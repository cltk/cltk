Malayalam
********

Malayalam is a language spoken in India, predominantly in the state of Kerala. Malayalam originated from Middle Tamil (Sen-Tamil) in the 7th century. An alternative theory proposes a split in even more ancient times.[12] Malayalam incorporated many elements from Sanskrit through the ages. Many medieval liturgical texts were written in an admixture of Sanskrit and early Malayalam, called Manipravalam.[17] The oldest literary work in Malayalam, distinct from the Tamil tradition, is dated from between the 9th and 11th centuries.
