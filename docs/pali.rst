Pali
****

Pali is a Prakrit language native to the Indian subcontinent which flourished between 5th and 1st century BC, now only used as a liturgical language. It is widely studied because it is the language of much of the earliest extant literature of Buddhism as collected in the Pāli Canon or Tipiṭaka and is the sacred language of Theravāda Buddhism.
