Old English
***********

Old English is the earliest historical form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages. It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid 5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century.

Stopword Filtering
==================

To use the CLTK's built-in stopwords list, We use an example from Beowulf:

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: from nltk.tokenize.punkt import PunktLanguageVars

   In [2]: from cltk.stop.old_english.stops import STOPS_LIST

   In [3]: sentence = 'þe hie ær drugon aldorlease lange hwile.'

   In [4]: p = PunktLanguageVars()

   In [5]: tokens = p.word_tokenize(sentence.lower())

   In [6]: [w for w in tokens if not w in STOPS_LIST]
   Out[6]:
   ['hie',
    'drugon',
    'aldorlease',
    'catilina',
    'lange',
    'hwile',
    '.']
