Old Norse
*********

Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during about the 9th to 13th centuries. The Proto-Norse language developed into Old Norse by the 8th century, and Old Norse began to develop into the modern North Germanic languages in the mid- to late 14th century, ending the language phase known as Old Norse. These dates, however, are not absolute, since written Old Norse is found well into the 15th century. (Source: `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse>`_)

Corpora
=======

Use ``CorpusImporter()`` or browse the `CLTK GitHub organization <https://github.com/cltk>`_ (anything beginning with ``old_norse_``) to discover available Old_norse corpora.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: from cltk.corpus.utils.importer import CorpusImporter

   In [2]: corpus_importer = CorpusImporter("old_norse")

   In [3]: corpus_importer.list_corpora
   Out[3]: ['old_norse_text_perseus']


Stopword Filtering
==================

To use the CLTK's built-in stopwords list, We use an example from `Eiríks saga rauða
<http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/Eir%C3%ADks_saga_rau%C3%B0a>`_:
.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: from nltk.tokenize.punkt import PunktLanguageVars

   In [2]: from cltk.stop.old_norse.stops import STOPS_LIST

   In [3]: sentence = 'Þat var einn morgin, er þeir Karlsefni sá fyrir ofan rjóðrit flekk nökkurn, sem glitraði við þeim'

   In [4]: p = PunktLanguageVars()

   In [5]: tokens = p.word_tokenize(sentence.lower())

   In [6]: [w for w in tokens if not w in STOPS_LIST]
   Out[6]:   ['var', 'einn', 'morgin', ',', 'karlsefni', 'rjóðrit', 'flekk', 'nökkurn', ',', 'glitraði']


POS tagging
===========

Thanks to TnT implemented in NLTK, you can get the POS tags of Old Norse texts. The model, first import the ``old_norse_models_cltk`` corpus.
Taggers are trained from an annotated corpus. You can find it at ` <http://www.linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Download>` and it is Icelandic Parsed Historical Corpus (IcePaHC) version 0.9.

.. code-block:: python

   In [1]: tagger.tag_tnt('Hlióðs bið ek allar.')
   Out[1]:
   [('Hlióðs', 'Unk'),
   ('bið', 'VBPI'),
   ('ek', 'PRO-N'),
   ('allar', 'Q-A'),
   ('.', '.')]
