   This is an alpha-stage project. Everything should work, but expect breaking changes.

The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) offers natural language processing support for Classical languages. In some areas, it extends the NLTK. The goals of the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) are to:

* Compile analysis-friendly corpora in a variety of Classical languages (Greek and Latin are in progress, with more in the pipeline)
* Gather, improve, and generate linguistic data required for NLP
* Develop a free and open platform for generating reproducible, scholarly research
