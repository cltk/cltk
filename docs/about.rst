The Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) offers natural language processing support for Classical languages. \
In some areas, it extends the NLTK. The goals of the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) are to:

* compile analysis-friendly corpora in a variety of Classical languages (currently available for Chinese, Coptic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Pali, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Telugu, and Tibetan);

* gather, improve, and generate linguistic data required for NLP (Greek and Latin are in progress, with `more in the pipeline <https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/List-of-Classical-languages>`_);

* develop a free and open platform for generating reproducible, scientific research that advances the study of the languages and literatures of the ancient world.

The project's source is hosted `on GitHub <https://github.com/cltk/cltk>`_ and the homepage is `http://cltk.org <http://cltk.org>`_.
