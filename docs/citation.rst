********

Each major release of the CLTK is given a `DOI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier>`_, a type of unique identity for digital documents. This DOI ought to be included in your citation, as it will allow your readers to reproduce your scholarship should the CLTK's API or codebase change. To find the CLTK's current DOI, observe the blue ``DOI`` button in the repository's home (`README.md <https://github.com/kylepjohnson/cltk>`_). To the end of your bibliographic entry, append `DOI ` plus the current identifier.

Therefore, please cite the CLTK similar to:
