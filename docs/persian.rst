Alphabet
=========

The Persian digits and alphabet are placed in `cltk/corpus/persian/alphabet.py <https://github.com/cltk/cltk/blob/master/cltk/corpus/persian/alphabet.py>`_.

The digits are placed in a list ``DIGITS`` with the digit the same as the list index (0-9). For example, the persian digit for 5 can be accessed in this manner:

.. code-block:: python
	In [1]: from cltk.corpus.persian.alphabet import DIGITS
	In [2]: DIGITS[5]
	Out[2]: '۵'

Persian has three ``SHORT_VOWELS`` that are essentially diacritics used in the script. It also has three ``LONG_VOWELS`` that are actually part of the alphabet. The corresponding lists can be imported:

.. code-block:: python
	In [1]: from cltk.corpus.persian.alphabet import SHORT_VOWELS
	In [2]: SHORT_VOWELS
	Out[2]: ['َ', 'ِ', 'ُ']

	In [3]: from cltk.corpus.persian.alphabet import LONG_VOWELS
	In [4]: LONG_VOWELS
	Out[4]: ['ا', 'و', 'ی']

The rest of the alphabet are ``CONSONANTS`` that can be accessed in a similar way.

There are three ``SPECIAL`` characters that are ligatures or different orthographical shapes of the alphabet.

.. code-block:: python
	In [1]: from cltk.corpus.persian.alphabet import SPECIAL
	In [2]: SPECIAL
	Out[2]: ['ﺁ', 'ۀ', 'ﻻ']
