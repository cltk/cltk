The CLTK relies heavily upon several free open source projects.

- Glottolog (<https://glottolog.org/>): Language metadata and classification references.
- Stanza (<https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/>): Neural pipeline components used by many CLTK backends.
- Universal Dependencies (<https://universaldependencies.org/>): Global language definitions for morphosyntax and syntactic parsing.
