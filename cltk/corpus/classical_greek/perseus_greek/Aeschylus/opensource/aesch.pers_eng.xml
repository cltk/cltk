<stage>Enter a band of Elders, guardians of the Persian Empire</stage>
<sp n="Chorus">
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line"/>Here we are, the faithful Council of the Persians, who have gone to the land of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, we who serve as warders of the royal abode, rich in bountiful store of gold,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>we whom Xerxes, our King, Darius' royal son, himself selected, by virtue of our rank and years, to be the guardians of his realm.</p>
<p>Yet as regards the return of our King and of his host, so richly decked out in gold,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>the soul within my breast is distressed and presages disaster.  For the whole populace of the Asian nation has come and murmurs against its youthful King, nor does any courier or horseman<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>arrive at the city of the Persians, who left behind them the walled defence of <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002115">Agbatana</placeName> and Cissa's ancient ramparts, and went forth, some on horseback, some in galleys, others on foot<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>presenting a dense array of war.</p>
<p>Such are Amistres and Artaphrenes and Megabates  and Astaspes, marshals of the Persians; kings themselves, yet vassals of the Great King,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>they press on, commanders of an enormous host, skilled in archery and horsemanship, formidable to look upon and fearful in battle through the valiant resolve of their souls.  Artembares, too, who fights from his chariot,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>and Masistres, and noble Imaeus, skilled with the bow, and Pharandaces, and Sosthanes, who urges on his steeds.  Others in addition the mighty, fecund <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> sent forth &mdash; Susiscanes,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>Pegastagon of Egyptian lineage, mighty Arsames, lord of sacred <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName>, Ariomardus, governor of ancient <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and the marsh-dwelling oarsmen,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>well-skilled and countless in number.<milestone ed="p" n="41" unit="card"/></p>
<p>Behind them follows a throng of luxurious Lydians and those<note anchored="yes" n="42" resp="Smyth">A covert reference to the Ionians, kinsmen of the Athenians, who served under compulsion in the expedition against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</note>who hold in subjection all the people of the mainland, whom Metrogathes and brave Arcteus, their regal commanders,<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>and <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> rich in gold sent forth, riding in many a chariot, in ranks with three and four steeds abreast, a spectacle terrible to behold.  They too who live by sacred Tmolus pledge themselves<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>to cast the yoke of slavery upon Hellas&mdash;Mardon, Tharybis, anvils of the lance, and the Mysians, hurlers of the javelin. <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, also, teeming with gold, sends a mixed host arrayed in a long line, both mariners borne in galleys<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>and those who rely on their skill in archery.  The nation too which wears the sabre follows from every part of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> in the fearful procession of the King.</p>
<p>Such are the warriors, the flower of the Persian land,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>who have departed, and in fierce longing for them the whole land of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, their foster-nurse, laments, while parents and wives, as they count the days, shudder at the lengthening delay.

<div1 type="episode">
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>For this very reason I have left the gold-decorated palace<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>and the chamber which belongs to Darius and myself, and have come here.  My heart, too, is racked with anxiety, and to you, my friends, will I make a disclosure. For I am by no means free from apprehension that wealth, grown great, will, raising a cloud of dust upon the ground, trip up the prosperity which Darius raised not without the favor of some god.<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>It is for this reason that there is a double concern in my mind: neither to hold in honor vast wealth without men, and that the light of success does not shine, in proportion to their strength, on men without riches.  Our wealth, at all events, is ample, but my anxiety is for the light, the salvation of the house, which I regard to be the presence of its lord.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>Therefore, since things stand as they do, lend me your counsel in this concern, Persians, my aged trusty servants.  For all my hopes of good counsel depend on you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Be assured, our country's Queen, that you need not twice mention either word or deed regarding that in which it is possible for us to direct you.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>For we whom you summon as counsellors in these matters are well disposed towards you and your interests.<milestone ed="p" n="176" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp n="Atossa">
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>I have been haunted by a multitude of dreams at night since the time when my son, having despatched his army, departed with intent to lay waste the land of the Ionians.  But never yet have I beheld so distinct a vision<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>as that of the last night.  This I will describe to you.</p>
<p>I dreamed that two women in beautiful clothes, one in Persian garb, the other in Dorian attire, appeared before my eyes; both far more striking in stature than are the women of our time,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>flawless in beauty, sisters of the same family. As for the lands in which they dwelt, to one had been assigned by lot the land of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, to the other that of the barbarians.  The two, as I imagined it, seemed to provoke each other to a mutual feud, and my son,  when he had become aware of this,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>attempted to restrain and placate them. He yoked them both to his car and placed the collar-straps upon their necks.  The one bore herself proudly in these trappings and kept her mouth obedient to the rein.  The other struggled and with her hands<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>tore apart the harness of the car; then, free of the curb,  she dragged it violently along with her and snapped the yoke in two.  My son was hurled to the ground and his father Darius stood by his side filled with pity.  But Xerxes, when he caught sight of him, tore the garments covering his body.<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="card"/></p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>Such was the vision I beheld in the night. But when I had risen and dipped my hands in the clear-flowing water of a spring, I drew near to an altar with incense in my hand, intending to make an offering of sacrificial cake to the divinities that avert evil, those to whom these rites are due.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>But I saw an eagle fleeing for safety to the altar of Phoebus&mdash;and out of terror, my friends, I stood speechless. Thereupon I caught sight of a falcon rushing at full speed with outstretched wings and with his talons plucking at the head of the eagle, which did nothing but cower and<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>yielded its body to his foe.</p>
<p>These are the terrors I beheld, terrors too for you to hear. Be assured that if my son should suceeed, he would prove to be remarkable indeed, but if he fails, he does not have to answer to the state; if he returns safely, he will hold sway in this land as he did before.
</p></sp>
<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="card"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>Mother, we would neither alarm you unduly by our words nor raise your hopes too high.  If, however, it is something inauspicious that you have seen, visit the gods with supplication and entreat them to avert the evil and to bring to pass what will be beneficial to you, your children, the kingdom, and all else that you hold dear.  Next, it is appropriate that you should<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>offer libations to Earth and the dead; and use auspicious words to address your husband Darius, whom you say you have seen in the night, and ask him to send into the light of day from beneath the earth blessings for you and your son; ask too that the reverse of this may be held in bondage beneath the earth and fade away in gloom.  Such is the advice I, relying on my instincts, offer you with kind intent.<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>According to our interpretation of these portents, the issue will in all respects prove prosperous to you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>You, its first interpreter, have indeed read the meaning of my dream with goodwill, at least, toward my son and house.  May the outcome then prove beneficial! When I return to the palace, I will perform for the gods and my dear ones beneath the earth all those rites which you recommend. Meanwhile, my friends, I would like to learn<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>where <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> is located.<milestone ed="p" n="232" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Far from here, to the west where the last rays of our Lord the Sun set.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>Can it then really be that my son had the keen desire to make this city his prey?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Yes, for then all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> would be subject to the King.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>Does their army have such a multitude of men?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Yes, it is an army of such magnitude that it has caused great disaster for the Medes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>And what else have they besides?  Do they have sufficient wealth in their homes?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Of silver they possess a veritable fountain, a treasure chest in their soil.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>Is the bow-stretching arrow particularly suited to their hands?<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Far from it; they have lances for close fight and shields that serve them for armor.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>And who is set over them as shepherd and is master of their host?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Of no man are they called the slaves or vassals.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>How then can they withstand the attack of an invading foe?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>So well as to have destroyed Darius' great and courageous host.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>In truth, your words have given the fathers and mothers of those who are now on their way there dire food for thought.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>No, rather I think that you will soon learn the truth of the matter.  For here comes one who is beyond a doubt a Persian courier.  He bears clear tidings of some issue, be it good or bad.<milestone ed="p" n="249" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<p>If numbers had been the only factor, be assured that the barbarians would have gained the victory with their fleet.  For the whole number of the ships of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> amounted to ten times thirty,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>and, in addition to these, there was a chosen squadron of ten.  But Xerxes, this I know, had under his command a thousand, while those excelling in speed were twice a hundred, and seven more.  This is the total of their respective numbers.  Do you think that we were simply outnumbered in this contest?<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>No, it was some divine power that tipped the scale of fortune with unequal weight and thus destroyed our host.

<sp n="Messenger">
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My Queen, some destructive power or evil spirit, appearing from somewhere or other, caused the beginning of our utter rout.<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>A Hellene, from the Athenian host, came to your son Xerxes and told this tale: that, when the gloom of black night should set in, the Hellenes would not remain in place, but, springing upon the rowing benches of their ships, would seek, some here, some there,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>to preserve their lives by stealthy flight.  But Xerxes, when he heard this, comprehending neither the cleverness of the Greek nor that the gods grudged him success, straightway gave all his captains orders to this effect&mdash;that, when the sun had ceased to illumine the earth with his beams,<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>and darkness had covered the region of the sky, they should bring up in a tight group the main body of the fleet, disposed in triple line, to bar the exits and the sounding straits, and station other ships in a circle around the island of Ajax. He gave them a warning too that, should the Hellenes escape an evil doom,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>finding by stealth some means of flight for their fleet, it had been decreed that every captain should lose his head.  These commands he made with complete confidence of heart, since he knew not the issue intended by the gods.  Our crews then, with no lack of order but with an obedient spirit,<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>prepared their evening meal, while each sailor looped his oar about its thole-pin so that it fitted well.  But when the light of the sun had faded and night drew on, each master of an oar and each man versed in arms went on board.<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>The long galleys cheered each other, line by line; and they held their course as each captain had been ordered, and all through the night the commanders of the fleet kept their whole force cruising to and fro across the strait.  Night began to wane,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>yet the fleet of the Hellenes in no way attempted to put forth by stealth.  When, however, radiant Day with her white horses shone over all the land, a loud cheer like a song of triumph first rang out from the Hellenes, and, at the same instant,<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>clear from the island crags, an echo returned an answering cry.  Terror fell on all the barbarians, balked of their purpose; for then the Hellenes chanted their solemn paean, not as in flight, but as men rushing to the onset with the courage of gallant hearts.<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="card"/></p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>The trumpet with its blast set all their side afire, and instantly, at the word of command, with the even stroke of foaming oars they struck the briny deep.  Swiftly they all came clear into view.  Their right wing, well marshalled,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>led on in orderly advance, next their whole army pressed on against us, and at the same time a loud shout met our ears: &ldquo;On, you men of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>!  Free your native land. Free your children, your wives, the temples of your fathers' gods,<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>and the tombs of your ancestors.  Now you are fighting for all you have.&rdquo;  Then from our side arose in response the mingled clamor of Persian speech, and straightaway the ships dashed together their bronze prows.  It was a ship of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName><milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>that began the charge and chopped off in its entirety the curved stern of a Phoenician boat. Each captain drove his ship straight against some other ship.  At first the stream of the Persian army held its own. When, however, the mass of our ships had been crowded in the narrows, and none could render another aid,<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>and each crashed its bronze prow against each of its own line, they splintered their whole bank of oars. Then the Hellenic galleys, not heedless of their chance, hemmed them in and battered them on every side.  The hulls of our vessels rolled over, and the sea was hidden from our sight,<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>strewn as it was with wrecks and slaughtered men.  The shores and reefs were crowded with our dead, and every ship that formed a part of the barbarian fleet plied its oars in disorderly flight.  But, as if our men were tuna or some haul of fish,<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>the foe kept striking and hacking them with broken oars and fragments of wrecked ships. Groans and shrieks together filled the open sea until the face of black night hid the scene.  But as for the the full extent of our disasters, this, even if I had ten days in succession to do so, I could not describe to you.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>However,  you can be sure that so great a multitude of men never perished in a single day.

For when some god<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>had given the glory to the Hellenes in the battle on the sea, on that same day, fencing their bodies in armor of bronze, they leapt from their ships and encircled the whole island, so that our men were at a loss which way to turn.  Often they were struck by stones slung from their hands,<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>and arrows sped from the bow-string kept falling upon them and doing them harm.

As for the survivors of the army, they perished in Boeotian territory, some, faint from thirst, beside a refreshing spring, while some of us, exhausted and panting,<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>made our way to the land of the Phocians, to Doris and the Melian gulf, where the Spercheus waters the plain with kindly stream.  Coming from there, badly in need of food, we received welcome in the Achaean land and<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>the cities of the Thessalians.  There it was that many perished of thirst and hunger, for we were oppressed by both.  And we came to the Magnesian land and to the country of the Macedonians, to the ford of the <placeName key="tgn,7015932">Axius</placeName> and Bolbe's reedy marsh, and to Mount Pangaeus,<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>in the Edonian land.

<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>Neither; but near <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> our whole host has been brought to ruin.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>Tell me, what son of mine led our army there?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>Impetuous Xerxes,  depopulating the whole surface of the continent.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>Was it by land or sea that he made this mad expedition, the reckless man?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/>By both.  There was a twofold front of double armies.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>But how was it that so vast a land force won a passage to the farther shore?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>By a clever device he yoked the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> so as to gain a passage.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>What!  Did he succeed in closing the mighty <placeName key="tgn,1115068">Bosporus</placeName>?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>Yes indeed.   One of the divine powers must have assisted him in his purpose.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="725" unit="line"/>Alas! Some mighty power came upon him so that he was not able to think clearly.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>Yes, since we can see the outcome, what ruin he wrought.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>And how then did they fare that you now lament them?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>Disaster to the naval force brought ruin to the force on land.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>And did the whole army utterly perish by the spear?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="730" unit="line"/>Yes, and it is for this reason that the whole city of <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName> groans at its desolation.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>Alas for the loss of our warriors' valiant force and defence!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>And the host of the Bactrians is lost, wholly destroyed: not even an old man is left.</p></sp>

<p>Yes, a proven report establishes this. Doubt there is none.<milestone ed="p" n="739" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>Alas! The fulfilment of the oracles has indeed come swiftly, and it is my son upon whom<milestone ed="p" n="740" unit="line"/>Zeus has caused their issue to descend.  Yet I was confident that, only after long lapse of time, the gods would in some way bring them to accomplishment; nevertheless, when man hastens to his own undoing, the god too participates with him. A fountain of misfortune has now, I think, been discovered for all I love.  A son of mine it was who, in his ignorance, brought these things to pass through youthful recklessness;<milestone ed="p" n="745" unit="line"/>for he conceived the hope that he could by shackles, as if it were a slave, restrain the current of the sacred <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, the <placeName key="tgn,1115068">Bosporus</placeName>, a stream divine; he set himself to fashion a roadway of a new type, and, by casting upon it hammer-wrought fetters, made a spacious causeway for his mighty host.  Mortal though he was, he thought in his folly that he would gain the mastery of all the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line"/>yes, even over Poseidon.  Must this not have been a disease of the soul that possessed my son?  I fear that the plenteous treasure amassed by my toil may become the prey of the spoiler.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Atossa</speaker>
<p>This lesson impetuous Xerxes learned through conversation with evil men.  For they kept telling him that, whereas you<milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line"/>won plentiful treasure for your children by your spear, he, on his part, through lack of manly spirit, played the warrior at home and did not increase his father's wealth. Hearing such taunts many a time from evil counsellors, he planned this expedition and army against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="759" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Darius</speaker>
<p>Therefore a calamity<milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/>dreadful and unforgettable has been caused by him, a desolating calamity such as never before befell this city of <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName> since our Lord Zeus first ordained that one ruler should bear sway over all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> with its flocks and wield the sceptre of its government.<milestone ed="p" n="765" unit="line"/>For Medus was first to be the leader of its host; and another, his son, completed his work since wisdom ruled his spirit.  Third, after him, Cyrus, blessed in good fortune, came to the throne and established peace for all his people.<milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line"/>The Lydians and Phrygians he won to his rule, and the whole of <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> he subdued by force; for he won the favor of the gods through his right-mindedness.  Fourth in succession, the son of Cyrus ruled the host.  Fifth in the list, Mardus came to power, a disgrace to his native land<milestone ed="p" n="775" unit="line"/>and to the ancient throne; but he was slain in his palace by the guile of noble Artaphrenes, with the help of friends whose duty this was.  &lsqb;Sixth came Maraphis, and seventh Artaphrenes.<note anchored="yes" n="778" resp="Smyth">This interpolated or corrupt verse possibly comes from a variant list of the conspirators against the Smerdis (in l. 774 called Mardus), whom the Magian rebels planned to put in the place of the real prince of that name, who was slain by his brother Cambyses.  The name Maraphis does not occur elsewhere in connection with this event, and neither he nor Artaphrenes was ever king.  Herodotus names Intaphernes as the chief conspirator against the false Smerdis.</note>&rsqb; And I in turn attained the lot I desired,<milestone ed="p" n="780" unit="line"/>and many a campaign I made with a valiant force; but disaster so dire as this I brought not upon the state.  Yet Xerxes my son, youth that he is, has the mind of youth and does not remember my injunctions.

<p><milestone ed="p" n="800" unit="line"/>Few indeed out of many, if it is right to put any faith in the oracles of Heaven, with regard to what has just been brought to pass; for they are fulfilled, not just some, while others fail.

Here they will meet their crowning disaster in requital for their presumptuous pride and impious thoughts.  For, on reaching the land of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="810" unit="line"/>restrained by no religious awe, they ravaged the images of the gods and set fire to their temples.  Altars have been destroyed, statues of the gods have been thrown from their bases in utter ruin and confusion. Therefore, since they wrought such evil, evil they suffer in no less measure; and other evils are still in store:<milestone ed="p" n="815" unit="line"/>the spring of their woes is not yet quenched, but it still wells forth.  For so great will be the mass of clotted gore spilled by the Dorian lance upon Plataean soil that heaps of dead will reveal, even to the third generation, a voiceless record for the eyes of men<milestone ed="p" n="820" unit="line"/>that mortal man should not vaunt himself excessively.  For presumptuous pride, when it has matured, bears as its fruit a crop of calamity, from which it reaps an abundant harvest of tears.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that such are the penalties for deeds like these, and hold <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> in your memory.  Let no one of you,<milestone ed="p" n="825" unit="line"/>through disdain of present fortune and lust for more, squander his abundant wealth.

For<milestone ed="p" n="835" unit="line"/>through grief at his misfortunes, the embroidered apparel which he was wearing has been torn into tattered shreds. Soothe him with words of kindness; for it is to your voice alone, I know, that he will listen.
