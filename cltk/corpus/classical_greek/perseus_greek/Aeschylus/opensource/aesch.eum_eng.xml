<sp n="Priestess of Pythian Apollo">
<speaker>The Priestess of Pythian Apollo</speaker>
    <p>First, in this prayer of mine, I give the place of highest honor among the gods to the first prophet, Earth; and after her to Themis, for she was the second to take this oracular seat of her mother, as legend tells. And in the third allotment, with Themis' consent and not by force,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>another Titan, child of Earth, Phoebe, took her seat here. She gave it as a birthday gift to Phoebus, who has his name from Phoebe. Leaving the lake<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="Smyth">A circular lake in the island of Apollo's birth.</note>and ridge of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, he landed on Pallas' ship-frequented shores,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>and came to this region and the dwelling places on <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>. The children of Hephaistos,<note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="Smyth">The Athenians, because Erichthonius, who was identified with Erechtheus, was the son of Hephaestus, who first fashioned axes.</note>road-builders taming the wildness of the untamed land, escorted him with mighty reverence. And at his arrival, the people<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>and Delphus, helmsman and lord of this land, made a great celebration for him. Zeus inspired his heart with prophetic skill and established him as the fourth prophet on this throne; but Loxias is the spokesman of Zeus, his father.</p>
    <p>These are the gods I place in the beginning of my prayer.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>And Pallas who stands before the temple<note anchored="yes" n="21" resp="Smyth">The shrine of Pallas &ldquo;before the temple,&rdquo; close to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> on the main road leading to the sanctuary of Apollo.</note> is honored in my words; and I worship the Nymphs where the Corycian<note anchored="yes" n="22" resp="Smyth">The Corycian cave, sacred to the Nymphs and Pan, has been identified with a grotto on the great plateau above <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</note>rock is hollow, the delight of birds and haunt of gods. Bromius has held the region &mdash;I do not forget him&mdash; ever since he, as a god, led the Bacchantes in war,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>and contrived for Pentheus death as of a hunted hare. I call on the streams of Pleistus and the strength of Poseidon, and highest Zeus, the Fulfiller; and then I take my seat as prophetess upon my throne. And may they allow me now to have the best fortune, far better than on my previous entrances.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>And if there are any from among the Hellenes here, let them enter, in turn, by lot, as is the custom. For I prophesy as the god leads.<stage>She enters the temple and after a brief interval returns terror-stricken</stage><milestone ed="p" n="34" unit="card"/></p>
<p>Horrors to tell, horrors for my eyes to see, have sent me back from the house of Loxias,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>so that I have no strength and I cannot walk upright. I am running on hands and knees, with no quickness in my limbs; for an old woman, overcome with fright, is nothing, or rather she is like a child.</p>
    <p>I was on my way to the inner shrine, decked with wreaths; I saw on the center-stone<note anchored="yes" n="40" resp="Smyth"> <foreign lang="greek">o)mfalo/s</foreign>&ldquo;navel&rdquo; was the name given by the Delphians to a white stone &lpar;in Aeschylus' time placed in the inmost sanctuary of Apollo&rpar;, which they regarded as marking the exact center of the earth. Near the great altar of Apollo the French excavators of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> discovered a navel-stone. <foreign lang="greek">o)mfalo/s</foreign>is sometimes used of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> itself.</note>a man defiled in the eyes of the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>occupying the seat of suppliants. His hands were dripping blood; he held a sword just drawn and an olive-branch, from the top of the tree, decorously crowned with a large tuft of wool, a shining fleece; for as to this I can speak clearly.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/></p>
<p>Before this man an extraordinary band of women slept, seated on thrones. No! Not women, but rather Gorgons I call them; and yet I cannot compare them to forms of Gorgons either. Once before I saw some creatures in a painting,<note anchored="yes" n="50" resp="Smyth">The Harpies.</note><milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>carrying off the feast of Phineus; but these are wingless in appearance, black, altogether disgusting; they snore with repulsive breaths, they drip from their eyes hateful drops; their attire is not fit to bring either before the statues of the gods or into the homes of men.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>I have never seen the tribe that produced this company, nor the land that boasts of rearing this brood with impunity and does not grieve for its labor afterwards.</p>
<p>Let what is to come now be the concern of the master of this house,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>powerful Loxias himself. He is a prophet of healing, a reader of portents, and for others a purifier of homes.<stage>Exit</stage>
</p></sp>
<milestone ed="p" n="64" unit="card"/>
<stage>The interior of the temple is disclosed. Enter, from the inner sanctuary, Apollo, who takes his stand beside Orestes at the center-stone. Near the suppliant are the Furies asleep. Hermes in the background.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>No! I will not abandon you. Your guardian to the end, close by your side or far removed,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>I will not be gentle to your enemies. So now you see these mad women overcome; these loathsome maidens have fallen asleep, old women, ancient children, with whom no god or man or beast ever mingles.<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>They were even born for evil, since they live in evil gloom and in Tartarus under the earth, creatures hateful to men and to the Olympian gods. Nevertheless, escape and do not be cowardly.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>For as you go always over the earth that wanderers tread, they will drive you on, even across the wide mainland, beyond the sea and the island cities. Do not grow weary too soon, brooding on this labor, but when you have come to Pallas' city, sit down and hold in your arms her ancient image.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>And there, with judges of your case and speeches of persuasive charm, we shall find means to release you completely from your labors. For I persuaded you to take your mother's life.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Lord Apollo, you know how to do no wrong;<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>and, since you know this, learn not to be neglectful also. For your power to do good is assured.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Remember, do not let fear overpower your heart. You, Hermes, my blood brother, born of the same father, watch over him; true to your name,<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>be his guide,<note anchored="yes" n="91" resp="Smyth">Hermes is the guide of the living on their journeys; as he is also the conductor of the souls of the dead to the nether world.</note>shepherding this suppliant of mine&mdash;truly Zeus respects this right of outlaws&mdash;as he is sped on towards mortals with the fortune of a good escort.<stage>Exit. Orestes departs escorted by Hermes. The Ghost of Clytaemestra appears.</stage><milestone ed="p" n="94" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ghost of Clytaemestra</speaker>
<p>Sleep on! Aha! Yet what need is there of sleepers? It is due to you that I am thus dishonored among the other dead;<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>because of those I killed the dead never cease to reproach me, and I wander in disgrace. I tell you that I am most greatly accused by them. And yet, although I have suffered cruelly in this way from my nearest kin,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>no divine power is angry on my behalf, slaughtered as I have been by the hands of a matricide. See these gashes in my heart, and from where they came! For the sleeping mind has clear vision, but in the daytime the fate of mortals is unforeseeable.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/></p>
<p>Truly, you have lapped up many of my offerings&mdash;wineless libations, a sober appeasement; and I have sacrificed banquets in the solemn night upon a hearth of fire at an hour unshared by any god. I see all this trampled under foot.<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>But he has escaped and is gone, like a fawn; lightly indeed, from the middle of snares, he has rushed away mocking at you. Hear me, since I plead for my life, awake to consciousness, goddesses of the underworld!<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>For in a dream I, Clytaemestra, now invoke you.</p></sp>

<p>In a dream you are hunting your prey, and are barking like a dog that never leaves off its keenness for the work. What are you doing? Get up; do not let fatigue overpower you, and do not ignore my misery because you have been softened by sleep.

<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>What do you want to say to this, stranger, in turn? After you name your country and family and fortunes, then defend yourself against this charge; if indeed, relying on the justice of your case, you sit clinging to my image near my hearth,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>as a sacred suppliant, like Ixion.<note anchored="yes" n="441" resp="Smyth">Ixion, king of the Lapiths, murdered the father of his bride, and was given purification by Zeus after having been denied by the other gods. Cp. 718.</note> To all this give me a plain answer.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Lady Athena, first of all I will take away a great anxiety from your last words. I am not a suppliant in need of purification, nor did I sit at your image with pollution on my hands.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>I will give you strong proof of this. It is the law for one who is defiled by shedding blood to be barred from speech until he is sprinkled with the blood of a new-born victim by a man who can purify from murder.<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>Long before at other houses I have been thus purified both by victims and by flowing streams.</p>
    <p>And so I declare that this concern is out of the way. As to my family, you will soon learn. I am an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>; my father&mdash;you rightly inquire about him<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>&mdash;was Agamemnon, the commander of the naval forces; along with him, you made <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, the city of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>, to be no city. He did not die nobly, after he came home; but my black-hearted mother killed him after she covered him in a crafty snare that still remains to witness his murder in the bath.<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>And when I came back home, having been an exile in the time before, I killed the woman who gave birth to me, I will not deny it, as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearly-loved father. Together with me Loxias is responsible for this deed,<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>because he threatened me with pains, a goad for my heart, if I should fail to do this deed to those who were responsible. You judge whether I acted justly or not; whatever happens to me at your hands, I will be content.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>The matter is too great, if any mortal thinks to pass judgment on it;<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>no, it is not lawful even for me to decide on cases of murder that is followed by the quick anger of the Furies, especially since you, by rites fully performed, have come a pure and harmless suppliant to my house; and so I respect you, since you do not bring harm to my city.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>Yet these women have an office that does not permit them to be dismissed lightly; and if they fail to win their cause, the venom from their resentment will fall upon the ground, an intolerable, perpetual plague afterwards in the land.</p>
<p>So stands the case:<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>either course&mdash;to let them stay, to drive them out&mdash;brings disaster and perplexity to me. But since this matter has fallen here, I will select judges of homicide bound by oath, and I will establish this tribunal for all time. Summon your witnesses and proofs, <milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>sworn evidence to support your case; and I will return when I have chosen the best of my citizens, for them to decide this matter truly, after they take an oath that they will pronounce no judgment contrary to justice. <stage>Exit</stage><milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Zeus, as you say, gave you this oracular command, to tell Orestes here to avenge his father's murder but to take no account at all of the honor due his mother?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Yes, for it is not the same thing&mdash;the murder of a noble man,<milestone ed="p" n="625" unit="line"/>honored by a god-given scepter, and his murder indeed by a woman, not by rushing arrows sped from afar, as if by an Amazon, but as you will hear, Pallas, and those who are sitting to decide by vote in this matter.<milestone ed="p" n="630" unit="line"/></p>
<p>She received him from the expedition, where he had for the most part won success beyond expectation,<note anchored="yes" n="631" resp="Smyth">Literally &ldquo;trafficked better&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;better&rdquo; either &ldquo;than his foes, the Trojans&rdquo;; or &ldquo;beyond expectation&rdquo; &lpar;since he was guilty of the death of his daughter&rpar;; or possibly, without any implicit comparative force, simply &ldquo;well.&rdquo;</note> in the judgment of those favorable to him; then, as he was stepping from the bath, on its very edge, she threw a cloak like a tent over it, fettered her husband in an embroidered robe, and cut him down.<milestone ed="p" n="635" unit="line"/></p>
<p>This was his death, as I have told it to you&mdash;the death of a man wholly majestic, commander of the fleet. As for that woman, I have described her in such a way as to whet the indignation of the people who have been appointed to decide this case.<milestone ed="p" n="640" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Zeus gives greater honor to a father's death, according to what you say;<milestone ed="p" n="640" unit="line"/>yet he himself bound his aged father, Cronus. How does this not contradict what you say? I call on you as witnesses<stage>turning to the judges</stage>to hear these things.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Oh, monsters utterly loathed and detested by the gods! Zeus could undo fetters, there is a remedy for that,<milestone ed="p" n="645" unit="line"/>and many means of release. But when the dust has drawn up the blood of a man, once he is dead, there is no return to life. For this, my father has made no magic spells, although he arranges all other things, turning them up and down;<milestone ed="p" n="650" unit="line"/>nor does his exercise of force cost him a breath.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
    <p>See how you advocate acquittal for this man! After he has poured out his mother's blood on the ground, shall he then live in his father's house in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>?

<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>I will explain this, too, and see how correctly I will speak. The mother of what is called her child is not the parent, but the nurse of the newly-sown embryo.<note anchored="yes" n="659" resp="Smyth">This notion appears in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> &lpar;Diodorus Siculus 1. 80, whose source was Hecataeus, an older contemporary of Aeschylus&rpar; and in various Greek authors later than Aeschylus, e.g. <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 552">Eur.
Or. 552</bibl>; Frag. 1064, the Pythagoreans cited by Stobaeus &lpar;Hense ii. 72&rpar;. The passage in the play has been invoked as evidence that the Athenians of the fifth century B.C. were upholding, some the ancient mode of tracing descent from the mother &lpar;the argument of the Erinyes&rpar;; others, the patrilinear theory advocated by Apollo.</note> The one who mounts is the parent, whereas she, as a stranger for a stranger,<milestone ed="p" n="660" unit="line"/>preserves the young plant, if the god does not harm it.  And I will show you proof of what I say: a father might exist without a mother. A witness is here at hand, the child of Olympian Zeus, who was not nursed in the darkness of a womb,<milestone ed="p" n="665" unit="line"/>and she is such a child as no goddess could give birth to.</p>
<p>For my part, Pallas, as in all other matters, as I know how, I will make your city and people great; and I have sent this man as a suppliant to your sanctuary so that he may be faithful for all time,<milestone ed="p" n="670" unit="line"/>and that you, goddess, might win him and those to come after him as a new ally and so that these pledges of faith might remain always, for the later generations of these people to cherish.<milestone ed="p" n="674" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>For our part, every bolt is already shot. But I am waiting to hear how the trial will be decided.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Why not? As for you,<stage>To Apollo and Orestes.</stage>how shall I arrange matters so that I will not be blamed by you?</p></sp>

<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Hear now my ordinance, people of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, as you judge the first trial for bloodshed. In the future, even as now, this court of judges will always exist for the people of Aegeus. And this Hill of Ares, the seat and camp of the Amazons,<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/>when they came with an army in resentment against Theseus, and in those days built up this new citadel with lofty towers to rival his, and sacrificed to Ares, from which this rock takes its name, the Hill of Ares:<note anchored="yes" n="690" resp="Smyth">The Amazons, as &ldquo;daughters of Ares,&rdquo; invaded <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> to take vengeance on Theseus either, as one story reports, because he had carried off Antiope, their queen; or because he did not enclose the hill within the confines of his newly-founded city, which included the Acropolis. Aeschylus apparently rejects the legend whereby the Hill of Ares had its name from the fact that Ares was here tried for the murder of Halirrothius, a son of Poseidon, and acquitted by a tie vote of the gods, his judges.</note><milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/>on this hill, the reverence of the citizens, and fear, its kinsman, will hold them back from doing wrong by day and night alike, so long as they themselves do not pollute the laws with evil streams; if you stain clear water with filth, you will never find a drink.<milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/></p>
<p>Neither anarchy nor tyranny&mdash;this I counsel my citizens to support and respect, and not to drive fear wholly out of the city. For who among mortals, if he fears nothing, is righteous? Stand in just awe of such majesty,<milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line"/>and you will have a defense for your land and salvation of your city, such as no man has, either among the Scythians or in Pelops' realm. I establish this tribunal, untouched by greed, worthy of reverence, quick to anger, awake on behalf of those who sleep, a guardian of the land.<milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line"/></p>
<p>I have prolonged this advice to my citizens for the future; but now you must rise and take a ballot, and decide the case under the sacred obligation of your oath. My word has been spoken.<milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line"/>
<stage>The judges rise from their seats and cast their ballots one by one during the following altercation.</stage><milestone ed="p" n="711" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>And I counsel you not to dishonor us in any way, since our company can be a burden to your land.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>And I, for my part, command you to stand in fear of the oracles, both mine and Zeus', and not cause them to be unfulfilled.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Although it is not your office, you have respect for deeds of bloodshed.<milestone ed="p" n="715" unit="line"/>You will prophesy, dispensing prophecies that are no longer pure.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>Then was my father mistaken in any way in his purposes when Ixion, who first shed blood, was a suppliant?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>You do argue! But if I fail to win the case, I will once more inflict my company on this land as a burden.<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>But you have no honor, among both the younger and the older gods. I will win.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>You did such things also in the house of Pheres, when you persuaded the Fates to make mortals free from death.<note anchored="yes" n="724" resp="Smyth">In atonement for having shed blood &lpar;according to one legend, that of the dragon at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, according to another, that of the Cyclopes&rpar;, Apollo was compelled by Zeus to serve as a thrall in the house of Admetus, son of Pheres. An ancient story, adopted by Aeschylus, reported that, when the time came for Admetus to die, Apollo, in gratitude for the kindness shown him by the prince, plied the Fates with wine &lpar;l. 728&rpar; and thus secured their consent that Admetus should be released from death on condition that some one should voluntarily choose to die in his stead. Euripides, in his <title>Alcestis</title>, tells how, when both the father and the mother of Admetus refused to give up to him the remnant of their days, his wife Alcestis died for him.</note></p></sp>

<p>It was you who destroyed the old dispensations when you beguiled the ancient goddesses with wine.</p></sp>

<p>Soon, when you have lost the case, you will spit out your venom&mdash;no great burden to your enemies.<milestone ed="p" n="730" unit="line"/>
<stage>The balloting is now ended.</stage></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Since you, a youth, would ride me down, an old woman, I am waiting to hear the verdict in the case, since I have not decided whether to be angry at the city.</p></sp>

<p>It is my duty to give the final judgment and I shall cast my vote for Orestes.<milestone ed="p" n="735" unit="line"/>For there was no mother who gave me birth; and in all things, except for marriage, whole-heartedly I am for the male and entirely on the father's side.
