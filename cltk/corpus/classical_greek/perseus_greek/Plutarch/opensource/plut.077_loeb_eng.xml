            <head>ADVICE ABOUT KEEPING WELL (DE TUENDA SANITATE PRAECEPTA) <lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>Plutarch had more than a casual interest in medicine, for, besides this essay
					on keeping well, his other works abound in references to the behaviour of
					the sick and their treatment, and the medical practices of his day. Long
					before the time of Plutarch the art of medicine, always empirical, had been
					put on a solid foundation, and the acute observations of Hippocrates and his
					school had been set down in writing ; and this body of Hippocratic medical
					writings, along with others, was in circulation, and had undoubtedly been
					read by Plutarch. </p>
            <p>That medicine has made very great advances since Plutarch's time is, of
					course, self-evident; <q direct="unspecified">aseptic,</q>
					          <q direct="unspecified">antiseptic,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">sterilize</q> are now household
					words, and the germ theory of disease has, in recent times, shed light on
					much which before was dark. But Plutarch is not dealing with the technical
					side of medicine ; he is only giving some common-sense advice on rational
					living, and much that he has to say in regard to rest, exercise, and diet is
					in accord with the best medical practice of the present day. In fact, it is
					doubtful if any physician would take exception to anything that Plutarch
					advises (his advice is meant for men whose work is done with their heads
					rather than their hands), and one might name men in public life to-day, well
					on in years, who have followed many of his suggestions, unwittingly, no
					doubt, but to their own advantage. </p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.215"/>
            <p>The essay seems, at the first glance, to be put in the form of a dialogue,
					but it is about as much of a dialogue as Quiller-Couch's Foe-Farrell. The
					dialogue form is merely a literary subterfuge to present an essay in a
					slightly more attractive form, and the third person of the dialogue, only
					occasionally recalled to the reader by the parsimonious interjection of
					<q direct="unspecified">he said,</q> may be presumed to be Plutarch, the author. The
					two speakers in the brief dialogue at the beginning of the essay are
					Moschion, a physician, whom Plutarch introduces also into the Symposiacs
					(Moralia, 658 a), and Zeuxippus, a friend of Plutarch's, who is introduced
					also as a speaking character in two other essays of Plutarch's (Moralia, 748
					e and 1086 c), besides being mentioned several times in other essays. </p>
            <p>That the essay was written some time after a.d. 81 is clear from the
					reference to the death of the Roman Emperor Titus (123 d). </p>
            <p>The title of the essay is included in Lamprias' list of Plutarch's works, and
					Stobaeus, in his Florilegium, has several quotations from it, sometimes with
					a slightly different reading, but none of these readings changes the meaning
					of the passage at all, and rarely is one to be preferred to the reading
					found in the mss. of Plutarch (see Vol. I. Introd. p. xxi). </p>
            <p>Indeed, the text of this essay has suffered more at the hands of modern
					editors than from the ancient copyists, for a glance at the foot-notes
					inBernardakis's edition will show that the gratuitous and unnecessary
					changes introduced into the text by modern editors outnumber their
					corrections of the minor errors in spelling, and the like, made by the
					ancient copyists. </p>
         </div1>
         <pb id="v.2.p.217"/>
         <div1 type="section" n="1">
            <p>Moschion. So, Zeuxippus, yesterday you drove away Glaucus, the physician,
					when he wished to join in your philosophical discussions. </p>
            <p>Zeuxippus. No, my dear Moschion, I did not drive him away, nor did he wish to
					join in philosophical discussion, but I avoided him and feared giving an
					opening to a man fond of contention. In medicine the man is, as Homer <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xi. 514.</note> puts
					it, Worth many others together, but he is not kindly disposed towards
					philosophy, and there is always a certain harshness and ill-nature inherent
					in his remarks. And just then he was coming at us full tilt, crying out,
					even before he came near us, that it was no small or suitable task,
					amounting in fact to a confusion of all bounds, which had been boldly
					assumed by us in discussing a healthful manner of living. For he asserted
					that the subjects of philosophy and medicine are as <q direct="unspecified">far
						remote</q> from each other as <q direct="unspecified">are the boundaries of</q>
					any <q direct="unspecified">Mysians and Phrygians</q> 
               <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Proverbial; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Graec. Frag.</hi>, Adespota, No. 560.</note> ; and thereupon, as he had at
					the tip of his tongue some statements of ours, which, though not very
					carefully formulated, are certainly not without utility, he proceeded to
					tear them to pieces. </p>
            <p>Moschion. Well, in this and in other matters, <pb id="v.2.p.219"/> Zeuxippus,
					I should be very glad to be your attentive listener. </p>
            <p>Zeuxippus. That is because you, Moschion, have a natural gift for philosophy,
					and you feel incensed at the philosopher who does not take an interest in
					medicine, and you are indignant that such a man should imagine it more
					becoming for him, in the eyes of mankind, to profess some knowledge of
					geometry, logical discussion, and music, than to desire to seek out and know
					<quote rend="blockquote">All that of evil and good may have chanced to betide in the dwelling <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> iv, 392.</note>
               </quote> which
					is his own body. And yet you will see a larger number of spectators in the
					theatres where money to pay for admission is distributed to those who gather
					together, as at Athens ; and of the liberal arts medicine is inferior to
					none in elegance, distinction, and the satisfaction which it yields, and it
					gives to its students admission to something of very great
					importance&mdash;the preservation of their life and health.
					Consequently, the charge of trespass ought not to lie against philosophers
					if they discuss matters of health, but rather should they be blamed if they
					do not consider it their duty to abolish all boundarylines altogether, and
					to make a single field, as it were, of all honourable studies, and therein
					to cultivate them in common, thus aiming in their discussion at both the
					pleasant and the essential. </p>
            <p>Moschion. Well, Zeuxippus, let us say no more about Glaucus, who is so
					self-important that he wants to be a law unto himself, needing no help from
					philosophy ; but do you tell us in detail the whole discussion ; or, if you
					prefer, just those statements <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, Od. iv. 392.</note>
					          <pb id="v.2.p.221"/> which you first referred to as not altogether carefully
					formulated, which you say Glaucus seized upon. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>Zeuxippus. Well, our companion <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plutarch himself presumably.</note> asserted that he had heard somebody say that
					keeping the hands always warm, and never allowing them to get cold, is in no
					small measure conducive to health, and, conversely, the chilling of the
					extremities, by concentrating the warmth in the interior of the body,
					creates, as it were, a habit or a predisposition towards feverishness ; and
					for a man to divert the substances in his body toward the surface, and to
					conduct and distribute them, along with the warmth, to all parts of his body
					, is healthful. <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 635 C.</note> If therefore we happen to be doing something with our hands
					and using them, the motion itself brings the warmth to these parts, and
					keeps it there ; but when not engaged in such activities we must by no means
					allow the cold to find lodgement in our extremities. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>This, then, was one of the things ridiculed. The second, I think, concerned
					the food which you people serve to the sick. For he urged that we should
					partake of it and taste it from time to time, and get ourselves used to it
					in time of health, and not abhor and detest such a regimen, like little
					children, but gradually make it familiar and congenial to our appetites, so
					that in sickness we may not be disaffected over our fare as if it were so
					much medicine, and may not show impatience at receiving something simple,
					unappetising, and savourless. <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 661 B.</note> For this reason, too, omitting the bath now
					and then before going to a meal is not a thing to be avoided, nor drinking
					only water when wine is at hand, nor drinking anything lukewarm in the
					summer-time when there is snow on the table ; and while dismissing <pb id="v.2.p.223"/> once for all time the ostentatious and studied
					abstinence from such things and the bragging over it, we should silently, by
					our own selves, habituate the appetite to be obedient to expediency with all
					serenity, and long beforehand we must rid our soul of its squeamishness in
					times of sickness about such trifles, and its lamentation thereat, as it
					deplores how it has been driven away from great and fond pleasures to an
					ignoble and humiliating way of living. </p>
            <p>Well has it been said, <q direct="unspecified">Choose the life that is best, and constant
					habit will make it pleasant,</q> 
               <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">A precept of Pythagoras according to Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 466 F, and other writers who quote it; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 602 B.</note> and, in particular, it is
					profitable for a man, experimenting with each several department of life and
					especially with those which have to do with the practices which affect the
					body, to inculcate a fixed habit during periods of soundest health, so thus
					to make these things agreeable, familiar, and congenial to his nature, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend="italics">Laws</hi>, p. 797 E.</note>
					bearing in mind how some men feel and act in times of sickness, being angry
					and fretful when hot water and gruel, or plain bread, is served to them,
					calling these things abominable and unpleasant, and abominable and
					hard-hearted also those who would force such things upon them. A bath has
					proved to be the death of many men who at the outset had not much the matter
					with them, save only that they could not and would not bear to taste food
					unless they had first had their bath ; of whom Titus the Emperor <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">There are varying accounts regarding the manner of Titus's death, poisoning or drowning being also alleged.</note> was one,
					as those who attended him in his illness affirm. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="4">
            <p>Something, moreover, was said to this effect, that, while the less expensive
					things are always more healthful for the body, we ought especially to guard
					against excess in eating and drinking, and against <pb id="v.2.p.225"/> all
					self-indulgence when we have immediately on hand some festival or a visit
					from friends, or when we are expecting an entertainment of some king or high
					official with its unavoidable social engagements ; and thus we should, as it
					were, in fair weather make our body trim and buoyant against the oncoming
					wind and wave. It is indeed a hard task, in the midst of company and good
					cheer, to keep to moderation and one's habits and at the same time to avoid
					the extreme disagreeableness which makes one appear offensive and tiresome
					to the whole company. Therefore, to avoid adding fire to fire (as the
					proverb has it),<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The proverb may be found in Plato's <hi rend="italics">Laws</hi>, p. 666 A, and often repeated in other writers.</note> and gorging to gorging, and strong drink to strong drink,
					we ought with all seriousness to imitate the polite joke of Philip. It was
					in this wise <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The story is repeated by Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 178 D, and referred to, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 707 B.</note> : A man had invited Philip to dinner in the country, assuming
					that he had but a few with him, but when later the host saw Philip bringing
					a great company, no great preparations having been made, he was much
					perturbed . Philip, becoming aware of the situation, sent word privately to
					each of his friends to <q direct="unspecified">leave room for cake.</q> They, following
					the advice, and looking for more to come, ate sparingly of what was before
					them, and so the dinner was ample for all. In this manner, then, we ought to
					prepare ourselves in anticipation of our imperative round of social
					engagements by keeping room in the body for elaborate dishes and pastry,
					and, I dare to say it, for indulgence in strong drink also, by bringing to
					these things an appetite fresh and willing. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>If, however, such imperative occasions suddenly confront us when we are
					overloaded and in no condition for taking part&mdash;if, for instance,
					we receive an invitation from a high official, or guests appear, so <pb id="v.2.p.227"/> that we are constrained by a false sense of shame to
					join company with men who are in fit condition and to drink with
					them&mdash;then especially, in order to combat <q direct="unspecified">shame which works
						mischief for men</q> 
               <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The reference may be to Homer, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> xxiv. 45 (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Hesiod, <hi rend="italics">Works and Days,</hi> 318).</note> (or rather I would call it shamefacedness),
					we should summon to our defence the words which Creon speaks <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Euripides, <hi rend="italics">Medea</hi>, 290, quoted also in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 530 C.</note> in the
					tragedy : <quote rend="blockquote">'Twere better, friend, to gain your hatred now Than be
						soft-hearted and lament anon.</quote> For to be so afraid of being thought ill-bred
					as to plunge oneself into a pleurisy or brain-fever is proof that one is in
					very truth ill-bred, possessed of neither sense nor the reason which knows
					how to consort with men without the wine-glass and the savour of food.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 612 F.</note> For
					a request to be excused, if characterized by cleverness and wit, is no less
					agreeable than joining in the round of gaiety ; and if a man provides a
					banquet in the same spirit in which he provides a burnt-offering which it is
					forbidden to taste, and personally abstains when the wine-cup and the table
					are before him, at the same time volunteering cheerfully some playful
					allusion to himself, he will create a pleasanter impression than the man who
					gets drunk and gormandizes for company. Of the men of earlier times he <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Presumable Plutarch again.</note>
					mentioned Alexander,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plutarch's <hi rend="italics">Life of Alexander</hi>, chap. lxxv. (p. 706 C); Diodorus, xvii. 117; Athenaeus, 434 C; Arrian, <hi rend="italics">Anabasis</hi>, vii. 25. 1; Quintus Curtius, x. 4; Justin, xii. 13.</note> who, after a prolonged debauch, was ashamed to say no
					to the challenges of Medius, and abandoned himself to a fresh round of hard
					drinking, which cost him his life; and of the men of our time he mentioned
					Regulus the prize-fighter. For when Titus Caesar called him to the bath at
					daybreak, 
					<pb id="v.2.p.229"/> he came and bathed with him, took but one drink, they
					say, and died immediately from a stroke of apoplexy. </p>
            <p>These are the teachings which Glaucus in derision quoted aggressively to us
					as pedantic. The rest he was not eager to hear, nor we to tell him. But I
					beg that you will examine each of the several statements. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>First there is Socrates,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Memorabilia</hi>, i. 3. 6; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi> 513 C, 521 E, and 661 F.</note> who, in urging us to be on our guard against such
					things to eat as persuade us to eat when we are not hungry, and such things
					to drink as persuade us to drink when we are not thirsty, did not absolutely
					forbid the use of these things ; but he was instructing us to use them only
					if we needed them, and to make the pleasure in them serve our necessity,
					just as our statesmen do who turn to military uses their funds for
					amusements.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Perhaps a reference to Demosthenes, lix. 4, which says that in time of war all surplus funds are to be devoted to the army.</note> For that which is pleasant, in so far as it is a nutritive
					element, is congenial to our nature, and it is by remaining still hungry
					that we ought to get enjoyment from the necessary or the pleasant foods ;
					but we should not stir up in ourselves a second and separate set of
					appetites after we have appeased the usual ones. And here is another
					consideration. Just as Socrates <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Symposium</hi>, ii. 17-20; again referred to <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>, 130 E and <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 711 E.</note> found dancing a not unpleasant exercise,
					so the man for whom pastry and sweets serve as a meal and as food suffers
					less injury. But when a man has satisfied the moderate demands of his
					nature, and has had his fill, he ought to exercise the very greatest
					vigilance against helping himself to such things. And in such matters, while
					we should be on guard against love of pleasure and gluttony, yet we should
					be no less on guard against vulgarity and love of notoriety. For these
					latter often help to persuade people to eat <pb id="v.2.p.231"/> something
					when they are not hungry, and to drink when they are not thirsty,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Supra</hi>, 124 D.</note> by
					suggesting utterly sordid and cheap conceits&mdash;that it is absurd not
					to take advantage of the presence of some rare and expensive thing, as, for
					example, sow's udder,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">For the cruelties practised in the preparation of this highly esteemed delicacy see Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 997 A.</note> Italian mushrooms, Samian cake, or snow in Egypt. For
					things of this sort do indeed often induce people to use what is renowned
					and rare, since they are led on by empty repute as by an attractive savour,
					and compel their body to do its share, although it feels no need, so that
					they may have a tale to tell to others, and may be envied for their
					enjoyment of things so hard to obtain and so uncommon. Quite similar is
					their behaviour toward notorious women. There are times when they repose in
					quiet with their own wives who are both lovely and loving, but when they
					have paid money to a Phryne or a La&iuml;s, although their body is in
					sorry state and is inclined to shirk its task, they rouse it forthwith to
					action, and call in licentiousness to minister to pleasure, all because of
					empty repute. In fact, Phryne herself, in her advancing years, said that she
					got a better price for her remnants because of her repute. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="7">
            <p>It is a great marvel if we get off unscathed, when we concede to the body
					only as much of pleasures as Nature in her need finds a place for, but still
					more so when we battle with it vigorously to thwart its appetites, and keep
					putting them off, and finally consent to some negotiation with such as will
					not be denied, or, as Plato <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The quotation does not appear in Plato, but Plutarch is probably summing up from memory an account of a contest with the passions such as may be found, for example, in the <hi rend="italics">Phaedrus</hi>, pp. 254 ff.</note> says, <q direct="unspecified">yield when the body bites and
						strains.</q> But when the case is reversed, 
					<pb id="v.2.p.233"/> and the desires descend from the mind to the body and
					force it to be subservient to the mind's emotions, and to join in their
					excitements, there is no way to prevent their leaving as a residue the most
					violent and serious injuries as the aftermath of feeble and evanescent
					pleasures. Least of all ought the body to be stirred to pleasures by the
					mind's desire, since such an origin is unnatural. Just as tickling the
					arm-pits so affects the mind as to produce laughter which is not natural, or
					even mild or happy, but convulsive and harsh, so whatsoever pleasures the
					body achieves through being prodded and disturbed by the mind are deranging
					and disturbing and foreign to Nature. Whenever, then, someone of those rare
					and notorious means of enjoyment is afforded us, we ought to take more pride
					in abstinence than in enjoyment, remembering that just as Simonides <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Repeated in more or less similar form, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 10 F and 514 F.</note> used
					to say that he had never been sorry for having kept silent, but many a time
					for having spoken, so we have never been sorry either for having put a
					dainty to one side, or for having drunk water instead of Falernian wine, but
					the opposite ; not only ought Nature not to be forced, but if anything of
					this sort is offered her even when she has need of it, the appetite ought to
					be often diverted from it towards the plain and familiar food for the sake
					of habituation and training. <quote rend="blockquote">If one must needs do wrong,</quote> are the words of
					the Theban,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Eteocles in the <hi rend="italics">Phoenissae</hi> of Euripides, i. 524; quoted by Plutarch also in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 18 D.</note> who is not correct in saying, far best it were <quote rend="blockquote">To do it for a

            <p>At some other time, then, it may be that we shall have to speak against

					continence ; but the present discourse is on the side of many pleasures and
					great. For diseases do not take from us and spoil for us so many of our
					enterprises or hopes or travels or pastimes as they do of our pleasures.
					Hence contempt for health is least profitable for those who make pleasure
					their chief aim. For infirmities allow many persons to be philosophers, or
					actually even generals or kings, but the pleasures and enjoyments of the
					body in some cases do not come to life at all in time of disease, and those
					that come to life yield but a brief part of what they properly should, and

					never give a thought to a plain and restrained way of living except when
					using enemas and poultices. But when we find ourselves in this plight we try
					hard to stifle the thought of our wrongdoings, setting ourselves against
					their remembrance, and, as is the way of most people who object to this or
					that air or this or that locality as insalubrious when they say that they
					dread travelling, we exclude our intemperance and self-indulgence from the

					ill-timed bath, or a social party, we have spoiled many of our pleasures and
					have ruined many an honourable enterprise and delightful recreation. For the
					sting caused by such reflections keeps the memory raw, so that, like a scar
					that remains when the body is in health, it makes us more circumspect about
					our way of living. For the healthy body will not, to any immoderate extent,
					breed desires that are vehement, intractable, unwonted, and hard to
					dispossess ; nay, we can boldly and confidently oppose the appetites which
					would fain go beyond all bounds and assault our enjoyments, knowing that
					their whining and whimpering is a trivial and childish manifestation, and

					Others, less gross than these, are not indeed caught in this folly, but very

            <p>Let us now take up each topic anew once more; and in the first place, on the
					subject of exercises suitable for scholars, we beg to remark that one might
					follow the example of the man who, by saying that he had nothing to write
					for people dwelling by the sea on the subject of ships, showed clearly that
					they were in use ; and so in the same way one <pb id="v.2.p.257"/> might say
					that he was not writing for scholars on the subject of exercise. For it is
					wonderful what an exercise is the daily use of the voice in speaking aloud,
					conducing, not only to health, but also to strength&mdash;not the
					strength of the wrestler which lays on flesh and makes the exterior solid
					like the walls of a building, but a strength which engenders an
					all-pervasive vigour and a real energy in the most vital and dominant parts.
					That breathing gives strength the athletic trainers make clear in telling
					the athletes to brace themselves against the rubbing and stop their breath
					meantime, and keep tense the portions of the body that are being kneaded and
					massaged. Now the voice is a movement of the breath, and if it be given
					vigour, not in the throat, but, as it were, at its source in the lungs, it
					increases the warmth, tones down the blood, clears out every vein, opens
					every artery, and does not permit of any concretion or solidifying of
					superfluous fluid like a sediment to take place in the containing organs
					which take over and digest the food. For this reason we ought especially to
					make ourselves habituated and used to this exercise by continual speaking,
					or, if there be any suspicion that our body is not quite up to the mark or
					is somewhat fatigued, then by reading aloud or declaiming. For reading
					stands in the same relation to discussion as riding in a carriage to active
					exercise, and as though upon the vehicle of another's words it moves softly,
					and carries the voice gently this way and that. But discussion adds
					contention and vehemence, as the mind joins in the encounter along with the
					body. We must, however, be cautious about passionate and convulsive
					vociferations. For 
					<pb id="v.2.p.259"/> spasmodic expulsion and straining of the breath
					produces ruptures and sprains. </p>
            <p>After reading or discussion, before going to walk, one should make use of
					rubbing with oil in a warm room to render the flesh supple, extending the
					massage so far as practicable to the inward parts, and gently equalizing the
					vital spirit and diffusing it into the extremities. Let the limits of the
					amount of this rubbing be what is agreeable to the senses and not
					discomforting. For the man who thus composes the inward disquiet and tension
					in his vital spirit manages the superfluous in his body without discomfort,
					and if unfavourable weather or some engagement prevent his going to walk, it
					does not matter, for Nature has received her proper due. Wherefore neither
					travelling nor stopping at an inn ought to be made an excuse for silence,
					nor even if everybody there deride one. For where it is not disgraceful to
					eat it is certainly not disgraceful to take exercise; nay, it is more
					disgraceful to feel timid and embarrassed before sailors, muleteers, and
					innkeepers, who do not deride the man who plays ball and goes through the
					movements of sparring alone, but the man who speaks, even though in his
					exercises he instruct, question, learn, and use his memory. Socrates said <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Symposium, 2. 18.</hi>
               </note>
					that for a man's movements in dancing a room that would accommodate seven
					persons at dinner was large enough to take exercise in, but for a man who
					takes his exercise through singing or speaking every place affords him
					adequate room for this exercise both when standing up and when lying down.
					But we must observe this one caution&mdash;not to strain our voices too
					hard
					<pb id="v.2.p.261"/> when we are conscious of a fullness, venery, or
					fatigue. This is the experience of many of the public speakers and sophists,
					some of whom are led on by repute and ambition, others on account of
					emoluments or political rivalries, to competition in excess of what is best
					for them. Our Niger, when he was giving public lectures in Galatia, happened
					to swallow a fish bone. But, as another sophist from abroad had made his
					appearance and was lecturing, Niger, dreading to give the impression that he
					had yielded to his rival, still lectured although the bone was sticking in
					his throat; unable to bear the distress from the great and stubborn
					inflammation that arose, he submitted to a deep incision from the outside,

            <p>To take a cold bath after exercising is ostentatious and juvenile rather than
					healthful. For the power of resistance to external influences and the
					hardiness which it seems to create in the body really produces a more evil
					effect on the inward parts by stopping up the pores, causing the fluids to
					collect together, and condensing the exudations which are always wanting to
					be released and dispersed. Besides, those who insist upon taking cold baths
					have to make a further change into that exact and strictly ordered way of
					living which we are trying to avoid, and they have to be always taking heed
					not to transgress this, since every shortcoming is at once bitterly brought
					to book. On the other hand, warm baths have much to offer by way of excuse.
					For they do not detract so much from vigour and strength as <pb id="v.2.p.263"/> they help towards health by rendering the food yielding
					and soft for the digestion, and by providing for the painless dispersion of
					whatever escapes digestion, at least if it do not remain altogether crude
					and high up, and soothing any latent feelings of fatigue. However, when
					Nature affords us a sense of a moderate and comfortable condition in our
					body, the bath had better be left alone. A gentle rubbing with oil beside a
					fire is better, if the body require warming, for it can take for itself the
					requisite amount of such warmth ; but the sun permits the use of its warmth
					at neither higher nor lower temperature than is determined by the
					temperature of the air. So much will suffice in regard to exercise. </p>

            <p>Coming now to the subject of food, if there be anything helpful in my earlier

					some further advice regarding what comes next; but if it be difficult to
					manage a belly that has been set free, as it were from bondage, and to
					wrangle with it when it has no ears to hear, as Cato <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The same remark is found in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 198 D, 996 D, and <hi rend="italics">Life of M. Cato</hi>, chap. viii. (p. 340 A).</note> used to say, we must
					contrive by means of the character of our food to make the quantity less
					burdensome ; and of the solid and very nourishing foods, things, for
					example, like meat and cheese, dried figs and boiled eggs, one may partake
					if he helps himself cautiously (for it is hard work to decline all the
					time), but should stick to the thin and light things, such as most of the
					garden stuff, birds, and such fish as have not much fat. For it is possible
					by partaking of these things both to gratify the appetites and not oppress
					the body. Especially to be feared are indigestions <pb id="v.2.p.265"/>
					arising from meats <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">It is worth while to compare Plutarch's essays on eating meat, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 993 A-999 B.</note> ; for they are depressing at the outset, and a
					pernicious residue from them remains behind. It is best to accustom the body
					not to require meat in addition to other food. For the earth yields in
					abundance many things not only for nourishment but also for comfort and
					enjoyment, some of which it grants to our use just as they are with no
					trouble on our part, while others we may make savoury by all sorts of
					combination and preparation. But since custom has become a sort of unnatural
					second nature, our use of meat should not be for the satisfaction of
					appetite, as is the case with wolves or lions ; but while we may put it in
					as a sort of prop and support of our diet, we should use other foods and
					relishes which for the body are more in accord with nature and less dulling
					to the reasoning faculty, which, as it were, is kindled from plain and light

					          <pb id="v.2.p.267"/> the wine, but that which is drunk by itself in the
					interim between the draughts of the mixture, makes the mixture more
					innocent. One ought to accustom oneself, therefore, in the course of the
					daily routine to partake of two or three glasses of water, thus both making
					the potency of the wine milder, and making the drinking of water habitual
					with the body, so that, whenever it comes to be in need of water, it may not
					feel strange towards the drink, and refuse it. For the fact is that some
					people feel most impelled towards wine when the drink which they most need
					is water. For after being exposed to the sun, and again when chilled, and
					after speaking more earnestly and thinking more intently than usual, and, in
					general, after exertions and strivings, they think they ought to drink wine,
					feeling that Nature requires for the body some comfort and change after
					labours. But Nature does not require comfort, if comfort is only a name for
					self-indulgence, but she does require a change, a change which puts the body
					in a state midway between pleasure and pain. Therefore in such circumstances
					there should not only be some reduction in food, but wine should be either
					altogether eliminated or else partaken of between times very diluted and
					practically engulfed by the drinking of water. For wine, being truculent and
					keen, intensifies the disturbances of the body, and exacerbates and
					irritates the contused parts, which are in need of the comfort and
					alleviation that water best supplies. For if, in spite of the fact that we
					are not thirsty, we drink hot water after undergoing exertion, strain, or
					heat, we are sensible of a relaxing and soothing effect within us; for the
					aqueous fluid is mild and does not quicken the pulse, <pb id="v.2.p.269"/>
					whereas that of wine has great impetuosity and a potency that is not kindly
					or humanely disposed toward recent affections. As for the acerbities and
					bitterness which some say fasting engenders in the body , if anybody fears
					them, or if, childlike, he thinks it a dreadful thing not to have a meal
					served before the fever which he suspects is coming, the drinking of water
					is a very fitting middle course. In fact we frequently make to Dionysus
					himself offerings which include no wine, thus habituating ourselves quite
					properly not to be always looking for strong drink. Minos, too, because of
					grief, abolished the flute and garland from the sacrifice.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

					to enjoyment, but set about bringing on emptiness with the idea of making
					room always for pleasures. The harmfulness in all this is manifest; for both
					procedures give rise to disorders and convulsive movements in the <pb id="v.2.p.277"/> body. What is peculiarly bad in the use of an emetic is
					that it increases and fosters an insatiate greediness. For the feelings of
					hunger become rough and turbulent, like rivers that are interrupted in their
					course, and they gulp the food down violently, always ravening and
					resembling not appetites that need victuals, but inflammations that need
					medicines and poultices. For this reason the pleasures that lay hold upon
					such persons are swift in their action and imperfect, and attended by much
					palpitation and agitation while being experienced, and these are succeeded
					by distensions and sharp pains in the passages, and retention of gases,
					which cannot wait for the natural movements, but stay in the upper part of
					the body as in water-logged ships which require the jettisoning of their
					cargo, not merely of their surplus. The violent disturbances lower down in
					the bowels resulting from medication, by decomposing and liquefying the
					existing contents, increase rather than relieve the overcrowding. Just
					imagine that anybody , feeling much troubled at the crowd of Greeks living
					in his city, should fill up the city with Arab and Scythian immigrants ! Yet
					it is just this radical mistake that some people make in connexion with the
					expulsion of the surplus of habitual and familiar foods, when they introduce
					into the body from the outside Cnidian berries, scammony, or other
					incongruous and drastic agents, which have more need of being purged away

            <p>If ever absolute necessity befall us, vomiting <pb id="v.2.p.279"/> should be

					excess to be peacefully ejected. Just as linen cleansed with lye and washing
					powders wears out faster than that washed in plenty of water, so vomitings
					with drugs maltreat and ruin the body. If the bowels are getting sluggish,
					there is no medicine like some sorts of food that afford a mild stimulus to
					the inclinations and gently dissolve the cause of trouble. Experience with
					these is familiar to all, and their use is not attended by discomfort. But
					if it will not yield to these, the drinking of water for several days, or

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 794 B; Tacitus, <hi rend="italics">Annals</hi>, vi. 46.</note> To me that seems a pretty <pb id="v.2.p.289"/> strong statement, but this does seem to be true, that
					each person ought neither to be unacquainted with the peculiarities of his
					own pulse (for there are many individual diversities), nor ignorant of any
					idiosyncrasy which his body has in regard to temperature and dryness,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 735 F.</note> and
					what things in actual practice have proved to be beneficial or detrimental
					to it. For the man has no perception regarding himself, and is but a blind
					and deaf tenant in his own body, who gets his knowledge of these matters
					from another, and must inquire of his physician whether his health is better
					in summer or winter, whether he can more easily tolerate liquid or solid
					foods, and whether his pulse is naturally fast or slow. For it is useful and
					easy for us to know things of this sort, since we have daily experience and
					association with them. </p>
            <p>In regard to food and drink it is expedient to note what kinds are wholesome
					rather than what are pleasant, and to be better acquainted with those that
					are good in the stomach rather than in the mouth, and those that do not
					disturb the digestion rather than those that greatly tickle the palate. For
					to inquire of a physician what is hard or easy for oneself to digest, and
					what is constipating or laxative, is no less disgraceful than to inquire
					what is sweet and what is bitter and what is sour. But nowadays people
					correct the chefs, being expert at detecting what dish has in it more
					sweetening or salt or sourness than is proper ; but they do not themselves
					know what, when taken into their own bodies, will be light and painless and
					beneficial. Therefore, a mistake is not often made in seasoning a soup at
					their houses, but by their vile and pernicious seasoning of themselves every
					day they provide a plentiful business <pb id="v.2.p.291"/> for the
					physicians. Now such persons do not regard the sweetest soup as the best,
					but they mix in also bitter and pungent flavourings ; on the other hand,
					they inject into the body numerous cloying pleasures, partly from ignorance,
					and partly because they do not remember that to whatever is healthful and
					beneficial nature adds a pleasure which causes neither pain nor repentance.
					But we must keep in mind both those things that are congenial and suitable
					to the body, and, conversely, as changes attendant on the season occur and
					different circumstances arise, we should, in full knowledge of the facts,
					suitably adjust our mode of living to each. </p>

					influence which compels them to be unsparing and careless of their body, so
					that they oftentimes, when the body is ready to succumb, will not surrender,

					earth-born with the celestial, in rivalry and achievement. Then later, to

					balance of a well-matched team ; when the body shares most in the work and
					weariness of the mind we should repay it by giving it the most care and
