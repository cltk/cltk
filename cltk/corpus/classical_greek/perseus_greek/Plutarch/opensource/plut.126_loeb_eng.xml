Adler (<title>Diss. Phil. Vind.</title> x, pp. 88-89). Wyttenbach contended that <q direct="unspecified">either nothing or no great part</q> had perished.</note> although one cannot tell whether much or little has been lost; this follows not merely from the abruptness of the opening as we have it, the lack of any kind of introduction, and the failure to identify the main speaker until two-thirds of the dialogue have been <pb n="v12.p.3"/> finished, but even more surely from the nature of the text in the opening sentences.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Those who have defended <foreign lang="greek">o( me\n ou)=n *su/llas <q direct="unspecified">tau=t</q> ei)=pe <q direct="unspecified">tw=| g' e)mw=| mu/qw| prosh/kei</q> ktl.</foreign> as a possible opening apparently were unaware that the reading of E is <foreign lang="greek">*)oaunosullas tau=ta ei)=pe. tw=| ga\r e)mw=| mu/qw| prosh/kei ktl.</foreign> and that B's <foreign lang="greek">o( me\n ou=n *su/llas</foreign> is in all probability a conjecture made by the scribe of that MS.

            <div2 type="chapter" n="2">
               <p>In the dialogue as it stands the first speaker is Sulla. His chief function is to recount the myth which he mentions in the first extant words and which occupies the final fifth of the work; but he interrupts the dialogue proper at 929 E  930 A to ask whether a certain difficulty was treated in the discussion which Lucius is reporting. He is a Carthaginian (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 942 C), presumably the Sextius Sulla cited by Plutarch in his <title>Romulus</title>, chap. 15 (26 C), and the same as the Carthaginian Sulla who gave a dinner for Plutarch in Rome (<bibl>
                     <title>Quaest. Conviv.</title> 727 B</bibl>). He is probably the Sulla who appears as the interlocutor of Fundanus in the <title>De Cohibenda Ira</title> (note b, 453 A) but probably not the same as the Sulla of <title>Quaest. Conviv.</title> 636 A (<foreign lang="greek">o( e(tai=ros</foreign>) and 650 A (one of <foreign lang="greek">tw=n sunh/qwn</foreign>).</p>
               <p>The second speaker, at once the narrator of the whole conversation and the leader of the dialogue <pb n="v12.p.4"/> proper, is Lamprias,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">His name is not mentioned until 937 D. There at the beginning of a section which serves as the transition from the main or <q direct="unspecified">scientific</q> part of the dialogue to the myth Theon calls Lamprias by name, as Sulla does also at the beginning of his myth (940 F) and at the end of it (945 D). It is probable that in the lost beginning of the work Lamprias was similarly identified.</note> who is also the narrator of the <title>De Defectu Oraculorum</title> (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 413 D), a dialogue in which he plays the leading role.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Flaceli&egrave;re, <title>Plutarque: Sur la Disparition des Oracles</title> (Paris, 1947), pp. 19-22.</note> In the <title>De E apud Delphos</title>, where Lamprias appears with Plutarch, Plutarch calls him brother (385 D); and he is frequently identified as Plutarchs brother in the <title>Quaest. Conviv.</title> (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 635 A, 726 D - E, 744 C [with 745 A], and possibly 626 A). He is characterized as a wit and a tease (726 D - E, 740 A), one accustomed to speak out in a loud voice (617 E-F), and capable of inventing a story as evidence to support his argument (<title>De E</title> 386 A); he is an expert in culinary matters (643 E, 669 C, 670 E) and in the dance (747 B) and shrinks from appearing as a kill-joy to younger men (704 E). He is made to emphasize his close relations with a Cynic (<title>De Defectu Oraculorum</title>, 413 B); but he is no Cynic himself, and he is mortified to think that he might be supposed to have used his skill in argument to discredit any pious belief (435 E). He is said to honour the school of Aristotle above that of Epicurus (<title>Quaest Conviv.</title> 635 A - B); but he does not hesitate to disagree with Aristotle in the <title>De Defectu Oraculorum</title> (424 C ff.) and to espouse against him the doctrine of the Academy (430 E ff.). In the De Facie he is a vehement critic of Stoic doctrine and a supporter of the Academic position (cf 922 F). Lamprias bore the name of his grandfather; but this <pb n="v12.p.5"/> does not prove, as has sometimes been asserted, that he was older than his brothers, Plutarch and Timon. <title>De Defectu Oraculorum</title>, 431 C - D, has been thought to show that he was a priest of the oracle in Lebadeia,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Hirzel, <title>Der Dialog</title>, ii, p. 189, n. 3; Flaceli&egrave;re, <hi rend="italics">

               <p>Apollonides, the third speaker, is at once identified as expert in geometry (920 F), and Lamprias indicates that the scope and limitations of his specialty coincide with those of Hipparchus, the great astronomer (921 d, <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 925 A). He puts forward objections to Lamprias's explanation of the <q direct="unspecified">face</q> based upon astronomical terminology and calculations (933 f, 935 d-e). An Apollonides appears at Quaest Conviv. 650 F along with Sulla; but he is called o( taktiko\s *)apollwni/dhs, and there is no compelling reason to identify the two.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Ziegler (<title>Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 34) says that the sentence at 927 B, <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r e)n stratope/dw| taktikw=n o)/felos ktl.</foreign>, is spoken <q direct="unspecified">obviously with reference to the interlocutor Apollonides</q>; but this is pretty obviously not true. Lamprias is not here speaking in answer to Apollonides; and his subsequent words, <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\ khpourw=n ou)d oi)kodo/mwn</foreign>, certainly have reference to none of the present company. These are in fact stock examples of the argument from design.</note> Prickard may well be right in saying that the name Apollonides here was used by Plutarch to mean <q direct="unspecified">one of the clan of Apollonius,</q> 
                  <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> a mathematician who, like Apollonius,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Apollonius of Perga; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Hultsch, <title>R. E.</title> ii. 151-160.</note> is interested in astronomical theory.</p>
               <pb n="v12.p.6"/>
               <p>Certainly Aristotle, who puts forward the orthodox Peripatetic theory of the heavenly bodies (928 E ff.), is only a name chosen by Plutarch to signify the school that he represents (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 920 F), even as the representative Epicurean in <title>De Sera Numinis Vindicta</title> is called Epicurus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">There is no reason to change <foreign lang="greek">*)epi/kouros</foreign> of the MSS. in 548 A to <foreign lang="greek">*)epikou/reios</foreign>, as Fabricius did. <q direct="unspecified">Aristotle</q> here supports <q direct="unspecified">Epicurus</q> there.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Stoic position is represented by Pharnaces. This name was borne by the son of Mithridates, of whom Plutarch tells in the Lives of Pompey and Caesar, as well as by several notable Persians mentioned by Herodotus and Thucydides<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">There was also a city in Pontus named Pharnaceia (<bibl>
                        <title>Lucullus</title>, 17 [502 F]</bibl>).</note>; and Plutarch probably chose it for his Stoic because of its Asiatic sound.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Hirzel (Der Dialog, ii, p. 186, n. 4) says that Pharnaces is certainly a former slave, one who had shared the fate and sentiments of Epictetus. This, of course, is the merest fancy; not all Asiatics, not even all in Rome at this time, had been slaves. For Athenians named Pharnaces <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After the role of Lamprias the largest in the dialogue proper is that of Lucius, who is probably the same as <q direct="unspecified">Lucius, the pupil of Moderatus the Pythagorean, from Etruria,</q> a guest at the dinner which Sulla gave for Plutarch in Rome (<bibl>
                     <title>Quaest. Conviv.</title> viii. 7-8 [727 B ff., 728 D ff.]</bibl>).<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Another Lucius, the son of Florus, appears in <bibl>

                     <bibl>Ziegler, <title>Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 55</bibl>.</note> Early in the dialogue (921 F) Lamprias turns to Lucius for aid; he seems to think it appropriate that Lucius should set forth the strict <q direct="unspecified">demonstration</q> of the Academic theory concerning <pb n="v12.p.7"/> the moon (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 928 D - E); and in fact the statement and defence of this position are shared by the two of them.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">It is Lucius who demands that the Stoic theory should not be passed over without refutation (921 F). It is he who replies when Pharnaces complains of Lamprias's violent treatment of the Stoics (922 F). His speeches extend from 922 F to 923 F, where Lamprias takes over to give him time to collect his thoughts, from 928 F to 929 E, from 930 A to 931 C, and from 931 D to 933 E.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Theon, whom Lamprias asks to identify a quotation (923 F) and whom he later teases for admiring Aristarchus to the neglect of Crates (938 D), is recognized as the literary authority in the group (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 931 E, 940 A). He is probably to be identified with <foreign lang="greek">*qe/wn o( grammotiko/s</foreign>, who was a guest at Sulla's dinner along with Lucius (<title>Quaest. Conviv.</title> 728 F) and who also dined with Plutarch at the house of Mestrius Florus (<title>Quaest.

               <p>The last of the persons present is Menelaus the mathematician.

               <p>From 937 C - D it follows that the interlocutors have hitherto been promenading as they talked and that now they sit down upon the steps, seats, or benches (<foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ tw=n ba/qrwn</foreign>) and remain seated to the end. No other indication of the scene or location is given in the work as we have it. It had generally been assumed that the dialogue was meant to take place in Chaeronea<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Hirzel, <title>Der Dialog</title>, ii, p. 184, n. 1, who discusses and rejects the suggestion that the scene is Delphi.

No such inference is justified by this phrase, of course; in fact, the preceding <foreign lang="greek">u(/lhn de\ kai\ karpou\s au)tou=</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">au)to/qi</foreign>, as Raingeard conjectures) <foreign lang="greek">me\n o)/mbroi tre/fousin</foreign> and the subsequent <foreign lang="greek">par' u(mi=n e)n *ai)gu/ptw|</foreign> (939 D 1) show that the scene of the dialogue is not anywhere in Egypt.</note>; but nothing in the text requires this, and F. H. Sandbach has adduced strong arguments for believing that the dramatic location is Rome or the vicinity of Rome.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">F. H.

I am indebted to Mr. Sandbach for sending me, along with copies of his publications, many of his unpublished opinions concerning points in the De Facie and copies of his correspondence with J. K. Fotheringham occasioned by the publication of the article cited above.</note> The persons in the dialogue furnish one of these arguments. Apollonides, Aristotle, and Pharnaces occur nowhere else in Plutarch's writings and are probably all fictitious <pb n="v12.p.9"/> characters. Plutarch nowhere else mentions Menelaus the mathematician either, but we know that Menelaus spent some time in Rome (see note a, p. 8). Sulla, Lucius, and Theon all appear together at a dinner given for Plutarch when he had returned to Rome after an interval of absence (<title>Quaest Conviv.</title> viii. 7-8); and none of these three is ever mentioned as being anywhere but in Rome or its vicinity (see &sect; 2, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>). Lamprias alone belongs to Plutarch's circle at Chaeronea; but it is by no means certain that he did not visit Rome as Plutarch did, though there seems to be no definite evidence either way.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Lamprias at least pretends to be conversant with Latin (<title>Quaest.

               </p>
               <p>The other argument for the dramatic location is connected with the question of the dramatic date of the dialogue.

The latter was total at Alexandria shortly before 15 hours. The former was total in Carthage a little after 15 hours and in the latitude of Rome on the eastern side of the Adriatic at about 15 hours, 20 minutes; at Rome itself the maximum obscuration was 11 &middot; 5 digits, so that, since according to Fotheringham<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">

Adler then, assuming that after the ceremonious restoration of the temple in A.D. 84 Plutarch would not remind his readers of its devastation, concluded that the dialogue must have been written before A.D. 84. This argument was criticized by K. Mras (<title>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die &ouml;sterreichischen Gymnasien</title>, lxv [1914], p. 187), who in turn deleted <foreign lang="greek">*tufw=nes</foreign> from the text and read <foreign lang="greek">*tituoi\ de\ kai\ o( *tufw\n o( nfw/n *delfou/s . . . bi/a| ktl.</foreign> This violent alteration is even less justifiable than Hirzel's excision of <foreign lang="greek">*tufw/n</foreign>, with which it shares the fault of producing the hiatus <foreign lang="greek">bi/a| e)c</foreign>; but the text of the MSS. is impossible despite Adler, for (a) one does not say in any language <q direct="unspecified">such creatures as Tityus and Typho and in particular Typho . . .,</q> (b) nowhere else is Typho himself said to have done the deed here ascribed to him, and (c) a reference to the conflagration is at least as improbable as the supposed reference to Nero. Kaltwasser's change of <foreign lang="greek">*tufw/n</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">*pu/qwn</foreign>, on the other hand, is practically certain. Confusion of <foreign lang="greek">p</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">t</foreign> and of <foreign lang="greek">q</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">f</foreign> is easy and common, and <foreign lang="greek">pu/qwn</foreign> coming after <foreign lang="greek">tufw/nes</foreign> would very easily be assimilated to it. Moreover, in <title>De Defectu Oraculorum</title>, 421 C, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ peri\ *pu/qwna</foreign> are included among <foreign lang="greek">daimo/nwn pa/qh</foreign> along with <foreign lang="greek">ta\ *tufwnika/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ta\ *titanika/</foreign>. In 414 A - B the oracle at Delphi is said to have been long deserted in what is represented as <q direct="unspecified">ancient times</q>; and, if it is denied that the beast (which is not here named but is certainly Pythons3) was the cause, that is done in order to ascribe the cause to <foreign lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign>. Finally, <foreign lang="greek">*pu/qwn</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">*tituo/s</foreign> are named together by Plutarch in Pelopidas, 16 (286 C) as they are by Strabo (ix. 3. 12 [cc. 422-423]) and Apollodorus (<title>Bibliotheca</title>, i. 4. 1. 3-5 [22-23]).</note>; and we are restricted by the evidence at present available to the conclusion that the conversation was meant to have taken place in or about Rome some time    and perhaps quite a long time    after A.D. 75.</p>
               <p>So much for the dramatic date. There is no reason <pb n="v12.p.13"/> at all for Hirzel's assertion<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">

            <div2 type="chapter" n="4">
               <p>The structure of the De Facie is complicated. The whole of the work is narrated by Lamprias who speaks in the first person and quotes those who took part in the conversation, including himself, some few times in indirect discourse (e.g. 933 F) but for the most part directly. The last part of his narration (chaps. 26-30 [940 F  945 D] consists entirely of Sulla's myth given in Sulla's own words; this myth, Sulla himself says, is a story told to him by an unnamed stranger, whom he quotes first indirectly and then (942 D ff.) directly to the end. The second or eschatological part of the myth the stranger had told Sulla that he had himself heard from <q direct="unspecified">the chamberlains and servitors of Cronus</q> (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 945 D). Hearing it from Lamprias now, the reader has this part at fourth hand and the geographical introduction of the stranger at third hand.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Cf, Plato's <title>Parmenides</title> and Shorey, <title>What Plato Said</title>, p. 287.</note>
               </p>
               <p>From 937 C it appears that Sulla had promised to tell his myth in return for an account of what had been said in an earlier discussion about the nature of the face which appears in the moon. Such a compact may have been expressly made in the beginning of the dialogue which is lost, where Sulla may have come upon the company already engaged in reviewing that earlier discussion (see note a, p. 3). So much is no more than conjecture. It is certain, however, <pb n="v12.p.15"/> that most of what Lamprias narrates from chapter 2 through chapter 23 is a conversation which is itself represented as containing a resume or report of what was said at an earlier conversation. This the beginning of chapter 24 (937 C) states explicitly: <foreign lang="greek">h(mei=s me\n ou)=n, e)/fhn, o(/sa mh\ diape/feuge th\n mnh/mhn tw=n e)kei= lexqe/ntwn a)phgge/lkamen</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">e)do/kei le/gesqai</foreign> at the end of chapter 2 (920 F) implies that what Lamprias has hitherto said in that chapter had been used as an argument in the earlier discussion.

Nevertheless, Pharnaces' words in the latter passage, <foreign lang="greek">e)me\ d ou)=n ou)k e)ca/cesqe th/meron ktl.</foreign>, are open to the interpretation that he had been present at the earlier discussion and had there been drawn out by the Academic gambit.</note>; and concerning Aristotle and Menelaus the text as we have it allows no clear inference to be drawn.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">Lucius's one remark to Menelaus (930 A), <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nomai . . . sou= paro/ntos ktl.</foreign>, seems to imply that the latter had not been present at the earlier discussion; but this is not decisive, especially in view of the fact that Menelaus makes no reply. Aristotle's silence when Lamprias addresses him in 920 F might be taken to mean that he had heard this before; and <foreign lang="greek">. . . pro\s *kle/arxon, w)= *)aristo/teles, . . . e)do/kei le/gesqai to\n u(me/rteron</foreign> could be interpreted as a reminder, although what follows, <foreign lang="greek">u(me/teros ga\r a(nh\r ktl.</foreign>, sounds as if this were something new. In 929 B Lucius in a speech addressed especially to Aristotle refers to what <q direct="unspecified">our comrade</q> said <foreign lang="greek">e)n th=| diatribh=|</foreign> and adds that he will not repeat what he learned <foreign lang="greek">par u(mw=n h)\ meq u(mw=n</foreign>, which might be taken to imply that Aristotle too had attended the <foreign lang="greek">diatribh/</foreign> in question, although it might have a more general meaning.</note> What these men other than Lamprias and Lucius say in chapters 2-23 is not, then, part of the report of that earlier discussion; but neither is all that Lucius says, for in several places his remarks or arguments are expressly declared to be his own contribution.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">

The latter marks the last sentence of Lucius's preceding speech (<foreign lang="greek">do/te dh/ moi gewmetrikw=s ei)pei=n ktl.</foreign>) as his own, while Lucius's own subsequent statement (<foreign lang="greek">ou)kou=n kai\ deu/teron a)nalogi/a| prosxrhte/on</foreign>) makes the same claim for what follows. In 933 C (<foreign lang="greek">pari/hmi d' o(/sa . . . e)le/xqh</foreign>) and possibly in 929 B (<foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ de\ tau=ta me\n ou)k e)rw= ktl.</foreign> [see note b <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>]) Lucius indicates that he is not giving a full account of the earlier discussion.</note> That earlier discussion cannot, however, be identified with any that Plutarch <pb n="v12.p.17"/> may have had with his friends or with any lecture that he may have given; it is primarily a literary fiction, part of the structure of the dialogue for which it provides a specious motivation.</p>
               <p>The recapitulation of this fictitious discussion along with the incidental arguments provoked by it contains all that Plutarch would consider to be <q direct="unspecified">scientific</q> in the dialogue. At its conclusion Lamprias is ready for Sulla's myth (chap. 24 <hi rend="italics">init.</hi> [937 C - D]); but before Sulla can begin to speak Theon raises the question of the habitability of the moon, contending that, if it is not habitable, there can be no reason for it to exist with the nature or composition that according to Lamprias and Lucius it does have.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">

                  </note> Lamprias calls Theon's speech a kind of relaxation after the seriousness of the preceding discussion. In fact, however, Theon has raised the metaphysical problem of the final cause; and to this Lamprias replies at length (chap. 25). He argues first that the moon, constituted as he contends it is, need not, even if uninhabitable, be without a purpose in the universe (938 C - F), and secondly that, even if uninhabitable by corporeal human beings, it may still be inhabited by living beings of an entirely different kind to whom the moon may justly appear to be the only real earth and our earth the slime and dregs of the universe, uninhabitable by creatures that have warmth and breath and motion. Here Sulla checks Lamprias (chap. 26 <hi rend="italics">init.</hi> [940 F]) lest the latter encroach upon his myth; and Lamprias was upon the very threshold  <pb n="v12.p.18"/> of it, for the myth, as it turns out, teaches that the moon is inhabited by souls that have left their bodies after death on earth or have not yet been incorporated by birth into terrestrial bodies. So the episode consisting of Theon's speech and Lamprias's reply (chaps. 24-25) is not merely a formal literary device. It is, to be sure, a transition from the scientific part of the dialogue, in which it is argued that the lunar phenomena imply the earth-like constitution of the moon, to the concluding myth in which the purpose of such a moon in the universe is imaginatively portrayed; but this <q direct="unspecified">transitional episode</q> raises the philosophical question, without the answer to which the strictly astronomical conclusion could to a Platonist or Aristotelian be no complete or satisfactory explanation, and itself contains the metaphysical answer, of which the myth is, despite all its intrinsic interest, essentially a poetical embellishment. When this <q direct="unspecified">transition</q> is properly attended to, there can be no question about the integral unity of the whole dialogue or any doubt that the purpose of the whole is to establish and defend the position that the moon is entirely earthy in its constitution and that on this hypothesis alone can the astronomical phenomena and the existence of the moon itself be accounted for.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">

Ibn Al-Haitham's explanation of the <q direct="unspecified">face</q> is that the nature of the moon's substance must differ from place to place, since the variation in illumination can be the result only of a difference in the power to absorb and reflect light, and the spots are places of greater density and less power of absorption (pp. 20 ff. and 29-31). Though Schoy appears to have been unaware of it and Plutarch does not mention it, this explanation is ascribed to <foreign lang="greek">oi( a)po\ tw=n maqhmatikw=n</foreign> in A&euml;tius, ii. 30. 7 (<title>Dox. Graeci</title>, p. 362. 5-13). Ibn Al-Haitham rejects the theory that the spots are shadows cast by prominences on the moon, arguing that such shadows would not always have the same shape and position, as the spots do (pp. 14-17). Like Plutarch, however, he knows and refutes the notion that they are a reflection of the terrestrial ocean or any other terrestrial feature (pp. 1-2, 5-7; <title>De Facie</title>, chaps. 3-4); and he also adduces the colour of the moon in eclipse (pp. 31 f.; <title>De Facie</title>, 934 B - D). He proves impossible as well (pp. 4-5, <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> p. 2) an explanation unmentioned by Plutarch but recorded by Simplicius (<title>De Caelo</title>, p. 457. 25-30) that the spots are the result of vapours rising from below and obscuring the moon's brilliance (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi>, however, for something similar, Milton, <title>Paradise Lost</title>, v. 415-420, and <title>De Facie</title>, 922 B - C). Like Cleomedes (ii. 4. 103 [p. 186. 14-27 Ziegler]), Ibn Al-Haitham seems to hold that the moon as a reflecting convex mirror would have to appear as a single point of light (pp. 7 f. with Schoy's note, p. 8, n. 1).</note>

               <p>The discussion of the second part of the myth, the demonology and eschatology, has also been concerned mainly with the problem of Plutarch's sources.

Later, against Karl Reinhardt's attempt to trace the myth back to a hypothetical <q direct="unspecified">solar esehatology</q> of Posidonius, Jones re-established the Platonic character of Plutarch's eschatology, psychology, and demonology here and the impossibility of taking Posidonius for the source.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">K.

As to Hamilton's notion of the seriousness with which Plutarch intended the myth, Ziegler is surely right in saying (<title>Plutarchos von Chaironeia</title>, 217) that Sulla's final sentence, taken together with Lamprias's remark in 920 B - C, shows that Plutarch had no intention of insisting upon the literal truth of the myth; in this attitude also he follows Plato: see note a on p. 223 <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> Soury in his extensive study of the myth, while emphasizing the possible influence of the mysteries, agrees in general with Hamilton that it is preponderantly Platonic.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">G.

               <p>Anyone who without a preconceived thesis to defend reads the De Facie will recognize, I believe, that Plato was Plutarch's inspiration throughout the dialogue but that Plutarch is himself the true author of the whole work and that, while there is in it a distillation of his wide and varied scientific and philosophical reading, he cannot possibly have composed it by copying out any source or combination of sources. I have tried in the exegetical notes to indicate the <q direct="unspecified">parallels</q> which will help the reader to understand the dialogue itself by seeing its relation <pb n="v12.p.26"/> to the rest of ancient scientific and philosophical thought. Among these <q direct="unspecified">parallels</q> some of the most striking are drawn from later writers, especially Neo-Platonists; these I have mentioned not in order to insinuate that they show Plutarch's direct influence upon those later writers, although many of them certainly were acquainted with him, but because they illuminate the meaning of the <title>De Facie</title> and at the same time indicate what may have been contained in some of the philosophical writings known to Plutarch and long since lost to us, and may help to cast some flicker of light upon that obscure and controversial problem, the prehistory of Neo-Platonism.</p>

               <head>Addendum</head>
               <p>Since this Bibliography was compiled in February 1953 some publications dealing with the De Facie have come to my attention which require a brief notice.</p>
               <p>Konrat Ziegler in <title>Plutarch &uuml;ber Gott und Vorsehung, D&auml;monen und Weissagung</title> (Z&uuml;rich, Artemis-Verlag, 1952) has written a brief summary of the essay (pp. 42-45) and has translated the myth (940 F  945 D into German (pp. 268-278) with the addition of a few explanatory notes. He makes one noteworthy alteration in the text at 941 A - B: adopting <foreign lang="greek">to\n de\ *bria/rewn e)/xonta fronro/n</foreign>, after which he puts a full stop, he removes the following words, <foreign lang="greek">tw=n te nh/swn . . . paraka/tw kei=sqai</foreign> (?), from their position in the MSS. and places them after <foreign lang="greek">ku/klw| qa/latta</foreign> in 941 B three lines below.</p>
               <p>The question of the MSS., which is touched upon in the Introduction &sect; 6 <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>, has been discussed, though without specific reference to the <title>De Facie</title>, by R. <pb n="v12.p.32"/> Flaceli&egrave;re in his edition and translation of the <title>Amatorius</title> (<title>Plutarque: Dialogue sur lamour</title> [Paris, <q direct="unspecified">Les Belles Lettres,</q> 1952], pp. 35-37) and in an article, <q direct="unspecified">La Tradition manuscrite des trait&eacute;s 70-77 de Plutarque,</q> 
                  <title>Rev. &Eacute;tudes Grecques</title>, lxv (1952), pp. 351-362. By a different route he reaches the same conclusion as did G. R. Manton, namely that B is derived from E, probably through an intermediate manuscript now lost.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Irigoin, <title>Rev. de Philologie</title>, xxviii (1954), pp. 117-119.</note> In <title>Gnomon</title>, xxv (1953), pp. 556-557 K. Hubert replied to Flaceli&egrave;re's arguments and again sought to establish the independence of B with respect to E.</p>
               <p>Flaceli&egrave;re in his article entitled <q direct="unspecified">Plutarque et les &eacute;clipses de la lune</q> (<title>Rev. tudes Anciennes</title>, liii [1951], pp. 203-221) is primarily concerned with the interpretation of De Genio Socratis, 591 C, but in connection with this he discusses <title>De Facie</title>, 933 D - E and 942 D - E and argues that in the former of these two passages Plutarch depends upon the calculations of Hipparchus (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> my note in <title>Class. Phil.</title> xlvi [1951], p. 145 referred to in note e on 933 E <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>).</p>
               <p>G. Zuntz in Rhein. Mus. xcvi (1953), pp. 233-234 has proposed several emendations in the text of the essay:</p>
               <p>940 E: He is right in assuming that Bernardakis' <foreign lang="greek">u(mei=s</foreign> is a misprint for <foreign lang="greek">h(mei=s</foreign> of the MSS., but <foreign lang="greek">o(/saper</foreign> which he condemns and emends is, of course, correct; he apparently misunderstood the construction, <foreign lang="greek">o(/saper h(mei=s</foreign> (scil. <foreign lang="greek">xrw/meqa</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">a)e/ri</foreign>.</p>
               <p>942 F: After <foreign lang="greek">ti/s d 'ou(=to/s e)stin</foreign>; he would add &lt;<foreign lang="greek">e)/fhn: o( d':</foreign>&gt;, thus producing the same effect as did Reiske's punctuation. <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> on this sentence my note in <title>Class. Phil.</title> xlvi (1951), pp. 150-151.</p>
               <pb n="v12.p.33"/>
               <p>943	D: He would write <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)/logon kai\ [to\] paqhtiko/n</foreign> on the strength of <title>De Def. Orac.</title> 417 B (p. 75. 23 [Sieveking]). This would be possible but is unnecessary, since <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign> can here be taken as <q direct="unspecified">explicative.</q>
               </p>
               <p>944	C: He suggests <foreign lang="greek">*fersefo/nhs ou)=dos a)ntixqo/nios</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">*fersefo/nhs ou)=dos a)nti/xqonos</foreign>, apparently unaware of von Arnim's far more probable emendation (see notes d and e on p. 221 <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>). His further supplement, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ de\ &lt;pro\s ta\&gt; e)ntau=qa</foreign>, is quite unnecessary.</p>
               <p>944	E: To <foreign lang="greek">e)/rwti th=s peri\ to\n h(/lion ei)ko/nos</foreign> he would add &lt;<foreign lang="greek">tou= e(no\s</foreign>&gt; or &lt;<foreign lang="greek">tou= nohtou=</foreign>&gt; or &lt;<foreign lang="greek">ta)gaqou=</foreign>&gt; on the ground that the phrase as it stands is unintelligible. The following words, <foreign lang="greek">di 'h)=s e)pila/mpei ktl.</foreign>, themselves explain what Plutarch means (see note g on 944 E <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>), and there is no excuse for any supplement at all.</p>
               <p>945	B: He rightly defends Kaltwasser's alteration of <foreign lang="greek">*tufw\n</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">*pu/qwn</foreign> (see Introduction, p. 12, note b <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>).</p>

            <p>Well, to begin with, you see that it is absurd to call the figure seen in the moon an affection of vision in its feebleness giving way to brilliance, a condition which we call &lt;bedazzlement&gt;.

In fact the contrary, I think, should have been the case if the image resulted from an affection of the eye when it is overpowered: the weaker the subject affected, &lt;the clearer&gt; should be the appearance of the image.

For with us too, while <pb n="v12.p.53"/> the air in the depths and hollows of the earth, wherever the suns rays do not penetrate, remains shadowy and unlit, that which suffuses the earth outside takes on brilliance and a luminous colour.

Since the sun is eclipsed by being overtaken and the moon by encountering that which produces the eclipse, it is reasonable or rather it is necessary that the sun be caught first from behind and the moon from the front, for the obstruction begins from that point which the intercepting body first assails. The sun is assailed from the west by the moon that is striving after him, and she is assailed from the east &lt;by the earth's shadow&gt; that is sweeping down as it were in the opposite direction. Thirdly, moreover, consider the matter of the duration and the magnitude of lunar eclipses. If the moon is eclipsed when she is high and far from the earth, she is concealed for a little time; but, if this very thing happens to her when she is low and near the earth, she is strongly curbed and is slow to get out of the shadow, although when she is low her exertions of motion are greatest and when she is high they are least. The reason for the difference lies in the shadow, which being broadest at the base, as cones are, and gradually contracting terminates at the vertex in a sharp and fine tip. Consequently the moon, if she has met the shadow when <pb n="v12.p.129"/> she is low, is involved by it in its largest circles<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">

Besides, even in the case of mountains the dazzling beams of the sun prevent their crags from being discerned in broad daylight, although their depths and hollows and shadowy parts are visible from afar. So it is not at all strange that in the case of the moon too it is not possible to discern accurately the reflection and illumination, whereas the juxtapositions  <pb n="v12.p.149"/> of the shadowy and brilliant parts by reason of the contrast do not escape our sight.</p>

For example, if when a ray of light rebounds from water to a wall the eye is situated in the place that is itself illuminated by the reflection, the eye discerns all three things, the reflected ray and the water that causes the reflection and the sun itself,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">

In the present passage Plutarch does not say why his interpretation of Homer's line justifies him in calling the moon <foreign lang="greek">tou= *(/aidou pe/ras</foreign>, but the rest of the myth makes it certain that Hades is the region between earth and moon (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 943 C <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>).

            <p>And what is this, Sulla? Do not ask about these things, for I am going to give a full explanation myself. Most people rightly hold man to be composite but wrongly hold him to be composed of only two parts. The reason is that they suppose mind to be somehow part of soul, thus erring no less than those who believe soul to be part of body, for in the same degree as soul is superior to body so is mind better and more divine than soul. The result of soul &lt;and body commingled is the irrational or the affective factor, whereas of mind and soul&gt; the conjunction produces reason; and of these the former is source of pleasure and pain, the latter of virtue and vice.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb" place="unspecified">
