            <head>Concerning the virtues of women.</head>
            <p>Concerning the virtues of women, O Clea, I am not of
				the same mind with Thucydides. For he would prove
				that she is the best woman concerning whom there is the
				least discourse made by people abroad, either to her praise
				or dispraise; judging that, as the person, so the very name
				of a good woman ought to be retired and not gad abroad.
				But to us Gorgias seems more accurate,who requires that
				not only the face but the fame of a woman should be known
				to many. For the Roman law seems exceeding good, which
				permits due praises to be given publicly both to men and
				women after death. Wherefore when Leontis, a most
				excellent woman, departed this life, immediately we made
				a long oration to thee about her, and truly not devoid of
				philosophical consolation; and now (as thou didst desire)
				I send thee in writing the rest of my speech and conversation, carrying with it an historical demonstration that the
				virtue of a man and woman is one and the same. And
				although it be not composed for the tickling of the ear,
				yet if there be jucundity in the nature of an example to
				him that is persuaded of the truth of it, my narration fails
				riot of that grace which works conviction; neither is it
				ashamed of commixing the Graces with the Muses in the
				sweetest harmony (as Euripides saith), while it engageth
				confidence especially through that part of the soul which
				is studious of grace and beauty. For surely, if, whilst we
				asserted the art of painting to be the same, whether performed
				
				<pb id="v.1.p.341"/>
				
				 by men or women, we produced the same sort of
				draughts wrought by women which Apelles, Zeuxis, or
				Nicomachus hath left, is there any one who would reprehend us as attempting rather to humor and cajole men
				than to convince them? Verily I do not think it. Moreover, if, whilst we go to make appear that the poetic
				or comic art is not one thing in men and another in
				women, we compare Sappho's verses with Anacreon's, or
				the Sibylline oracles with those of Bacis, can any one justly
				blame this way of argumentation, because it insinuates a
				credence into the pleased and delighted hearers? No one
				surely would say this. Neither can a man truly any waybetter
				learn the resemblance and the difference between feminine and virile virtue than by comparing together lives with
				lives, exploits with exploits, as the products of some great
				art; duly considering whether the magnanimity of Semiramis carries with it the same character and impression with
				that of Sesostris, or the cunning of Tanaquil the same with
				that of King Servius, or the discretion of Porcia the same
				with that of Brutus, or that of Pelopidas with Timoclea,&mdash;
				regarding that quality of these virtues wherein lie their
				chiefest point and force. Moreover, virtues do admit some
				other differences, like peculiar colors, by reason of men's
				dispositions, and are assimilated to the manners and temperaments of the bodies wherein they are, yea, to the education and manner of diet. Achilles was courageous in
				one manner, Ajax in another; the subtlety of Ulysses was
				not like that of Nestor, neither were Cato and Agesilaus
				just after the same manner; neither was Eirene a lover of
				her husband as Alcestis was; neither was Cornelia magnanimous in the same way with Olympias. But, for all
				this, we do not say that there are many kinds of fortitude,
				prudence, and justice specifically distinct, so long as their
				individual dissimilitudes exclude none of them from the
				specific definitions.</p>
            <pb id="v.1.p.342"/>
            <p>Those things now which are very commonly discoursed
				of, and of which I know thou hast had the exact history
				and knowledge from solid books, I will at present omit,
				unless there be some public and recorded matters worth
				your hearing, which have escaped the historians of former
				times.</p>
            <p>And seeing that many worthy things, both public and
				private, have been done by women, it is not amiss to give
				a brief historical account of those that are public, in the
				first place.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="chapter" n="1">
            <head>EXAMPLE 1. <hi rend="italics">Of the Trojan Women.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Of those that escaped at the taking of Troy the most
					part were exercised with much tempestuous weather, and
					being inexperienced in navigation and unacquainted with
					the sea, they were wafted over into Italy; and about the
					river Tiber they made a very narrow escape by putting
					into such ports and havens as they could meet with.
					Whilst the men went about the country to enquire after
					pilots, there fell out a discourse among the women, that for
					a people as fortunate and happy as they had been, any fixed
					habitation on the land was better than perpetual wandering
					over the sea; and that they must make a new country for
					themselves, seeing it was impossible to recover that which
					they had lost. Upon this, complotting together, they set
					fire on the ships, Roma (as they say) being one of the first
					in the attempt. But having done these things, they went to
					meet their husbands, who were running towards the sea to
					the relief of the ships; and fearing their indignation, they
					laid hold some of them on their husbands, and some on their
					kinsfolk, and fell a kissing them soundly; by which carriage
					they obtained their charitable reception. Wherefore it hath
					been formerly, and now remains to be a custom among the
					Romans, for the women to salute their kinsfolk that come
					unto them by kissing.</p>
            <pb id="v.1.p.343"/>
            <p>The Trojans as it seems, being sensible of the strait they
					were in, and having also made some experience of the natives entertaining them with much bounty and humanity,
					applauded the exploit of the women, and sat down by the
					Latins.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="chapter" n="2">
            <head>EXAMPLE 2. <hi rend="italics">Of the Phocian Women.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The action of the women of Phocis hath not fallen
					under the cognizance of any noted writer of that age, and
					vet there was never a more memorable deed of virtue
					wrought by women,&mdash;the which is attested by those
					famous sacred rites performed by the Phocians at Hyampolis, and by ancient decrees. The total history of
					the transaction is particularly recorded in the Life of
					Daiphantus.</p>
            <p>The story of those women is this. There was an implacable war between the Thessalians and the Phocians.
					For these (the Phocians) slew all the Thessalian governors
					and magistrates in the cities of Phocis in one day. Whereupon they (the Thessalians) slew two hundred and fifty
					Phocian hostages, and with their whole host marched up
					against them through Locris, publishing their resolution to
					spare no men that were of age, and to sell the women and
					children for slaves. Daiphantus therefore, the son of Bathyllius, a triumvir, governor of Phocis, persuaded the
					Phocian men themselves to go to meet the Thessalians in
					battle; but as for the women, together with their children,
					that they should assemble them from all the parts of Phocis into one place, which they should pile round with combustible matter, and should leave a watch, to whom they
					should give in charge, that if he perceived that the men
					were conquered, he should immediately set fire to the pile
					and burn all the bodies to ashes. The counsels were
					agreed to by sone, but one stands up and saith: It is just
					that these things be consented to by the women also, and
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.344"/>
					
					if they do not cheerfully submit to it, they should have no
					force offered to them. The account of this discourse being
					come to the women, they assembled together by themselves, and carried it by vote, and applauded Daiphantus
					as a man that best consulted the affairs of Phocis; they
					say also, that the children meeting together privately voted
					the same things. These matters being thus settled, the
					Phocians joining battle at Cleonae, a town of Hyampolis,
					got the victory. Hence the Grecians call this vote of the
					Phocian women Aponoia (the desperate resolve). And of
					all the festivals this of the Elaphebolia is the greatest,
					which they observe to Diana in Hyampolis to this day, in
					remembrance of this victory.</p>

         <div1 type="chapter" n="3">
            <head>EXAMPLE 3. <hi rend="italics">Of the Women of Chios.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The people of Chios possessed themselves of Leuconia
					upon this occasion following. A certain famous man of the
					nobles of Chios was married; whilst the bride was drawn
					in her chariot, King Hippoclus, an intimate friend of the
					bridegroom's, being present with the rest, and also fuddled
					and merry, leaped into the chariot, not designing any incivility, but only to keep up the usual custom and to make
					sport. However, the bridegroom's friends slew him. The
					effects of divine displeasure appearing against the people
					of Chios, and the oracle commanding them to slay the
					slayers of Hippoclus, they replied, We have all of us slain
					Hippoclus. The oracle commanded them all therefore to
					depart the city, if all did partake of the guilt. So that at
					length the principals, accessories, and abettors of the murder by any means whatsoever, being not a few in number
					nor feeble for strength, transplanted themselves into Leuconia, which the Chians had once taken from the Coroneans by the aid of the Erythraeans. Afterward a war arising
					between them and the Erythraeans, by far the most potent
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.345"/>
					
					people among the Ionians, when the latter invaded Leuco
					nia, the men of Chios were not able to defend themselves
					and came to an agreement to depart upon these terms
					that every one should take with him only one cloak and
					one coat, and nothing else. But the women of Chios upbraided them as mean-spirited men, that they would lay
					down their weapons and go naked men through their
					enemies. And when they made answer that they were
					sworn so to do, they charged them not to leave their
					weapons behind them, but to say to their adversaries, that
					the spear is a cloak and the buckler a coat to every man
					of courage. The men of Chios being persuaded to these
					things, and emboldening themselves courageously against
					the Erythraeans, and showing their weapons, the Erythraeans were amazed at their audacity, and none opposed
					or hindered them, but were glad of their departure. These
					men therefore, being taught courage by the women in this
					manner, made a safe escape.</p>
            <p>Many years after this there was another exploit, nothing
					inferior to this in fortitude, performed by the women of
					Chios. When Philip, the son of Demetrius, besieged the
					city, he set forth a barbarous and insolent proclamation,
					inviting the servants to a defection upon promise of liberty
					and marriage of their mistresses, saying that he would give
					them their masters' wives into their possession. At this
					the women were dreadfully and outrageously incensed; and
					also the servants were no less provoked to indignation, and
					were ready to assist. Therefore they rushed forth furiously
					and ascended the wall, bringing stones and darts, encouraging and animating the soldiers; so that in the end these
					women discomfited and repulsed the enemy, and caused
					Philip to raise his siege, while not so much as one servant
					fell off to him.</p>

            <head>EXAMPLE 4. <hi rend="italics">Of the Argive Women.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Of all the renowned actions performed by women, none
					was more famous than the fight with Cleomenes in the
					country of Argos, whom Telesilla the poetess by her influence defeated. This woman they say was of an honorable family, but had a sickly body; she therefore sent to
					consult the oracle concerning her health. Answer was made,
					that she must be a servant to the Muses. Accordingly she
					becomes obedient to the Goddess, applying herself to poetry
					and music; her distempers left her, and she became the mirror of women in the art of poetry. Now when Cleomenes,
					king of the Spartans, having slain many Argives (but not
					so many as some fabulously reported, to wit, 7,777),
					marched up against the city, the youthful women were (as
					it were) divinely inspired with desperate resolution and
					courage to repulse the enemies out of their native country.</p>
            <p>They take arms under the conduct of Telesilla, they
					place themselves upon the battlements, they crown the
					walls, even to the admiration of the enemy; they by a sally
					beat off Cleomenes, with the slaughter of many of his men;
					and as for the other king, Demaratus (as Socrates saith),
					he having entered the city and possessed him of the socalled Pamphyliacum, they beat him out. In this manner
					the city being preserved, those women that were slain in
					the engagement they buried by the Argive road; to them
					that escaped they gave the honor of erecting the statue of
					Mars, in perpetual memorial of their bravery. Some say
					this fight was on the seventh day of the month; others say
					it was on the first day of the month, which is now called
					the fourth and was anciently called Hermaeus by the Argives; upon which day, even to this time, they perform
					their Hybristica (i.e., their sacred rites of incivility), clothing the women with men's coats and cloaks, but the men
					with women's veils and petticoats. To repair the scarcity
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.347"/>
					
					of men, they admitted not slaves, as Herodotus saith, but
					the best sort of the adjacent inhabitants to be citizens, and
					married them to the widows; and these the women thought
					meet to reproach and undervalue at bed and board, as worse
					than themselves; whence there was a law made, that married women should wear beards when they lay with their
					husbands.</p>

            <head>EXAMPLE 5. <hi rend="italics">Of the Persian Women.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Cyrus, causing the Persians to revolt from King Astyages and the Medes, was overcome in battle; and the
					Persians retreating by flight into the city, the enemy pursued so close that they had almost fallen into the city with
					them. The women ran out to meet them before the city,
					plucking up their petticoats to their middle, saying, Ye
					vilest varlets among men, whither so fast? Ye surely cannot find a refuge in these parts, from whence ye came
					forth. The Persians blushing for shame at the sight and
					speech, and rebuking themselves, faced about, and renewing the fight routed their enemies. Hence a law was
					enacted, that when the king enters the city, every woman
					should receive a piece of gold; and this law Cyrus made.
					And they say that Ochus, being in other kinds a naughty
					and covetous king, would always, when he came, compass
					the city and not enter it, and so deprive the women of
					their largess; but Alexander entered twice, and gave all
					the women with child a double benevolence</p>

            </head>
            <p>There arose a very grievous and irreconcilable contention among the Celts, before they passed over the Alps to
					inhabit that tract of Italy which now they inhabit, which
					proceeded to a civil war. The women placing themselves
					between the armies, took up the controversies, argued
					them so accurately, and determined them so impartially,
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.348"/>
					
					that an admirable friendly correspondence and general
					amity ensued, both civil and domestic. Hence the Celts
					made it their practice to take women into consultation
					about peace or war, and to use them as mediators in any
					controversies that arose between them and their allies. In
					the league therefore made with Hannibal, the writing runs
					thus: If the Celts take occasion of quarrelling with the
					Carthaginians, the governors and generals of the Carthaginians in Spain shall decide the controversy; but if the
					Carthaginians accuse the Celts, the Celtic women shall be
					judges.</p>

         <div1 type="chapter" n="7">
            <head>EXAMPLE 7. <hi rend="italics">Of the Melian Women.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The Melians standing in need of a larger country constituted Nymphaeus, a handsome man and marvellously
					comely, the commander for the transplanting of the colony.
					The oracle enjoined them to continue sailing till they cast
					away their ships, and there to pitch their colony. It happened that, when they arrived at Caria and went ashore,
					their ships were broken to pieces by a storm. Some of
					the Carians which dwelt at Cryassus, whether commiserating their distressed condition or dreading their resolution,
					invited them to dwell in their neighborhood, and bestowed
					upon them a part of their country; but then observing
					their marvellous increase in a little time, they conspired to
					cut them off by treachery, and provided a feast and great
					entertainment for that end and purpose. But it came to
					pass that a certain virgin in Caria, whose name was
					Caphene, fell in love with Nymphaeus. While these
					things were in agitation, she could not endure to connive
					at the destruction of her beloved Nymphaeus, and therefore acquainted him privately with the conspiracy of the
					citizens against him. When the Cryassians came to invite
					them, Nymphaeus made this answer: It isnot the custom
					of the Greeks to go to a feast without their wives. The
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.349"/>
					
					Carians hearing this requested them also to bring their
					wives; and so explaining the whole transaction to the
					Melians, he charged the men to go without armor in plain
					apparel, but that every one of the women should carry a
					dagger stuck in her bosom, and that each should take her
					place by her husband. About the middle of supper, their
					signal token was given to the Carians; the point of time
					also the Grecians were sensible of. Accordingly the
					women laid open their bosoms, and the men laid hold of
					the daggers, and sheathing them in the barbarians, slew
					them all together. And possessing themselves of the
					country, they overthrew that city, and built another, which
					they called New Cryassus. Moreover, Caphene being
					married to Nymphaeus received due honor and grateful
					acknowledgments becoming her good services. Here the
					taciturnity and courage of women is worthy of admiration,
					that none of them among so many did so much as unwittingly, by reason of fear, betray their trust.</p>

         <div1 type="chapter" n="8">
            <head>EXAMPLE 8. <hi rend="italics">Of the Tyrrhene Women.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>At the time when the Tyrrhenians inhabited the islands
					Lemnos and Imbros, they violently seized upon some Athenian women from Brauron, on whom they begat children,
					which children the Athenians banished from the islands as
					mixed barbarians. But these arriving at Taenarum were
					serviceable to the Spartans in the Helotic war, and therefore obtained the privilege of citizens and marriage, but
					were not dignified with magistracies or admitted to the
					senate; for they had a suspicion that they would combine
					together in order to some innovation, and conceived they
					might shake the present established government. Wherefore the Lacedaemonians, seizing on them and securing
					them, shut them up close prisoners, seeking to take them
					off by evident and strong convictions. But the wives of
					the prisoners, gathering together about the prison, by many
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.350"/>
					
					supplications prevailed with the jailers that they might be
					admitted to go to salute their husbands and speak with
					them. As soon as they came in, they required them to
					change their clothes immediately and leave them to their
					wives; while the men, apparelled in their wives' habits,
					should go forth. These things being effected, the women
					stayed behind, prepared to endure all hard usages of the
					prison, but the deluded keepers let out the men as if they
					had been their wives. Whereupon they seized upon Taygeta, exciting the Helotic people to revolt, and taking them
					to their aid; but the Spartans, alarmed by these things into
					a great consternation, by a herald proclaimed a treaty of
					peace. And they were reconciled upon these conditions,
					that they should receive their wives again, and furnished
					with ships and provisions should make an expedition by
					sea, and possessing themselves of a land and a city elsewhere should be accounted a colony and allies of the Lacedaemonians. These things did the Pelasgians, taking
					Pollis for their captain and Crataedas his brother, both
					Lacedaemonians, and one part of them took up their seat
					in Melos; but the most part of them, which were shipped with
					Pollis, sailed into Crete, trying the truth of the oracles, by
					whom they were told that, when they should lose their
					Goddess and their anchor, then they should put an end to
					their roving and there build a city. Wherefore, putting
					into harbor on that part of Crete called Chersonesus, panic
					fears fell upon them by night, at which coming under a
					consternation, they leaped tumultuously on board their
					ships, leaving on shore for haste the statue of Diana, which
					was their patrimony brought from Brauron to Lemnos, and
					from Lemnos carried about with them wherever they went.
					The tumult being appeased, when they had set sail, they
					missed this statue; and at the same time Pollis, finding
					that his anchor had lost one of its beards (for the anchor,
					having been dragged, as appeared, through some rocky
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.351"/>
					
					place, was accidentally torn), said that the oracular answer
					of the Pythia was accomplished. Therefore he gave a sign
					to tack about, and accordingly made an inroad into that
					country, conquered those that opposed him in many battles,
					sat down at Lyctus, and brought many other cities to be
					tributary to him. And now they repute themselves to
					be akin to the Athenians on their mothers' side, and to be
					Spartan colonies.</p>

            <p>That which is reported to have fallen out in Lycia,
					although it be fabulous, hath yet common fame attesting
					it. Amisodarus, as they say, whom the Lycians call Isaras,
					came from a colony of the Lycians about Zeleia, bringing
					with him pirate ships, which Chimarrhus, a warlike man,
					who was also savage and brutish, was commander of. He
					sailed in a ship which had a lion carved on her head and a
					dragon on her stern. He did much mischief to the Lycians,
					so that they could not sail on the sea nor inhabit the towns
					nigh the sea-coast.</p>
            <p>This man Bellerophon pursued with his Pegasus and
					slew him, and also defeated the Amazons, for which he
					obtained no due requital, but lobates the king was most

					unfruitful; and having said his prayers, he faced about.
					Upon which the waves of the sea arose and overwhelmed

					it was not by execrations that he brought up the sea; but
					the fattest part of the plain lying lower than the sea, and
					a certain ridge extending itself all along the shore which
					beat off the sea, Bellerophon broke through this, so that
					the sea forcibly flowed in and overwhelmed the plain; and
					when the men by their humble addresses obtained nothing,
					the women assembling about him in multitudes gained respect from him and pacified his wrath. Some tell us that
					the celebrated Chimaera was a mountain opposite to the
					sun, which caused reflections of the sun's beams, and in
					summer ardent and fiery heats, which spread over the
					plain and withered the fruits; and Bellerophon, finding out
					the reason of the mischief, cut through the smoothest part
					of the cliff, which especially caused these reflections. But
					on seeing that he was treated ungratefully, his indignation
					was excited to take vengeance on the Lycians, but was appeased by the women. The reason which Nymphis (in the
					fourth book concerning Heraclea) doth assign is to me not
					at all fabulous; for he saith, when Bellerophon slew a certain wild boar, which destroyed the cattle and fruits in the
					province of the Xanthians, and received no due reward of
					his service, he prayed to Neptune for vengeance, and obtained that all the fields should cast forth a salt dew and
					be universally corrupted, the soil becoming bitter; which
					continued till he, condescendingly regarding the women suppliants, prayed to Neptune, and removed his wrath from
					them. Hence there was a law among the Xanthians, that
					they should not for the future derive their names from their
					fathers, but from their mothers.</p>

            <p>When Hannibal, the son of Barca, besieged the great

					Romans, at the first assault the besieged citizens were 
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.353"/>
					
					surprised with fear, insomuch that they consented to grant him
					his demands, and to give him three hundred talents of silver and three hundred hostages. Upon which he raised his
					siege; when they changed their minds, and would not perform any thing that they had promised. Wherefore returning again to his siege, he gave command to his soldiers to
					take the city by storm, and fall to the plundering their
					goods. At this the barbarians, struck universally into a
					panic fear, came to terms of composition, for the free citizens to depart the city with their clothes to their backs,
					but to leave their weapons, goods, slaves, and city behind
					them. Now the women supposed that, although the enemies would strictly search every man as he departed, yet
					the women would go untouched. Accordingly, taking scimitars and hiding them under their coats, they fell in with
					the men as they marched out. When they were all gone
					out of the city, Hannibal sets a guard of Masaesylian soldiers, fixing their post without the gate, but the rest of his
					army fell promiscuously into the city to plunder. But the
					Masaesylians, seeing them busy in carrying away much
					spoil, were not able any longer to refrain or to mind the
					charge of their watch, taking it heinously that that was
					their lot, and therefore left their post and went to take their
					share of the booty. Upon this the women raised a shout
					to animate their husbands, and delivered the scimitars
					into their hands, and they themselves some of them fell
					upon the sentinels; insomuch that one of them, snatching
					away the spear of Banon the interpreter, smote him with
					it, though he was armed with a breastplate. And as for
					the rest, the men routed and put some to flight and slew
					others, making their escape by charging through them in
					a great body together with the women. Hannibal, being
					made acquainted with these things, pursued them, and those
					he took he slew; but some betaking themselves to the

            <p>The injury done to Lucretia and her great virtue were
					the causes of banishing Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh
					Roman king from Romulus, she being married to an illustrious man, one of the royal race. She was ravished by
					one of Tarquin's sons, who was in a way of hospitality
					entertained by her; and after she had acquainted her
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.356"/>
					
					friends and family with the abuse offered her, she immediately slew herself. Tarquinius having fallen from his dominion, after many battles that he fought in attempting to
					regain his kingly government, at last prevailed with Porsena, prince'of the Etrurians, to encamp against Rome
					with a powerful army. Whereupon the Romans, being
					pressed with war and famine at the same time, likewise knowing that Porsena was not only a great soldier
					but a just and civil person, resolved to refer the matters
					against Tarquinius to him as a judge. This proposal Tarquinius obstinately refused to consent unto, saying that
					Porsena could not be a just arbitrator if he did not remain
					constant to his military alliance. Whereupon Porsena left
					him to himself, and made it his endeavor to depart a friend
					to the Romans, on condition of having restored to him
					the tracts of land they had cut off from the Etrurians and the
					captives they had taken. Upon these accepted conditions
					hostages being given,&mdash;ten male children,'and ten females
					(among whom was Valeria, the daughter of Publicola the
					consul),&mdash;he immediately ceased his warlike preparations
					before the articles of agreement were quite finished. Now
					the virgin hostages going down to the river, as if they intended only to wash themselves a little further than ordinary from the camp, there, by the instigation of one of
					them whose name was Cloelia, wrapping their garments
					about their heads, they cast themselves into that great river
					Tiber, and assisting one another, swam through those vast
					depths with much labor and difficulty. There are some
					who say that Cloelia compassing a horse got upon him,
					and passing over gently before, the rest swimming after her,
					conducted, encouraged, and assisted them; the argument
					they use for this we shall declare anon.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Romans saw the maids had made such a

					resolution, but did not approve of their return, not abiding
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.357"/>
					
					to be worse in their faith than any one man; therefore
					they charged the maids to return back, and sent them away
					with a safe conduct. Tarquinius laid wait for them as they
					passed the river, and wanted but little of intercepting the
					virgins. But Valeria with three of her household servants
					made her flight to the camp of Porsena; and as for the rest,
					Aruns, Porsena's son, gave them speedy help and delivered
					them from the enemies. When they were brought, Porsena looking upon them commanded them to tell him
					which of them advised and first attempted this enterprise;
					all of them being surprised with fear, except Cloelia, were
					silent, but she said, that she was the author of it; at which
					Porsena, mightily surprised, commanded an horse curiously
					adorned with trappings should be brought, which he gave
					to Cloelia, and dismissed them all with much generosity
					and civility; and this is the ground which many make of
					saying that Cloelia passed through the river on horseback.
					Others deny this story, but yet say that Porsena admiring
					the undauntedness and confidence of the maid, as being
					beyond what is commonly in a woman, bestowed a present

            </head>
            <p>Aristotimus having usurped tyranny over the people
					of Elis in Peloponnesus, against whom he prevailed by
					the aid of King Antigonus, used not his power with any
					meekness or moderation. For he was naturally a savage
					man; and being in servile fear of a band of mixed barbarians, who guarded his person and his government, he connived at many injurious and cruel things which his subjects
					suffered at their hands, among which was the calamity of
					Philodemus. This man had a beautiful daughter, whose
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.358"/>
					
					name was Micca. This maid one of the tyrant's captains
					of auxiliaries, called Lucius, attempted to lie with, more
					out of a design to debauch her than for any love he had
					to her; and for this end he sent to fetch her to him. The
					parents verily seeing the strait they were in advised her to
					go; but the maid, being of a generous and courageous
					spirit, clasped about her father, beseeching him with earnest
					entreaties that he would rather see her put to death than
					that her virginity should be filthily and wickedly violated.
					Some delay being made, Lucius himself starts up in the
					midst of his cups, enraged with wrath and lust, and drunk
					with wine; and finding Micca laying her head on her
					father's knees, he instantly commanded her to go along
					with him; but she refusing, he rent off her clothes, and
					whipped her stark naked, she stoutly enduring the smart
					in silence. When her father and mother perceived that
					by their tears they could not avail or bring any succor to
					her, they turned to imploring the help of both Gods and
					men, as persons that were oppressed by the most cruel and
					unrighteous proceedings. But this barbarous fellow, drunk
					and raging every way with madness, ran the maid through
					as she lay with her, face in her father's bosom. Neither
					was the tyrant affected with these cruelties, but slew many
					and sent more into exile; for they say eight hundred took
					their flight into Aetolia, petitioning the tyrant that their
					wives and children might come to them. A little after he
					made proclamation, permitting the women that would to go
					to their husbands, carrying with them all their household
					goods that they pleased; but when he perceived that all
					the women received the proclamation with pleasure (for the
					number was above six hundred), he charged them all to go
					in great companies on the appointed day, as if he intended to
					consult for their safety. When the day came, they crowded
					at the gates with their goods packed up, carrying their
					children, some in their arms and some in carts, and stayed
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.359"/>
					
					for one another. All on a sudden many of the tyrant's
					creatures made towards them in great haste, crying aloud
					to them to stay, while they were yet at great distance
					from them; and as they approached, they charged the
					women to return back. Likewise turning about their
					chariots and carts, they forced them upon them, drove the
					horses through the midst of them without fear or wit, suffering the women neither to follow nor to stay, nor to
					reach forth any help to the perishing infants, some of
					whom were killed falling out of the carts, others run over
					by the carts. So they drove them in (as so many sheep
					which butchers drive along), hauling and whipping them
					as they thronged upon one another, till they had crowded
					them all into a prison; but their goods they returned to
					Aristotimus. The people of Elis taking these things very
					heinously, the priestesses devoted to Bacchus (which they
					call the Sixteen), taking with them their suppliant boughs
					and wreaths belonging to the service of their God, went to
					meet Aristotimus in the market-place; the guards, out of a
					reverential awe, stood off and gave way to their approach.
					These priestesses stood still at first with silence, solemnly
					reaching forth their supplicatory rods; but as soon as they
					appeared as petitioners and deprecators of his wrath against
					the women, he fell into a great rage at the guards, exclaiming against them that they had suffered the priestesses to
					approach his presence, and he caused some to be thrust
					away, others to be beaten and dragged through the marketplace, and fined them two talents apiece.</p>
            <p>These things being transacted in this manner, one Hellanicus moved a conspiracy against this tyrant. He was a
					man who, by reason of old age and the loss of two sons
					by death, was unsuspected of the tyrant, as being altogether
					unlikely for action. In the mean time also the exiles waft
					themselves over from Aetolia, and take Amymona, a very
					convenient place on the borders to entrench a camp in,
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.360"/>
					
					where they received great numbers of the citizens who
					made their escape by flight from Elis. Aristotimus being
					startled at these things went in to the imprisoned women,
					and thinking to work them to his pleasure more by fear
					than by favor, charged them to send letters to their husbands, enjoining them to depart out of the coasts; if they
					would not write, he threatened them to slay their children
					before their eyes, and then put them (the mothers) to
					death by torments. Whilst he was long provoking and
					urging them to declare whether they would obey his mandates or not, most of them answered him nothing, but
					looked with silence one upon another, signifying by nods
					and gestures that they were not at all affrighted at his
					threat. But Megisto the wife of Timocleon, who both in
					respect of her husband and her own excellent accomplishments carried the port of a princess among them, would
					not vouchsafe to rise off her seat to him nor permit the
					rest so to do, but as she sat, she gave him this answer:&mdash;</p>
            <p>
               <q direct="unspecified">Verily if thou wert a discreet man, thou wouldst not
					after this manner discourse with women about their husbands, but wouldst send to them as to our lords, finding
					out better language than that by which thou hast deluded
					us. But if thou thyself despairest to prevail with them,
					and therefore undertakest to trepan them by our means, do
					not hope to put a cheat upon us again. And may they
					never be guilty of such baseness, that for the saving their
					wives and little ones they will desert that liberty of their
					native country; for it is not so great a prejudice to them
					to lose us, whom even now they are deprived of, as it
					will be benefit to set the subjects at liberty from thy
					cruelty and oppression.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Aristotimus, being not able to refrain himself at this
					speech of Megisto, required that her son should be
					brought, as if it were to slay him before her eyes; but
					whilst the officer was seeking out the child, that was in the
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.361"/>
					
					company of other children playing and wrestling together,
					his mother called him by his name, and said: Come hither,
					my child; before thou hast any sense and understanding,
					be thou delivered from bitter tyranny; for it would be
					much more grievous to me to see thee basely enslaved
					than to see thee die. At which Aristotimus drawing his
					sword upon the mother herself, and transported with rage,
					was going to fall upon her, when one of his favorites, Cylon
					by name (esteemed his trusty confidant, but in reality a
					hater of him, and a confederate with Hellanicus in the conspiracy), put a stop to him, and averted him in an humble
					manner, telling him: This is an ignoble and woman-like
					carriage, not at all becoming a person of a princely mind
					and a statesman. Hereupon Aristotimus scarcely coming
					to his senses departed. Now observe what an ominous
					prodigy happened to him. It was about noon, when he
					was taking some repose, his wife sitting by; and whilst his
					servants were providing dinner, an eagle was seen in the
					air floating over the house, which did, as it were considerately and on purpose, let fall a stone of an handsome bigness upon that part of the roof of the house which was
					over the apartment where Aristotimus lay. At the same
					time there was also a great rattling from above, together
					with an outcry made by the people that were abroad looking upon the bird. Upon which Aristotimus, falling into
					a great consternation and examining the matter, sent and
					called his soothsayer which he usually consulted in his
					public concerns, and being in great perplexity, desired to
					be satisfied what that prodigy meant. The soothsayer bade
					him be of good cheer, for it signified that Jupiter now
					wakened and assisted him. But to the citizens that he
					could confide in he said, that vengeance would no longer
					be delayed from falling on the tyrant's head. Wherefore
					it was concluded by Hellanicus and his friends not to defer
					any longer, but to bring matters to an issue the next day.</p>
            <pb id="v.1.p.362"/>
            <p>At night Hellanicus imagined in his sleep that he saw one
					of his dead sons stand by him saying, What is the matter
					with thee, O father! that thou sleepest To-morrow thou
					shalt be governor of this city. Being animated by his
					vision, he encouraged the rest concerned with him. Now
					Aristotimus was informed that Craterus, coming to his aid
					with great forces, was encamped in Olympia; upon which
					he became so confidently secure, that he ventured to go
					without his guards into the market-place, Cylon only accompanying him. Wherefore Hellanicus, observing this
					opportunity, did not think good to give the signal to those
					that were to undertake the enterprise with him, but with a
					clear voice and lifting up both his hands, he spake saying:
					O ye good men! why do ye delay? Here is a fair theatre
					in the midst of your native country for you to contend in
					for the prize of valor. Whereupon Cylon in the first
					place drawing his sword smote one of Aristotimus's waiting gentlemen; but Thrasybulus and Lampis making a
					brisk opposition, Aristotimus escaped by flight into the
					temple of Jupiter. Here slaying him, they dragged forth
					his corpse into the market-place, and proclaimed liberty to
					the citizens. Neither were the men there much before the
					women, who immediately ran forth with joyful acclamations,
					environing the men and binding triumphant garlands about
					their heads. The multitude presently rushed on upon the
					tyrant's palace, where his wife shutting herself into her
					bed-chamber hanged herself. He had also two daughters,
					maidens of most beautiful complexions, ripe for marriage.
					Those they laid hands on, and haled forth, with a desperate resolution to slay them, but first to torment and abuse
					them. But Megisto, with the rest of the women, meeting
					them called out with a loud voice: Will they perpetrate
					such enormities who reckon themselves a free people, in
					imitation of the practices of audacious and libidinous
					tyrants? The multitude reverencing the gravity of this
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.363"/>
					
					matron, pleading with them so undauntedly as also affectionately with tears, they resolved to lay aside this opprobrious way of proceeding, and to cause them to die by
					their own hands. As they were therefore returned into
					the chamber, they required the maids immediately to be
					their own executioners. Muro, the eldest, untying her
					girdle and tying it about her neck, saluted her sister, and
					exhorted her to be careful and do whatever she saw her
					do; lest (as she said) we come to our death in a base and
					unworthy manner. But the younger desiring it might be
					her lot to die first, she delivered her the girdle, saying: I
					did never deny thee any thing thou didst ever desire,
					neither will I now; take this favor also. I am resolved to
					bear and endure that which is more grievous than death to
					me, to see my most dear sister die before me. Upon this,
					when she had instructed her sister how to put the girdle
					so as to strangle her, and perceived her dead, she took her
					down and covered her. And now the eldest sister, whose
					turn was next, besought Megisto to take care of her, and
					not suffer her to lie indecently after she was dead. So that
					there was not any one present that was so bitter and
					vehement a tyrant-hater that he did not lament and compassionate these maidens upon their brave and virtuous
					behavior.</p>
            <p>Of the innumerable famous exploits performed by women, these examples may suffice. But as for their particular virtues, we will describe them according as they
					offer themselves scattered here and there, not supposing

					Now there was at Myus Pythes, a renowned man among

            <p>A war arose between the Naxians and Milesians upon

					For she fell in love with Promedon a Naxian, who was

					and placed her a supplicant to Vesta. The Naxians not
					restoring her upon demand, for the sake of Promedon and
					making her devotion to Vesta their pretence, a war arose.
					To the assistance of the Milesians came in many others;
					and of the Ionians the Erythraeans were most ready. So
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.365"/>
					
					that this war was of long continuance, and had great calamities attending it. But as it was begun by the lewdness of
					a woman, so it was ended by a woman's policy. Diognetus,
					a colonel of the Erythraeans, holding a fortification committed to his keeping, which was cast up against the Naxians, lying naturally to great advantage and well furnished
					with ammunition, took great spoils from the Naxians; yea,
					he captivated both free married women and virgins; with
					one of which, called Polycrita, he fell in love, and treated
					her not as a captive but after the manner of a married wife.
					Now a festival coming in turn to be celebrated among the
					Milesians in the camp, and all of them given to their cups
					and luxury, Polycrita petitioned Diognetus that he would
					be pleased to permit her to send some part of the cakes to
					her brethren. He permitting and bidding her do it, she
					thrust into a cake a piece of lead engraven with writing,
					and commanded the bearer to say to her brethren that they
					alone by themselves should eat up what she had sent. Accordingly they met with the plate of lead, and read Polycrita's hand-writing, advising them that night to fall upon
					their enemies, who, by reason of excess caused by their
					feastings, were overcome with wine and therefore in a careless secure condition. They acquainted the officers with it,
					and urged them to accompany them forth against the enemies. Upon engagement the stronghold being gotten and
					many slain, Polycrita by entreaty of her countrymen obtained
					the life of Diognetus and preserved him. But she being
					met by her countrymen at the gate, who received her with
					acclamations of joy and garlands, and greatly applauded
					her deed, could not bear the greatness of the joy, but died,
					falling down at the gate of the citadel, where she was
					buried; and it is called the Sepulchre of Envy, as though
					some envious fortune had grudged Polycrita the fruition of
					so great honor. And thus do the Naxian writers declare
					the history. But Aristotle saith, that Polycrita was not
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.366"/>
					
					taken captive, but that by some other way or means Diognetus seeing her fell in love with her, and was ready to give
					and do all that he could for the enjoying her. Polycrita
					promised to consent to him, provided she might obtain one

            </head>
            <p>There were two brethren, Phobus and Blepsus, twins of
					the stock of Codrus, natives of Phocaea; of which two
					Phobus, the elder, threw himself from the Leucadian rocks
					into the sea, as Charon of Lampsacus hath told us in history. This Phobus, having potency and royal dignity, took
					a voyage into Parium upon the account of his own private
					concerns; and becoming a friend and guest to Mandron
					king of the Bebrycians, the same that were called Pituoessans, he aided and assisted him in the war against those of
					the bordering inhabitants that molested him. So that when
					Phobus was returning back by sea, Mandron showed great
					civility to him, promising to give him a part of his country
					and city, if he would bring over the Phocaeans and plant
					them as inhabitants in Pituoessa. Phobus therefore persuading his countrymen sent his brother to conduct them
					over as planters, and likewise the obligation was performed
					on Mandron's part according to expectation. But the
					Phocaeans taking great booty, prey, and spoils from the
					neighboring barbarians, were first envied, and afterwards
					became a terror to the Bebrycians; and therefore they desired
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.367"/>
					
					 to be rid of them. As for Mandron, being an honest
					and righteous person, they could not possess him against
					the Grecians; but he taking a long journey, they provided
					to destroy the Phocaeans by treachery. Mandron had a
					daughter called Lampsace, a virgin, who was acquainted
					with the plot; and first she endeavored to take off her
					friends and familiars from it, admonishing them what a
					dreadful and ungodly enterprise they were going upon,&mdash;to
					murder men that were benefactors, military auxiliaries, and
					now citizens. But when she could not prevail with them,
					she declared to the Grecians secretly what was plotting,
					and wished them to stand upon their guard. Upon this,
					the Phocaeans provided a sacrifice and feast, and invited
					the Pituoessans into the suburbs; on which, dividing themselves into two parts, with one they surprised the walls of
					the city, with the other they slew the men. Thus taking
					the city, they sent to Mandron, desiring him to join with
					their own rulers in the government. As for Lampsace,
					she died of a sickness, and they buried her sumptuously,
					and called the city Lampsace after her name. But when
					Mandron, avoiding all suspicion of betraying his people.
					refused to come to dwell among them, and desired this
					favor at their hands, that they would send him the wives
					and children of the deceased, the Phocaeans most readily
					sent them, offering them no injury at all. And ascribing
					in the first place heroic renown to Lampsace, in the last
					place they decreed a sacrifice to her as a Goddess, which
					they continue yearly to offer.</p>

            <head>EXAMPLE 19. <hi rend="italics">Aretaphila.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Aretaphila, a Cyrenaean, was not of ancient time, but
					lived in the time of the Mithridatic war. She arrived at
					such a degree of fortitude and experience in counsel as
					might be compared with the conduct of any heroic ladies.
					She was the daughter of Aeglator and the wife of Phaedimus,
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.368"/>
					
					 both renowned men. She was a great beauty, excelling in discretion, and was not unacquainted with the most
					knotty pieces of policy; but the common disasters of her
					native country rendered her famous. Nicocrates, having
					then usurped the tyranny over the Cyrenaeans, not only
					murdered many other citizens, but also assassinated Melanippus, a priest of Apollo, with his own hand, and held the
					priesthood himself. He slew also Phaedimus, the husband
					of Aretaphila, and married Aretaphila against her will.
					Unto a thousand other villanies he added this, that he set
					guards at the gates, who mangled the dead corpses as they
					were carrying forth, pricking them with their daggers and
					clapping hot irons to them, lest any citizen should be carried out privily under pretence of being a dead corpse.
					Aretaphila's own proper calamities were very grievous to
					her, although the tyrant, for the love that he bare to her,
					suffered her to enjoy a great part of his regal power; for
					his love had subdued him unto her, and to her alone was
					he gentle and manageable, being very rude and savage in
					his behavior to others. But that which troubled her more
					than other things was to see her miserable country suffering such horrid things in so base a manner; one citizen
					being slaughtered after another, without any hopes of a
					vindictive justice from any. The exiles also were altogether
					enfeebled, affrighted, and scattered here and there. Aretaphila therefore supposed herself to be the only hope
					remaining for the state; and emulating the famous and
					brave enterprises of Thebe of Pherae, although she was
					destitute of the faithful friends and helpers which circumstances afforded to Thebe, she laid a plan to despatch her
					husband by poison. But in setting herself about it, providing the materials, and trying many experiments with
					poisons, the matter could not be hid, but was discovered;
					and there being proof made of the attempt, Calbia, Nicocrates's mother, being naturally of a murdering implacable
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.369"/>
					
					spirit, presently adjudged Aretaphila to torments and then
					to death. But love abated the rage of Nicocrates, and put
					him upon delay; and the vigorous manner in Which Aretaphila met the accusation and defended herself gave some
					plausible ground for his hesitation. But when she was
					convicted by the clearest proofs, and the preparation she
					had made for the poison was even in sight, admitting no
					denial, she confessed that she provided poison, but not
					deadly poison. But truly, O sir, she said, I am contending
					for matters of great concern, no less indeed than the honor
					and power which by thy gracious favor I reap the fruit of.
					I am maligned by many ill women, whose poisons and
					treacheries I stand in fear of, and therefore have been persuaded to contrive something on the other side in my own
					defence. These are haply foolish and woman-like plots,
					but not such as deserve death, unless it seem good to thee
					as judge to take away thy wife's life on account of lovepotions and charms, which she has used because she wishes
					to be loved by thee more than thou wouldst have her.
					Notwithstanding this defence which Aretaphila had made
					for herself, Nicocrates thought good to commit her to torments; and Calbia presided in the judicature, rigid and
					inexorable. But Aretaphila bore up invincibly under her
					tortures, till Calbia herself was tired, sore against her will.
					But Nicocrates being pacified discharged her, and was sorry
					he had tortured her. And it was not very long ere he went
					in again unto her, being highly transported with affection,
					renewing his favor towards her with honors and courteous
					behavior. But she would not be brought under by flattery,
					who had held out so stoutly under tortures and pains; and
					an emulation of victory, conjoined with the love of honesty,
					made her betake herself to other measures.</p>
            <p>She had a daughter marriageable, an excellent beauty.
					Her she presented for a bait to the tyrant's brother, a young
					stripling and lasciviously addicted. There was a report,
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.370"/>
					
					that Aretaphila used such enchantments and witchcrafts
					towards the maid, that she plainly charmed and destroyed
					the young man's reason. He was called Leander. After
					he was entangled, he petitioned his brother and accomplished the marriage. Now the maid, being instructed by
					her mother, instigated and persuaded him to set the city at
					liberty, insinuating that he himself could not live long free
					under an arbitrary government, nor could he marry a wife
					or reserve her to himself. Also some friends, Aretaphila's
					favorites, suggested to him continually some accusations or
					surmises concerning his brother. But as soon as he perceived that Aretaphila was counselling and aiding in these
					matters, he undertook the business, and excited Daphnis
					a household servant, who slew Nicocrates by his command. In what followed, he attended not so much to
					Aretaphila, but presently manifested by his actions that he
					was rather a fratricide than a tyrannicide; for he managed
					his affairs perversely and foolishly. But yet he had some
					honor for Aretaphila, and she had some influence with him;
					neither did she manage any enmity or open opposition
					against him, but ordered her affairs privily. First of all,
					she stirred up an African war against him, and incited
					Anabus, a certain duke, to invade his borders and approach
					the city; and then she buzzed into Leander's head suspicions against the favorites and officers, saying that they
					were not forward to fight but rather ambitious of peace
					and tranquillity, which indeed (she said) the state of affairs
					and the security of his dominion required of him if he
					would hold his subjects in firm subjection; and she would
					effect a cessation of arms and bring Anabus to a parley with
					him, if he would permit it, before an incurable war should
					break forth. Leander gave her commission. First she
					treated with the African, and with the promise of great
					presents and treasures begged that he would seize Leander
					when he came to treat with him. The African was persuaded,
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.371"/>
					
					 but Leander was backward to it; only for the respect that he bore to Aretaphila, who said that she would
					be present, he went unarmed and unguarded. But as he
					came nigh and saw Anabus, he made a halt, and would
					have waited the coming of his guards; only Aretaphila
					being present sometimes encouraged him, sometimes reviled
					him. But at last, when he still hesitates, she undauntedly
					lays hold on him, and dragging him resolutely along, delivers him to the barbarian. He was immediately seized,
					confined, and bound, and kept prisoner by the African,
					until Aretaphila's friends, with other citizens, procured the
					treasures promised. Many people acquainted with this
					ran forth to the parley; and as soon as they saw Aretaphila, they were so transported that they had like to have
					forgot their indignation against the tyrant, and reckoned
					the punishing him of no great concern. But the first
					work after the enjoyment of their liberty was the saluting
					Aretaphila, between acclamations of joy and weeping, and
					falling down before her, as before the statue of one of the
					Gods. And the people flocked in one after another, so
					that they scarcely had time that evening to receive Leander again and return into the city. When they had satisfied themselves in honoring and applauding Aretaphila,
					they turned themselves to the tyrants; and Calbia they
					burnt alive, Leander they sewed up in a sack and threw
					him into the sea, but they voted that Aretaphila should
					bear her share in the government together with the statesmen, and be taken into counsel. But she, by great sufferings having acted a tragi-comedy consisting of various
					parts, and at last obtained the reward of the garland, as
					soon as she saw the city set at liberty, betook herself to
					her private apartment; and casting off all multiplicity of
					business, she led the rest of her time in spining, and
					finished her days in tranquillity among her friend and acquaintance.</p>

            </head>
            <p>There were two most potent persons among the tetrarchs
					of Galatia, allied by kin to each other, Sinatus and Synorix;
					one of which, Sinatus, took a maid to wife, Camma by name,
					very comely to behold for person and favor, but principally
					to be admired for virtue. For she was not only modest and
					loving to her husband, but discreet and of a generous mind.
					And by reason of her gentle and courteous behavior she
					was extremely acceptable to her inferiors; yea, that which
					rendered her more eminently renowned was, that being a
					priest of Diana (for the Galatians worship that goddess
					most) she did always appear magnificently adorned in all
					sacred processions and at the sacrifices. Wherefore Synorix, falling in love with her, could not prevail either by
					persuasions or violence, whilst her husband lived. He
					commits a horrid crime,&mdash;he slays Sinatus treacherously,
					&mdash;and not long after accosts Camma, whilst she abode
					within the temple, and bore Synorix's crime not in an abject and despondent manner, but with a mind intent upon
					revenge on Synorix, and only waiting an opportunity. He
					was importunate in his humble addresses, neither did he
					seem to use arguments that were without all show of honesty. For as in other things he pretended that he far excelled Sinatus, so he slew him for the love he bare to Camma
					and for no other wicked design. The woman's'denials were
					at first not very peremptory, and then by little and little she
					seemed to be softened towards him. Her familiars and
					friends also lay at her in the service and favor of Synorix,
					who was a man of great power, persuading and even forcing her. In fine therefore she consented, and accordingly
					sent for him to come to her, that the mutual contract and
					covenant might be solemnized in the presence of the Goddess. When he came, she received him with much courtesy, and bringing him before the altar and pouring out
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.373"/>
					
					some of the drink-offering upon the altar out of the bowls,
					part of the remainder she drank herself and part she gave
					him to drink. The cup was poisoned mead. As she saw
					him drink it all up, she lifted up a shrill loud voice, and fell
					down and worshipped her Goddess, saying: I call thee to
					witness, O most reverend Divinity! that for this very day's
					work's sake I have over-lived the murder of Sinatus, no
					otherwise taking any comfort in this part of my life but in
					the hope of revenge that I have had. And now I go down
					to my husband. And for thee, the lewdest person among
					men, let thy relations prepare a sepulchre, instead of a
					bride-chamber and nuptials. When the Galatian heard
					these things, and perceived the poison to wamble up and
					down and indispose his body, he ascended his chariot, hoping to be relieved by the jogging and shaking. But he
					presently alighted, and put himself into a litter, and died
					that evening. Camma continued all that night, and being
					told that he had ended his life, she comfortably and cheerfully expired.</p>

            <p>When Mithridates sent for sixty noblemen of Galatia as

					at. Poredorix, a man of a robust body and lofty mind, who
					was no less than tetrarch of the Tosiopae, designed to lay
					hold on Mithridates, seizing him when he should be determining causes on the bench of judicature in the gymnasium, and to force him bench and all into the ditch;
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.375"/>
					
					but by a certain chance he went not up to the place of
					judicature that day, but sent for the Galatians to come
					home to him to his house. Poredorix encouraged them all
					to be of good courage, and when they should be all come
					together there, to fall upon him on every side, slay him,
					and cut his body in pieces. This conspiracy was not unknown to Mithridates, an intimation of it being given him;
					accordingly he delivers up the Galatians one by one to
					be slain. But calling to mind a young man among them,
					who excelled in comeliness and beauty all whom he knew,
					he commiserated him and repented himself and was apparently grieved, supposing him slain among the first, and
					also sent his command, that if he were alive he should
					remain so. The young man's name was Bepolitanus. There
					was a strange accident befell this man. When he was apprehended, he had on very gay and rich apparel, which
					the executioner desired to preserve clean from being
					stained with blood; and undressing the young man leisurely, he saw the king's messengers running to him and
					calling out the name of the youth. So that covetousness,

					unburied, and none of his friends did dare to come near

            <p>Theagenes the Theban, who held the same sentiments
					with regard to his country's welfare with Epaminondas,
					Pelopidas, and the other most worthy Thebans, was slain in
					Chaeronea, in the common disaster of Greece, even then

					aloud to him, How far wilt thou pursue? Even (saith he)
					to Macedonia. When he was dead, his sister survived him,
					who gave testimony that he was nobly descended, and
					that he was naturally a great man and excellently accomplished. Moreover, this woman was so fortunate as to
					reap a great benefit by her prowess, so that the more
					public calamities fell upon her, so much the easier she
					bore them. For when Alexander took Thebes and the
					soldiers fell a plundering, some in one part and some in
					another, it happened that a man, neither civil nor sober
					but mischievous and mad, took up his quarters in Timoclea's house. He was a captain to a Thracian company,
					and the king's namesake, but nothing like him; for he
					having no regard either to the family or estate of this
					woman, when he had swilled himself in wine after supper,
					commanded her to come and lie with him. Neither ended
					he here, but enquired for gold and silver, whether she had
					not some hid by her; sometimes threatening as if he would
					kill her, sometimes flattering as if he would always repute
					her in the place of a wife. She, taking the occasion
					offered by him, said: <q direct="unspecified">Would God I had died before this
						night came, rather than lived to it; that though all other
						things had been lost, I might have preserved my body free
						from abuse. But now seeing it is thus come to pass, and
						Divine Providence hath thus disposed of it that I must
						repute thee my guardian, lord, and husband, I will not
						hold any thing from thee that is thine own. And as for
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.377"/>
						
						myself, I see I am at thy disposition. As for corporeal enjoyments, the world was mine, I had silver bowls, I had
						gold, and some money; but when this city was taken, I
						commanded my maids to pack it up altogether, and threw
						it, or rather put it for security, into a well that had no
						water in it. Neither do many know of it, for it hath a
						covering, and nature hath provided a shady wood round
						about it. Take then these things, and much good may
						they do thee; and they shall lie by thee, as certain tokens
						and marks of the late flourishing fortune and splendor of
						our family.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Macedonian heard these things, he stayed not
					for day, but presently went to the place by Timoclea's conduct, commanding the garden-door to be shut, that none
					might perceive what they were about. He descended in
					his morning vestment. But the revengeful Clotho brought
					dreadful things upon him by the hand of Timoclea, who
					stood on the top of the well; for as soon as she perceived
					by his voice that he reached the bottom, she threw down
					abundance of stones upon him, and her maids rolled in
					many and great ones, till they had dashed him to pieces
					and buried him under them. As soon as the Macedonians
					came to understand this and had taken up the corpse, there
					having been late proclamation that none of the Thebans
					should be slain, they seized her and carried her before the
					king and declared her audacious exploit; but the king,
					who by the gravity of her countenance and stateliness of
					her behavior did perceive in her something that savored
					of the greatest worth and nobility, asked her first, What
					woman art thou? She courageously and undauntedly answered: Theagenes was my brother, who was a commander at Chaeronea, and lost his life fighting against
					you in defence of the Grecian liberty, that we might not
					suffer any such thing; and seeing I have suffered things
					unworthy of my rank, I refuse not to die; for it is better
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.378"/>
					
					so to do than to experience another such a night as the
					last, which awaits me unless thou forbid it. All the most
					tender-spirited persons that were present broke out into
					tears; but Alexander was not for pitying her, as being a
					woman above pity. But he admired her fortitude and eloquence, which had taken strong hold on him, and charged
					his officers to have a special care and look to the guards,

            <p>Arcesilaus was the son of Battus who was surnamed
					Felix, not at all like to his father in his conversation. His
					father, when he lived, laid a fine of a talent upon him for
					making fortifications about his house. After his father's
					death he being of a rugged disposition (therefore surnamed
					the Severe), and following the counsels of Laarchus, an ill
					friend, became a tyrant instead of a king. For Laarchus
					affecting the government for himself, either banished or slew
					the noblemen of Cyrene, and charged the fault upon Arcesilaus; and at last casting him into a wasting and grievous
					disease, by giving him the sea-hare in his drink, he deprived
					him of his life. So that Laarchus assumed the government,
					under pretence of being protector to Arcesilaus's young son
					Battus; but the youth, by reason either of his lameness or
					youthful age, was contemned. As for his mother, many
					made addresses to her, being a modest and courteous
					woman, and she had many of the commons and nobility at
					her devotion. Therefore Laarchus, pretending to be her
					humble servant, would needs marry her, and thereby take
					Battus to the dignity of being son and then allow him a
					share in the government. But Eryxo (for that was the
					woman's name), taking counsel of her brethren, bade Laarchus
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.379"/>
					
					 treat with them as if she had designed marriage;
					Laarchus accordingly treating with Eryxo's brethren, they
					on purpose delay and prolong the business. Eryxo sends
					one of her maid-servants acquainting him, that for the
					present her brethren did oppose the match, but if they
					could but accomplish it so as to lie together once, her
					brethren would cease arguing the matter any farther, and
					would give their consent. He should therefore come to
					her by night, if he pleased; an entrance being once made
					in a business, the rest will succeed well enough. These
					things were m'ghty pleasing to Laarchus, and he was much
					inflamed by the woman's obliging carriage towards him,
					and declared that he would come to whatever place she
					should command him. These things Eryxo transacted
					with the privity of Polyarchus, her eldest brother. A time
					being now appointed for the congress, Polyarchus placed
					himself in his sister's bed-chamber, together with two
					young men that were sword-men, all out of sight, to revenge the death of his father, whom Laarchus had lately
					murdered. Eryxo sending at the time to acquaint him, he
					entered without his guard, and the young men falling upon
					him, he was wounded with the sword and died; the corpse
					immediately they threw over the wall. Battus they brought
					forth and proclaimed king over his father's dominions, and
					Polyarchus restored to the Cyrenaeans their ancient constitution of government. There were present at that time
					many soldiers of Amasis, the Egyptian king; whom Laar
					chus had employed and found faithful, and by whose means
					he had been not a little formidable to the citizens. These
					sent messengers to accuse Polyarchus and Eryxo to Amasis.
					At this the king was greatly incensed, and determined to
					make war upon the Cyrenaeans. But it happened that his
					mother died, and while he was solemnizing her funeral, ambassadors came and brought the news of his intentions to
					Cyrene. Wherefore it was thought best by Polyarchus to
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.380"/>
					
					go and apologize for himself. Eryxo would not desert him,
					but was resolved to accompany him and run the same hazard with him. Nor would his mother Critola leave him,
					though she was an old woman; for great was her dignity,
					she being the sister of old Battus, surnamed Felix. As
					soon as they came into Egypt, as others with admiration
					approved of the exploit, so even Amasis himself did not a

            </head>
            <p>Xenocrita of Cumae deserves no less to be admired for
					her exploits against Aristodemus the tyrant, whom some
					have supposed to be surnamed the Effeminate, being ignorant of the true story. He was called by the barbarians
					Malakos (that is soft and effeminate) with regard merely to
					his youth; because, when he was a mere stripling, with
					other companions of the same age who wore long hair
					(whence they were called Coronistae, as it seems from their
					long hair), he became famous in the war against the barbarians. He was also not only renowned for resolution
					and activity, but very exceedingly remarkable for his discretion and providence; insomuch that being admired by the
					citizens he proceeded to the highest dominion among them.
					He was to bring aid to the Romans when they were in war
					with the Etrurians, who engaged to restore Tarquinius
					Superbus to his kingdom; in all which expedition, that
					was very long, he managed all affairs so as to ingratiate
					himself with the military part of the citizens, aiming more
					at the making himself head of a popular faction than general of the army. He accordingly prevails with them to
					join with himin attacking the senate, and in casting out the
					citizens of highest rank and most potent into exile. Afterwards becoming tyrant, he was flagitious in his carriage
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.381"/>
					
					towards women and free-born youth, and exceeded even himself in vileness. For history reports of him how that he accustomed the boys to wear their hair long and set with
					golden ornaments, and the girls he compelled to be polled
					round, and to wear youths' jerkins and short-tailed petticoats. Notwithstanding, he had a peculiar affection for
					Xenocrita, a girl of Cumae, left behind by her exiled father.
					Her he kept, but could not bring over to his humor by any
					insinuations or persuasions, neither had he gained her
					father's consent; however, he reckoned the maid would
					be brought to love him by constant conversation with him,
					since she would be envied and reputed very happy by the
					citizens. But these things did not at all besot the maid;
					but she took it heinously that she must be constrained to
					dwell with him, not espoused or married. Neither did she
					less long for the liberty of her native country than did
					those who were hated by the tyrant.</p>
            <p>It happened about that time that Aristodemus was casting up an entrenchment about the borders of Cumae, a
					work neither necessary nor profitable, only because he was
					resolved to tire out the citizens with hard toil and labor;
					for every one was required to carry out a stinted number
					of baskets of earth daily, in order to the delving this ditch.
					A certain maid, as she saw Aristodemus approaching, ran
					aside and covered her face with her apron; but when
					Aristodemus was withdrawn, the young men would sport
					and jest with her, asking her whether out of modesty she
					avoided only the sight of Aristodemus and was not so affected towards other men. She made answer designedly,
					rather than otherwise, that of the Cumaeans Aristodemus
					was the only man. This sentence thus spoken verily
					touched them all very near, for it provoked the generousminded men among them for very shame to the recovering
					of their liberties. And it is said that Xenocrita was heard
					to say, that she had rather carry earth for her father, if he
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.382"/>
					
					were at home, than participate in the great luxury and
					pomp of Aristodemus. These things added courage to
					them that were about to make an insurrection against
					Aristodemus, which Thymoteles had the chief management of; for Xenocrita providing them safe admittance,
					they easily rushed in upon Aristodemus, unarmed and unguarded, and slew him. In this manner the city of Cumae
					gained its liberty, by the virtue of two women; one by
					suggesting and invigorating the enterprise, the other by
					bringing it to an issue. When honors and great presents
					were tendered to Xenocrita, she refused all; but requested
					one thing, that she might bury the corpse of Aristodemus.
					This they delivered her, and made her a priestess of Ceres;
					reckoning that, as it was a deserved honor bestowed on her,
					so she would be no less acceptable to the Goddess.</p>

            <head>EXAMPLE 27. <hi rend="italics">The Wife of Pythes.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>It is reported that the wife of Pythes, who lived at the
					time of Xerxes, was a wise and courteous woman. Pythes,
					as it seems, finding by chance some gold mines, and falling
					vastly in love with the riches got out of them, was insatiably and beyond measure exercised about them; and he
					brought down likewise the citizens, all of whom alike he
					compelled to dig or carry or refine the gold, doing nothing
					else; many of them dying in the work, and all being quite
					worn out. Their wives laid down their petition at his gate,
					addressing themselves to the wife of Pythes. She bade
					them all depart and be of good cheer; but those goldsmiths
					which she confided most in she required to wait upon her,
					and confining them commanded them to make up golden
					loaves, all sorts of junkets and summer-fruits, all sorts of
					fish and flesh meats, in which she knew Pythes was most
					delighted. All things being provided, Pythes coming home
					then (for he happened to go a long journey) and asking for
					his supper, his wife set a golden table before him, having
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.383"/>
					
					no edible food upon it, but all golden. Pythes admired the
					workmanship for its imitation of nature. When, however,
					he had sufficiently fed his eyes, he called in earnest for
					something to eat; but his wife, when he asked for any sort,
					brought it of gold. Whereupon being provoked, he cried
					out, I am an hungered. She replied: Thou hast made
					none other provisions for us; every skilful science and art
					being laid aside, no man works in husbandry; but neglecting sowing, planting, and tilling the ground, we delve and
					search for useless things, killing ourselves and our subjects.
					These things moved Pythes, but not so as to give over all
					his works about the mine; for he now commanded a fifth
					part of the citizens to that work, the rest he converted to
					husbandry and manufactures. But when Xerxes made an
					expedition into Greece,Pythes, being most splendid in his
					entertainments and presents, requested a gracious favor of
					the king, that since he had many sons, one might be spared
					from the camp to remain with him, to cherish his old age.
					At which Xerxes in a rage slew this son only which he
					desired, and cut him in two pieces, and commanded the
					army to march between the two parts of the corpse. The
					rest he took along with him, and all of them were slain in
					the wars. At which Pythes fell into a despairing condition,
					so that he fell under the like suffering with many wicked
					men and fools. He dreaded death, but was weary of his
					life; yea, he was willing not to live, but could not cast
					away his life. He had this project. There was a great
					mound of earth in the city, and a river running by it, which
					they called Pythopolites. In that mound he prepared him
					a sepulchre, and diverted the stream so as to run just by
					the side of the mound, the river lightly washing the sepulchre. These things being finished, he enters into the
					sepulchre, committing the city and all the government
					thereof to his wife; commanding her not to come to him,
					but to send his supper daily laid on a sloop, till the sloop
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.384"/>
					
					should pass by the sepulchre with the supper untouched;
					and then she should cease to send, as supposing him dead.
					He verily passed in this manner the rest of his life; but
					his wife took admirable care of the government, and
					brought in a reformation of all things amiss among the
					people.</p>
