            <salute>Diocles to Nicarchus.</salute>
         </opener>
         <div1 type="section" n="1">
            <p>No wonder, my friend Nicarchus, to find old truths so
				disguised, and the words and actions of men so grossly
				misrepresented and lamely delivered, seeing people are so
				disposed to give ear and credit to fictions of yesterday's
				standing. For there were not merely seven present at
				that feast, as you were informed; there were more than
				double the number. I was there myself in person and
				familiarly acquainted with Periander (my art had gained
				me his acquaintance); and Thales boarded at my house, at
				the request and upon the recommendation of Periander.
				Whoever then gave you that account of our feast did it
				very badly; it is plain he did it upon hearsay, and that he
				was not there among us. Now, since we are together and
				at leisure, and possibly we may not live to find an opportunity so convenient another time, I will (seeing you desire it)
				give you a faithful account of the whole proceedings at
				that meeting.</p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.4"/>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>Periander had prepared a dinner for us, not in the
				town, but in a dining-hall at Lechaeum which stands close to
				the temple of Venus, to whom there was a sacrifice that day.
				For having neglected the duty ever since his mother died
				for love, he was resolved now to atone for the omission,
				being warned so to do by the dreams of Melissa. In
				order thereunto, there was provided a rich chariot for
				every one of the guests. It was summer-time, and every
				part of the way quite to the seaside was hardly passable,
				by reason of throngs of people and whole clouds of dust.
				As soon as Thales espied the chariot waiting at the door,
				he smilingly discharged it, and we walked through the
				fields to avoid the press and noise. There was in our
				company a third person, Niloxenus a Naucratian, an eminent man, who was very intimately acquainted with Solon
				and Thales in Egypt; he had a message to deliver to Bias,
				and a letter sealed, the contents whereof he knew not;
				only he guessed it contained a second question to be
				resolved by Bias, and in case Bias undertook not to answer it, he had in commission to impart it to the wisest
				men in Greece. What a fortune is this (quoth Niloxenus) to find you all together! This paper (showing it us)
				I am bringing to the banquet. Thales replied, after his
				wonted smiling way, If it contains any hard question,
				away with it to Priene. Bias will resolve it with the
				same readiness he did your former problem. What problem was that? quoth he. Why, saith Thales, a certain
				person sent him a beast for sacrifice with this command,
				that he should return him that part of his flesh which was
				best and worst; our philosopher very gravely and wisely
				pulled out the tongue of the beast, and sent it to the
				donor;&mdash;which single act procured him the name and
				reputation of a very wise man. It was not this act
				alone that advanced him in the estimation of the world,
				quoth Niloxenus; but he joyfully embraces what you so
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.5"/>
				
				carefully shun, the acquaintance and friendship of kings
				and great men; and whereas he honors you for divers
				great accomplishments, he particularly admires you for
				this invention, that with little labor and no help of any
				mathematical instrument you took so truly the height of
				one of the pyramids; for fixing your staff erect at the
				point of the shadow which the pyramid cast, two triangles being thus made by the tangent rays of the sun, you
				demonstrated that what proportion one shadow had to
				the other, such the pyramid bore to the stick.</p>
            <p>But, as I said, you are accused of being a hater of kings,
					and certain back friends of yours have presented Amasis
					with a paper of yours stuffed with sentences reproachful
					to majesty; as for instance, being at a certain time asked
					by Molpagoras the Ionian, what the most absurd thing was
					you had observed in your notice, you replied, An old king.
					Another time, in a dispute that happened in your company
					about the nature of beasts, you affirmed that of wild beasts,
					a king, of tame, a flatterer was the worst. Such apophthegms must needs be unacceptable to kings, who pretend
					there is vast difference between them and tyrants. This
					was Pittacus's reply to Myrsilus, and it was spoken in jest,
					quoth Thales; nor was it an old king I said I should marvel at, but an old pilot. In this mistake, however. I am
					much of the youth's mind who, throwing a stone at a
					bitch, hit his stepmother, adding, Not so bad. I therefore
					esteemed Solon a very wise and good man, when I understood he refused empire; and if Pittacus had not taken
					upon himself a monarchy, he had never exclaimed, O ye
					Gods! how hard a matter it is to be good! And Periander,
					however he seems to be sick of his father's disease, is yet
					to be commended that he gives ear to wholesome discourses
					and converses only with wise and good men, rejecting the
					advice of Thrasybulus my countryman, who would have
					persuaded him to chop off the heads of his nobility. For
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.6"/>
					
					a prince that chooses rather to govern slaves than freemen
					is like a foolish farmer, who throws his wheat and barley
					in the streets, to fill his barns with swarms of locusts and
					whole cages of birds. For government has one good
					thing to make amends for the many evils attending it,
					namely, honor and glory, provided the ruler rules good
					men because he is better than they, and great men seeming to be greater than they. But he that having ascended
					the throne minds only his own interest and ease, remitting
					all care and concern for the welfare of the subject, is fitter
					to tend sheep or to drive horses or to feed cattle than to
					govern men of reason.</p>
            <p>But this stranger (continues he) has engaged us in a deal
					of impertinent chat, for we have neglected to speak or offer
					any discourse suitable to the occasion and end of our meeting; for doubtless it becomes the guest, as well as the host,
					to make preparation beforehand. It is reported that the
					Sybarites used to invite their neighbors' wives a whole
					twelve-month before to their entertainments, that they
					might have convenient time to trim and adorn themselves; for my part, I am of opinion, that he who would
					feast as he should ought to allow himself more time for
					preparation than they, it being a more difficult matter to
					compose the mind into an agreeable temper than to fit
					one's clothes for the outward ornament of the body. For
					a prudent man comes not hither only to fill his belly, as if he
					were to fill a bottle, but to be sometimes grave and serious,
					sometimes pleasant, sometimes to listen to others, and sometimes to speak himself what may benefit or divert the company, if the meeting is intended for any good use or
					purpose. For if the victuals be not good, men may let
					them alone, or if the wine be bad, men may use water;
					but for a weak-headed, impertinent, unmannerly, shallow
					fellow-commoner there is no cure; he mars all the mirth
					and music, and spoils the best entertainment in the world.
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.7"/>
					
					And it will be no easy business to rid one's self of a sullen
					temper when once entertained; since we find divers men,
					affronted in their debauches, have yet remembered the
					provocation to their dying day, the spite remaining like a
					surfeit arising from wrong done or anger conceived in
					drinking wine. Wherefore Chilo did very well and wisely;
					for when he was invited yesterday, he would not promise
					to come till he had a particular given him of all their
					names who were to meet him. For, quoth he, if my
					business calls me to sea or I am pressed to serve my
					prince in his wars, there is a necessity upon me to rest
					contented with whatever company I fall into, though never
					so unsuitable to my quality or disagreeable to my nature
					and humor; but voluntarily and needlessly to associate
					myself with any riffraff rabble would ill become any man
					pretending to but common discretion.</p>
            <p>The Egyptian skeleton which they brought into their
					feasts and exposed to the view of their guests, with this
					advice, that they should not in their merriment forget they
					would shortly be themselves such as that was,&mdash;though it
					was a sight not so acceptable (as may be supposed),&mdash;had
					yet this conveniency and use, to incite the spectators not
					to luxury and drunkenness but to mutual love and friendship,
					persuading them not to protract a life in itself short and
					uncertain by a tedious course of wickedness.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>In discourses of this kind we spent our time by the
				way, and were now come to the house. Here Thales
				would not be washed, for he had but a while before
				anointed himself; wherefore he took a round to view the
				horse-race and the wrestling-place, and the grove upon the
				water-side, which was neatly trimmed and beautified by
				Periander; this he did, not so much to satisfy his own
				curiosity (for he seldom or never admired any thing he saw),
				but that he might not disoblige Periander or seem to overlook or despise the glory and magnificence of our host.
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.8"/>
				
				Of the rest every one, after he had anointed and washed
				himself, the servants introduced into a particular room,
				purposely fitted and prepared for the men; they were
				guided thither through a porch, in which Anacharsis sat,
				and there was a certain young lady with him arranging his
				hair. This lady stepping forward to welcome Thales, he
				saluted her most courteously, and smiling said: Madam,
				make the stranger fair and pleasant, so that, being (as he
				is) the mildest. man in the world, he may not be fearful and
				hideous for us to look on. When I was curious to enquire
				who this lady was whom Thales thus complimented, he
				said, Do you not yet know the wise and famous Eumetis?
				&mdash;for so her father calls her, though others call her after
				her father's name Cleobulina. Doubtless, saith Niloxenus,
				they call her by this name to commend her judgment and
				wit, and her reach into the more abstruse and recondite
				part of learning; for I have myself in Egypt seen and
				read some problems first started and discussed by her.
				Not so, saith Thales, for she plays with these as men do
				with cockal-bones, and encounters boldly all she meets,
				without study or premeditation; she is a person of an
				admirable understanding, of a politic capacious mind, of a
				very obliging conversation, and one that by her rhetoric
				and the sweetness of her temper prevails upon her father
				to govern his subjects with the greatest mildness in the
				world. How popular she is appears, saith Niloxenus, plainly to any that observes her pleasant innocent garb. But
				pray, continues he, wherefore is it that she shows such
				tenderness and affection to Anacharsis ? Because, replied
				Thales, he is a temperate and learned man, who fully and
				freely makes known to her those mysterious ways of dieting and physicing the sick which are now in use among
				the Scythians; and I doubt not she now coaxes and courts
				the old gentleman at the rate you see, taking this opportunity to discourse with him and learn something of him.</p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.9"/>
            <p>As we were come near the dining-room, Alexidemus the
					Milesian, a bastard son of Thrasybulus the Tyrant, met us.
					He seemed to be disturbed, and in an angry tone muttered
					to himself some words which we could not distinctly hear;
					but espying Thales, and recovering himself out of his
					disorder, he complained how Periander had put an insufferable affront upon him. He would not permit me, saith
					he, to go to sea, though I earnestly importuned him, but
					he would press me to dine with him. And when I came
					as invited, he assigned me a seat unbecoming my person
					and character, Aeolians and islanders and others of inferior
					rank being placed above me; whence it is easy to infer
					how meanly he thinks of my father, and it is undeniable
					how this affront put upon me rebounds disgracefully in my
					parent's face. Say you so? quoth Thales, are you afraid
					lest the place lessen or diminish your honor and worth, as
					the Egyptians commonly hold the stars are magnified or
					lessened according to their higher or lower place and position? And are you more foolish than that Spartan who,
					when the prefect of the music had appointed him to sit in
					the lowest seat in the choir, replied, This is prudently done,
					for this is the ready way to bring this seat into repute and
					esteem ? It is a frivolous consideration, where or below
					whom we sit; and it is a wiser part to adapt ourselves to
					the judgment and humor of our right and left hand man
					and the rest of the company, that we may approve ourselves
					worthy of their friendship, when they find we take no pet
					at our host, but are rather pleased to be placed near such
					good company. And whosoever is disturbed upon the
					account of his place seems to be more angry with his
					neighbor than with his host, but certainly is very troublesome and nauseous to both.</p>
            <p>These are fine words, and no more, quoth Alexidemus,
					for I observe you, the wisest of men, as ambitious as other
					men; and having said thus, he passed by us doggedly and
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.10"/>
					
					trooped off. Thales, seeing us admiring the innocence of
					the man, declared he was a fellow naturally of a blockish,
					stupid disposition; for when he was a boy, he took a parcel of rich perfume that was presented to Thrasybulus
					and poured it into a large bowl, and mixing it with a
					quantity of wine, he drank it off and was ever hated for it.
					As Thales was talking after this fashion, in comes a servant and tells us it was Periander's pleasure we would
					come in and inform him what we thought of a certain
					creature brought into his presence that instant, whether it
					were so born by chance or were a prodigy and omen;&mdash;
					himself seeming mightily affected and concerned, for he
					judged his sacrifice polluted by it. At the same time he
					walked before us into a certain house adjoining to his garden-wall, where we found a young beardless shepherd,
					tolerably handsome, who having opened a leathern bag
					produced and showed us a child born (as he averred) of a
					mare. His upper part, as far as his neck and his hands,
					was of human shape, and the rest of his body resembled
					a perfect horse; his cry was like that of a child newly
					born. As soon as Niloxenus saw it, he cried out, The
					Gods deliver us; and away he fled as one sadly affrighted.
					But Thales eyed the shepherd a considerable while, and
					then smiling (for it was his way to jeer me perpetually
					about my art) says he, I doubt not, Diocles, but you have
					been all this time seeking for some expiatory offering, and
					intending to call to your aid those Gods whose province
					and work it is to avert evils from men, as if some great
					and grievous thing had happened. Why not? quoth I,
					for undoubtedly this prodigy portends sedition and war,
					and I fear the dire portents thereof may extend to myself, my wife, and my children, and prove all our ruin;
					since, before I have atoned for my former fault, the Goddess gives us this second evidence and proof of her displeasure. Thales replied never a word, but laughing went
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.11"/>
					
					out of the house. Periander, meeting him at the door,
					enquired what we thought of that creature; he dismissed
					me, and taking Periander by the hand, said, Whatsoever
					Diodes shall persuade you to do, do it at your best leisure;
					but I advise you either not to have such young men to
					keep your mares, or to give them leave to marry. When
					Periander heard him out, he seemed infinitely pleased, for
					he laughed outright, and hugging Thales in his arms he
					kissed him; then saith he, O Diocles, I am apt to think the
					worst is over, and what this prodigy portended is now
					at an end; for do you not apprehend what a loss we have
					sustained in the want of Alexidemus's good company at
					supper?</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="4">
            <p>When we entered into the house, Thales raising his
				voice enquired where it was his worship refused to be placed;
				which being shown him, he sat himself in that very place,
				and prayed us to sit down by him, and said, I would gladly
				give any money to have an opportunity to sit and eat with Ardalus. This Ardalus was a Troezenian by birth, by profession a minstrel, and a priest of the Ardalian Muses, whose
				temple old Ardalus had founded and dedicated. Here
				Esop, who was sent from Croesus to visit Periander, and
				withal to consult the oracle at Delphi, sitting by and beneath Solon upon a low stool, told the company this fable:
				A Lydian mule, viewing his own picture in a river, and
				admiring the bigness and beauty of his body, raises his
				crest; he waxes proud, resolving to imitate the horse in
				his gait and running; but presently, recollecting his extraction, how that his father was but an ass at best, he stops
				his career and checks his own haughtiness and bravery.
				Chilo replied, after his short laconic way, You are slow and
				yet try to run, in imitation of your mule.</p>
            <p>Amidst these discourses in comes Melissa and sits her
					down by Periander; Eumetis followed and came in as we
					were at supper; then Thales calls to me (I sat me down
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.12"/>
					
					above Bias), Why do you not make Bias acquainted with
					the problems sent him from the King by Niloxenus this
					second time, that he may soberly and warily weigh them
					Bias answered, I have been already scared with that news.
					I have known that Bacchus is otherwise a powerful God,
					and for his wisdom is termed <foreign lang="greek">lu/sios</foreign>, that is, <hi rend="italics">the interpreter;</hi>
					therefore I shall undertake it when my belly is full of wine.
					Thus they jested and reparteed and played one upon another all the while they sat at table. Observing the unwonted frugality of Periander at this time, I considered
					with myself that the entertainment of wise and good men
					is a piece of good husbandry, and that so far from enhancing a man's expenses in truth it serves to save charge, the
					charge (to wit) of costly foreign unguents and junkets, and
					the waste of the richest wines, which Periander's state and
					greatness required him every day in his ordinary treats to
					expend. Such costly provisions were useless here, and Periander's wisdom appeared in his frugality. Moreover, his
					lady had laid aside her richer habit, and appeared in an
					ordinary, but a very becoming dress.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>Supper now ended, and Melissa having distributed
				the garlands, we offered sacrifice; and when the minstrel
				had played us a tune or two, she withdrew. Then Ardalus
				enquired of Anacharsis, if there were women fiddlers at
				Scythia. He suddenly and smartly replied, There are no
				vines there. Ardalus asked a second question, whether the
				Scythians had any Gods among them. Yes, quoth Anacharsis, and they understand what men say to them; nor
				are the Scythians of the Grecian opinion (however these
				last may be the better orators), that the Gods are better
				pleased with the sounds of flutes and pipes than with the
				voice of men. My friend, saith Esop, what would you say
				if you saw our present pipe-makers throw away the bones
				of fawns and hind-calves, to use those of asses, affirming
				they yield the sweeter and more melodious sound? Whereupon
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.13"/>
				
				 Cleobulina made one of her riddles about the Phrygian flute, ... in regard to the sound, and wondered that
				an ass, a gross animal and no lover of music, should yet
				afford bones so fit for harmony. Therefore it is doubtless,
				quoth Niloxenus, that the people of Busiris accuse us Naucratians of folly for using pipes made of asses' bones, it
				being an insufferable fault in any of them to listen to the
				flute or cornet, the sound thereof being (as they esteem it)
				so like the braying of an ass; and you know an ass is
				hateful to the Egyptians on account of Typhon.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>There happening here a short silence, Periander,
				observing Niloxenus willing but not daring to speak, said:
				I cannot but commend the civility of those magistrates who
				give audience first to strangers and afterwards to their own
				citizens; wherefore I judge it convenient that we inhabitants and neighbors should proceed no farther at present
				in our discourse, and that now attention be given to those
				royal propositions sent us from Egypt, which the worthy
				Niloxenus is commissioned to deliver to Bias, who desires
				that he and we may scan and examine them together. And
				Bias said: For where or in what company would a man
				more joyfully adventure to give his opinion than here in
				this? And since it is his Majesty's pleasure that I should
				give my judgment first, in obedience to his commands I will
				do so, and afterwards they shall come to every one of you
				in order.</p>
            <p>Then Niloxenus delivered the paper to Bias, who broke
					up the seal and commanded it to be read in all their hearing. The contents were these:&mdash;
					
					<quote rend="blockquote">Amasis the king of Egypt, to Bias, the wisest of the
						Grecians, greeting. There is a contest between my brother
						of Ethiopia and myself about wisdom; and being baffled
						in divers other particulars, he now demands of me a thing
						absurd and impracticable; for he requires me to drink up
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.14"/>
						
						the ocean dry. If I be able to read this his riddle, divers
						cities and towns now in his possession are to be annexed
						to my kingdom; but if I cannot resolve this hard sentence,
						and give him the right meaning thereof, he requires of me
						my right to all the towns bordering upon Elephantina.
						Consider with speed the premises, and let me receive your
						thoughts by Niloxenus. Pray lose no time. If in any
						thing I can be serviceable to your city or friends, you may
						command me. Farewell.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>Bias, having perused and for a little time meditated upon
					the letter, and whispering Cleobulus in the ear (he sat by
					him), exclaimed: What a narration is here, O Niloxenus!
					Will Amasis, who governs so many men and is seized of so
					many flourishing territories, drink up the ocean for the
					gain of a few paltry, beggarly villages? Niloxenus replied
					with a smile: Consider, good sir, what is to be done, if he
					will obey. Why then, said Bias, let Amasis require the
					Ethiopian king to stop the streams which from all parts
					flow and empty themselves in the ocean, until he have
					drunk out the whole remainder; for I conceive he means
					the present waters, not those which shall flow into it hereafter. Niloxenus was so overjoyed at this answer, that he
					could not contain himself. He hugged and kissed the
					author, and the whole company liked his opinion admirably
					well; and Chilo laughing desired Niloxenus to get aboard
					immediately before the sea was consumed, and tell his
					master he should mind more how to render his government
					sweet and potable to his people, than how to swallow such
					a quantity of salt water. For Bias, he told him, understands these things very well, and knows how to oblige
					your lord with very useful instructions, which if he vouchsafe to attend, he shall no more need a golden basin to wash
					his feet, to gain respect from his subjects; all will love and
					honor him for his virtue, though he were ten thousand
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.15"/>
					
					times more hateful to them than he is. It were well and
					worthily done, quoth Periander, if all of us did pay him
					our first-fruits in this kind by the poll (as Homer said).
					Such a course would bring him an accession of profit greater
					than the whole profit of the voyage, besides being of no
					little use to ourselves.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="7">
            <p>To this point it is fit that Solon should first speak,
				quoth Chilo, not only because he is the eldest in the company and therefore sits uppermost at table, but because he
				governs and gives laws to the amplest and most complete
				and flourishing republic in the world, that of Athens.
				Here Niloxenus whispered me in the ear: O Diocles, saith
				he, how many reports fly about and are believed, and how
				some men delight in lies which they either feign of their
				own heads or most greedily swallow from the mouths of
				others. In Egypt I heard it reported how Chilo had renounced all friendship and correspondence with Solon,
				because he maintained the mutability of laws. A ridiculous fiction, quoth I, for then he and we must have renounced Lycurgus, who changed the laws and indeed the
				whole government of Sparta.</p>
            <p>Solon, pausing awhile, gave his opinion in these words.
					I conceive that monarch, whether king or tyrant, were infinitely to be commended, who would exchange his monarchy
					for a commonwealth. Bias subjoined, And who would be
					first and foremost in conforming to the laws of his country.
					Thales added, I reckon that prince happy, who, being old,
					dies in his bed a natural death. Fourthly, Anacharsis, If
					he alone be a wise man. Fifthly, Cleobulus said, If he
					trust none of his courtiers. Sixthly, Pittacus spake thus,
					If he could cause his subjects to have fear not of him but
					for him. Lastly, Chilo concluded thus, A magistrate ought
					to have thoughts, purposes, and resolutions not mean and
					earthly, but divine and immortal.</p>
            <p>When all had given in their judgments upon this point,
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.16"/>
					
					we requested Periander he would condescend to give the
					company the satisfaction to let them know his thoughts
					upon the same head. Disorder and discontent appearing
					in his countenance, he said, These opinions are enough to
					scare any wise man from affecting empire. These things,
					saith Esop after his fault-finding way, ought rather to have
					been discussed privately among ourselves, lest we be accounted antimonarchical while we desire to be esteemed
					friends and loyal counsellors. Solon, gently clapping him
					upon the shoulder and smiling, answered: Do you not perceive that any one would make a king more moderate and
					a tyrant more favorable, who should persuade him that it
					is better not to reign than to reign? Then we must believe you before the oracle delivered unto you, quoth
					Esop, which pronounced that city happy that heard but one
					crier. Yes, quoth Solon, and Athens, though now a commonwealth, hath but one crier and one magistrate, and that
					is the law, though the government be democratical; but
					you, my friend, have been so accustomed to the croaking
					of ravens and the prating of jays, that you do not hear
					your own voice. For you maintain it to be the happiness
					of a city to be under the command of one man, and yet
					account it the praise of a feast if liberty is allowed every
					man to speak his mind freely upon what subject he pleases.
					But you have not prohibited your servants' drunkenness,
					as you have forbidden them to love or to use dry ointments.
					Solon laughed at this; but Cleodorus the physician said: To
					use dry ointment is like talking when a man is drenched
					with wine; both are very pleasant. Therefore, saith Chilo,
					it concerns men the more carefully to avoid it. Esop proceeds, Thales seemed to imply that he should soon grow old.</p>

            <p>Periander said laughing: We suffer deservedly, for,

				foreign to the matter under consideration; and therefore I
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.17"/>
				
				pray, Niloxenus, read out the remainder of your lord's
				letter, and slip not this opportunity to receive what satisfaction all that are present shall be able to give you. The
				command of the king of Ethiopia, says Niloxenus, is no
				more and no less than (to use Archilochus's phrase) a
				broken scytale; that is, the meaning is inscrutable and
				cannot be found out. But your friend Amasis was more
				gentle and civil in his queries; for he commanded him
				only to resolve him what was most ancient, most beautiful, greatest, wisest, most common, and withal, what was
				most profitable, most pernicious, most strong, and most
				easy. Did he resolve and answer every one of these questions? He did, quoth Niloxenus, and do you judge of his
				answers and the soundness thereof: and it is my prince's
				purpose not to misrepresent his responses and condemn
				unjustly what he saith well, so, where he finds him under
				a mistake, not to suffer that to pass without correction.
				His answers to the foresaid questions I will read to you.&mdash;
				What is most ancient? Time. What is greatest? The
				World. What is wisest? Truth. What is most beautiful ? The light. What is most common ? Death.
				What is most profitable ? God. What is most pernicious ? An evil genius. What is strongest? Fortune.
				What is most easy? That which is pleasant.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="9">
            <p>When Niloxenus had read out these answers, there
				was a short silence among them; by and by Thales desires
				Niloxenus to inform him if Amasis approved of these answers. Niloxenus said, he liked some and disliked others.
				There is not one of them right and sound, quoth Thales,
				but all are full of wretched folly and ignorance. As for instance, how can that be most ancient whereof part is past,
				part is now present, and part is yet to come; every man
				knows it is younger than ourselves and our actions. As
				to his answer that truth is the most wise thing, it is as incongruous as if he had affirmed the light to be an eye; if
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.18"/>
				
				he judged the light to be the most beautiful, how could he
				overlook the sun; as to his solutions concerning the Gods
				and evil geniuses, they are full of presumption and peril.
				What he saith of Fortune is void of sense, for her inconstancy and fickleness proceeds from want of strength and
				power. Nor is death the most common thing; the living
				are still at liberty, it hath not arrested them. But lest we
				be censured as having a faculty to find fault only, we will
				lay down our opinions of these things, and compare them
				with those of the Ethiopian; and I offer myself first, if
				Niloxenus pleases, to deliver my opinion on every one
				singly, and I will relate both questions and answers in that
				method and order in which they were sent to Ethiopia and
				read to us. What is most ancient? Thales answered,
				God, for he had no beginning. What is greatest? Place;
				the world contains all other things, this surrounds and contains the world. What is most beautiful? The world;
				for whatever is framed artificially and methodically is a
				part of it. What is most wise ? Time; for it has found out
				some things already, it will find out the rest in due time.
				What is most common? Hope; for they that want other
				things are masters of this. What is most profitable? Virtue; for by a right managery of other things she makes
				them all beneficial and advantageous. What is most pernicious? Vice; for it depraves the best things we enjoy.
				What is the most strong ? Necessity; for this alone is insuperable. What is most easy? That which is most agreeable to nature; for pleasures themselves are sometimes
				tedious and nauseating.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="10">
            <p>All the consult approved of Thales's solutions. Then
				Cleodemus said: My friend Niloxenus, it becomes kings to
				propound and resolve such questions; but the insolence of
				that barbarian who would have Amasis drink the sea would
				have been better fitted by such a smart reprimand as Pittacus gave Alyattes, who sent an imperious letter to the
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.19"/>
				
				Lesbians. He made him no answer, except to bid him spend
				his time in eating his hot bread and onions.</p>
            <p>Periander here assumed the discourse, and said: It was
					the manner of the ancient Grecians heretofore, O Cleodemus, to propound doubts to one another; and it hath been
					told us, that the most famous and eminent poets once met
					at the grave of Amphidamas in Chalcis. This Amphidamas was a leading citizen, one that had perpetual wars
					with the Eretrians, and at last lost his life in one of the
					battles fought for the possession of the Lelantine plain.
					Now, because the writings of those poets were composed
					in verse, and so made the argument more knotty and the
					decision more difficult, and the great names of the antagonists, Homer and Hesiod, whose excellence was so well
					known, made the umpires timorous and shy to determine;
					they therefore betook themselves to these sorts of questions,
					and Homer, says Lesches, propounded this riddle:&mdash;
					<quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>For this reply he was infinitely commended and won the

					may be fit to offer and puzzle women withal; but for men
					to beat their brains to find out their mystery would be

					great mind to reply; but her modesty would not permit
					her, for her face was filled with blushes. But Esop in her

         <div1 type="section" n="11">
            <p>Mnesiphilus the Athenian, a friend and favorite of
				Solon's, said: O Periander, our discourse, as our wine,
				ought to be distributed not according to our power or priority, but freely and equally, as in a popular state; for what
				hath been already discoursed concerning kingdoms and
				empires signifies little to us who live in a democracy.
				Wherefore I judge it convenient that every one of you
				beginning with Solon, should freely and impartially declare
				his sense of a popular state. The motion pleased all the
				company; then saith Solon: My friend Mnesiphilus, you
				heard, together with the rest of this good company, my
				opinion concerning republics; but since you are willing to
				hear it again, I hold that city or state happy and most likely
				to remain democratic, in which those that are not personally injured are yet as forward to question and correct wrongdoers as that person who is more immediately wronged.
				Bias added, Where all fear the law as they fear a tyrant.
				Thirdly, Thales said, Where the citizens are neither too
				rich nor too poor. Fourthly, Anacharsis said, Where,
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.21"/>
				
				though in all other respects they are equal, yet virtuous
				men are advanced and vicious persons degraded. Fifthly,
				Cleobulus said, Where the rulers fear reproof and shame
				more than the law. Sixthly, Pittacus said, Where bad
				men are prohibited from ruling, and good men from not ruling. Chilo, pausing a little while, determined that the best
				and most durable state was where the subject minded the
				law most and the orators least. Periander concluded with
				his opinion, that all of them would best approve that democracy which came next and was likest to an arisocracy.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="12">
            <p>When they had ended this discourse, I begged they
				would condescend to direct me how to govern a house; for
				they were few who had cities and kingdoms to govern,
				compared with those who had houses and families to manage. Esop laughed and said: I hope you except Anacharsis
				out of your number; for having no house, he glories because he can be contented with a chariot only, as they say
				the sun is whirled about from one end of the heavens to
				the other in his chariot. Therefore, saith Anacharsis, he
				alone, or he principally, is most free among the Gods, and
				ever at his own liberty and dispose. He governs all, and
				is governed and subject to none, but he rides and reigns;
				and you know not how magnificent and capacious his chariot
				is; if you did, you would not thus floutingly compare it
				with our Scythian chariots. For you seem in my apprehension to call these coverings made of wood and mud
				houses, as if you should call the shell and not the living
				creature a snail. Therefore you laughed when Solon told
				you how, when he viewed Croesus's palace and found it
				richly and gloriously furnished, he yet could not yield he
				lived happily until he had tried the inward and invisible
				state of his mind; for a man's felicity consists not in the
				outward and visible favors and blessings of Fortune, but in
				the inward and unseen perfections and riches of the mind.
				And you seem to have forgot your own fable of the fox,
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.22"/>
				
				who, contending with the leopard as to which was beset
				with more colors and spots, and having referred the matter
				in controversy to the arbitration of an umpire, desired
				him to consider not so much the outside as the inside; for,
				saith he, I have more various and different fetches and
				tricks in my mind than he has marks or spots in his body.
				You regard only the handiwork of carpenters and masons
				and stone-cutters, and call this a house; not what one hath
				within, his children, his wife, his friends and attendants,
				with whom if a man lived in an emmet's bed or a bird's
				nest, enjoying in common the ordinary comforts of life, this
				man may be affirmed to live a happy and a fortunate life.</p>
            <p>This is the answer I purpose to return Esop, quoth Anacharsis, and I tender it to Diocles as my share in this discourse; only let the rest give in their opinions, if they
					please. Solon thought that house most happy where the
					estate was got without injustice, kept without distrust, and
					spent without repentance. Bias said, That house is happy
					where the master does freely and voluntarily at home what
					the law compels him to do abroad. Thales held that house
					most happy where the master had most leisure and respite
					from business. Cleobulus said, That in which the master
					is more beloved than feared. Pittacus said, That is most
					happy where superfluities are not required and necessaries are not wanting. Chilo added, That house is most
					happy where the master rules as a monarch in his kingdom.
					And he proceeded, When a certain Lacedaemonian desired
					Lycurgus to establish a democracy in the city, Go you,
					friend, replied he, and try the experiment first in your own
					house.</p>

            <p>When they had all given in their opinions upon this

				those persons there swilling up all that good liquor, and

				it hath stood so long by Solon's trenchard. Then Pittacus

            <p>Anacharsis subjoined: He fears your severe law, my friend
					Pittacus, wherein you decreed the drunkard a double punishment. You seem, said Pittacus, a little to fear the penalty, who have adventured heretofore, and now again before
					my face, to break that law and to demand a crown for the
					reward of your debauch. Why not, quoth Anacharsis,
					when there is a reward promised to the hardest drinker?
					Why should I not demand my reward, having drunk down
					all my fellows?&mdash;or inform me of any other end men drive
					at in drinking much wine, but to be drunk. Pittacus laughed
					at this reply, and Esop told them this fable: The wolf
					seeing a parcel of shepherds in their booth feeding upon
					a lamb, approaching near them,&mdash;What a bustle and noise
					and uproar would you have made, saith he, if I had but
					done what you do! Chilo said: Esop hath very justly
					revenged himself upon us, who awhile ago stopped his
					mouth; now he observes how we prevented Mnesiphilus's
					discourse, when the question was put why Solon did not
					drink up his wine.</p>
            <p>Mnesiphilus then spake to this effect: I know this to be
					the opinion of Solon, that in every art and faculty, divine
					and human, the work which is done is more desired than
					the instrument wherewith it is done, and the end than the
					means conducing to that end; as, for instance, a weaver
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.24"/>
					
					thinks a cloak or coat more properly his work than the
					ordering of his shuttles or the divers motions of his beams.
					A smith minds the soldering of his irons and the sharpening of the axe more than those little things preparatory to
					these main matters, as the kindling of the coals and getting
					ready the stone-dust. Yet farther, a carpenter would justly
					blame us, if we should affirm it is not his work to build
					houses or ships but to bore holes or to make mortar; and
					the Muses would be implacably incensed with him that
					should say their business is only to make harps, pipes, and
					such musical instruments, not the institution and correction
					of manners and the government of those men's passions
					who are lovers of singing and masters of music. And
					agreeably copulation is not the work of Venus, nor is
					drunkenness that of Bacchus; but love and friendship,
					affection and familiarity, which are begot and improved by
					the means of these. Solon terms these works divine, and
					he professes he loves and now prosecutes them in his declining years as vigorously as ever in his youthful days.
					That mutual love between man and wife is the work of
					Venus, the greatness of the pleasure affecting their bodies
					mixes and melts their very souls; divers others, having
					little or no acquaintance before, have yet contracted a firm
					and lasting friendship over a glass of wine, which like fire
					softened and melted their tempers, and disposed them for a
					happy union. But in such a company, and of such men
					as Periander hath invited, there is no need of can and
					chalice, but the Muses themselves throwing a subject of
					discourse among you, as it were a sober cup, wherein is
					contained much of delight and drollery and seriousness too,
					do hereby provoke, nourish, and increase friendship among
					you, suffering the can to rest quietly upon the bowl, contrary to the rule which Hesiod<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Hesiod, Works and Days, 744.</note> gives for those who have

            <p>When Mnesiphilus had discoursed after this manner, in
					comes Chersias the poet, whom Periander had lately pardoned and received into favor upon Chilo's mediation.
					Saith Chersias: Does not Jupiter distribute to the Gods

					Agamemnon did to his commanders when his guests drank
					to one another? If, O Chersias, quoth Cleodemus, as you
					narrate, certain doves bring him his ambrosia every meal,
					flying with a world of hardship through the rocks called
					<hi rend="italics">Planctae</hi> (or <hi rend="italics">wandering</hi>), can you blame him for his sparingness and frugality and dealing out to his guests by
					measure?</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="14">
            <p>I am satisfied, quoth Chersias, and since we are fallen upon our old discourse of housekeeping, which of the
				company can remember what remains to be said thereof?
				There remains, if I mistake not, to show what that measure is which may content any man. Cleobulus answered:
				The law has prescribed a measure for wise men; but as
				touching fools, I will tell you a story I once heard my
				mother relate to my brother. On a certain time the moon
				begged of her mother a coat that would fit her. How can
				that be done, quoth the mother, for sometimes you are full,
				sometimes the one-half of you seems lost and perished,
				sometimes only a pair of horns appear. So, my Chersias,
				to the desires of a foolish immoderate man no certain measure can be fitted; for, according to the ebbings and flowings of his lust and appetite, and the frequent or seldom
				casualties that befall him, accordingly his necessities ebb
				or flow, not unlike Esop's dog, who, being pinched and
				ready to starve with cold in winter, was of mind to build
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.26"/>
				
				himself a house; but when summer came on, he lay all
				along upon the ground, and stretching himself in the sun
				thought himself monstrous big, and thought it a needless
				thing and besides no small piece of work to build him a
				house proportionable to that bulk and bigness. And do
				you not observe, O Chersias, continues he, many poor men,&mdash;
				how one while they pinch their bellies, upon what short
				commons they live, how sparing and niggardly and miserable they are; and another while you may observe the same
				men as distrustful and covetous withal, as if the plenty of
				city and country, the riches of king and kingdom were not
				sufficient to preserve them from want and beggary.</p>
            <p>When Chersias had concluded this discourse, Cleodemus
					began thus: We see you that are wise men possessing these
					outward goods after an unequal manner. Good sweet sir,
					answered Cleobulus, the law weaver-like hath distributed to
					every man a fitting, decent, adequate portion, and in your
					profession your reason does what the law does here,&mdash;when you feed, or diet, or physic your patient, you give not
					an equal quantity to all, but what you judge to be convenient for each in his circumstances. Ardalus enquires:
					I pray what law compels our friend and Solon's host,
					Epimenides, to abstain from all other victuals, and to content himself with a little composition of his own, which the
					Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">a)/limos</foreign> (<hi rend="italics">hunger-relieving</hi>)? This he takes into his
					mouth and chews, and eats neither dinner nor supper. This
					instance obliged the whole company to be a little while
					silent, until Thales in a jesting way replied, that Epimenides did very wisely, for hereby he saved the trouble and
					charge of grinding and boiling his food, as Pittacus did.
					I myself sojourning at Lesbos overheard my landlady, as
					she was very busy at her hand-mill, singing as she used to

					Periander, that Hesiod meant this literally; or rather that,
					being himself a great admirer of parsimony, he hereby intended to exhort men to use a mean and spare diet, as most
					healthful and pleasant? For the chewing of mallows is
					very wholesome, and the stalk of asphodel is very luscious;
					but this <q direct="unspecified">expeller of hunger and thirst</q> I take to be rather
					physic than natural food, consisting of honey and I know
					not what barbarian cheese, and of many and costly seeds
					fetched from foreign parts. If to make up this composition so many ingredients were requisite, and so difficult to
					come by and so expensive, Hesiod might as well have kept
					his breath to cool his pottage, and never blessed the world
					with the discovery. And yet I admire how your host, when
					he went to perform the great purification for the Delians
					not long since, could overlook the monuments and patterns
					of the first aliment which the people brought into the temple,&mdash;and, among other cheap fruits such as grow of themselves, the mallows and the asphodel; the usefulness and
					innocency whereof Hesiod seemed in his work to magnify.
					Not only that, quoth Anacharsis, but he affirms both plants
					to be great restoratives. You are in the right, quoth Cleodemus; for it is evident Hesiod was no ordinary physician,
					who could discourse so learnedly and judiciously of diet,
					of the nature of wines, and of the virtue of waters and
					baths, and of women, the proper times for procreation, and
					the site and position of infants in the womb; insomuch,
					that (as I take it) Esop deserves much more the name of
					Hesiod's scholar and disciple than Epimenides, whose great
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.28"/>
					
					and excellent wisdom the fable of the nightingale and
					hawk demonstrates. But I would gladly hear Solon's opinion in this matter; for having sojourned long at Athens
					and being familiarly acquainted with Epimenides, it is more
					than probable he might learn of him the grounds upon
					which he accustomed himself to so spare a diet.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="15">
            <p>To what purpose, said Solon, should I trouble him
				or myself to make enquiry in a matter so plain? For if
				it be a blessing next to the greatest to need little victuals,
				then it is the greatest felicity to need none at all. If I may
				have leave to deliver my opinion, quoth Cleodemus, I must
				profess myself of a different judgment, especially now we
				sit at table; for as soon as the meat is taken away, we
				have removed what belongs to those Gods that are the
				patrons of friendship and hospitality. As upon the removal of the earth, quoth Thales, there must needs follow
				an universal confusion of all things, so in forbidding men
				meat, there must needs follow the dispersion and dissolution
				of the family, the sacred fire, the cups, the feasts and entertainments, which are the principal and most innocent diversions of mankind; and so all the comforts of society are
				at end. For to men of business some recreation is necessary, and the preparation and use of victuals conduces
				much thereunto. Again, to be without victuals would
				tend to the destruction of husbandry, for want whereof
				the earth would soon be overgrown with weeds, and through
				the sloth of men overflowed with waters. And together
				with this, all arts would fail which are supported and encouraged hereby; nay, more, take away hospitality and the
				use of victuals, and the worship and honor of the Gods will
				sink and perish; the sun will have but small and the moon
				yet smaller reverence, if they afford men only light and heat.
				And who will build an altar or offer sacrifice to Jupiter
				Pluvius, or to Ceres the patroness of husbandmen, or to
				Neptune the preserver of plants and trees? Or how can
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.29"/>
				
				Bacchus be any longer termed the donor of all good things,
				if men make no further use of the good things he gives?
				What shall men sacrifice? What first-fruits shall they offer?
				In short, the subversion and confusion of the greatest
				blessings attend this opinion. Promiscuously and indefatigably to pursue all sorts of pleasures I own to be brutish,
				and to avoid all with a suitable aversion equally blockish;
				let the mind then freely enjoy such pleasures as are agree
				able to its nature and temper. But for the body, there is
				certainly no pleasure more harmless and commendable and
				fitting than that which springs from a plentiful table,&mdash;
				which is granted by all men; for, placing this in the mid
				die, men converse with one another and share in the provision. As to the pleasures of the bed, men use these in
				the dark, reputing the use thereof no less shameful and
				beastly than the total disuse of the pleasures of the table.</p>
            <p>Cleodemus having finished this long harangue, I began
					to this effect. You omit one thing, my friend, how they
					that decry food decry sleep too, and they that declaim
					against sleep declaim against dreams in the same breath,
					and so destroy the primitive and ancient way of divination.
					Add to this, that our whole life will be of one form and
					fashion, and our soul enclosed in a body to no purpose;
					many and those the principal parts thereof are naturally
					so formed and fashioned as to be organs of nutriment; so
					the tongue, the teeth, the stomach, and the liver, whereof
					none are idle, none flamed for other use. so that whosoever
					hath no need of nutriment has no need of his body; that
					is, in other words, no man hath any need of himself, for
					every man hath a body of his own. This I have thought
					fit to offer in vindication of our bellies; if Solon or any
					other has any thing to object to what I have said, I am
					willing to hear him.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="16">
            <p>Yea, doubtless, replies Solon, or we may be reputed
				more injudicious than the Egyptians. For when any person
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.30"/>
				
				 dies among them, they open him and show him so
				dissected to the sun; his guts they throw into the river, to
				the remaining parts they allow a decent burial, for they
				think the body now pure and clean; and to speak truly,
				they are the foulest parts of the body, and like that lower
				hell crammed with dead carcasses and at the same time
				flowing with offensive rivers, such as flame with fire and
				are disturbed with tempests. No live creature feeds upon
				another living creature, but we first take away their lives,
				and in that action we do them great wrong; forasmuch as
				whatsoever is transmuted and turned into another loseth
				the nature which it had before, and is corrupted that it
				may become nourishment to the others. Now the very
				plants have life in them,&mdash;that is clear and manifest, for
				we perceive they grow and spread. But to abstain from
				eating flesh (as they say Orpheus of old did) is more a
				pretence than a real avoiding of an injury proceeding from
				the just use of meat. One way there is, and but one way,
				whereby a man may avoid offence, namely by being contented with his own, not coveting what belongs to his
				neighbor. But if a man's circumstances be such and so
				hard that he cannot subsist without wronging another man,
				the fault is God's, not his. The case being such with
				some persons, I would fain learn if it be not advisable to
				destroy, at the same time with injustice, these instruments
				of injustice, the belly, stomach, and liver, which have no
				sense of justice or appetite to honesty, and therefore may
				be fitly compared to your cook's implements, his knives
				and his caldrons, or to a baker's chimney and bins and
				kneading-tubs. Verily one may observe the souls of some
				men confined to their bodies, as to a house of correction,
				barely to do the drudgery and to serve the necessities
				thereof. It was our own case but even now. While we
				minded our meat and our bellies, we had neither eyes to
				see nor ears to hear; but now the table is taken away, we
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.31"/>
				
				are free to discourse among ourselves and to enjoy one
				another; and now our bellies are full, we have nothing
				else to do or care for. And if this condition and state
				wherein we at present are would last our whole life, we
				having no wants to fear nor riches to covet (for a desire of
				superfluities attends a desire of necessaries), would not
				our lives be much more comfortable and life itself much
				more desirable?</p>
            <p>Yea, but Cleodemus stiffly maintains the necessity of
					eating and drinking, else we shall want tables and cups,
					and shall not be able to sacrifice to Ceres and Proserpina. By a parity of reason there is a necessity there
					should be contentions and wars, that men may have bulwarks and citadels and fortifications by land, fleets and
					navies abroad at sea, and that having slain hundreds,
					we may offer sacrifices (called Hecatomphonia) after the
					Messenian manner. By this reason we shall find men
					grudging their own health, for (they will say) there will be
					no need of down or feather beds unless they are sick; and
					so those healing Gods, and particularly Esculapius, will be
					vast sufferers, for they will infallibly lose so many fat and
					rich sacrifices yearly. Nay, the art of chirurgery will perish,
					and all those ingenious instruments that have been invented
					for the cure of man will lie by useless and insignificant.
					And what great difference is there between this and that?
					For meat is a medicine against hunger, and such as keep a
					regular diet are said to cure themselves,&mdash;I mean such as
					use meat not for wantonness but of necessity. For it is
					plain, the prejudices we receive by feeding far surmount
					the pleasures. And the pleasure of eating fills a very
					little place in our bodies and very little time. But why
					should I trouble you or myself with a catalogue of the many
					vexations which attend that man who is necessitated to
					provide for a family, and the many difficulties which distract him in his undertaking? For my part, I verily
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.32"/>

            <p>And before Solon had fully finished, in came Gorgias, Periander's brother, who was just returned from
				Tacnarum, whither he had been sent by the advice of the
				oracle to sacrifice to Neptune and to conduct a deputation.
				Upon his entrance we welcomed him home; and Periander having among the rest saluted him, Gorgias sat by
				him upon a bed, and privately whispered something to
				his brother which we could not hear. Periander by his
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.33"/>
				
				various gestures and motions discovered different affections;
				sometimes he seemed sad and melancholic, by and by disturbed and angry; frequently he looked as doubtful and
				distrustful men use to do; awhile after he lifts up his eyes
				as is usual with men in a maze. At last recovering himself, saith he, I have a mind to impart to you the contents
				of this embassy; but I scarce dare do it, remembering
				Thales's aphorism, how things impossible or incredible are
				to be concealed and only things credible and probable are
				to be related. Bias answered, I crave leave to explain
				Thales's saying, We may distrust enemies, even though
				they speak things credible, and trust friends, even though
				they relate things incredible; and I suppose by enemies
				he meant vicious men and foolish, and by friends, wise and

				relate the whole story particularly.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="18">
            <p>Gorgias in obedience to his brother's command
				began his story thus:&mdash;</p>
            <p>When we had fasted now for three days and offered sacrifice upon each of those days, we were all resolved to sit
					up the third night and spend it in pastime and dancing.
					The moon shone very bright upon the water, and the sea
					was exceeding calm and still; this we saw, for we sported
					ourselves upon the shore. Being thus taken up, all of a
					sudden we espied a wonderful spectacle off at sea, making
					with incredible expedition to the adjoining promontory.
					The violence of the motion made the sea foam again, and
					the noise was so loud, that the whole company forsook
					their sport and ran together toward the place, admiring
					what the matter should be. Before we could make a full
					discovery of the whole, the motion was so rapid, we perceived divers dolphins, some swimming in a ring or circle,
					others hastening amain to that part of the shore which was
					most smooth, and others following after and (as it were)
					bringing up the rear. In the middle there was a certain
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.34"/>
					
					heap which we could perceive above the water; but we
					could not distinctly apprehend what it was, till drawing
					near the shore we saw all the dolphins flocking together,
					and having made near the land they safely surrendered
					their charge, and left out of danger a man breathing and
					shaking himself. They returned to the promontory, and
					there seemed to rejoice more than before for this their fortunate undertaking. Divers in the company were affrighted
					and ran away; myself and a few more took courage, and
					went on to see and satisfy ourselves what this unusual matter might be; there we found and instantly knew our old
					acquaintance Arion the musician, who told us his name.
					He wore that very garment he used when he strove for
					mastery. We brought him into our tent and found he had
					received no damage in his passage, save only a little lassitude by the violence of the motion. He told us the whole
					story of his adventure,&mdash;a story incredible to all but such
					as saw it with their eyes. He told us how, when he had
					determined to leave Italy, being hastened away by Periander's letters, he went aboard a Corinthian merchantman
					then in port and ready to sail; being off at sea with the
					winds favorable, he observed the seamen bent to ruin him,
					and the master of the vessel told him as much, and that they
					purposed to execute their design upon him that very night.
					In this distress, the poor man (as if inspired by his good
					Genius) girds about him his heretofore victorious, now his
					funeral cloak, with a brave resolution to compose and sing
					his own epitaph, as the swans when they apprehend the approaches of death are reported to do. Being thus habited, he
					told the seamen he was minded to commit the protection of
					himself and his fellow-passengers to the providence of the
					Gods in a Pythian song; then standing upon the poop near
					the side of the vessel, and having invoked the help and
					assistance of all the sea Gods, he strikes up briskly and
					sings to his harp. Before he had half finished his carol,
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.35"/>
					
					the sun set, and he could discern Peloponnesus before him.
					The seamen thought it tedious to tarry for the night, wherefore they resolved to murder him immediately, to which
					purpose they unsheathed their swords. Seeing this, and
					beholding the master standing with his face covered, he
					leaped into the sea as far as he could; but before his body
					sunk he found himself supported by dolphins. At first he
					was surprised with care and trouble; but by and by, finding himself marching forward with much ease and security, and observing a whole shoal of dolphins flocking about
					him and joyfully contending which should appear most forward and serviceable in his preservation, and discerning the
					vessel at a considerable distance behind, he apprehended
					the nimbleness of his porters; then, and not till then, his
					fears forsook him, and he professed he was neither so fearful of death nor desirous of life as he was full of ambitious desire to reach the haven of safety, that he might
					show to all men that he stood in the grace and favor of the
					Gods, and that he might himself believe more firmly than
					ever before in their being and goodness. In his passage,
					as he lifted up his eyes toward heaven, and beheld the stars
					glittering and twinkling and the moon full and glorious,
					and the sea calm all about her as she seemed to rise out of
					it, and yielding him (as it were) a beaten track; he declared, he thought God's justice had more eyes than one,
					and that with these many eyes the Gods beheld what was
					acted here below both by sea and land. With such contemplations he performed his voyage less anxiously, which
					much abated the tediousness thereof and was a comfort
					and refreshment to him in his solitude and danger. At
					last, arriving near the promontory which was both steep
					and high, and fearing danger in a straight course and
					direct line, they unanimously veered about, and making to
					shore with a little compass for security, they delivered Arion
					to us in safety, so that he plainly perceived and with thanks
					acknowledged a Providence.</p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.36"/>
            <p>When Arion had finished this narrative of his escape,
					I asked him (quoth Gorgias) whither the ship was bound;
					he told me for Corinth, but it would not be there very
					suddenly, for when he leaped out of the ship and was
					carried (as he conceived) about five hundred furlongs, he
					perceived a calm, which must needs much retard their
					arrival who were aboard. Gorgias added that, having
					learned the names of the pilot and master and the colors
					of the ship, he immediately despatched out ships and soldiers to examine all the ports, all this while keeping Arion
					concealed, lest the criminals should upon notice of his
					deliverance escape the pursuit of justice. This action
					happened very luckily, as if it were directed by the power
					of the Gods; for as soon as he arrived at Corinth, news
					was brought him that the same ship was in port, and that
					his party had seized it and secured all the men, merchants
					and others. Whereupon Periander commended Gorgias's
					discretion and zeal, desiring him to proceed and lose no
					time, but immediately to clap them in close prison, and
					to suffer none to come at them to give the least notice of
					Arion's miraculous escape.</p>

            <p>Gentlemen, quoth Esop, I remember you derided
				my dialogue of the daws and crows; and now you can
				admire and believe as improbable a story of dolphins.
				You are mightily out, said I, for this is no new story
				which we believe, but it is recorded in the annals of Ino
				and Athamas above a thousand years ago. These passages
				are supernatural, quoth Solon, and much above our
				reason; what befell Hesiod is of a lower kind, and more
				proper for our discourse, and if you have not heard of it
				before, it is worth your hearing.</p>
            <p>Hesiod was once entertained at the same house in
					Locris with a certain Milesian. In this his sojourning
					time it happened the gentleman's daughter was got with
					child by the Milesian; which being discovered, the whole
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.37"/>
					
					family concluded Hesiod, if not guilty, must be privy to
					the fact. His innocence was but a weak fence against
					their jealousy and aspersions; and therefore, rashly censuring him guilty, the brothers of the woman waylaid him
					in his return home, and slew him and his companion
					Troilus near the temple of Nemean Jove in Locris. Their
					carcasses they threw into the sea; that of Troilus was
					carried into the river Daphnus, and rested upon a certain
					rock compassed with waters, just above the surface of
					the sea, which rock bears his name to this day. The
					body of Hesiod was no sooner fallen upon the surface
					of the water, but a company of dolphins received it,
					and conveyed it to Rhium and Molycria. It happened
					the Locrians were assembled at Rhium that day to
					feast and make merry, according to the custom which
					continues still among them. As soon as they perceived a
					carcass floating or rather swimming towards them, they
					hastened, not without admiration, to see what it was; and
					knowing the body to be Hesiod's, they instantly resolved
					to find out the murderers. It proved an easy discovery.
					After conviction they threw them headlong alive into the
					sea, and ordered their houses to be demolished to the very
					foundations. The body they buried in the grove of the
					temple of Jove, that no foreigner might find it out; the
					reason of this act was that the Orchomenians had searched
					far and near for it at the instigation of the oracle, who
					promised them the greatest felicity if they could get the
					bones of Hesiod and bury them in their city. Now if
					dolphins are so favorable to dead men, it is very probable they have a strong affection for the living, especially
					for such as delight in music, whether vocal or instrumental.
					And this we know undoubtedly, that these creatures delight infinitely in music; they love it, and if any man
					sings or plays as he sails along in fair weather, they will
					quietly swim by the side of the ship, and listen till the
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.38"/>
					
					music is ended. When children bathe in the water and
					sport themselves, you shall have a parcel of them flock
					together and sport and swim by them; and they may do
					it the more securely, since it is a breach of the law of
					Nature to hurt them. You never heard of any man that
					fishes for them purposely or hurts them wilfully, unless
					falling into the nets they spoil the sport, and so, like
					naughty children, are corrected for their misdemeanors.
					I very well remember the Lesbians told me how a maid
					of their town was preserved from drowning by them.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="20">
            <p>It was a very true story, quoth Pittacus, and there
				are divers still alive who will attest it, if need be. The
				builders or founders of Lesbos were commanded by the
				oracle to sail till they came to a haven called Mesogaeum,
				there they should sacrifice a bull to Neptune, and for the
				honor of Amphitrite and the sea-nymphs they should offer
				a virgin. The principal persons in this colony were seven
				in number; the eighth was one Echelaus by name, and
				appointed head of the rest by the oracle himself; and he
				was a bachelor. A daughter of one of these seven was to
				be sacrificed, but who it should be was to be decided by
				lot, and the lot fell upon Smintheus's sister. Her they
				dressed most richly, and so apparelled they conveyed her
				in abundance of state to the water-side, and having composed a prayer for her, they were now ready to throw her
				overboard. There was in the company a certain ingenuous
				young gentleman whose name was Enalus; he was desperately in love with this young lady, and his love prompted
				him to endeavor all he could for her preservation, or at
				least to perish in the attempt. In the very moment she
				was to be cast away, he clasps her in his arms and throws
				himself and her together into the sea. Shortly after there
				was a flying report they were both conveyed safe to land.
				A while after Enalus was seen at Lesbos, who gave out
				they were preserved by dolphins. I could tell you stories
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.39"/>
				
				more incredible than these, such as would amuse some and
				please others; but it is impossible to command men's
				faith. The sea was so tempestuous and rough, the people were afraid to come too near the waters, when Enalus
				arrived. A number of polypuses followed him even to
				Neptune's temple, the biggest and strongest of which
				carried a great stone. This Enalus dedicated, and this
				stone is therefore called Enalus to this day. To be short
				and to speak all in a few words,&mdash;he that knows how

				is no wonder that the most commendable acts are governed
