            <head>A LETTER OF CONDOLENCE TO APOLLONIUS (CONSOLATIO AD APOLLONIUM) <lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>The Letter of Condolence to Apollonius, into which quotations from earlier
					authors have been emptied from the sack rather than scattered by hand, has
					in comparatively recent years fallen under suspicion as being perhaps not
					the work of Plutarch. The suspicion rests mainly on two grounds, the unusual
					length of the quotations, and certain incongruities of style. The latter may
					here be briefly dismissed with the remark that for every departure from
					accepted Plutarchean style a striking instance of conformity to his style
					may be cited, so that no very positive results are to be obtained in this
					way. The case is much the same with the quotations. Many of them are
					unusually long, although not longer than we find in other authors. Some of
					them, for example Euripides, Suppliants 1110 and 1112 (Plut. 110c), show an
					accuracy of ms. tradition so far superior that the reading given by Plutarch
					is commonly adopted by editors of Euripides in preference to the traditional
					reading of the mss. of Euripides. On the other hand, the quotation from
					Plato, Gorgias 523 a (Plut. 120 e), shows many minor variations from our
					text of Plato ; some of these are interesting in themselves, but none of
					them really disturbs the meaning of the passage. </p>
            <p>We learn from the letter almost nothing about <pb id="v.2.p.106"/> Apollonius
					and his departed son, and hardly more about Plutarch. It lacks the intimate
					touch of a similar letter which was written by Plutarch to his wife
					(Moralia, 608 a). Indeed we cannot be wholly sure that the boy was called
					Apollonius after his father, for one stroke of the pen to change the
					accusative to a vocative (121 e) would cause his name to disappear entirely. </p>
            <p>The title of the letter is not found in Lamprias' list of Plutarch's works,
					nevertheless we have reference to it at a comparatively early date. </p>
            <p>Some striking similarities between the letter and Cicero's Tusculan
					Disputations are doubtless to be explained by derivation from a common
					source, and this source was doubtless in large part the works of the
					Academic philosopher Crantor. </p>
            <p>In the absence of actual knowledge it is convenient to assume an hypothesis
					(as in the realm of science one speaks of <q direct="unspecified">atoms</q> or <q direct="unspecified">
						ions</q> or of the electric <q direct="unspecified">current</q>). If we assume
					that this is the original rough draft of the letter which was to be sent to
					Apollonius, nearly everything can be made to square with the hypothesis. In
					selecting some of the quotations Plutarch had put down enough of the
					context, so that later the lines he might finally choose to insert could be
					smoothly interwoven with the text, and the text itself was no doubt to be
					subjected to further polish. </p>
            <p>However, we may be profoundly grateful for the collection of extracts
					included in the letter, and, if the hypothesis be right, we may also be
					grateful for this glimpse of Plutarch's methods of composition. </p>
            <p>We must bear in mind that this particular form of literary composition had
					developed a style of its <pb id="v.2.p.107"/> own, the earliest example
					perhaps being the Axiochus (of Plato ?), and we have records of many more
					now lost. Among the Romans also this form of composition was popular, and
					several examples may be found in the works of Seneca. </p>

            <p>Even before this time, Apollonius, I felt for you in your sorrow and trouble,
					when I heard of the untimely passing from life of your son, who was very
					dear to us all&mdash;a youth who was altogether decorous and modest, and
					unusually observant of the demands of religion and justice both toward the
					gods and toward his parents and friends. In those days, close upon the time
					of his death, to visit you and urge you to bear your present lot as a mortal
					man should would have been unsuitable, when you were prostrated in both body
					and soul by the unexpected calamity ; and, besides, I could not help sharing
					in your feeling. For even the best of physicians do not at once apply the
					remedy of medicines against acute attacks of suppurating humours, but allow
					the painfulness of the inflammation, without the application of external
					medicaments, to attain some assuagement of itself.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

            <p>Reason therefore requires that men of understanding should be neither

					course is unfeeling and brutal, the other lax and effeminate. Sensible is he
					who keeps within appropriate bounds and is able to bear judiciously both the
					agreeable and the grievous in his lot, and who has made up his mind
					beforehand to conform uncomplainingly and obediently to the dispensation of
					things ; just as in a democracy there is an allotment of offices, and he who
					draws the lot holds office, while he who fails to do so must bear his
					fortune without taking offence. For those who cannot do this would be unable

					toward adversity. For it is the task of rational prudence, either to be on
					guard against evil as it approaches, or, if it have already happened, to
					rectify it or to minimize it or to provide oneself with a virile and noble
					patience to endure it. For wisdom deals also with the good, in a fourfold
					way&mdash; either acquiring a store of goods, or conserving them, or
					adding to them, or using them judiciously. These are the laws of wisdom and

					          <q direct="unspecified">in countless ways leaves us no leisure because of its necessary care
						and feeding. Moreover, if any diseases invade it, they hinder our
						pursuit of reality, and it fills us with lusts and desires and fears and
						all manner of fancies and folly, so that, as the saying goes, because of
						it we really have no opportunity to think seriously of anything. It is a
						fact that wars and strifes and battles are brought about by nothing else
						except the body and its desires ; for all wars are waged for the
						acquisition of property, and property we are forced to acquire because
						of the body, since we are slaves in its service ; and the result is
						that, because of these things, we have no leisure for study. And the
						worst of all is, that even if we do gain some leisure from the demands
						of the body, and turn to the consideration of some subject, yet at every
						point in our investigation the body forces itself in, and causes tumult
						and confusion, and disconcerts us, so that on account of it we are
						unable to discern the truth. Nay, the fact has been thoroughly
						demonstrated to us that, if we are ever going to have any pure
						knowledge, we must divest ourselves of the body, and with the soul
						itself observe the realities. And, as it appears, we shall possess what
						we desire and what we profess to long for&mdash;and that is
						wisdom&mdash;only, as our reasoning shows, after we are dead, but
						not <pb id="v.2.p.143"/> while we are alive. For if it is impossible in
						company with the body to have any pure knowledge, then one of two things
						is true : either it is not possible to attain knowledge anywhere, or
						else only after death. For then the soul will be quite by itself,
						separate from the body, but before that time never. And so, while we
						live, we shall, as it appears, be nearest to knowledge if, as far as
						possible, we have no association or communion with the body, except such
						as absolute necessity requires, and if we do not taint ourselves with
						its nature, but keep ourselves pure of it until such time as God himself
						shall release us. And thus, being rid of the irrationality of the body,
						we shall, in all likelihood, be in the company of others in like state,
						and we shall behold with our own eyes the pure and absolute, which is
						the truth ; since for the impure to touch the pure may well be against

					sacrifice prescribed by custom, he lay down to sleep in the place, and had
					this vision. It seemed that his own father came to him, and that on seeing
					his father he related to him what had happened touching his son, and begged
					and besought his help to discover the man who was responsible for his son's

					<pb id="v.2.p.161"/> selfish; for it will be plain that they mourn, not

					then if they will fix their attention on the fact that the dead are in no

            <p>That this is easy is plainly to be seen from the following sort of

					it was only right that some honour be given to her also, Zeus, being
					perplexed, since all the honours had been used up, finally gave her that
					honour which is paid in the case of those who have died&mdash;tears and
					griefs. Just as the other deities, therefore, are fond of those by whom they
					are honoured, so also is Mourning. <q direct="unspecified">Therefore, Madame, if you treat

					are more given to it than men, and barbarians more than Greeks, and inferior

         <div1 type="section" n="23">
            <p>But I dare say that, in answer to this, some may assert their belief that
					there need not be mourning for every death, but only for untimely deaths,
					because of the failure of the dead to gain what are commonly held to be the
					advantages of life, such as marriage, education, manhood, citizenship, or
					public office (for these are the considerations, they say, which most cause
					grief to those who suffer misfortune through untimely deaths, since they are
					robbed of their hope out of due time) ; but they do not realize that the
					untimely death shows no disparity if it be considered with reference to the
					<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Nauck, Trag. Graec. Frag. p. 743, Ion, No. 54.</note>
					          <pb id="v.2.p.169"/> common lot of man. For just as when it has been decided
					to migrate to a new fatherland, and the journey is compulsory for all, and
					none by entreaty can escape it, some go on ahead and others follow after,
					but all come to the same place; in the same manner, of all who are
					journeying toward Destiny those who come more tardily have no advantage over
					those who arrive earlier. If it be true that untimely death is an evil, the
					most untimely would be that of infants and children, and still more that of
					the newly born. But such deaths we bear easily and cheerfully, but the
					deaths of those who have already lived some time with distress and mourning
					because of our fanciful notion, born of vain hopes, since we have come to
					feel quite assured of the continued tarrying with us of persons who have
					lived so long. But if the years of man's life were but twenty, we should
					feel that he who passed away at fifteen had not died untimely, but that he
					had already attained an adequate measure of age, while the man who had
					completed the prescribed period of twenty years, or who had come close to
					the count of twenty years, we should assuredly deem happy as having lived
					through a most blessed and perfect life. But if the length of life were two
					hundred years, we should certainly feel that he who came to his end at one
					hundred was cut off untimely, and we should betake ours elves to wailing and
					lamentation. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="24">
            <p>It is evident, therefore, that even the death which we call untimely readily

					          <pb id="v.2.p.171"/> and if Priam had died earlier, while his kingdom and

					          <quote rend="blockquote">Come then within the walled city, my son, so to

					offerings of sacrifice,&mdash;if the departed one is now a partaker in

					ought not to wait for that outcome which has already been the lot of many in

						the discourse, said : ' That not to be born is the best of all, and that
						to be dead is better than to live. And the proof that this is so has
						been given to many men by the deity. So, for example, they say that
						Silenus, after the hunt in which Midas of yore had captured him, when
						Midas questioned and inquired of him what is the best thing for mankind
						and what is the most preferable of all things, was at first unwilling to
						teli, but maintained a stubborn silence. But when at last, by employing
						every device, Midas induced him to say something to him, Silenus, forced
						to speak, said : <q direct="unspecified">Ephemeral offspring of a travailing genius and

							woes is most free from grief. But for men it is utterly impossible
							that they should obtain the best thing of all, or even have any
							share in its nature (for the best thing for all men and women is not
							to be born) ; however, the next best thing to this, and the first of

            <p>Ah well, but he, bearing with him the fair and fitting fame of your

            <p>The divine Plato has said a good deal in his treatise On the Soul about its
					immortality, and not a little also in the Republic and Meno and Gorgias, and
					here and there in his other dialogues. What is said in the dialogue On the
					Soul I will copy, with comments, and send you separately, as you desired.
					But for the present occasion these words, which were spoken 
					<pb id="v.2.p.207"/> to Callicles the Athenian, the friend and disciple of
					Gorgias the orator, are timely and profitable. They say that Socrates,
					according to Plato's account,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Gorgias</hi>, p. 523 A.</note> says : <q direct="unspecified">Listen to a very beautiful
						story, which you, I imagine, will regard as a myth, but which I regard
						as a story; for what I am going to say I shall relate as true. As Homer <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                     <hi rend="italics">Iliad</hi>, xv. 187.</note>
						tells the tale, Zeus, Poseidon, and Pluto divided the kingdom when they
						received it from their father. Now this was the custom regarding men
						even in the time of Cronus, and it has persisted among the gods to this
						day&mdash;that the man who has passed through life justly and in
						holiness shall, at his death, depart to the Islands of the Blest and
						dwell in all happiness beyond the reach of evil, while he who has lived
						an unjust and godless life shall go to the prison-house of justice and
						punishment, which they call Tartarus. The judges of these men, in the
						time of Cronus and in the early days of Zeus's dominion, were living,
						and judged the living, giving judgement on the day when the men were
						about to die. As time went on, for some reason the cases were not
						decided well. Accordingly Pluto and the supervisors in the Islands of
						the Blest went to Zeus and said to him that there kept coming to them at
						both places inadmissible persons. ' Very well,' said Zeus, ' then I
						shall put a stop to this proceeding. The judgements are now rendered
						poorly ; for,' said he, ' those who are judged are judged with a
						covering on them, since they are judged while alive, and so,' he
						continued, a good 
						<pb id="v.2.p.209"/> many perhaps who have base souls are clad with
						beautiful bodies and ancestry and riches, and, when the judgement takes
						place, many come to testify for them that they have lived righteously.
						So not only are the judges disconcerted by these things, but at the same
						time they themselves sit in judgement with a covering on them, having
						before their own souls, like a veil, their eyes and ears and their whole
						body. All these things come between, both their own covering and that of
						those who are being judged. In the first place, then, all their
						foreknowledge of death must be ended ; for now they have foreknowledge
						of it. So Prometheus has been told to put an end to this. Secondly, they
						must be judged divested of all these things ; for they must be judged
						after they have died. The judge also must be naked, and dead, that he
						may view with his very soul the very soul of every man instantly after
						he has died, and isolated from all his kin, having left behind on earth
						all earthly adornments, so that his judgement may be just. I, therefore,
						realizing this situation sooner than you, have made my own sons judges,
						two from Asia&mdash;Minos and Rhadamanthys‚Äîand one from
						Europe‚ÄîAeacus. These, then, as soon as they have died, shall sit in
						judgement in the meadow at the parting of the ways whence the two roads
						lead, the one to the Islands of the Blest and the other to Tartarus. The
						people of Asia shall Rhadamanthys judge, while Aeacus shall judge the
						people of Europe; and to Minos I shall give the prerogative of
						pronouncing final judgement in case the other 
						<pb id="v.2.p.211"/> two be in any doubt, in order that the decision in
						regard to the route which men must take shall be as just as possible.'
						This, Callicles, is what I have heard, and believe to be true ; and from
						these words I draw the following inference‚Äîthat death is, as it seems
						to me, nothing else than the severing of two things, soul and body, from
						each other.</q>

            <p>Having collected and put together these extracts, my dearest Apollonius, with
					great diligence, I have completed this letter of condolence to you, which is
					most needful to enable you to put aside your present grief and to put an end
					to mourning, which is the most distressing of all things. In it is included
					also for your son, Apollonius, a youth so very dear to the gods, a fitting
					tribute, which is much coveted by the sanctified&mdash;a tribute due to
					his honourable memory and to his fair fame, which will endure for time
					eternal. You will do well, therefore, to be persuaded by reason, and, as a
					favour to your dear departed son, to turn from your unprofitable distress
					and desolation, which affect both body and soul, and to go back to your
					accustomed and natural course of life. Forasmuch as your son, while he was
					living among us, was sorry to see either you or his mother downcast, even
					so, now that he is with the gods and is feasting with them, he would not be
					well satisfied with your present course of life. Resume, therefore, the
					spirit of a brave-hearted and high-minded man who loves his offspring, and
					set free from all this wretchedness both yourself, the mother of the youth,
					and your relatives and friends, as you may do by pursuing a more tranquil
					form of life, which will be most gratifying both to your son and to all of
					us who are concerned for you, as we rightly should be. </p>
