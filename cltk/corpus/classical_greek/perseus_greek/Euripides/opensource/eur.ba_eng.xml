<sp n="Dionysus">
<speaker>Dionysus</speaker>
<p>I, the son of Zeus, have come to this land of the Thebans&mdash;Dionysus, whom once Semele, Kadmos' daughter, bore, delivered by a lightning-bearing flame. And having taken a mortal form instead of a god's, <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> I am here at the fountains of Dirke and the water of Ismenus. And I see the tomb of my thunder-stricken mother here near the palace, and the remnants of her house, smouldering with the still living flame of Zeus' fire, the everlasting insult of Hera against my mother. <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> I praise Kadmos, who has made this place hallowed, the shrine of his daughter; and I have covered it all around with the cluster-bearing leaf of the vine.</p>
<p>I have left the wealthy lands of the Lydians and Phrygians, the sun-parched plains of the Persians, <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> and the Bactrian walls, and have passed over the wintry land of the Medes, and blessed <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, and all of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> which lies along the coast of the salt sea with its beautifully-towered cities full of Hellenes and barbarians mingled together; <milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> and I have come to this Hellene city first, having already set those other lands to dance and established my mysteries there, so that I might be a deity manifest among men. In this land of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, I have first excited <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> to my cry, fitting a fawn-skin to my body and <milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/> taking a thyrsos in my hand, a weapon of ivy. For my mother's sisters, the ones who least should, claimed that I, Dionysus, was not the child of Zeus, but that Semele had conceived a child from a mortal father and then ascribed the sin of her bed to Zeus, <milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/> a trick of Kadmos', for which they boasted that Zeus killed her, because she had told a false tale about her marriage. Therefore I have goaded them from the house in frenzy, and they dwell in the mountains, out of their wits; and I have compelled them to wear the outfit of my mysteries. <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/> And all the female offspring of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, as many as are women, I have driven maddened from the house, and they, mingled with the daughters of Kadmos, sit on roofless rocks beneath green pines. For this city must learn, even if it is unwilling, <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/> that it is not initiated into my Bacchic rites, and that I plead the case of my mother, Semele, in appearing manifest to mortals as a divinity whom she bore to Zeus.</p>
<milestone ed="p" n="43" unit="card"/>
<p>Now Kadmos has given his honor and power to Pentheus, his daughter's son, <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/> who fights against the gods as far as I am concerned and drives me away from sacrifices, and in his prayers makes no mention of me, for which I will show him and all the Thebans that I was born a god. And when I have set matters here right, I will move on to another land, <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/> revealing myself. But if ever the city of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> should in anger seek to drive the the Bacchae down from the mountains with arms, I, the general of the Maenads, will join battle with them. On which account I have changed my form to a mortal one and altered my shape into the nature of a man. <milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/> But, you women who have left Tmolus, the bulwark of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, my sacred band, whom I have brought from among the barbarians as assistants and companions to me, take your drums, native instruments of the city of the Phrygians, the invention of mother Rhea and myself, <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/> and going about this palace of Pentheus beat them, so that Kadmos' city may see. I myself will go to the folds of Kithairon, where the Bacchae are, to share in their dances.

<p>From the land of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> having left sacred Tmolus, I am swift to perform for Bromius my sweet labor and toil easily borne, celebrating the god Bacchus<note anchored="yes" resp="Buckley">Lit. shouting the ritual cry <foreign lang="greek">eu)oi=</foreign>.</note>.

<p>Blessed is he who, being fortunate and knowing the rites of the gods, keeps his life pure and <milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/> has his soul initiated into the Bacchic revels, dancing in inspired frenzy over the mountains with holy purifications, and who, revering the mysteries of great mother Kybele, <milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/> brandishing the thyrsos, garlanded with ivy, serves Dionysus.</p>
<p>Go, Bacchae, go, Bacchae, escorting the god Bromius, child of a god, <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/> from the Phrygian mountains to the broad streets of Hellas&mdash;Bromius,<milestone ed="p" n="88" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>

<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/> Who is at the gates? Call from the house Kadmos, son of Agenor, who leaving the city of <placeName key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</placeName> built this towering city of the Thebans. Let someone go and announce that Teiresias is looking for him. He knows why I have come and <milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/> what agreement I, an old man, have made with him, older still: to twine the thyrsoi, to wear fawn-skins, and to crown our heads with ivy branches.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Dearest friend, for inside the house I heard and recognized your wise voice, the voice of a wise man;<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/> I have come prepared with this equipment of the god. For we must extol him, the child of my daughter, &lsqb;Dionysus, who has appeared as a god to men&rsqb; as much as is in our power. Where must I dance, where set my feet <milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/> and shake my grey head? Show me the way, Teiresias, one old man leading another; for you are wise. And so I shall never tire night or day striking the ground with the thyrsos. Gladly I have forgotten that I am old.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p>Then you and I have the same feelings, <milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/> for I too feel young and will try to dance.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Then will we go to the mountain in a chariot?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p>But then the god would not have equal honor.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>I, an old man, will lead you, an old man, like a pupil.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p>The god will lead us there without trouble.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/> Are we the only ones in the city who will dance in Bacchus' honor?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p>Yes, for we alone think rightly, the rest wrongly.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>The delay is long; come, take hold of my hand.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p>Here, take hold, and join your hand with mine.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Having been born mortal I do not scorn the gods.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/> We mortals have no cleverness in the eyes of the the gods.<note anchored="yes" resp="Buckley">Dodds admits that the text, as it appears in <placeName key="tgn,2532811">Murray</placeName>, should be translated this way, but feels that the line should mean &ldquo;nor do we use cleverness on the gods&rdquo; or something similar. He argues for another reading that would allow this.</note> Our ancestral traditions, and those which we have held throughout our lives, no argument will overturn, not even if some craftiness should be discovered by the depths of our wits. <note anchored="yes" resp="Buckley">This translation, though literal, fudges on the meaning: a)krai\ fre/nes must mean something like &ldquo;best&rdquo; or &ldquo;most subtle minds.&rdquo;</note> Will anyone say that I do not respect old age, <milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/> being about to dance with my head covered in ivy? No, for the god has made no distinction as to whether it is right for men young or old to dance, but wishes to have common honors from all and to be extolled, setting no one apart.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/> Since you do not see this light, Teiresias, I will be your interpreter. Pentheus, child of Echion, to whom I gave control of this land, is coming here to the house now in haste. How fluttered he is! What new matter will he tell us?<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pentheus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/> I happened to be at a distance from this land, when I heard of strange evils throughout this city, that the women have left our homes in contrived Bacchic rites, and rush about in the shadowy mountains, honoring with dances <milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/> this new deity Dionysus, whoever he is. I hear that mixing-bowls stand full in the midst of their assemblies, and that they each creep off different ways into secrecy to serve the beds of men, on the pretext that they are Maenads worshipping; <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/> but they consider Aphrodite before Bacchus.</p>
<p>As many of them as I have caught, servants keep in the public strongholds with their hands bound, and as many as are absent I will hunt from the mountains, &lsqb;I mean Ino and Agave, who bore me to Echion, and <milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/> Autonoe, the mother of Actaeon.&rsqb; And having bound them in iron fetters, I will soon stop them from this ill-working revelry. And they say that some stranger has come, a sorcerer, a conjuror from the Lydian land, <milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/> fragrant in hair with golden curls, having in his eyes the wine-dark graces of Aphrodite. He is with the young girls day and night, alluring them with joyful mysteries. If I catch him within this house, <milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/> I will stop him from making a noise with the thyrsos and shaking his hair, by cutting his head off.</p>
<p>That one claims that Dionysus is a god, claims that he was once stitched into the thigh of Zeus&mdash;Dionysus, who was burnt up with his mother by the flame of lightning, <milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/> because she had falsely claimed a marriage with Zeus. Is this not worthy of a terrible death by hanging, for a stranger to insult me with these insults, whoever he is?</p>
<p>But here is another wonder&mdash;I see Teiresias the soothsayer in dappled fawn-skins <milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/> and my mother's father&mdash;a great absurdity&mdash;raging about with a thyrsos. I shrink, father, from seeing your old age devoid of sense. Won't you cast away the ivy? Grandfather, will you not free your hand of the thyrsos? <milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/> You persuaded him to this, Teiresias. Do you wish, by introducing another new god to men, to examine birds and receive rewards for sacrifices? If your gray old age did not defend you, you would sit in chains in the midst of the Bacchae, <milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/> for introducing wicked rites. For where women have the delight of the grape-cluster at a feast, I say that none of their rites is healthy any longer.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>Oh, what impiety! O stranger, do you not reverence the gods and Kadmos who sowed the earth-born crop? <milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/> Do you, the child of Echion, bring shame to your race?<milestone ed="p" n="266" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp n="Teiresias">
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>
<p> Whenever a wise man takes a good occasion for his speech, it is not a great task to speak well. You have a rapid tongue as though you were sensible, but there is no sense in your words. <milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/> A man powerful in his boldness, one capable of speaking well, becomes a bad citizen in his lack of sense. This new god, whom you ridicule, I am unable to express how great he will be throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. For two things, young man, <milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/> are first among men: the goddess Demeter&mdash;she is the earth, but call her whatever name you wish; she nourishes mortals with dry food; but he who came afterwards, the offspring of Semele, discovered a match to it, the liquid drink of the grape, and introduced it <milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/> to mortals. It releases wretched mortals from grief, whenever they are filled with the stream of the vine, and gives them sleep, a means of forgetting their daily troubles, nor is there another cure for hardships. He who is a god is poured out in offerings to the gods, <milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/> so that by his means men may have good things.</p>
<p>And do you laugh at him, because he was sewn up in Zeus' thigh? I will teach you that this is well: when Zeus snatched him out of the lighting-flame, and led the child as a god to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/> Hera wished to banish him from the sky, but Zeus, as a god, had a counter-contrivance. Having broken a part of the air which surrounds the earth, he gave this to Hera as a pledge &lt;protecting the real&gt; <note anchored="yes" resp="Buckley">A line of text has apparently been lost here.</note>Dionysus from her hostility. But in time, <milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/> mortals say that he was nourished in the thigh of Zeus, changing the word, because a god he had served as a hostage for the goddess Hera, and composing the story. <note anchored="yes" resp="Buckley">The account given in lines 292f. of the development of this legend is based on the similarity between the Greek words for hostage &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">o(/mhros</foreign>&rpar; and thigh &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">mhro/s</foreign>&rpar;.</note></p>
<milestone ed="p" n="298" unit="card"/>
<p>But this god is a prophet&mdash;for Bacchic revelry and madness have in them much prophetic skill. <milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/> For whenever the god enters a body in full force, he makes the frantic to foretell the future. He also possesses a share of Ares' nature. For terror sometimes flutters an army under arms and in its ranks before it even touches a spear; <milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/> and this too is a frenzy from Dionysus. You will see him also on the rocks of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, bounding with torches through the highland of two peaks, leaping and shaking the Bacchic branch, mighty throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. But believe me, Pentheus; <milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>do not boast that sovereignty has power among men, nor, even if you think so, and your mind is diseased, believe that you are being at all wise. Receive the god into your land, pour libations to him, celebrate the Bacchic rites, and garland your head.</p>
<p>Dionysus will not compel women <milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/> to be modest in regard to Aphrodite, but in nature &lsqb;modesty dwells always&rsqb; you must look for that. For she who is modest will not be corrupted in Bacchic revelry. Do you see? You rejoice whenever many people are at your gates, <milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/> and the city extols the name of Pentheus. He too, I think, delights in being honored. Kadmos, whom you mock, and I will crown our heads with ivy and dance, a gray yoke-team but still we must dance; <milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/> and I will not be persuaded by your words to fight against the god. For you are mad in a most grievous way, and you will not be cured by drugs, nor are you sick without them.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>Old man, you do not shame Phoebus with your words, and honoring Dionysus, a great god, you are prudent.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/> My child, Teiresias has advised you well. Dwell with us, not apart from the laws. For now you flit about and have thoughts without thinking. Even if, as you say, he is not a god, call him one; and tell a glorious falsehood, <milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/> so that Semele might seem to have borne a god, and honor might come to all our race. You see the wretched fate of Actaeon, who was torn apart in the meadows by the blood-thirsty hounds he had raised, <milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/> having boasted that he was superior in the hunt to Artemis. May you not suffer this. Come, let me crown your head with ivy; honor the god along with us.<milestone ed="p" n="343" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pentheus</speaker>
<p>Don't lay a hand on me! Go off and hold your revels, but don't wipe your foolishness off on me. I will seek the punishment of this <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/> teacher of your folly. Let someone go quickly to the seat where he watches the flights of birds, upset and overturn it with levers, turning everything upside down; <milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/> and release his garlands to the winds and storms. In this way I will especially wound him. And some of you hunt throughout the city for this effeminate stranger, who introduces a new disease to women and pollutes our beds. <milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/> If you catch him, bring him here bound, so that he might suffer as punishment a death by stoning, having seen a bitter Bacchic revelry in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teiresias</speaker>

<p>The herds of grazing cattle were just climbing up the hill, at the time when the sun sends forth its rays, warming the earth. <milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/> I saw three companies of dancing women, one of which Autonoe led, the second your mother Agave, and the third Ino.

<p>Your mother raised a cry, <milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/> standing up in the midst of the Bacchae, to wake their bodies from sleep, when she heard the lowing of the horned cattle. And they, casting off refreshing sleep from their eyes, sprang upright, a marvel of orderliness to behold, old, young, and still unmarried virgins. <milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/> First they let their hair loose over their shoulders, and secured their fawn-skins, as many of them as had released the fastenings of their knots, girding the dappled hides with serpents licking their jaws. And some, holding in their arms a gazelle or wild <milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line"/> wolf-pup, gave them white milk, as many as had abandoned their new-born infants and had their breasts still swollen. They put on garlands of ivy, and oak, and flowering yew. One took her thyrsos and struck it against a rock, <milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line"/> from which a dewy stream of water sprang forth. Another let her thyrsos strike the ground, and there the god sent forth a fountain of wine.

<p>We herdsmen and shepherds gathered in order to <milestone ed="p" n="715" unit="line"/> debate with one another concerning what strange and amazing things they were doing. Some one, a wanderer about the city and practised in speaking, said to us all: &ldquo;You who inhabit the holy plains of the mountains, do you wish to hunt <milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/> Pentheus' mother Agave out from the Bacchic revelry and do the king a favor?&rdquo; We thought he spoke well, and lay down in ambush, hiding ourselves in the foliage of bushes. They, at the appointed hour, began to wave the thyrsos in their revelries, <milestone ed="p" n="725" unit="line"/> calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice. The whole mountain revelled along with them and the beasts, and nothing was unmoved by their running.</p>

<p>Agave happened to be leaping near me, and I sprang forth, wanting to snatch her, <milestone ed="p" n="730" unit="line"/> abandoning the ambush where I had hidden myself.

<p>We fled and escaped <milestone ed="p" n="735" unit="line"/> from being torn apart by the Bacchae, but they, with unarmed hands, sprang on the heifers browsing the grass. and you might see one rending asunder a fatted lowing calf, while others tore apart cows. <milestone ed="p" n="740" unit="line"/> You might see ribs or cloven hooves tossed here and there; caught in the trees they dripped, dabbled in gore. Bulls who before were fierce, and showed their fury with their horns, stumbled to the ground, <milestone ed="p" n="745" unit="line"/> dragged down by countless young hands. The garment of flesh was torn apart faster then you could blink your royal eyes. And like birds raised in their course, they proceeded along the level plains, which by the streams of the Asopus <milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line"/> produce the bountiful Theban crop. And falling like soldiers upon Hysiae and Erythrae, towns situated below the rock of Kithairon, they turned everything upside down. They were snatching children from their homes; <milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line"/> and whatever they put on their shoulders, whether bronze or iron, was not held on by bonds, nor did it fall to the ground. They carried fire on their locks, but it did not burn them. Some people in rage took up arms, being plundered by the Bacchae, <milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/> and the sight of this was terrible to behold, lord. For their pointed spears drew no blood, but the women, hurling the thyrsoi from their hands, kept wounding them and turned them to flight&mdash;women did this to men, not without the help of some god. <milestone ed="p" n="765" unit="line"/> And they returned where they had come from, to the very fountains which the god had sent forth for them, and washed off the blood, and snakes cleaned the drops from the women's cheeks with their tongues.</p>
<p>Receive this god then, whoever he is, <milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line"/> into this city, master. For he is great in other respects, and they say this too of him, as I hear, that he gives to mortals the vine that puts an end to grief. Without wine there is no longer Aphrodite or any other pleasant thing for men.

<p>Already like fire does this insolence of the Bacchae blaze up, a great reproach for the Hellenes. <milestone ed="p" n="780" unit="line"/> But we must not hesitate. Go to the Electran gates, bid all the shield-bearers and riders of swift-footed horses to assemble, as well as all who brandish the light shield and pluck bowstrings with their hands, so that we can make an assault against <milestone ed="p" n="785" unit="line"/> the Bacchae.

<p>When we left the dwellings of the Theban land and crossed the streams of Asopus, <milestone ed="p" n="1045" unit="line"/> we began to ascend the heights of Kithairon, Pentheus and I&mdash;for I was following my master&mdash;and the stranger who was our guide to the sight. First we sat in a grassy vale, <milestone ed="p" n="1050" unit="line"/> keeping our feet and voices quiet, so that we might see them without being seen. There was a little valley surounded by precipices, irrigated with streams, shaded by pine trees, where the Maenads were sitting, their hands busy with delightful labors. Some of them were crowning again <milestone ed="p" n="1055" unit="line"/> the worn thyrsos, making it leafy with ivy, while some, like colts freed from the painted yoke, were singing a Bacchic melody to one another. And the unhappy Pentheus said, not seeing the crowd of women: &ldquo;Stranger, <milestone ed="p" n="1060" unit="line"/> from where we are standing I cannot see these false Maenads. But on the hill, ascending a lofty pine, I might view properly the shameful acts of the Maenads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I saw the stranger perform a marvelous deed. For seizing hold of the lofty top-most branch of the pine tree, <milestone ed="p" n="1065" unit="line"/> he pulled it down, pulled it, pulled it to the dark earth. It was bent just as a bow or a curved wheel, when it is marked out by a compass, describes a circular course <note anchored="yes" resp="Buckley">The sense of the text here is not clear. The translation &lpar;which follows Dodds&rpar; assumes that the &ldquo;curved wheel&rdquo; is not a hollow circle connected to the hub by spokes, but a single piece of wood which has been cut into the shape of a circle. In the action described, a peg &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">to/rnos</foreign>&rpar; is fixed into the center of the word-section. A string with a piece of chalk on one end is then attached to the peg, and the chalk, held tight against the string, is able to mark out an even circle. The bending of the tree thus resembles the circular path taken by the chalk.</note>: in this way the stranger drew the mountain bough with his hands and bent it to the earth, doing no mortal's deed. <milestone ed="p" n="1070" unit="line"/> He sat Pentheus down on the pine branch, and let it go upright through his hands steadily, taking care not to shake him off. The pine stood firmly upright into the sky, with my master seated on its back. <milestone ed="p" n="1075" unit="line"/> He was seen by the Maenads more than he saw them, for sitting on high he was all but apparent, and the stranger was no longer anywhere to be seen, when a voice, Dionysus as I guess, cried out from the air: &ldquo;Young women, <milestone ed="p" n="1080" unit="line"/> I bring the one who has made you and me and my rites a laughing-stock. Now punish him!&rdquo; And as he said this a light of holy fire was placed between heaven and earth.<milestone ed="p" n="1084" unit="card"/></p>
<p>The air became quiet and the woody glen <milestone ed="p" n="1085" unit="line"/> kept its leaves silent, nor would you have heard the sounds of animals. But they, not having heard the sound clearly, stood upright and looked all around. He repeated his order, and when the daughters of Kadmos recognized the clear command of Bacchus, <milestone ed="p" n="1090" unit="line"/> they rushed forth, swift as a dove, running with eager speed of feet, his mother Agave, and her sisters, and all the Bacchae. They leapt through the torrent-streaming valley and mountain cliffs, frantic with the inspiration of the god. <milestone ed="p" n="1095" unit="line"/> When they saw my master sitting in the pine, first they climbed a rock towering opposite the tree and began to hurl at him boulders violently thrown. Some aimed with pine branches and other women hurled their thyrsoi through the air <milestone ed="p" n="1100" unit="line"/> at Pentheus, a sad target indeed. But they did not reach him, for the wretched man, caught with no way out, sat at a height too great for their eagerness. Finally like lightning they smashed oak branches and began to tear up the roots of the tree with ironless levers. <milestone ed="p" n="1105" unit="line"/> When they did not succeed in their toils, Agave said: &ldquo;Come, standing round in a circle, each seize a branch, Maenads, so that we may catch the beast who has climbed aloft, and so that he does not make public the secret dances of the god.&rdquo; They applied countless hands <milestone ed="p" n="1110" unit="line"/> to the pine and dragged it up from the earth. Pentheus fell crashing to the ground from his lofty seat, wailing greatly: for he knew he was in terrible trouble.</p>
<milestone ed="p" n="1114" unit="card"/>
<p>His mother, as priestess, began the slaughter, <milestone ed="p" n="1115" unit="line"/> and fell upon him. He threw the headband from his head so that the wretched Agave might recognize and not kill him. Touching her cheek, he said: &ldquo;It is I, mother, your son, Pentheus, whom you bore in the house of Echion. <milestone ed="p" n="1120" unit="line"/> Pity me, mother, and do not kill me, your child, for my sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she, foaming at the mouth and twisting her eyes all about, not thinking as she ought, was possessed by Bacchus, and he did not persuade her. <milestone ed="p" n="1125" unit="line"/> Seizing his left arm at the elbow and propping her foot against the unfortunate man's side, she tore out his shoulder, not by her own strength, but the god gave facility to her hands. Ino began to work on the other side, <milestone ed="p" n="1130" unit="line"/> tearing his flesh, while Autonoe and the whole crowd of the Bacchae pressed on. All were making noise together, he groaning as much as he had life left in him, while they shouted in victory. One of them bore his arm, another a foot, boot and all. His ribs were stripped bare <milestone ed="p" n="1135" unit="line"/> from their tearings. The whole band, hands bloodied, were playing a game of catch with Pentheus' flesh.</p>
<p>His body lies in different places, part under the rugged rocks, part in the deep foliage of the woods, not easy to be sought. His miserable head, <milestone ed="p" n="1140" unit="line"/> which his mother happened to take in her hands, she fixed on the end of a thyrsos and carries through the midst of Kithairon like that of a savage lion, leaving her sisters among the Maenads' dances. She is coming inside these walls, preening herself <milestone ed="p" n="1145" unit="line"/> on the ill-fated prey, calling Bacchus her fellow hunter, her accomplice in the chase, the glorious victor&mdash;in whose service she wins a triumph of tears.</p>
<p>And as for me, I will depart out of the way of this calamity before Agave reaches the house. <milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="line"/> Soundness of mind and reverence for the affairs of the gods is best; and this, I think, is the wisest possession for those mortals who adopt it.

<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p>You who dwell in this fair-towered city of the Theban land, come to see this prey which we the daughters of Kadmos hunted down, <milestone ed="p" n="1205" unit="line"/> not with thonged Thessalian javelins, or with nets, but with the fingers of our white arms. And then should huntsmen boast and use in vain the work of spear-makers? But we caught and <milestone ed="p" n="1210" unit="line"/> tore apart the limbs of this beast with our very own hands. Where is my old father? Let him approach. And where is my son Pentheus? Let him take a ladder and raise its steps against the house so that he can fasten to the triglyphs this <milestone ed="p" n="1215" unit="line"/> lion's head which I have captured and brought here.</p></sp>
<stage>Enter Kadmos and his servants, carrying the remains of Pentheus' body</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Follow me, carrying the miserable burden of Pentheus, follow me, slaves, before the house; exhausted from countless searches, I am bringing his body, for I discovered it in the folds of Kithairon, <milestone ed="p" n="1220" unit="line"/> torn apart; I picked up nothing in the same place, and it was lying in the woods where discovery was difficult. For some one told me of my daughters' bold deeds, when I had already come within the walls of the city on my return from the Bacchae with old Teiresias. <milestone ed="p" n="1225" unit="line"/> I turned back to the mountain and now bring here my child who was killed by the Maenads. For I saw Autonoe, who once bore Actaeon to Aristaeus, and Ino with her, still mad in the thicket, wretched creatures. <milestone ed="p" n="1230" unit="line"/> But some one told me that Agave was coming here with Bacchic foot, and this was correct, for I see her&mdash;no happy sight!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p>Father, you may make a great boast, that you have born daughters the best by far of all <milestone ed="p" n="1235" unit="line"/> mortals. I mean all of us, but myself especially, who have left my shuttle at the loom and gone on to greater things, to catch wild animals with my two hands. And having taken him, I carry these spoils of honor in my arms, as you see, <milestone ed="p" n="1240" unit="line"/> so that they may hang from your house. You father, receive them in your hands. Preening yourself in my catch, call your friends to a feast. For you are blessed, blessed, now that we have performed these deeds.<milestone ed="p" n="1244" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>O grief beyond measuring, one which I cannot stand to see, <milestone ed="p" n="1245" unit="line"/> that you have performed murder with miserable hands. Having cast down a fine sacrificial victim to the gods, you invite <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and me to a banquet. Alas, first for your troubles, then for my own. How justly, yet too severely, <milestone ed="p" n="1250" unit="line"/> lord Bromius the god has destroyed us, though he is a member of our own family.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p>How morose and sullen in its countenance is man's old age! I hope that my son is a good hunter, taking after his mother's ways, when he goes after wild beasts <milestone ed="p" n="1255" unit="line"/> together with the young men of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. But all he can do is fight with the gods. You must admonish him, father. Who will call him here to my sight, so that he may see how lucky I am?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Alas, alas! When you realize what you have done <milestone ed="p" n="1260" unit="line"/> you will suffer a terrible pain. But if you remain forever in the state you are in now, though hardly fortunate, you will not imagine that you are unfortunate.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p>But what of these matters is not right, or what is painful?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>First cast your eye up to this sky.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1265" unit="line"/> All right; why do you tell me to look at it?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Is it still the same, or does it appear to have changed?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p>It is brighter than before and more translucent.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Is your soul still quivering?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p>I don't understand your words. I have become somehow <milestone ed="p" n="1270" unit="line"/> sobered, changing from my former state of mind.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>Can you hear and respond clearly?</p></sp>

<speaker>Agave</speaker>
<p>Yes, for I forget what we said before, father.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Kadmos</speaker>
<p>To whose house did you come in marriage?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agave</speaker>

But now I, great Kadmos, who sowed and reaped <milestone ed="p" n="1315" unit="line"/> a most glorious crop, the Theban people, will be banished from the house without honor. Dearest of men&mdash;for though you are dead I still count you among my dearest, child&mdash;no longer will you embrace me, calling me grandfather, touching my chin with your hand, child, and <milestone ed="p" n="1320" unit="line"/> saying: &ldquo;Who wrongs you, old man, who dishonors you?
