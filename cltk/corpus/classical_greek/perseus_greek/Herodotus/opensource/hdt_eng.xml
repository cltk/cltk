<milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="0" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This is the display of the inquiry of <name type="pers">Herodotus</name> of <name key="tgn,7016142" type="place" reg="Bodrum [27.466,37.5] (inhabited place), Mugla Ili, Ege kiyilari, Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7016142">Halicarnassus</placeName></name>, so that things done by man not be forgotten in time, and that great and marvelous deeds, some displayed by the <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name>, some by the barbarians, not lose their glory, including among others what was the cause of their waging war on each other.
<milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> learned men say that the <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name> were the cause of the dispute. These (they say) came to our seas from the sea which is called Red,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Not the modern <name key="tgn,7016791" type="place" reg="Red Sea [42,15] (sea) "><placeName key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName></name>, but the <name key="tgn,7016761" type="place" reg="Persian Gulf [53.83,25.583] (gulf), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7016761">Persian Gulf</placeName></name> and adjacent waters.</note>  and having settled in the country which they still occupy, at once began to make long voyages. Among other places to which they carried <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> and <name type="ethnic">Assyrian</name> merchandise, they came to <name key="perseus,Argos" type="place" reg="Argos [22.7333,37.6417] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName></name>,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
which was at that time preeminent in every way among the people of what is now called <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe "><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name>. The <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name> came to <name key="perseus,Argos" type="place" reg="Argos [22.7333,37.6417] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName></name>, and set out their cargo.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>On the fifth or sixth day after their arrival, when their wares were almost all sold, many women came to the shore and among them especially the daughter of the king, whose name was <name type="pers">Io</name> (according to <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> alike), the daughter of <name type="pers">Inachus</name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>As these stood about the stern of the ship bargaining for the wares they liked, the <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name> incited one another to set upon them. Most of the women escaped: <name type="pers">Io</name> and others were seized and thrown into the ship, which then sailed away for <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>In this way, the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> say (and not as the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>), was how <name type="pers">Io</name> came to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, and this, according to them, was the first wrong that was done. Next, according to their story, some <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> (they cannot say who) landed at <name key="tgn,7002862" type="place" reg="Tyre [35.183,33.266] (inhabited place), Al-Janub, Lebanon, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName></name> in <name key="tgn,6004687" type="place" reg="Phoenicia (region (general)), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName></name> and carried off the king's daughter <name type="pers">Europa</name>. These <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> must, I suppose, have been <name type="ethnic">Cretans</name>. So far, then, the account between them was balanced. But after this (they say), it was the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> who were guilty of the second wrong.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They sailed in a long ship to <name type="place">Aea</name>, a city of the <name type="ethnic">Colchians</name>, and to the river <name key="tgn,7012263" type="place" reg="Poti [41.683,42.183] (inhabited place), regions under republican jurisdiction, Georgia, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName></name>:<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">This is the legendary cruise of the Argonauts.</note>  and when they had done the business for which they came, they carried off the king's daughter <name type="pers">Medea</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Colchian</name> king sent a herald to demand reparation for the robbery and restitution of his daughter, the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> replied that, as they had been refused reparation for the abduction of the <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> <name type="pers">Io</name>, they would not make any to the <name type="ethnic">Colchians</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Then (they say), in the second generation after this, <name type="pers">Alexandrus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Priam</name>, who had heard this tale, decided to get himself a wife from <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe "><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name> by capture; for he was confident that he would not suffer punishment.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>So he carried off <name type="pers">Helen</name>. The <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> first resolved to send messengers demanding that <name type="pers">Helen</name> be restored and atonement made for the seizure; but when this proposal was made, the <name type="ethnic">Trojans</name> pleaded the seizure of <name type="pers">Medea</name>, and reminded the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> that they asked reparation from others, yet made none themselves, nor gave up the booty when asked.

<milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So far it was a matter of mere seizure on both sides. But after this (the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> say), the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> were very much to blame; for they invaded <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name> before the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> attacked <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;We think,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;that it is unjust to carry women off. But to be anxious to avenge rape is foolish: wise men take no notice of such things. For plainly the women would never have been carried away, had they not wanted it themselves.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>We of <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name> did not deign to notice the seizure of our women; but the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, for the sake of a <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonian</name> woman, recruited a great armada, came to <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name>, and destroyed the power of <name type="pers">Priam</name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Ever since then we have regarded <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> as our enemies.&rdquo; For the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> claim <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name> for their own, and the foreign peoples that inhabit it; <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName></name> and the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> people they consider to be separate from them.

<milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Such is the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> account; in their opinion, it was the taking of <name key="perseus,Troy" type="place" reg="Troy [26.2833,39.9167] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></name> which began their hatred of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But the <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name> do not tell the same story about <name type="pers">Io</name> as the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>. They say that they did not carry her off to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> by force. She had intercourse in <name key="perseus,Argos" type="place" reg="Argos [22.7333,37.6417] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName></name> with the captain of the ship. Then, finding herself pregnant, she was ashamed to have her parents know it, and so, lest they discover her condition, she sailed away with the <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name> of her own accord.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>These are the stories of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name>. For my part, I shall not say that this or that story is true, but I shall identify the one who I myself know did the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> unjust deeds, and thus proceed with my history, and speak of small and great cities of men alike.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For many states that were once great have now become small; and those that were great in my time were small before. Knowing therefore that human prosperity never continues in the same place, I shall mention both alike.

<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Croesus</name> was a <name type="ethnic">Lydian</name> by birth, son of <name type="pers">Alyattes</name>, and sovereign of all the nations west of the river <name key="tgn,6002441" type="place" reg="Halys River (river), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,6002441">Halys</placeName></name>, which flows from the south between <name key="tgn,1000140" type="place" reg="Syria [38,35] (nation), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName></name> and <name key="tgn,7016760" type="place" reg="Paphlagonia (region (general)), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7016760">Paphlagonia</placeName></name> and empties into the sea called <name key="tgn,7016619" type="place" reg="Black Sea [38,42] (sea) "><placeName key="tgn,7016619">Euxine</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was the first foreigner whom we know who subjugated some <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> and took tribute from them, and won the friendship of others: the former being the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name>, the <name type="ethnic">Aeolians</name>, and the <name type="ethnic">Dorians</name> of <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name>, and the latter the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Before the reign of <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, all <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> were free: for the <name type="pers">Cimmerian</name> host which invaded <name key="tgn,6002765" type="place" reg="Ionia (region (general)), Europe "><placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName></name> before his time did not subjugate the cities, but raided and robbed them.

<milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now the sovereign power that belonged to the descendants of <name type="pers">Heracles</name><note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Descendants of <name type="pers">Heracles</name> seems to mean descended from the <name type="ethnic">Asiatic</name> sun god identified with <name type="pers">Heracles</name> by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.</note>  fell to the family of <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, called the <name type="pers">Mermnadae</name>, in the following way.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Candaules</name>, whom the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> call <name type="pers">Myrsilus</name>, was the ruler of <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>; he was descended from <name type="pers">Alcaeus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Heracles</name>; <name type="pers">Agron</name> son of <name type="pers">Ninus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Belus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Alcaeus</name>, was the first <name type="ethnic">Heraclid</name> king of <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> and <name type="pers">Candaules</name> son of <name type="pers">Myrsus</name> was the last.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The kings of this country before <name type="pers">Agron</name> were descendants of <name type="pers">Lydus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Atys</name>, from whom this whole <name type="ethnic">Lydian</name> district got its name; before that it was called the land of the <name type="ethnic">Meii</name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The <name type="pers">Heraclidae</name>, descendants of <name type="pers">Heracles</name> and a female slave of <name type="pers">Iardanus</name>, received the sovereignty from these and held it, because of an oracle; and they ruled for twenty-two generations, or five hundred and five years, son succeeding father, down to <name type="pers">Candaules</name> son of <name type="pers">Myrsus</name>.

<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This <name type="pers">Candaules</name>, then, fell in love with his own wife, so much so that he believed her to be by far the most beautiful woman in the world; and believing this, he praised her beauty beyond measure to <name type="pers">Gyges</name> son of <name type="pers">Dascylus</name>, who was his favorite among his bodyguard; for it was to <name type="pers">Gyges</name> that he entrusted all his most important secrets.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>After a little while, <name type="pers">Candaules</name>, doomed to misfortune, spoke to <name type="pers">Gyges</name> thus: &ldquo;<name type="pers">Gyges</name>, I do not think that you believe what I say about the beauty of my wife; men trust their ears less than their eyes: so you must see her naked.&rdquo; <name type="pers">Gyges</name> protested loudly at this.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what an unsound suggestion, that I should see my mistress naked! When a woman's clothes come off, she dispenses with her modesty, too.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Men have long ago made wise rules from which one ought to learn; one of these is that one should mind one's own business. As for me, I believe that your queen is the most beautiful of all women, and I ask you not to ask of me what is lawless.&rdquo;

<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Speaking thus, <name type="pers">Gyges</name> resisted: for he was afraid that some evil would come of it for him. But this was <name type="pers">Candaules</name>' answer: &ldquo;Courage, <name type="pers">Gyges</name>! Do not be afraid of me, that I say this to test you, or of my wife, that you will have any harm from her. I will arrange it so that she shall never know that you have seen her.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>I will bring you into the chamber where she and I lie and conceal you behind the open door; and after I have entered, my wife too will come to bed. There is a chair standing near the entrance of the room: on this she will lay each article of her clothing as she takes it off, and you will be able to look upon her at your leisure.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Then, when she moves from the chair to the bed, turning her back on you, be careful she does not see you going out through the doorway.&rdquo;

<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>As <name type="pers">Gyges</name> could not escape, he consented. <name type="pers">Candaules</name>, when he judged it to be time for bed, brought <name type="pers">Gyges</name> into the chamber; his wife followed presently, and when she had come in and was laying aside her garments, <name type="pers">Gyges</name> saw her;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
when she turned her back upon him to go to bed, he slipped from the room. The woman glimpsed him as he went out, and perceived what her husband had done. But though shamed, she did not cry out or let it be seen that she had perceived anything, for she meant to punish <name type="pers">Candaules</name>;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
since among the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> and most of the foreign peoples it is felt as a great shame that even a man be seen naked.

<milestone n="11" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>For the present she made no sign and kept quiet. But as soon as it was day, she prepared those of her household whom she saw were most faithful to her, and called <name type="pers">Gyges</name>. He, supposing that she knew nothing of what had been done, answered the summons; for he was used to attending the queen whenever she summoned him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Gyges</name> came, the lady addressed him thus: &ldquo;Now, <name type="pers">Gyges</name>, you have two ways before you; decide which you will follow. You must either kill <name type="pers">Candaules</name> and take me and the throne of <name key="tgn,7016631" type="place" reg="Lydia [27.516,38.683] (region (general)), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName></name> for your own, or be killed yourself now without more ado; that will prevent you from obeying all <name type="pers">Candaules</name>' commands in the future and seeing what you should not see.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>One of you must die: either he, the contriver of this plot, or you, who have outraged all custom by looking on me uncovered.&rdquo; <name type="pers">Gyges</name> stood awhile astonished at this; presently, he begged her not to compel him to such a choice.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But when he could not deter her, and saw that dire necessity was truly upon him either to kill his master or himself be killed by others, he chose his own life. Then he asked: &ldquo;Since you force me against my will to kill my master, I would like to know how we are to lay our hands on him.&rdquo;
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>She replied, &ldquo;You shall come at him from the same place where he made you view me naked: attack him in his sleep.&rdquo;

<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When they had prepared this plot, and night had fallen, <name type="pers">Gyges</name> followed the woman into the chamber (for <name type="pers">Gyges</name> was not released, nor was there any means of deliverance, but either he or <name type="pers">Candaules</name> must die). She gave him a dagger and hid him behind the same door;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
and presently he stole out and killed <name type="pers">Candaules</name> as he slept. Thus he made himself master of the king's wife and sovereignty. He is mentioned in the iambic verses of <name type="pers">Archilochus</name> of <name type="place">Parus</name> who lived about the same time.

<milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So he took possession of the sovereign power and was confirmed in it by the <name type="ethnic">Delphic</name> oracle. For when the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> took exception to what was done to <name type="pers">Candaules</name>, and took up arms, the faction of <name type="pers">Gyges</name> came to an agreement with the rest of the people that if the oracle should ordain him king of the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name>, then he would reign; but if not, then he would return the kingship to the <name type="pers">Heraclidae</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The oracle did so ordain, and <name type="pers">Gyges</name> thus became king. However, the <name type="ethnic">Pythian</name> priestess declared that the <name type="pers">Heraclidae</name> would have vengeance on <name type="pers">Gyges</name>' posterity in the fifth generation; an utterance to which the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> and their kings paid no regard until it was fulfilled.

<milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

<milestone unit="para"/>So for that reason, and to see the world, <name type="pers">Solon</name> went to visit <name type="pers">Amasis</name> in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> and then to <name type="pers">Croesus</name> in <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>. When he got there, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> entertained him in the palace, and on the third or fourth day <name type="pers">Croesus</name> told his attendants to show <name type="pers">Solon</name> around his treasures, and they pointed out all those things that were great and blest.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>After <name type="pers">Solon</name> had seen everything and had thought about it, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> found the opportunity to say, &ldquo;My <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> guest, we have heard a lot about you because of your wisdom and of your wanderings, how as one who loves learning you have traveled much of the world for the sake of seeing it, so now I desire to ask you who is the most fortunate man you have seen.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Croesus</name> asked this question believing that he was the most fortunate of men, but <name type="pers">Solon</name>, offering no flattery but keeping to the truth, said, &ldquo;O King, it is <name type="pers">Tellus</name> the <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name>.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Croesus</name> was amazed at what he had said and replied sharply, &ldquo;In what way do you judge <name type="pers">Tellus</name> to be the most fortunate?&rdquo; <name type="pers">Solon</name> said, &ldquo;<name type="pers">Tellus</name> was from a prosperous city, and his children were good and noble. He saw children born to them all, and all of these survived. His life was prosperous by our standards, and his death was most glorious:
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
when the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> were fighting their neighbors in <name key="perseus,Eleusis" type="place" reg="Eleusis [23.5583,38.0417] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName></name>, he came to help, routed the enemy, and died very finely. The <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> buried him at public expense on the spot where he fell and gave him much honor.&rdquo;

<milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Solon</name> had provoked him by saying that the affairs of <name type="pers">Tellus</name> were so fortunate, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> asked who he thought was next, fully expecting to win second prize. <name type="pers">Solon</name> answered, &ldquo;<name type="pers">Cleobis</name> and <name type="pers">Biton</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They were of <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> stock, had enough to live on, and on top of this had great bodily strength. Both had won prizes in the athletic contests, and this story is told about them: there was a festival of <name type="pers">Hera</name> in <name key="perseus,Argos" type="place" reg="Argos [22.7333,37.6417] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName></name>, and their mother absolutely had to be conveyed to the temple by a team of oxen. But their oxen had not come back from the fields in time, so the youths took the yoke upon their own shoulders under constraint of time. They drew the wagon, with their mother riding atop it, traveling five miles until they arrived at the temple.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When they had done this and had been seen by the entire gathering, their lives came to an excellent end, and in their case the god made clear that for human beings it is a better thing to die than to live. The <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> men stood around the youths and congratulated them on their strength; the <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> women congratulated their mother for having borne such children.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>She was overjoyed at the feat and at the praise, so she stood before the image and prayed that the goddess might grant the best thing for man to her children <name type="pers">Cleobis</name> and <name type="pers">Biton</name>, who had given great honor to the goddess.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>After this prayer they sacrificed and feasted. The youths then lay down in the temple and went to sleep and never rose again; death held them there. The <name type="ethnic">Argives</name> made and dedicated at <name key="perseus,Delphi" type="place" reg="Delphi [22.5167,38.4917] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName></name> statues of them as being the best of men.&rdquo;

<milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Thus <name type="pers">Solon</name> granted second place in happiness to these men. <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was vexed and said, &ldquo;My <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> guest, do you so much despise our happiness that you do not even make us worth as much as common men?&rdquo; <name type="pers">Solon</name> replied, &ldquo;<name type="pers">Croesus</name>, you ask me about human affairs, and I know that the divine is entirely grudging and troublesome to us.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In a long span of time it is possible to see many things that you do not want to, and to suffer them, too. I set the limit of a man's life at seventy years;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
these seventy years have twenty-five thousand, two hundred days, leaving out the intercalary month.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The &ldquo;intercalary&rdquo; month is a month periodically inserted to make the series of solar and calendar years eventually correspond. But <name type="pers">Herodotus</name>' reckoning here would make the average length of a year three hundred seventy-five days.</note> But if you make every other year longer by one month, so that the seasons agree opportunely, then there are thirty-five intercalary months during the seventy years, and from these months there are one thousand fifty days.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Out of all these days in the seventy years, all twenty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty of them, not one brings anything at all like another. So, <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, man is entirely chance.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>To me you seem to be very rich and to be king of many people, but I cannot answer your question before I learn that you ended your life well. The very rich man is not more fortunate than the man who has only his daily needs, unless he chances to end his life with all well. Many very rich men are unfortunate, many of moderate means are lucky.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>The man who is very rich but unfortunate surpasses the lucky man in only two ways, while the lucky surpasses the rich but unfortunate in many. The rich man is more capable of fulfilling his appetites and of bearing a great disaster that falls upon him, and it is in these ways that he surpasses the other. The lucky man is not so able to support disaster or appetite as is the rich man, but his luck keeps these things away from him, and he is free from deformity and disease, has no experience of evils, and has fine children and good looks.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>If besides all this he ends his life well, then he is the one whom you seek, the one worthy to be called fortunate. But refrain from calling him fortunate before he dies; call him lucky.
<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>It is impossible for one who is only human to obtain all these things at the same time, just as no land is self-sufficient in what it produces. Each country has one thing but lacks another; whichever has the most is the best. Just so no human being is self-sufficient; each person has one thing but lacks another.
<milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Whoever passes through life with the most and then dies agreeably is the one who, in my opinion, O King, deserves to bear this name. It is necessary to see how the end of every affair turns out, for the god promises fortune to many people and then utterly ruins them.&rdquo;

<milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>By saying this, <name type="pers">Solon</name> did not at all please <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, who sent him away without regard for him, but thinking him a great fool, because he ignored the present good and told him to look to the end of every affair.

<milestone n="34" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But after <name type="pers">Solon</name>'s departure divine retribution fell heavily on <name type="pers">Croesus</name>; as I guess, because he supposed himself to be blessed beyond all other men. Directly, as he slept, he had a dream, which showed him the truth of the evil things which were going to happen concerning his son.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He had two sons, one of whom was ruined, for he was mute, but the other, whose name was <name type="pers">Atys</name>, was by far the best in every way of all of his peers. The dream showed this <name type="pers">Atys</name> to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, how he would lose him struck and killed by a spear of iron.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, after he awoke and considered, being frightened by the dream, brought in a wife for his son, and although <name type="pers">Atys</name> was accustomed to command the <name type="ethnic">Lydian</name> armies, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> now would not send him out on any such enterprise, while he took the javelins and spears and all such things that men use for war from the men's apartments and piled them in his store room,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Or, perhaps, &ldquo;in the women's quarters.&rdquo;</note> lest one should fall on his son from where it hung.

<milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now while <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was occupied with the marriage of his son, a <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name> of the royal house came to <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>, in great distress and with unclean hands. This man came to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' house, and asked to be purified according to the custom of the country; so <name type="pers">Croesus</name> purified him (
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> have the same manner of purification as the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>), and when he had done everything customary, he asked the <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name> where he came from and who he was:
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who are you, and from what place in <name key="tgn,7002613" type="place" reg="Phrygia (region (general)), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName></name> do you come as my suppliant? And what man or woman have you killed?&rdquo; &ldquo;O King,&rdquo; the man answered, &ldquo;I am the son of <name type="pers">Gordias</name> the son of <name type="pers">Midas</name>, and my name is <name type="pers">Adrastus</name>; I killed my brother accidentally, and I come here banished by my father and deprived of all.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Croesus</name> answered, &ldquo;All of your family are my friends, and you have come to friends, where you shall lack nothing, staying in my house. As for your misfortune, bear it as lightly as possible and you will gain most.&rdquo;

<milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So <name type="pers">Adrastus</name> lived in <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' house. About this same time a great monster of a boar appeared on the <name type="place">Mysian Olympus</name>, who would come off that mountain and ravage the fields of the <name type="ethnic">Mysians</name>. The <name type="ethnic">Mysians</name> had gone up against him often; but they never did him any harm but were hurt by him themselves.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>At last they sent messengers to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, with this message: &ldquo;O King, a great monster of a boar has appeared in the land, who is destroying our fields; for all our attempts, we cannot kill him; so now we ask you to send your son and chosen young men and dogs with us, so that we may drive him out of the country.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Such was their request, but <name type="pers">Croesus</name> remembered the prophecy of his dream and answered them thus: &ldquo;Do not mention my son again: I will not send him with you. He is newly married, and that is his present concern. But I will send chosen <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name>, and all the huntsmen, and I will tell those who go to be as eager as possible to help you to drive the beast out of the country.&rdquo;

<milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This was his answer, and the <name type="ethnic">Mysians</name> were satisfied with it. But the son of <name type="pers">Croesus</name> now entered, having heard what the <name type="ethnic">Mysians</name> had asked for; and when <name type="pers">Croesus</name> refused to send his son with them, the young man said,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Father, it was once thought very fine and noble for us to go to war and the chase and win renown; but now you have barred me from both of these, although you have seen neither cowardice nor lack of spirit in me. With what face can I now show myself whenever I go to and from the market-place?
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>What will the men of the city think of me, and what my newly wedded wife? With what kind of man will she think that she lives? So either let me go to the hunt, or show me by reasoning that what you are doing is best for me.&rdquo;

<milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; answered <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, &ldquo;I do this not because I have seen cowardice or anything unseemly in you, but the vision of a dream stood over me in my sleep, and told me that you would be short-lived, for you would be killed by a spear of iron.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It is because of that vision that I hurried your marriage and do not send you on any enterprise that I have in hand, but keep guard over you, so that perhaps I may rob death of you during my lifetime. You are my only son: for that other, since he is ruined, he doesn't exist for me.&rdquo;

<milestone n="39" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; the youth replied, &ldquo;no one can blame you for keeping guard over me, when you have seen such a vision; but it is my right to show you what you do not perceive, and why you mistake the meaning of the dream.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>You say that the dream told you that I should be killed by a spear of iron? But has a boar hands? Has it that iron spear which you dread? Had the dream said I should be killed by a tusk or some other thing proper to a boar, you would be right in acting as you act; but no, it was to be by a spear. Therefore, since it is not against men that we are to fight, let me go.&rdquo;

<milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Croesus</name> answered, &ldquo;My son, your judgment concerning the dream has somewhat reassured me; and being reassured by you, I change my thinking and permit you to go to the chase.&rdquo;

<milestone n="41" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Having said this, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> sent for <name type="pers">Adrastus</name> the <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name> and when he came addressed him thus: &ldquo;<name type="pers">Adrastus</name>, when you were struck by ugly misfortune, for which I do not blame you, it was I who cleansed you, and received and still keep you in my house, defraying all your keep.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now then, as you owe me a return of good service for the good which I have done you, I ask that you watch over my son as he goes out to the chase. See that no thieving criminals meet you on the way, to do you harm.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Besides, it is only right that you too should go where you can win renown by your deeds. That is fitting for your father's son; and you are strong enough besides.&rdquo;

<milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>&ldquo;O King,&rdquo; <name type="pers">Adrastus</name> answered, &ldquo;I would not otherwise have gone into such an arena.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But now, since you urge it and I must please you (since I owe you a return of good service), I am ready to do this; and as for your son, in so far as I can protect him, look for him to come back unharmed.&rdquo;

<milestone n="43" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So when <name type="pers">Adrastus</name> had answered <name type="pers">Croesus</name> thus, they went out provided with chosen young men and dogs.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
then the guest called <name type="pers">Adrastus</name>, the man who had been cleansed of the deed of blood, missed the boar with his spear and hit the son of <name type="pers">Croesus</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So <name type="pers">Atys</name> was struck by the spear and fulfilled the prophecy of the dream.

<milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Distraught by the death of his son, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> cried out the more vehemently because the killer was one whom he himself had cleansed of blood,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
and in his great and terrible grief at this mischance he called on <name type="pers">Zeus</name> by three names&mdash;<name type="pers">Zeus the Purifier</name>, <name type="pers">Zeus of the Hearth</name>, <name type="pers">Zeus of Comrades</name>: the first, because he wanted the god to know what evil his guest had done him; the second, because he had received the guest into his house and thus unwittingly entertained the murderer of his son; and the third, because he had found his worst enemy in the man whom he had sent as a protector.

<milestone n="45" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Soon the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> came, bearing the corpse, with the murderer following after. He then came and stood before the body and gave himself up to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, holding out his hands and telling him to kill him over the corpse, mentioning his former misfortune, and that on top of that he had destroyed the one who purified him, and that he was not fit to live.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>On hearing this, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> took pity on <name type="pers">Adrastus</name>, though his own sorrow was so great, and said to him, &ldquo;Friend, I have from you the entire penalty, since you sentence yourself to death. But it is not you that I hold the cause of this evil, except in so far as you were the unwilling doer of it, but one of the gods, the same one who told me long ago what was to be.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So <name type="pers">Croesus</name> buried his own son in such manner as was fitting. But <name type="pers">Adrastus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Gordias</name> who was son of <name type="pers">Midas</name>, this <name type="pers">Adrastus</name>, the destroyer of his own brother and of the man who purified him, when the tomb was undisturbed by the presence of men, killed himself there by the sepulcher, seeing clearly now that he was the most heavily afflicted of all whom he knew.

<milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>After the loss of his son, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> remained in deep sorrow for two years.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Having thus determined, he at once made inquiries of the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> and <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> oracles, sending messengers separately to <name key="perseus,Delphi" type="place" reg="Delphi [22.5167,38.4917] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName></name>, to <name key="perseus,Abai" type="place" reg="Abai [22.9583,38.5917] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Abai">Abae</placeName></name> in <name type="place">Phocia</name>, and to <name key="perseus,Dodona" type="place" reg="Dodona [20.8,39.55] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName></name>, while others were despatched to <name type="pers">Amphiaraus</name> and <name type="pers">Trophonius</name>,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">That is, to the oracular shrines of these legendary heroes.</note> and others to <name key="tgn,7002494" type="place" reg="Didyma [27.233,37.35] (historic site), Aydin Ili, Ege kiyilari, Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002494">Branchidae</placeName></name> in the <name type="ethnic">Milesian</name> country.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>These are the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> oracles to which <name type="pers">Croesus</name> sent for divination: and he told others to go inquire of <name type="pers">Ammon</name> in <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="47" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>And when he sent to test these shrines he gave the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> these instructions: they were to keep track of the time from the day they left <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>, and on the hundredth day inquire of the oracles what <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, king of <name key="tgn,7016631" type="place" reg="Lydia [27.516,38.683] (region (general)), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName></name>, son of <name type="pers">Alyattes</name>, was doing then; then they were to write down whatever the oracles answered and bring the reports back to him.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For after sending his envoys to the oracles, he had thought up something which no conjecture could discover, and carried it out on the appointed day: namely, he had cut up a tortoise and a lamb, and then boiled them in a cauldron of bronze covered with a lid of the same.

<milestone n="49" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Such, then, was the answer from <name key="perseus,Delphi" type="place" reg="Delphi [22.5167,38.4917] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName></name> delivered to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>.

<milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>After this, he tried to win the favor of the <name type="ethnic">Delphian</name> god with great sacrifices.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When the sacrifice was over, he melted down a vast store of gold and made ingots of it, the longer sides of which were of six and the shorter of three palms' length, and the height was one palm. There were a hundred and seventeen of these. Four of them were of refined gold, each weighing two talents and a half; the rest were of gold with silver alloy, each of two talents' weight.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>He also had a figure of a lion made of refined gold, weighing ten talents.

<milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

<milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When he heard these verses, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was pleased with them above all, for he thought that a mule would never be king of the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> instead of a man, and therefore that he and his posterity would never lose his empire. Then he sought very carefully to discover who the mightiest of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> were, whom he should make his friends.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He found by inquiry that the chief peoples were the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> among those of <name type="ethnic">Doric</name>, and the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> among those of <name type="ethnic">Ionic</name> stock.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>If, then, all the <name type="ethnic">Pelasgian</name> stock spoke so, then the Attic nation, being of <name type="ethnic">Pelasgian</name> blood, must have changed its language too at the time when it became part of the <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name>. For the people of <name type="place"><placeName key="tgn,2267015">Creston</placeName></name> and <name type="place">Placia</name> have a language of their own in common, which is not the language of their neighbors; and it is plain that they still preserve the manner of speech which they brought with them in their migration into the places where they live.

<milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But the <name type="ethnic">Hellenic</name> stock, it seems clear to me, has always had the same language since its beginning; yet being, when separated from the <name type="ethnic">Pelasgians</name>, few in number, they have grown from a small beginning to comprise a multitude of nations, chiefly because the <name type="ethnic">Pelasgians</name> and many other foreign peoples united themselves with them. Before that, I think, the <name type="ethnic">Pelasgic</name> stock nowhere increased much in number while it was of foreign speech.

<milestone n="59" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now of these two peoples, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> learned that the Attic was held in subjection and divided into factions by <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Hippocrates</name>, who at that time was sovereign over the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>. This <name type="pers">Hippocrates</name> was still a private man when a great marvel happened to him when he was at <name key="perseus,Olympia" type="place" reg="Olympia [21.6333,37.65] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName></name> to see the games: when he had offered the sacrifice, the vessels, standing there full of meat and water, boiled without fire until they boiled over.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Chilon</name> the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonian</name>, who happened to be there and who saw this marvel, advised <name type="pers">Hippocrates</name> not to take to his house a wife who could bear children, but if he had one already, then to send her away, and if he had a son, to disown him.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Hippocrates</name> refused to follow the advice of <name type="pers">Chilon</name>; and afterward there was born to him this <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name>, who, when there was a feud between the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> of the coast under <name type="pers">Megacles</name> son of <name type="pers">Alcmeon</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> of the plain under <name type="pers">Lycurgus</name> son of <name type="pers">Aristolaides</name>, raised up a third faction, as he coveted the sovereign power. He collected partisans and pretended to champion the uplanders, and the following was his plan.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Wounding himself and his mules, he drove his wagon into the marketplace, with a story that he had escaped from his enemies, who would have killed him (so he said) as he was driving into the country. So he implored the people to give him a guard: and indeed he had won a reputation in his command of the army against the <name type="ethnic">Megarians</name>, when he had taken <name type="place"><placeName key="perseus,Nisaea">Nisaea</placeName></name> and performed other great exploits.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Taken in, the <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> people gave him a guard of chosen citizens, whom <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> made clubmen instead of spearmen: for the retinue that followed him carried wooden clubs.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>These rose with <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> and took the Acropolis; and <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> ruled the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, disturbing in no way the order of offices nor changing the laws, but governing the city according to its established constitution and arranging all things fairly and well.

<milestone n="60" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But after a short time the partisans of <name type="pers">Megacles</name> and of <name type="pers">Lycurgus</name> made common cause and drove him out.

Presently his enemies who together had driven him out began to feud once more.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then <name type="pers">Megacles</name>, harassed by factional strife, sent a message to <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> offering him his daughter to marry and the sovereign power besides.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When this offer was accepted by <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name>, who agreed on these terms with <name type="pers">Megacles</name>, they devised a plan to bring <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> back which, to my mind, was so exceptionally foolish that it is strange (since from old times the <name type="ethnic">Hellenic</name> stock has always been distinguished from foreign by its greater cleverness and its freedom from silly foolishness) that these men should devise such a plan to deceive <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, said to be the subtlest of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.

&ldquo;<name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, give a hearty welcome to <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name>, whom <name type="pers">Athena</name> herself honors above all men and is bringing back to her own acropolis.&rdquo; So the heralds went about proclaiming this; and immediately the report spread in the demes that <name type="pers">Athena</name> was bringing <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> back, and the townsfolk, believing that the woman was the goddess herself, worshipped this human creature and welcomed <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name>.

<milestone n="61" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Having got back his sovereignty in the manner which I have described, <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> married <name type="pers">Megacles</name>' daughter according to his agreement with <name type="pers">Megacles</name>. But as he already had young sons, and as the <name type="pers">Alcmeonid</name> family were said to be under a curse, he had no wish that his newly-wedded wife bear him children, and therefore had unusual intercourse with her.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>At first the woman hid the fact: presently she told her mother (whether interrogated or not, I do not know) and the mother told her husband. <name type="pers">Megacles</name> was very angry to be dishonored by <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name>; and in his anger he patched up his quarrel with the other faction. <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name>, learning what was going on, went alone away from the country altogether, and came to <name key="perseus,Eretria" type="place" reg="Eretria [23.8083,38.3917] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName></name> where he deliberated with his sons.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The opinion of <name type="pers">Hippias</name> prevailing, that they should recover the sovereignty, they set out collecting contributions from all the cities that owed them anything.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
and in course of time, not to make a long story, everything was ready for their return: for they brought <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> mercenaries from the <name key="tgn,7017076" type="place" reg="Peloponnese [22,37.5] (region), Greece, Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName></name>, and there joined them on his own initiative a man of <name key="tgn,7012053" type="place" reg="Nisos Naxos [25.583,32.33] (island), Cyclades, Aegean Islands, Greece, Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7012053">Naxos</placeName></name> called <name type="pers">Lygdamis</name>, who was most keen in their cause and brought them money and men.

but the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> in the city, who while <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> was collecting money and afterwards when he had taken Marathon took no notice of it, did now, and when they learned that he was marching from Marathon against <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName></name>, they set out to attack him.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>There (by the providence of heaven) <name type="pers">Pisistratus</name> met <name type="pers">Amphilytus</name> the <name type="ethnic">Acarnanian</name>, a diviner, who came to him and prophesied as follows in hexameter verses:

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Some even say that the ancient channel dried up altogether. But I do not believe this; for in that case, how did they pass the river when they were returning?

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The fighting was fierce, many on both sides fell, and at nightfall they disengaged with neither side victorious. The two sides contended thus.

<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Croesus</name> was not content with the size of his force, for his army that had engaged was far smaller than that of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>; therefore, when on the day after the battle <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> did not try attacking again, he marched away to <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>, intending to summon the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> in accordance with their treaty

<milestone n="78" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This was how <name type="pers">Croesus</name> reasoned. Meanwhile, snakes began to swarm in the outer part of the city; and when they appeared the horses, leaving their accustomed pasture, devoured them. When <name type="pers">Croesus</name> saw this he thought it a portent, and so it was.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He at once sent to the homes of the <name type="ethnic">Telmessian</name> interpreters,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">These were a caste of priests of <name type="pers">Apollo</name> at <name type="place">Telmessus</name> or <name type="place">Telmissus</name> in <name key="tgn,7001294" type="place" reg="Lycia (region (general)), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName></name>. <foreign lang="greek">tw=n e)chghte/wn *telmhsse/wn</foreign> is contrary to <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> usage, <foreign lang="greek">e)chghth/s</foreign> being a substantive: <name type="pers">Stein</name> suggests that the true reading may be <foreign lang="greek">*telmhsse/wn tw=n e)chghte/wn</foreign>.</note> to inquire concerning it; but though his messengers came and learned from the <name type="ethnic">Telmessians</name> what the portent meant, they could not bring back word to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, for he was a prisoner before they could make their voyage back to <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Nonetheless, this was the judgment of the <name type="ethnic">Telmessians</name>: that <name type="pers">Croesus</name> must expect a foreign army to attack his country, and that when it came, it would subjugate the inhabitants of the land: for the snake, they said, was the offspring of the land, but the horse was an enemy and a foreigner. This was the answer which the <name type="ethnic">Telmessians</name> gave <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, knowing as yet nothing of the fate of <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> and of the king himself; but when they gave it, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was already taken.

<milestone n="79" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Croesus</name> marched away after the battle in the <name type="ethnic">Pterian</name> country, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, learning that <name type="pers">Croesus</name> had gone intending to disband his army, deliberated and perceived that it would be opportune for him to march quickly against <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>, before the power of the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> could be assembled again.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This he decided, and this he did immediately; he marched his army into <name key="tgn,7016631" type="place" reg="Lydia [27.516,38.683] (region (general)), Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName></name> and so came himself to bring the news of it to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>. All had turned out contrary to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' expectation, and he was in a great quandary; nevertheless, he led out the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> to battle.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now at this time there was no nation in <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name> more valiant or warlike than the <name type="ethnic">Lydian</name>. It was their custom to fight on horseback, carrying long spears, and they were skillful at managing horses.

<milestone n="80" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So the armies met in the plain, wide and bare, that is before the city of <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>: the <name type="place">Hyllus</name> and other rivers flow across it and run violently together into the greatest of them, which is called <name type="place">Hermus</name> (this flows from the mountain sacred to the Mother <name type="pers">Dindymene</name><note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Identified with the <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name> and <name type="ethnic">Lydian</name> goddess <name type="pers">Cybele</name>.</note> and empties into the sea near the city of <name key="tgn,7018000" type="place" reg="Foca [26.75,38.666] (inhabited place), Izmir Ili, Ege kiyilari, Turkey, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7018000">Phocaea</placeName></name>).
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> saw the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> maneuvering their battle-lines here, he was afraid of their cavalry, and therefore at the urging of one <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>, a <name type="ethnic">Mede</name>, he did as I shall describe. Assembling all the camels that followed his army bearing food and baggage, he took off their burdens and mounted men upon them equipped like cavalrymen; having equipped them, he ordered them to advance before his army against <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' cavalry; he directed the infantry to follow the camels, and placed all his cavalry behind the infantry.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When they were all in order, he commanded them to kill all the other <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> who came in their way, and spare none, but not to kill <name type="pers">Croesus</name> himself, even if he should defend himself against capture.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Such was his command. The reason for his posting the camels to face the cavalry was this: horses fear camels and can endure neither the sight nor the smell of them; this then was the intention of his maneuver, that <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' cavalry, on which the <name type="ethnic">Lydian</name> relied to distinguish himself, might be of no use.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So when battle was joined, as soon as the horses smelled and saw the camels they turned to flight, and all <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' hope was lost.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Nevertheless the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> were no cowards; when they saw what was happening, they leaped from their horses and fought the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> on foot. Many of both armies fell; at length the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> were routed and driven within their city wall, where they were besieged by the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>.

<milestone n="81" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So then they were besieged. But <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, supposing that the siege would last a long time, again sent messengers from the city to his allies; whereas the former envoys had been sent to summon them to muster at <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> in five months' time, these were to announce that <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was besieged and to plead for help as quickly as possible.

<milestone n="82" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So he sent to the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> as well as to the rest of the allies. Now at this very time the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> themselves were feuding with the <name type="ethnic">Argives</name> over the country called <name type="place">Thyrea</name>;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
for this was a part of the <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> territory which the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> had cut off and occupied. (All the land towards the west, as far as <name type="place">Malea</name>, belonged then to the <name type="ethnic">Argives</name>, and not only the mainland, but the island of <name key="tgn,7010869" type="place" reg="Cerigo (island), Attica, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe"><placeName key="tgn,7010869">Cythera</placeName></name> and the other islands.)
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Argives</name> came out to save their territory from being cut off, then after debate the two armies agreed that three hundred of each side should fight, and whichever party won would possess the land. The rest of each army was to go away to its own country and not be present at the battle, since, if the armies remained on the field, the men of either party might render assistance to their comrades if they saw them losing.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Having agreed, the armies drew off, and picked men of each side remained and fought. Neither could gain advantage in the battle; at last, only three out of the six hundred were left, <name type="pers">Alcenor</name> and <name type="pers">Chromios</name> of the <name type="ethnic">Argives</name>, <name type="pers">Othryades</name> of the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>: these three were left alive at nightfall.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Then the two <name type="ethnic">Argives</name>, believing themselves victors, ran to <name key="perseus,Argos" type="place" reg="Argos [22.7333,37.6417] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName></name>; but <name type="pers">Othryades</name> the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonian</name>, after stripping the <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> dead and taking the arms to his camp, waited at his position. On the second day both armies came to learn the issue.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>For a while both claimed the victory, the <name type="ethnic">Argives</name> arguing that more of their men had survived, the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> showing that the <name type="ethnic">Argives</name> had fled, while their man had stood his ground and stripped the enemy dead.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>At last from arguing they fell to fighting; many of both sides fell, but the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> gained the victory. The <name type="ethnic">Argives</name>, who before had worn their hair long by fixed custom, shaved their heads ever after and made a law, with a curse added to it, that no <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> grow his hair, and no <name type="ethnic">Argive</name> woman wear gold, until they recovered <name type="place">Thyreae</name>;
<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
and the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> made a contrary law, that they wear their hair long ever after; for until now they had not worn it so. <name type="pers">Othryades</name>, the lone survivor of the three hundred, was ashamed, it is said, to return to <name key="perseus,Sparta" type="place" reg="Sparta [22.4417,37.0667] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName></name> after all the men of his company had been killed, and killed himself on the spot at <name type="place">Thyreae</name>.

<milestone n="83" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Sardian</name> herald came after this had happened to the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> to ask for their help for <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, now besieged; nonetheless, when they heard the herald, they prepared to send help; but when they were already equipped and their ships ready, a second message came that the fortification of the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> was taken and <name type="pers">Croesus</name> a prisoner. Then, though very sorry indeed, they ceased their efforts.

<milestone n="84" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This is how <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> was taken. When <name type="pers">Croesus</name> had been besieged for fourteen days, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> sent horsemen around in his army to promise to reward whoever first mounted the wall.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>After this the army made an assault, but with no success. Then, when all the others were stopped, a certain <name type="ethnic">Mardian</name><note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The <name type="ethnic">Mardi</name> were a nomadic <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> tribe.</note> called <name type="pers">Hyroeades</name> attempted to mount by a part of the acropolis where no guard had been set, since no one feared that it could be taken by an attack made here.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>For here the height on which the acropolis stood is sheer and unlikely to be assaulted; this was the only place where <name type="pers">Meles</name> the former king of <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> had not carried the lion which his concubine had borne him, the <name type="ethnic">Telmessians</name> having declared that if this lion were carried around the walls, <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> could never be taken. <name type="pers">Meles</name> then carried the lion around the rest of the wall of the acropolis where it could be assaulted, but neglected this place, because the height was sheer and defied attack. It is on the side of the city which faces towards <name type="place">Tmolus</name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The day before, then, <name type="pers">Hyroeades</name>, this <name type="ethnic">Mardian</name>, had seen one of the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> come down by this part of the acropolis after a helmet that had fallen down, and fetch it; he took note of this and considered it.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>And now he climbed up himself, and other <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> after him. Many ascended, and thus <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> was taken and all the city sacked.

<milestone n="85" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>I will now relate what happened to <name type="pers">Croesus</name> himself. He had a son, whom I have already mentioned, fine in other respects, but mute. Now in his days of prosperity past <name type="pers">Croesus</name> had done all that he could for his son; and besides resorting to other devices he had sent to <name key="perseus,Delphi" type="place" reg="Delphi [22.5167,38.4917] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName></name> to inquire of the oracle concerning him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Pythian</name> priestess answered him thus:

<l>It were better for you that he remain mute as before;</l>
<l>For on an unlucky day shall he first speak.&rdquo;</l></quote>

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So at the taking of the fortification a certain <name type="ethnic">Persian</name>, not knowing who <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was, came at him meaning to kill him. <name type="pers">Croesus</name> saw him coming, but because of the imminent disaster he was past caring, and it made no difference to him whether he were struck and killed.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But this mute son, when he saw the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> coming on, in fear and distress broke into speech and cried, &ldquo;Man, do not kill <name type="pers">Croesus</name>!&rdquo; This was the first word he uttered, and after that for all the rest of his life he had power of speech.

<milestone n="86" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> gained <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> and took <name type="pers">Croesus</name> prisoner. <name type="pers">Croesus</name> had ruled fourteen years and been besieged fourteen days. Fulfilling the oracle, he had destroyed his own great empire. The <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> took him and brought him to <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
who erected a pyre and mounted <name type="pers">Croesus</name> atop it, bound in chains, with twice seven sons of the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> beside him. <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> may have intended to sacrifice him as a victory-offering to some god, or he may have wished to fulfill a vow, or perhaps he had heard that <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was pious and put him atop the pyre to find out if some divinity would deliver him from being burned alive.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> did this. As <name type="pers">Croesus</name> stood on the pyre, even though he was in such a wretched position it occurred to him that <name type="pers">Solon</name> had spoken with god's help when he had said that no one among the living is fortunate.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Cyrus</name> heard and ordered the interpreters to ask <name type="pers">Croesus</name> who he was invoking. They approached and asked, but <name type="pers">Croesus</name> kept quiet at their questioning, until finally they forced him and he said, &ldquo;I would prefer to great wealth his coming into discourse with all despots.&rdquo; Since what he said was unintelligible, they again asked what he had said,
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
persistently harassing him. He explained that first <name type="pers">Solon</name> the <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> had come and seen all his fortune and spoken as if he despised it. Now everything had turned out for him as <name type="pers">Solon</name> had said, speaking no more of him than of every human being, especially those who think themselves fortunate. While <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was relating all this, the pyre had been lit and the edges were on fire.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> heard from the interpreters what <name type="pers">Croesus</name> said, he relented and considered that he, a human being, was burning alive another human being, one his equal in good fortune. In addition, he feared retribution, reflecting how there is nothing stable in human affairs. He ordered that the blazing fire be extinguished as quickly as possible, and that <name type="pers">Croesus</name> and those with him be taken down, but despite their efforts they could not master the fire.

<milestone n="87" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Then the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> say that <name type="pers">Croesus</name> understood <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' change of heart, and when he saw everyone trying to extinguish the fire but unable to check it, he invoked <name type="pers">Apollo</name>, crying out that if <name type="pers">Apollo</name> had ever been given any pleasing gift by him, let him offer help and deliver him from the present evil.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Thus he in tears invoked the god, and suddenly out of a clear and windless sky clouds gathered, a storm broke, and it rained violently, extinguishing the pyre. Thus <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> perceived that <name type="pers">Croesus</name> was dear to god and a good man. He had him brought down from the pyre and asked,
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;<name type="pers">Croesus</name>, what man persuaded you to wage war against my land and become my enemy instead of my friend?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;O King, I acted thus for your good fortune, but for my own ill fortune. The god of the <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name> is responsible for these things, inciting me to wage war.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>No one is so foolish as to choose war over peace. In peace sons bury their fathers, in war fathers bury their sons. But I suppose it was dear to the divinity that this be so.&rdquo;

<milestone n="88" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Croesus</name> said this, and <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> freed him and made him sit near and was very considerate to him, and both he and all that were with him were astonished when they looked at <name type="pers">Croesus</name>.

&ldquo;The multitude there, what is it at which they are so busily engaged?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are plundering your city,&rdquo; said <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, &ldquo;and carrying off your possessions.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; <name type="pers">Croesus</name> answered, &ldquo;not my city, and not my possessions; for I no longer have any share of all this; it is your wealth that they are pillaging.&rdquo;

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But as to the oracle that was given to him, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> is wrong to complain concerning it.

<milestone unit="para"/>The customs of the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> are like those of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, except that they make prostitutes of their female children.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And, according to what they themselves say, the games now in use among them and the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> were invented by the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name>: these, they say, were invented among them at the time when they colonized <name key="tgn,7008330" type="place" reg="Etruria (region (general)), Italy, Europe">Tyrrhenia</name>.

For a while the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> bore this with what patience they could; presently, when the famine did not abate, they looked for remedies, and different plans were devised by different men. Then it was that they invented the games of dice and knuckle-bones and ball and all other forms of game except dice, which the <name type="ethnic">Lydians</name> do not claim to have discovered.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Then, using their discovery to lighten the famine, every other day they would play for the whole day, so that they would not have to look for food, and the next day they quit their play and ate. This was their way of life for eighteen years.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But the famine did not cease to trouble them, and instead afflicted them even more.

<milestone n="96" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>All of those on the mainland were now free men; but they came to be ruled by monarchs again, as I will now relate. There was among the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> a clever man called <name type="pers">Deioces</name>: he was the son of <name type="pers">Phraortes</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Deioces</name> was infatuated with sovereignty, and so he set about gaining it. Already a notable man in his own town (one of the many towns into which Media was divided), he began to profess and practice justice more constantly and zealously than ever, and he did this even though there was much lawlessness throughout the land of Media, and though he knew that injustice is always the enemy of justice. Then the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> of the same town, seeing his behavior, chose him to be their judge, and he (for he coveted sovereign power) was honest and just.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>By acting so, he won no small praise from his fellow townsmen, to such an extent that when the men of the other towns learned that <name type="pers">Deioces</name> alone gave fair judgments (having before suffered from unjust decisions), they came often and gladly to plead before <name type="pers">Deioces</name>; and at last they would submit to no arbitration but his.

<milestone n="97" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The number of those who came grew ever greater, for they heard that each case turned out in accord with the truth. Then <name type="pers">Deioces</name>, seeing that everything now depended on him, would not sit in his former seat of judgment, and said he would give no more decisions; for it was of no advantage to him (he said) to leave his own business and spend all day judging the cases of his neighbors.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This caused robbery and lawlessness to increase greatly in the towns; and, gathering together, the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> conferred about their present affairs, and said (here, as I suppose, the main speakers were <name type="pers">Deioces</name>' friends),
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Since we cannot go on living in the present way in the land, come, let us set up a king over us; in this way the land will be well governed, and we ourselves shall attend to our business and not be routed by lawlessness.&rdquo; With such words they persuaded themselves to be ruled by a king.

<milestone unit="para"/>The question was at once propounded: Whom should they make king? Then every man was loud in putting <name type="pers">Deioces</name> forward and praising <name type="pers">Deioces</name>, until they agreed that he should be their king.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He ordered them to build him houses worthy of his royal power, and strengthen him with a bodyguard. The <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> did so. They built him a big and strong house wherever in the land he indicated to them, and let him choose a bodyguard out of all the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And having obtained power, he forced the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> to build him one city and to fortify and care for this more strongly than all the rest. The <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> did this for him, too.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He was careful to hedge himself with all this so that the men of his own age (who had been brought up with him and were as nobly born as he and his equals in courage), instead of seeing him and being upset and perhaps moved to plot against him, might by reason of not seeing him believe him to be different.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Or, perhaps, different from themselves.</note>

and presently, when <name type="pers">Mandane</name> was of marriageable age, he feared the vision too much to give her to any <name type="ethnic">Mede</name> worthy to marry into his family, but married her to a <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> called <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, a man whom he knew to be wellborn and of a quiet temper: for <name type="pers">Astyages</name> held <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> to be much lower than a <name type="ethnic">Mede</name> of middle rank.

<milestone n="108" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But during the first year that <name type="pers">Mandane</name> was married to <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> saw a second vision.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Having seen this vision, and communicated it to the interpreters of dreams, he sent to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> for his daughter, who was about to give birth, and when she arrived kept her guarded, meaning to kill whatever child she bore: for the interpreters declared that the meaning of his dream was that his daughter's offspring would rule in his place.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Anxious to prevent this, <name type="pers">Astyages</name>, when <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> was born, summoned <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>, a man of his household who was his most faithful servant among the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> and was administrator of all that was his, and he said:
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;<name type="pers">Harpagus</name>, whatever business I turn over to you, do not mishandle it, and do not leave me out of account and, giving others preference, trip over your own feet afterwards.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;O King,&rdquo; <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> answered, &ldquo;never yet have you noticed anything displeasing in your man; and I shall be careful in the future, too, not to err in what concerns you. If it is your will that this be done, then my concern ought to be to attend to it scrupulously.&rdquo;

<milestone n="109" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Harpagus</name> answered thus. The child was then given to him, consigned to its death, and he went to his house weeping. When he came in, he told his wife the entire speech uttered by <name type="pers">Astyages</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;what do you propose to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not to obey <name type="pers">Astyages</name>' instructions,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;not even if he should lose his mind and be more frantic than he is now: I will not lend myself to his plan or be an accessory to such a murder.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>There are many reasons why I will not kill him: because the child is related to me, and because <name type="pers">Astyages</name> is old and has no male children.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Now if the sovereignty passes to this daughter of his after his death, whose son he is now killing by means of me, what is left for me but the gravest of all dangers? For the sake of my safety this child has to die; but one of <name type="pers">Astyages</name>' own people has to be the murderer and not one of mine.&rdquo;

<milestone n="110" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So saying, he sent a messenger at once to one of <name type="pers">Astyages</name>' cowherds, who he knew pastured his herds in the likeliest spots and where the mountains were most infested with wild beasts. The man's name was <name type="pers">Mitradates</name>, and his wife was a slave like him; her name was in the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> language <name type="pers">Cyno</name>, in the Median <name type="pers">Spako</name>: for &ldquo;spax&rdquo; is the Median word for dog.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The foothills of the mountains where this cowherd pastured his cattle are north of <name key="tgn,7002115" type="place" reg="Hamadan [48.583,34.766] (inhabited place), Hamadan, Iran, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002115">Ecbatana</placeName></name>, towards the <name key="tgn,7016619" type="place" reg="Black Sea [38,42] (sea)"><placeName key="tgn,7016619">Euxine sea</placeName></name>; for the rest of Media is everywhere a level plain, but here, on the side of the <name type="ethnic">Saspires</name>,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">In the north-western part of Media: modern <name key="tgn,7006646" type="place" reg="Azerbaijan [47.5,40.5] (nation), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7006646">Azerbaijan</placeName></name>.</note> the land is very high and mountainous and covered with woods.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So when the cowherd came in haste at the summons, <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> said: &ldquo;<name type="pers">Astyages</name> wants you to take this child and leave it in the most desolate part of the mountains so that it will perish as quickly as possible. And he wants me to tell you that if you do not kill it, but preserve it somehow, you will undergo the most harrowing death; and I am ordered to see it exposed.&rdquo;

<milestone n="111" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Hearing this, the cowherd took the child and went back the same way and came to his dwelling. Now as it happened his wife too had been on the verge of delivering every day, and as the divinity would have it, she did in fact give birth while the cowherd was away in the city. Each of them was anxious for the other, the husband being afraid about his wife's labor, and the wife because she did not know why <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> had so unexpectedly sent for her husband.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>So when he returned and stood before her, she was startled by the unexpected sight and asked him before he could speak why <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> had so insistently summoned him. &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when I came to the city, I saw and heard what I ought never to have seen, and what ought never to have happened to our masters. <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>' whole house was full of weeping; astonished, I went in;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
and immediately I saw a child lying there struggling and crying, adorned in gold and embroidered clothing. And when <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> saw me, he told me to take the child in haste and bring it away and leave it where the mountains are the most infested with wild beasts. It was <name type="pers">Astyages</name>, he said, who enjoined this on me, and <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> threatened me grievously if I did not do it.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So I took him and brought him away, supposing him to be the child of one of the servants; for I could never have guessed whose he was. But I was amazed at seeing him adorned with gold and clothing, and at hearing, too, the evident sound of weeping in the house of <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Very soon on the way I learned the whole story from the servant who brought me out of the city and gave the child into my custody: namely, that it was the son of <name type="pers">Mandane</name> the king's daughter and <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> the son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, and that <name type="pers">Astyages</name> gave the command to kill him. And now, here he is.&rdquo;

<milestone n="112" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>And as he said this the cowherd uncovered it and showed it. But when the woman saw how fine and fair the child was, she began to cry and laid hold of the man's knees and begged him by no means to expose him. But the husband said he could not do otherwise; for, he said, spies would be coming from <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> to see what was done, and he would have to die a terrible death if he did not obey.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Being unable to move her husband, the woman then said: &ldquo;Since I cannot convince you not to expose it, then, if a child has to be seen exposed, do this: I too have borne a child, but I bore it dead.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Take this one and put it out, but the child of the daughter of <name type="pers">Astyages</name> let us raise as if it were our own; this way, you won't be caught disobeying our masters, and we will not have plotted badly. For the dead child will have royal burial, and the living will not lose his life.&rdquo;

<milestone n="113" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Thinking that his wife advised him excellently in his present strait, the cowherd immediately did as she said. He gave his wife the child whom he had brought to kill, and his own dead child he put into the chest in which he carried the other,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
and dressed it with all the other child's finery and left it out in the most desolate part of the mountains. Then on the third day after leaving the child out, the cowherd left one of his herdsmen to watch it and went to the city, where he went to <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>' house and said he was ready to show the child's dead body.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Harpagus</name> sent the most trusted of his bodyguard, and these saw for him and buried the cowherd's child. So it was buried: and the cowherd's wife kept and raised the boy who was afterwards named <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>; but she did not give him that name, but another.

<milestone n="114" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now when the boy was ten years old, the truth about him was revealed in some such way as this. He was playing in the village where these herdsmen's quarters were, playing in the road with others of his age. The boys while playing chose to be their king this one who was supposed to be the son of the cowherd.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then he assigned some of them to the building of houses, some to be his bodyguard, one doubtless to be the <name type="pers">King's Eye</name>; to another he gave the right of bringing him messages; to each he gave his proper work.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now one of these boys playing with him was the son of <name type="pers">Artembares</name>, a notable <name type="ethnic">Mede</name>; when he did not perform his assignment from <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> told the other boys to seize him, and when they did so he handled the boy very roughly and whipped him.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>As soon as he was let go, very upset about the indignity he had suffered, he went down to his father in the city and complained of what he had received at the hands of the son of <name type="pers">Astyages</name>' cowherd&mdash;not calling him <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, for that name had not yet been given.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Artembares</name>, going just as angry as he was to <name type="pers">Astyages</name> and bringing his son along, announced that an impropriety had been committed, saying, &ldquo;O King, by your slave, the son of a cowherd, we have been outraged thus&rdquo;: and with that he bared his son's shoulders.

<milestone n="115" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Astyages</name> heard and saw, he was ready to avenge the boy in view of <name type="pers">Artembares</name>' rank: so he sent for the cowherd and his son. When they were both present, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> said, fixing his eyes on <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Is it you, then, the child of one such as this, who have dared to lay hands on the son of the greatest of my courtiers?&rdquo; <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> answered, &ldquo;Master, what I did to him I did with justice.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The other boys then did as assigned: but this one was disobedient and cared nothing for me, for which he got what he deserved. Now, if I deserve punishment for this, here I am to take it.&rdquo;

<milestone n="116" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>While the boy spoke, it seemed to <name type="pers">Astyages</name> that he recognized him; the character of his face was like his own, he thought, and his manner of answering was freer than customary: and the date of the exposure seemed to agree with the boy's age.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Astonished at this, he sat a while silent; but when at last with difficulty he could collect his wits, he said (for he wanted to be rid of <name type="pers">Artembares</name> and question the cowherd with no one present), &ldquo;I shall act in such a way, <name type="pers">Artembares</name>, that you and your son shall have no cause of complaint.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So he sent <name type="pers">Artembares</name> away, and the attendants led <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> inside at <name type="pers">Astyages</name>' bidding. When the cowherd was left quite alone, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> asked him where he had got the boy and who had been the giver.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The cowherd answered that <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> was his own son and that the mother was still with him. <name type="pers">Astyages</name> said that he was not well advised if he wished to find himself in a desperate situation, and as he said this made a sign to the spearbearers to seize him.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Then, under stress of necessity, the cowherd disclosed to him the whole story, telling everything exactly as it had happened from the beginning, and at the end fell to entreaty and urged the king to pardon him.

<milestone n="117" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the cowherd had disclosed the true story, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> took less interest in him, but he was very angry with <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> and had the guards summon him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Harpagus</name> came, and <name type="pers">Astyages</name> asked him &ldquo;<name type="pers">Harpagus</name>, how did you kill the boy, my daughter's son, whom I gave you?&rdquo; <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>, when he saw the cowherd was there, did not take the way of falsehood, lest he be caught and confuted:
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;O King,&rdquo; he said,&rdquo; when I took the boy, I thought and considered how to do what you wanted and not be held a murderer by your daughter or by you even though I was blameless toward you.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So I did this: I summoned this cowherd here, and gave the child to him, telling him that it was you who gave the command to kill it. And that was the truth; for such was your command. But I gave the child with the instructions that the cowherd was to lay it on a desolate mountainside and wait there and watch until it was dead; and I threatened all sorts of things if he did not accomplish this.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Then, when he had done what he was told, and the child was dead, I sent the most trusted of my eunuchs and had the body viewed and buried. This, O king, is the story, and such was the end of the boy.&rdquo;

<milestone n="118" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Harpagus</name> told the story straight, while <name type="pers">Astyages</name>, hiding the anger that he felt against him for what had been done, first repeated the story again to <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> exactly as he had heard it from the cowherd, then, after repeating it, ended by saying that the boy was alive and that the matter had turned out well.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was greatly afflicted by what had been done to this boy, and it weighed heavily on me that I was estranged from my daughter. Now, then, in this good turn of fortune, send your own son to this boy newly come, and (since I am about to sacrifice for the boy's safety to the gods to whom this honor is due) come here to dine with me.&rdquo;

<milestone n="119" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> heard this, he bowed and went to his home, very pleased to find that his offense had turned out for the best and that he was invited to dinner in honor of this fortunate day.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Coming in, he told his only son, a boy of about thirteen years of age, to go to <name type="pers">Astyages</name>' palace and do whatever the king commanded, and in his great joy he told his wife everything that had happened.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But when <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>' son came, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> cut his throat and tore him limb from limb, roasted some of the flesh and boiled some, and kept it ready after he had prepared it.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So when the hour for dinner came and the rest of the guests and <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> were present, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> and the others were served dishes of lamb's meat, but <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> that of his own son, all but the head and hands and feet, which lay apart covered up in a wicker basket.

<name type="pers">Harpagus</name> did; he opened and saw what was left of his son: he saw this, but mastered himself and did not lose his composure. <name type="pers">Astyages</name> asked him, &ldquo;Do you know what beast's meat you have eaten?&rdquo;
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and all that the king does is pleasing.&rdquo; With that answer he took the remains of the meat and went home. There he meant, I suppose, after collecting everything, to bury it.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then <name type="pers">Astyages</name> said, &ldquo;The boy is safe and alive, and when he was living in the country the boys of his village made him king, and he duly did all that is done by true kings: for he assigned to each individually the roles of bodyguards and sentinels and messengers and everything else, and so ruled. And what do you think is the significance of this?&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;If the boy is alive,&rdquo; said the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name>, &ldquo;and has been made king without premeditation, then be confident on this score and keep an untroubled heart: he will not be made king a second time. Even in our prophecies, it is often but a small thing that has been foretold and the consequences of dreams come to nothing in the end.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;I too, <name type="ethnic">Magi</name>,&rdquo; said <name type="pers">Astyages</name>, &ldquo;am very much of your opinion: that the dream came true when the boy was called king, and that I have no more to fear from him. Nevertheless consider well and advise me what will be safest both for my house and for you.&rdquo;
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> said, &ldquo;O King, we too are very anxious that your sovereignty prosper: for otherwise, it passes from your nation to this boy who is a <name type="ethnic">Persian</name>, and so we <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> are enslaved and held of no account by the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, as we are of another blood, but while you, our countryman, are established king, we have our share of power, and great honor is shown us by you.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Thus, then, we ought by all means to watch out for you and for your sovereignty. And if at the present time we saw any danger we would declare everything to you: but now the dream has had a trifling conclusion, and we ourselves are confident and advise you to be so also.

<milestone n="121" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Hearing this, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> was glad, and calling <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, said, &ldquo;My boy, I did you wrong because of a vision I had in a dream, that meant nothing, but by your own destiny you still live; now therefore, go to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and good luck go with you; I will send guides with you.

<milestone n="122" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>After saying this, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> sent <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> away.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then he told them, and said that until now he had known nothing but been very deceived, but that on the way he had heard the whole story of his misfortune; for he had thought, he said, that <name type="pers">Astyages</name>' cowherd was his father, but in his journey from the city his escort had told him the whole story.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And he had been raised, he said, by the cowherd's wife, and he was full of her praises, and in his tale he was constantly speaking of <name type="pers">Cyno</name>. Hearing this name, his parents circulated a story that <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> was suckled by a dog when exposed, thinking in this way to make the story of his salvation seem more marvellous to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>.

<milestone n="123" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This then was the beginning of that legend.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Even before this the following had been done by him: since <name type="pers">Astyages</name> was harsh toward the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name>, he associated with each of the chief <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> and persuaded them to make <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> their leader and depose <name type="pers">Astyages</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So much being ready and done, <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> wanted to reveal his intent to <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, who then lived among the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>. But the roads were guarded, and he had no plan for sending a message but this:
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
he carefully slit the belly of a hare, and then leaving it as it was without further harm he put into it a paper on which he wrote what he thought best.

<milestone n="124" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>All this was done. <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> took the hare and slit it and read the paper which was in it; the writing was as follows: &ldquo;Son of <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, since the gods watch over you (otherwise you would not have prospered so) avenge yourself now on <name type="pers">Astyages</name>, your murderer;

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
then you have your wish, whether I am appointed to command the army against you or some other notable man among the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name>: for they will of themselves revolt from <name type="pers">Astyages</name> and join you and try to pull him down.

<milestone n="125" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> read this, he deliberated as to what was the shrewdest way to persuade the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to revolt; and what he thought to be most effective, he did:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
writing what he liked on a paper, he assembled the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and then unfolded the paper and declared that in it <name type="pers">Astyages</name> appointed him leader of the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> armies. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said in his speech, &ldquo;I command you, men of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, to come, each provided with a sickle.&rdquo; This is what <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> said.

<milestone n="126" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So when they all came with sickles as ordered, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> commanded them to reclaim in one day a thorny tract of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, of two and one quarter or two and one half miles each way in extent.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> accomplished the task appointed; <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> then commanded them to wash themselves and come the next day; meanwhile, collecting his father's goats and sheep and oxen in one place, he slaughtered and prepared them as a feast for the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> host, providing also wine and all the foods that were most suitable.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> came on the next day he had them sit and feast in a meadow. After dinner he asked them which they liked more: their task of yesterday or their present pastime.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>They answered that the difference was great: all yesterday they had had nothing but evil, to-day nothing but good. Then, taking up their word, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> laid bare his whole purpose, and said:

&ldquo;This is your situation, men of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>: obey me and you shall have these good things and ten thousand others besides with no toil and slavery; but if you will not obey me, you will have labors unnumbered like your toil of yesterday.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Now, then, do as I tell you, and win your freedom.

<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> had long been discontent that the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> ruled them, and now having got a champion they were glad to win their freedom.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Cyrus</name> told the messenger to take back word that <name type="pers">Astyages</name> would see him sooner than he liked. Hearing this, <name type="pers">Astyages</name> armed all his <name type="ethnic">Medes</name>, and was distracted by Providence so that he forgot what he had done to <name type="pers">Harpagus</name>, and appointed him to command the army.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So when the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> marched out and engaged with the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, those who were not in on the plan fought, while others deserted to the enemy, and most were deliberate cowards and ran.

<milestone n="128" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Thus the Median army was shamefully scattered. As soon as <name type="pers">Astyages</name> heard, he sent a threatening message to <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>: &ldquo;Nevertheless, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> shall not rejoice&rdquo;;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
and with that he took the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> who interpreted dreams, who had persuaded him to let <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> go free, and impaled them; then he armed the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> who were left in the city, the very young and very old men.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Leading these out, and engaging the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, he was beaten: <name type="pers">Astyages</name> himself was taken prisoner, and lost the Median army which he led.

<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Astyages</name> was a captive, <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> came and exulted over him and taunted him, and besides much other bitter mockery he recalled his banquet, when <name type="pers">Astyages</name> had fed <name type="pers">Harpagus</name> his son's flesh, and asked <name type="pers">Astyages</name> what it was like to be a slave after having been a king.

&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said <name type="pers">Astyages</name>, &ldquo;you stand confessed the most foolish and most unjust man on earth; most foolish, in giving another the throne which you might have had for yourself, if the present business is indeed your doing; most unjust, in enslaving the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> because of that banquet.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>To pray for blessings for himself alone is not lawful for the sacrificer; rather, he prays that the king and all the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> be well; for he reckons himself among them.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When he has so arranged it, a <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> comes near and chants over it the song of the birth of the gods, as the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> tradition relates it; for no sacrifice can be offered without a <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>.

and when one is asked by his neighbor who he is, he will say that he is the son of such a mother, and rehearse the mothers of his mother.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>On the top, along the edges of the wall, they built houses of a single room, facing each other, with space enough between to drive a four-horse chariot. There are a hundred gates in the circuit of the wall, all of bronze, with posts and lintels of the same.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>In the last tower there is a great shrine; and in it stands a great and well-covered couch, and a golden table nearby.

The first of these lived five generations earlier than the second, and her name was <name type="pers">Semiramis</name>: it was she who built dikes on the plain, a notable work; before that the whole plain used to be flooded by the river.

<milestone n="185" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The second queen, whose name was <name type="pers">Nitocris</name>, was a wiser woman than the first. She left such monuments as I shall record; and moreover, seeing that the kingdom of Media was great and restless and <name key="tgn,7017998" type="place" reg="Nineveh (deserted settlement), Ninawa, Iraq, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7017998">Ninus</placeName></name> itself among other cities had fallen to it, she took such precautions as she could for her protection.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>First she dealt with the river <name key="tgn,1123842" type="place" reg="Euphrates [47.5,31.83] (river), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName></name>, which flows through the middle of her city; this had been straight before; but by digging canals higher up she made the river so crooked that its course now passes one of the <name type="ethnic">Assyrian</name> villages three times; the village which is so approached by the <name key="tgn,1123842" type="place" reg="Euphrates [47.5,31.83] (river), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName></name> is called <name type="place">Ardericca</name>. And now those who travel from our sea to <name key="tgn,7002626" type="place" reg="Babylon [44.4,32.55] (deserted settlement), Babil, Iraq, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></name> must spend three days as they float down the <name key="tgn,1123842" type="place" reg="Euphrates [47.5,31.83] (river), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName></name> coming three times to the same village.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Such was this work; and she built an embankment along either shore of the river, marvellous for its greatness and height.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Then a long way above <name key="tgn,7002626" type="place" reg="Babylon [44.4,32.55] (deserted settlement), Babil, Iraq, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></name> she dug the reservoir of a lake, a little way off from the river, always digging deep enough to find water, and making the circumference a distance of fifty two miles; what was dug out of this hole, she used to embank either edge of the river;
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
and when she had it all dug, she brought stones and made a quay all around the lake.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Her purpose in making the river wind and turning the hole into marsh was this: that the current might be slower because of the many windings that broke its force, and that the passages to <name key="tgn,7002626" type="place" reg="Babylon [44.4,32.55] (deserted settlement), Babil, Iraq, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></name> might be crooked, and that right after them should come also the long circuit of the lake.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>All this work was done in that part of the country where the passes are and the shortest road from Media, so that the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> might not mix with her people and learn of her affairs.

<milestone n="186" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So she made the deep river her protection; and this work led to another which she added to it. Her city was divided into two parts by the river that flowed through the middle. In the days of the former rulers, when one wanted to go from one part to the other, one had to cross in a boat; and this, I suppose, was a nuisance. But the queen also provided for this; she made another monument of her reign out of this same work when the digging of the basin of the lake was done.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>She had very long blocks of stone cut; and when these were ready and the place was dug, she turned the course of the river into it, and while it was filling, the former channel now being dry, she bricked the borders of the river in the city and the descent from the gate leading down to the river with baked bricks, like those of the wall; and near the middle of the city she built a bridge with the stones that had been dug up, binding them together with iron and lead.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Each morning, she laid square-hewn logs across it, on which the <name type="ethnic">Babylonians</name> crossed; but these logs were removed at night, lest folk always be crossing over and stealing from one another.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Then, when the basin she had made for a lake was filled by the river and the bridge was finished, <name type="pers">Nitocris</name> brought the <name key="tgn,1123842" type="place" reg="Euphrates [47.5,31.83] (river), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName></name> back to its former channel out of the lake; thus she had served her purpose, as she thought, by making a swamp of the basin, and her citizens had a bridge made for them.

<milestone n="187" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>There was a trick, too, that this same queen contrived. She had a tomb made for herself and set high over the very gate of that entrance of the city which was used most, with writing engraved on the tomb, which read:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;If any king of <name key="tgn,7002626" type="place" reg="Babylon [44.4,32.55] (deserted settlement), Babil, Iraq, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></name> in the future is in need of money, let him open this tomb and take as much as he likes: but let him not open it unless he is in need; for it will be the worse for him.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This tomb remained untouched until the kingship fell to <name type="pers">Darius</name>. He thought it a very strange thing that he should never use this gate, or take the money when it lay there and the writing itself invited him to.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The reason he did not use the gate was that the dead body would be over his head as he passed through.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>After opening the tomb, he found no money there, only the dead body, with writing which read: &ldquo;If you were ever satisfied with what you had and did not disgrace yourself seeking more, you would not have opened the coffins of the dead.&rdquo; Such a woman, it is recorded, was this queen.

and when he came to the lake, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> dealt with it and with the river just as had the <name type="ethnic">Babylonian</name> queen: drawing off the river by a canal into the lake, which was a marsh, he made the stream sink until its former channel could be forded.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They make these in <name key="tgn,7004538" type="place" reg="Armenia (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7004538">Armenia</placeName></name>, higher up the stream than <name type="place">Assyria</name>. First they cut frames of willow, then they stretch hides over these for a covering, making as it were a hold; they neither broaden the stern nor narrow the prow, but the boat is round, like a shield. They then fill it with reeds and send it floating down the river with a cargo; and it is for the most part palm wood casks of wine that they carry down.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Two men standing upright steer the boat, each with a paddle, one drawing it to him, the other thrusting it from him. These boats are of all sizes, some small, some very large; the largest of them are of as much as five thousand talents<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The <name type="ethnic">Attic</name> talent = about 58 lbs. avoirdupois; the <name type="ethnic">Aeginetan</name> = about 82.</note> burden. There is a live ass in each boat, or more than one in the larger.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So when they have floated down to <name key="tgn,7002626" type="place" reg="Babylon [44.4,32.55] (deserted settlement), Babil, Iraq, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></name> and disposed of their cargo, they sell the framework of the boat and all the reeds; the hides are set on the backs of asses, which are then driven back to <name key="tgn,7004538" type="place" reg="Armenia (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7004538">Armenia</placeName></name>,
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
for it is not by any means possible to go upstream by water, because of the swiftness of the current; it is for this reason that they make their boats of hides and not of wood. When they have driven their asses back into <name key="tgn,7004538" type="place" reg="Armenia (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7004538">Armenia</placeName></name>, they make more boats in the same way.

<milestone n="195" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Such then are their boats. For clothing, they wear a linen tunic, reaching to the feet; over this the <name type="ethnic">Babylonian</name> puts on another tunic, of wool, and wraps himself in a white mantle; he wears the shoes of his country, which are like <name type="ethnic">Boeotian</name> sandals. Their hair is worn long, and covered by caps; the whole body is perfumed.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Every man has a seal and a carved staff, and on every staff is some image, such as that of an apple or a rose or a lily or an eagle: no one carries a staff without an image.

<milestone n="196" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This is the equipment of their persons. I will now speak of their established customs. The wisest of these, in our judgment, is one which I have learned by inquiry is also a custom of the <name type="ethnic">Eneti</name> in <name key="tgn,7016683" type="place" reg="Illyria (region (general)), Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName></name>. It is this: once a year in every village all the maidens as they attained marriageable age were collected and brought together into one place, with a crowd of men standing around.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then a crier would display and offer them for sale one by one, first the fairest of all; and then, when she had fetched a great price, he put up for sale the next most attractive, selling all the maidens as lawful wives. Rich men of <name type="place">Assyria</name> who desired to marry would outbid each other for the fairest; the ordinary people, who desired to marry and had no use for beauty, could take the ugly ones and money besides;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
for when the crier had sold all the most attractive, he would put up the one that was least beautiful, or crippled, and offer her to whoever would take her to wife for the least amount, until she fell to one who promised to accept least; the money came from the sale of the attractive ones, who thus paid the dowry of the ugly and the crippled. But a man could not give his daughter in marriage to whomever he liked, nor could one that bought a girl take her away without giving security that he would in fact make her his wife.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And if the couple could not agree, it was a law that the money be returned. Men might also come from other villages to buy if they so desired.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>This, then, was their best custom; but it does not continue at this time; they have invented a new one lately &lsqb;so that the women not be wronged or taken to another city&rsqb;; since the conquest of <name key="tgn,7002626" type="place" reg="Babylon [44.4,32.55] (deserted settlement), Babil, Iraq, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></name> made them afflicted and poor, everyone of the people that lacks a livelihood prostitutes his daughters.

<milestone n="197" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>I come now to the next wisest of their customs: having no use for physicians, they carry the sick into the market-place; then those who have been afflicted themselves by the same illness as the sick man's, or seen others in like case, come near and advise him about his disease and comfort him, telling him by what means they have themselves recovered from it or seen others recover. No one may pass by the sick man without speaking and asking after his sickness.

<milestone n="198" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The dead are embalmed in honey for burial, and their dirges are like the dirges of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>. Whenever a <name type="ethnic">Babylonian</name> has had intercourse with his wife, they both sit before a burnt offering of incense, and at dawn they wash themselves; they will touch no vessel before this is done. This is the custom in <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name> also.

<milestone n="199" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The foulest <name type="ethnic">Babylonian</name> custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of <name type="pers">Aphrodite</name> and have intercourse with some stranger once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But most sit down in the sacred plot of <name type="pers">Aphrodite</name>, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, &ldquo;I invite you in the name of <name type="pers">Mylitta</name>&rdquo; (that is the <name type="ethnic">Assyrian</name> name for <name type="pers">Aphrodite</name>).
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfill the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of <name key="tgn,1006894" type="place" reg="Cyprus [33,35] (island), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1006894">Cyprus</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="200" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>These are established customs among the <name type="ethnic">Babylonians</name>. Furthermore, there are three tribes in the country that eat nothing but fish, which they catch and dry in the sun; then, after throwing it into a mortar, they pound it with pestles and strain everything through linen. Then whoever desires kneads as it were a cake of it and eats it; others bake it like bread.

<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> had conquered this nation, too, he wanted to subject the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name>.

<milestone n="202" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="place">Araxes</name> is said by some to be greater and by some to be less than the <name type="place">Ister</name>.

and they know (it is said) of trees bearing a fruit whose effect is this: gathering in groups and kindling a fire, the people sit around it and throw the fruit into the flames; then the fumes of it as it burns make them drunk as the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> are with wine, and more and more drunk as more fruit is thrown on the fire, until at last they rise up to dance and even sing. Such is said to be their way of life.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="place">Araxes</name><note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The <name type="place">Araxes</name> of this chapter appears to be, from the description of its course, the modern <name key="tgn,7002838" type="place" reg="Araks [48.416,40] (river), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002838">Aras</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="203" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
but the <name type="place">Caspian</name> is separate and by itself. Its length is what a ship rowed by oars can traverse in fifteen days, and its breadth, where it is broadest, is an eight days' journey.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Here, it is said, are trees growing leaves that men crush and mix with water and use for painting figures on their clothing; these figures cannot be washed out, but last as long as the wool, as if they had been woven into it from the first. Men and women here (they say) have intercourse openly, like beasts of the flock.

<milestone n="204" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This sea called <name type="place">Caspian</name> is hemmed in to the west by the <name key="tgn,1108814" type="place" reg="Bol&apos;soj Kavkaz [46.833,42] (mountain range), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,1108814">Caucasus</placeName></name>: towards the east and the sunrise there stretches from its shores a boundless plain as far as the eye can see. The greater part of this wide plain is the country of the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name>, against whom <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> was eager to lead his army.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For there were many weighty reasons that impelled and encouraged him to do so: first, his birth, because of which he seemed to be something more than mortal; and next, his victories in his wars: for no nation that <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> undertook to attack could escape from him.

<milestone n="205" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now at this time the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> were ruled by a queen called <name type="pers">Tomyris</name>, whose husband was dead. <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> sent a message with a pretence of wanting her for his wife, but <name type="pers">Tomyris</name> would have none of his advances, well understanding that he wanted not her but the kingdom of the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>So when guile was of no avail, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> marched to the <name type="place">Araxes</name> and openly prepared to attack the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name>; he bridged the river for his army to cross, and built towers on the pontoons bridging the river.

<milestone n="206" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But while he was busy at this, <name type="pers">Tomyris</name> sent a herald to him with this message: &ldquo;O king of the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name>, stop hurrying on what you are hurrying on, for you cannot know whether the completion of this work will be for your advantage. Stop, and be king of your own country; and endure seeing us ruling those whom we rule.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But if you will not take this advice, and will do anything rather than remain at peace, then if you so greatly desire to try the strength of the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name>, stop your present work of bridging the river, and let us withdraw three days' journey from the <name type="place">Araxes</name>; and when that is done, cross into our country.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Or if you prefer to receive us into your country, then withdraw yourself as I have said.&rdquo; Hearing this, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> called together the leading <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and laid the matter before them, asking them to advise him which he should do. They all spoke to the same end, urging him to let <name type="pers">Tomyris</name> and her army enter his country.

<milestone n="207" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But <name type="pers">Croesus</name> the <name type="ethnic">Lydian</name>, who was present, was displeased by their advice and spoke against it. &ldquo;O King,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have before now heard from me that since <name type="pers">Zeus</name> has given me to you I will turn aside to the best of my ability whatever misadventure I see threatening your house. And disaster has been my teacher.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now, if you think that you and the army that you lead are immortal, I have no business giving you advice; but if you know that you and those whom you rule are only men, then I must first teach you this: men's fortunes are on a wheel, which in its turning does not allow the same man to prosper forever.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So, if that is the case, I am not of the same opinion about the business in hand as these other counsellors of yours. This is the danger if we agree to let the enemy enter your country: if you lose the battle, you lose your empire also, for it is plain that if the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> win they will not retreat but will march against your provinces.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And if you conquer them, it is a lesser victory than if you crossed into their country and routed the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> and pursued them; for I weigh your chances against theirs, and suppose that when you have beaten your adversaries you will march for the seat of <name type="pers">Tomyris</name>' power.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>And besides what I have shown, it would be a shameful thing and not to be endured if <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> the son of <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> should yield and give ground before a woman. Now then, it occurs to me that we should cross and go forward as far as they draw back, and that then we should endeavor to overcome them by doing as I shall show.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>As I understand, the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> have no experience of the good things of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, and have never fared well as to what is greatly desirable. Therefore, I advise you to cut up the meat of many of your sheep and goats into generous portions for these men, and to cook it and serve it as a feast in our camp, providing many bowls of unmixed wine and all kinds of food.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Then let your army withdraw to the river again, leaving behind that part of it which is of least value. For if I am not mistaken in my judgment, when the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> see so many good things they will give themselves over to feasting on them; and it will be up to us then to accomplish great things.&rdquo;

<milestone n="208" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So these opinions clashed; and <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> set aside his former plan and chose that of <name type="pers">Croesus</name>; consequently, he told <name type="pers">Tomyris</name> to draw her army off, for he would cross (he said) and attack her; so she withdrew as she had promised before. Then he entrusted <name type="pers">Croesus</name> to the care of his own son <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, to whom he would leave his sovereignty, telling <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> to honor <name type="pers">Croesus</name> and treat him well if the crossing of the river against the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> should not go well. With these instructions, he sent the two back to <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, and he and his army crossed the river.

<milestone n="209" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>After he had crossed the <name type="place">Araxes</name>, he dreamed that night while sleeping in the country of the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> that he saw the eldest of <name type="pers">Hystapes</name>' sons with wings on his shoulders, the one wing overshadowing <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name> and the other <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Hystaspes</name> son of <name type="pers">Arsames</name> was an <name type="pers">Achaemenid</name>, and <name type="pers">Darius</name> was the eldest of his sons, then about twenty years old; this <name type="pers">Darius</name> had been left behind in <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, not yet being of an age to go on campaign.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So when <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> awoke he considered his vision, and because it seemed to him to be of great importance, he sent for <name type="pers">Hystaspes</name> and said to him privately, &ldquo;<name type="pers">Hystaspes</name>, I have caught your son plotting against me and my sovereignty; and I will tell you how I know this for certain.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The gods care for me and show me beforehand all that is coming.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>From this vision, there is no way that he is not plotting against me.

<milestone n="210" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Cyrus</name> said this, thinking that <name type="pers">Darius</name> was plotting against him; but in fact, heaven was showing him that he himself was to die in the land where he was and <name type="pers">Darius</name> inherit his kingdom.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>So then <name type="pers">Hystaspes</name> replied with this: &ldquo;O King, may there not be any <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> born who would plot against you! But if there is, may he perish suddenly; for you have made the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> free men instead of slaves and rulers of all instead of subjects of any.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But if your vision does indeed signify that my son is planning revolution, I give him to you to treat as you like.&rdquo;

<milestone n="211" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>After having given this answer and crossed the <name type="place">Araxes</name>, <name type="pers">Hystaspes</name> went to <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> to watch his son for <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>; and <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, advancing a day's journey from the <name type="place">Araxes</name>, acted according to <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' advice.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Cyrus</name> and the sound portion of the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> army marched back to the <name type="place">Araxes</name>, leaving behind those that were useless; a third of the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> forces attacked those of the army who were left behind and destroyed them despite resistance; then, when they had overcome their enemies, seeing the banquet spread they sat down and feasted, and after they had had their fill of food and wine, they fell asleep.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Then the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> attacked them, killing many and taking many more alive, among whom was the son of <name type="pers">Tomyris</name> the queen, <name type="pers">Spargapises</name> by name, the leader of the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name>.

<milestone n="212" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Tomyris</name> heard what had happened to her army and her son, she sent a herald to <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> with this message:

&ldquo;<name type="pers">Cyrus</name> who can never get enough blood, do not be elated by what you have done; it is nothing to be proud of if, by the fruit of the vine&mdash;with which you <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> fill yourselves and rage so violently that evil words rise in a flood to your lips when the wine enters your bodies&mdash;if, by tricking him with this drug, you got the better of my son, and not by force of arms in battle.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now, then, take a word of good advice from me: give me back my son and leave this country unpunished, even though you have savaged a third of the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> army.

<milestone n="213" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Cyrus</name> dismissed this warning when it was repeated to him.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Psammetichus</name>, when he was in no way able to learn by inquiry which people had first come into being, devised a plan by which he took two newborn children of the common people and gave them to a shepherd to bring up among his flocks. He gave instructions that no one was to speak a word in their hearing; they were to stay by themselves in a lonely hut, and in due time the shepherd was to bring goats and give the children their milk and do everything else necessary.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Psammetichus</name> did this, and gave these instructions, because he wanted to hear what speech would first come from the children, when they were past the age of indistinct babbling.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>When he first heard this, he kept quiet about it; but when, coming often and paying careful attention, he kept hearing this same word, he told his master at last and brought the children into the king's presence as required. <name type="pers">Psammetichus</name> then heard them himself, and asked to what language the word &ldquo;Bekos&rdquo; belonged; he found it to be a <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name> word, signifying bread.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>One of them maintains that the <name type="ethnic">Etesian</name> winds<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The regular N.W. winds which blow in summer from the <name key="tgn,7016735" type="place" reg="Mediterranean Sea [30,31.5] (sea)"><placeName key="tgn,7016735">Mediterranean</placeName></name>.</note> are the cause of the river being in flood, because they hinder the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> from emptying into the sea.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And further, if the <name type="ethnic">Etesian</name> winds were the cause, then the other rivers which flow contrary to those winds should be affected like the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>, and even more so, since being smaller they have a weaker current. Yet there are many rivers in <name key="tgn,1000140" type="place" reg="Syria [38,35] (nation), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName></name> and many in <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>, and they behave nothing like the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The second opinion is less grounded on knowledge than the previous, though it is more marvellous to the ear: according to it, the river effects what it does because it flows from Ocean, which flows around the whole world.

<milestone unit="para"/>The third opinion is by far the most plausible, yet the most erroneous of all. It has no more truth in it than the others.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>How can it flow from snow, then, seeing that it comes from the hottest places to lands that are for the most part cooler?

<milestone unit="para"/>If, after having condemned the opinions proposed, I must indicate what I myself think about these obscure matters, I shall say why I think the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> floods in the summer. During the winter, the sun is driven by storms from his customary course and passes over the inland parts of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For the briefest demonstration, everything has been said; for whatever country this god is nearest, or over, it is likely that that land is very thirsty for water and that the local rivers are dried up.

<milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>A lengthier demonstration goes as follows. In its passage over the inland parts of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName></name>, the sun does this: as the air is always clear in that region, the land warm, and the winds cool, the sun does in its passage exactly as it would do in the summer passing through the middle of the heaven:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
it draws the water to itself, and having done so, expels it away to the inland regions, and the winds catch it and scatter and dissolve it; and, as is to be expected, those that blow from that country, the south and the southwest, are the most rainy of all winds.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Yet I think that the sun never lets go of all of the water that it draws up from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> yearly, but keeps some back near itself. Then, as the winter becomes milder, the sun returns to the middle of the heaven, and after that draws from all rivers alike.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Meanwhile, the other rivers are swollen to high flood by the quantity of water that falls into them from the sky, because the country is rained on and cut into gullies; but in the summer they are low, lacking the rain and being drawn up too by the sun.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>, being fed by no rain, and being the only river drawn up by the sun in winter, at this time falls far short of the height that it had in summer; which is but natural; for in summer all other waters too and not it alone are attracted to the sun, but in the winter it alone is afflicted.

<milestone n="26" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>I am convinced, therefore, that the sun is the cause of this phenomenon.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>After praying in the foregoing way, they take the whole stomach out of the flayed bull, leaving the entrails and the fat in the carcass, and cut off the legs, the end of the loin, the shoulders, and the neck.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Having done this, they fill what remains of the carcass with pure bread, honey, raisins, figs, frankincense, myrrh, and other kinds of incense, and then burn it, pouring a lot of oil on it.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>They fast before the sacrifice, and while it is burning, they all make lamentation; and when their lamentation is over, they set out a meal of what is left of the victim.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Cattle that die are dealt with in the following way.

to show himself displaying the head and wearing the fleece of a ram which he had flayed and beheaded.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>There I saw it, richly equipped with many other offerings, besides two pillars, one of refined gold, one of emerald: a great pillar that shone at night; and in conversation with the priests, I asked how long it was since their temple was built.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>I found that their account did not tally with the belief of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, either; for they said that the temple of the god was founded when <name key="tgn,7002862" type="place" reg="Tyre [35.183,33.266] (inhabited place), Al-Janub, Lebanon, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName></name> first became a city, and that was two thousand three hundred years ago.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now it seems to me that by this story the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> show themselves altogether ignorant of the character and customs of the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>; for how should they sacrifice men when they are forbidden to sacrifice even beasts, except swine and bulls and bull-calves, if they are unblemished, and geese?
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And furthermore, as <name type="pers">Heracles</name> was alone, and, still, only a man, as they say, how is it natural that he should kill many myriads? In talking so much about this, may I keep the goodwill of gods and heroes!

<milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This is why the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> of whom I have spoken sacrifice no goats, male or female: the <name type="ethnic">Mendesians</name> reckon Pan among the eight gods who, they say, were before the twelve gods.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Mendesians</name> consider all goats sacred, the male even more than the female, and goatherds are held in special estimation: one he-goat is most sacred of all; when he dies, it is ordained that there should be great mourning in all the <name type="place">Mendesian district</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>I say, then, that <name type="pers">Melampus</name> acquired the prophetic art, being a discerning man, and that, besides many other things which he learned from <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, he also taught the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> things concerning <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>, altering few of them; for I will not say that what is done in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> in connection with the god and what is done among the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> originated independently: for they would then be of an <name type="ethnic">Hellenic</name> character and not recently introduced.

the latter settled on an oak tree, and there uttered human speech, declaring that a place of divination from <name type="pers">Zeus</name> must be made there; the people of <name key="perseus,Dodona" type="place" reg="Dodona [20.8,39.55] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName></name> understood that the message was divine, and therefore established the oracular shrine.

and then, being a slave there, she established a shrine of <name type="pers">Zeus</name> under an oak that was growing there; for it was reasonable that, as she had been a handmaid of the temple of <name type="pers">Zeus</name> at <name key="tgn,7001297" type="place" reg="Thebes [32.666,25.683] (deserted settlement), Qina, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001297">Thebes</placeName></name>

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
for beasts and birds (they say) are seen to mate both in the temples and in the sacred precincts; now were this displeasing to the god, the beasts would not do so. This is the reason given by others for practices which I, for my part, dislike;

<milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
but the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> in this and in all other matters are exceedingly strict against desecration of their temples.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But I will indicate how it is customary to deal with the animals. Men and women are appointed guardians to provide nourishment for each kind respectively; a son inherits this office from his father.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Townsfolk in each place, when they pay their vows, pray to the god to whom the animal is dedicated, shaving all or one half or one third of their children's heads, and weighing the hair in a balance against a sum of silver; then the weight in silver of the hair is given to the female guardian of the creatures, who buys fish with it and feeds them.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Thus, food is provided for them. Whoever kills one of these creatures intentionally is punished with death; if he kills accidentally, he pays whatever penalty the priests appoint. Whoever kills an ibis or a hawk, intentionally or not, must die for it.

<milestone unit="para"/>There are many household animals; and there would be many more, were it not for what happens among the cats. When the females have a litter, they are no longer receptive to the males; those that seek to have intercourse with them cannot;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
so their recourse is to steal and carry off and kill the kittens (but they do not eat what they have killed). The mothers, deprived of their young and desiring to have more, will then approach the males; for they are creatures that love offspring.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And when a fire breaks out, very strange things happen among the cats. The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> stand around in a broken line, thinking more of the cats than of quenching the burning; but the cats slip through or leap over the men and spring into the fire.

for whenever the crocodile comes ashore out of the water and then opens its mouth (and it does this mostly to catch the west wind), the sandpiper goes into its mouth and eats the leeches; the crocodile is pleased by this service and does the sandpiper no harm.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In this city is a square temple of <name type="pers">Perseus</name> son of <name type="pers">Danae</name>, in a grove of palm trees.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The people of this <name key="tgn,7001190" type="place" reg=" +Akhmim [31.733,26.566] (inhabited place), Sawhaj, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001190">Khemmis</placeName></name> say that <name type="pers">Perseus</name> is seen often up and down this land, and often within the temple, and that the sandal he wears, which is four feet long, keeps turning up, and that when it does turn up, all <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> prospers.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>This is what they say; and their doings in honor of <name type="pers">Perseus</name> are <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>, inasmuch as they celebrate games that include every form of contest, and offer animals and cloaks and skins as prizes.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When I asked why <name type="pers">Perseus</name> appeared only to them, and why, unlike all other <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, they celebrate games, they told me that <name type="pers">Perseus</name> was by lineage of their city; for <name type="pers">Danaus</name> and <name type="pers">Lynceus</name>, who travelled to <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></name>, were of <name key="tgn,7001190" type="place" reg=" +Akhmim [31.733,26.566] (inhabited place), Sawhaj, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001190">Khemmis</placeName></name>; and they traced descent from these down to <name type="pers">Perseus</name>.

It was at his bidding, they said, that they celebrated the games.

<milestone n="92" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>All these are the customs of <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who live above the marsh country. Those who inhabit the marshes have the same customs as the rest of <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>, even that each man has one wife just like <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>. They have, besides, devised means to make their food less costly.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When the river is in flood and flows over the plains, many lilies, which the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> call lotus, grow in the water. They gather these and dry them in the sun; then they crush the poppy-like center of the plant and bake loaves of it.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The root of this lotus is edible also, and of a sweetish taste; it is round, and the size of an apple.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Other lilies grow in the river, too, that are like roses; the fruit of these is found in a calyx springing from the root by a separate stalk, and is most like a comb made by wasps; this produces many edible seeds as big as olive pits, which are eaten both fresh and dried.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>They also use the byblus which grows annually: it is gathered from the marshes, the top of it cut off and put to other uses, and the lower part, about twenty inches long, eaten or sold. Those who wish to use the byblus at its very best, roast it before eating in a red-hot oven. Some live on fish alone. They catch the fish, take out the intestines, then dry them in the sun and eat them dried.

<milestone n="93" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Fish that go in schools are seldom born in rivers; they are raised in the lakes, and this is how they behave: when the desire of spawning comes on them, they swim out to sea in schools, the males leading, and throwing out their milt, while the females come after and swallow and conceive from it.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When the females have grown heavy in the sea, then all the fish swim back to their own haunts. But the same no longer lead; now the leadership goes to the females. They go before in a school as the males had, and now and then throw off some of their eggs (which are like millet-seeds), which the males devour as they follow. These millet-seeds, or eggs, are fish.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The fish that are reared come from the eggs that survive and are not devoured. Those fish that are caught while swimming seawards show bruises on the left side of their heads; those that are caught returning, on the right side.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>This happens because they keep close to the left bank as they swim seawards, and keep to the same bank also on their return, grazing it and keeping in contact with it as well as they can, I suppose lest the current make them miss their way.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> begins to rise, hollow and marshy places near the river are the first to begin to fill, the water trickling through from the river, and as soon as they are flooded, they are suddenly full of little fishes.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Where these probably come from, I believe that I can guess. When the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> falls, the fish have dropped their eggs into the mud before they leave with the last of the water; and when in the course of time the flood comes again in the following year, from these eggs at once come the fish.

<milestone n="94" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So much, then, for the fish. The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who live around the marshes use an oil drawn from the castor-berry, which they call kiki. They sow this plant, which grows wild in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name>, on the banks of the rivers and lakes;

sown in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, it produces abundant fruit, though malodorous; when they gather this, some bruise and press it, others boil after roasting it, and collect the liquid that comes from it. This is thick and useful as oil for lamps, and gives off a strong smell.

<milestone unit="para"/>Against the mosquitos that abound, the following have been devised by them: those who dwell higher up than the marshy country are well served by the towers where they ascend to sleep, for the winds prevent the mosquitos from flying aloft;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
those living about the marshes have a different recourse, instead of the towers. Every one of them has a net, with which he catches fish by day, and at night he sets it around the bed where he rests, then creeps under it and sleeps.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
by fastening these four foot logs to long and close-set stakes; and having done so, they set crossbeams athwart and on the logs. They use no ribs. They caulk the seams within with byblus.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>There is one rudder, passing through a hole in the boat's keel. The mast is of acacia-wood and the sails of byblus. These boats cannot move upstream unless a brisk breeze continues; they are towed from the bank; but downstream they are managed thus:
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
they have a raft made of tamarisk wood, fastened together with matting of reeds, and a pierced stone of about two talents' weight; the raft is let go to float down ahead of the boat, connected to it by a rope, and the stone is connected by a rope to the after part of the boat.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So, driven by the current, the raft floats swiftly and tows the &ldquo;baris&rdquo; (which is the name of these boats,) and the stone dragging behind on the river bottom keeps the boat's course straight. There are many of these boats; some are of many thousand talents' burden.

<milestone unit="para"/>So far, all I have said is the record of my own autopsy and judgment and inquiry. Henceforth I will record <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> chronicles, according to what I have heard, adding something of what I myself have seen.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The priests told me that <name type="pers">Min</name> was the first king of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, and that first he separated <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> by a dam. All the river had flowed close under the sandy mountains on the <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> side, but <name type="pers">Min</name> made the southern bend of it, which begins about twelve and one half miles above <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name>, by damming the stream, thereby drying up the ancient channel, and carried the river by a channel so that it flowed midway between the hills.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>And to this day the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> keep careful watch on this bend of the river, strengthening its dam every year to keep the current in; for were the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> to burst its dikes and overflow here, all <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> would be in danger of flooding.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Then, when this first king <name type="pers">Min</name> had made dry land of what he thus cut off, he first founded in it that city which is now called <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> (for even <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name> lies in the narrow part of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>), and outside of it he dug a lake from the river to its north and west (for the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name> itself bounds it on the east); and secondly, he built in it the great and most noteworthy temple of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>.

<milestone unit="para"/>After him came three hundred and thirty kings, whose names the priests recited from a papyrus roll.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The name of the queen was the same as that of the <name type="ethnic">Babylonian</name> princess, <name type="pers">Nitocris</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>She built a spacious underground chamber; then, with the pretence of inaugurating it, but with quite another intent in her mind, she gave a great feast, inviting to it those <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> whom she knew to have had the most complicity in her brother's murder; and while they feasted, she let the river in upon them by a vast secret channel.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>This was all that the priests told of her, except that when she had done this she cast herself into a chamber full of hot ashes, to escape vengeance.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>When those that he met were valiant men and strove hard for freedom, he set up pillars in their land, the inscription on which showed his own name and his country's, and how he had overcome them with his own power;
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
but when the cities had made no resistance and been easily taken, then he put an inscription on the pillars just as he had done where the nations were brave; but he also drew on them the private parts of a woman, wishing to show clearly that the people were cowardly.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It was these who dragged the great and long blocks of stone which were brought in this king's reign to the temple of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>; and it was they who were compelled to dig all the canals which are now in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, and involuntarily made what had been a land of horses and carts empty of these.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And any man who was robbed by the river of part of his land could come to <name type="pers">Sesostris</name> and declare what had happened; then the king would send men to look into it and calculate the part by which the land was diminished, so that thereafter it should pay in proportion to the tax originally imposed.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>From this, in my opinion, the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> learned the art of measuring land; the sunclock and the sundial, and the twelve divisions of the day, came to <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name> from <name key="tgn,7013255" type="place" reg=" +Babylonia (region (general)), Iraq, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7013255">Babylonia</placeName></name> and not from <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
then, it is said, the king was so audacious as to seize a spear and hurl it into the midst of the river eddies. Right after this, he came down with a disease of the eyes, and became blind. When he had been blind for ten years, an oracle from the city of <name key="tgn,7001292" type="place" reg=" +Kawm al-Farain [30.733,31.2] (deserted settlement), Kafr ash-Shaykh, Lower Egypt, Egypt, Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7001292">Buto</placeName></name> declared to him that the term of his punishment was drawing to an end, and that he would regain his sight by washing his eyes with the urine of a woman who had never had intercourse with any man but her own husband.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Pheros</name> tried his own wife first; and, as he remained blind, all women, one after another. When he at last recovered his sight, he took all the women whom he had tried, except the one who had made him see again, and gathered them into one town, the one which is now called &ldquo;<name type="place">Red Clay</name>&rdquo;; having concentrated them together there, he burnt them and the town;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
but the woman by whose means he had recovered his sight, he married. Most worthy of mention among the many offerings which he dedicated in all the noteworthy temples for his deliverance from blindness are the two marvellous stone obelisks which he set up in the temple of the Sun. Each of these is made of a single block, and is over one hundred and sixty-six feet high and thirteen feet thick.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, thinking that the <name type="ethnic">Trojans</name> were mocking them, laid siege to the city, until they took it; but there was no <name type="pers">Helen</name> there when they breached the wall, but they heard the same account as before; so, crediting the original testimony, they sent <name type="pers">Menelaus</name> himself to <name type="pers">Proteus</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Yet, although getting this, <name type="pers">Menelaus</name> was guilty of injustice toward the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>. For adverse weather detained him when he tried to sail away; after this continued for some time, he carried out something impious,
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
taking two native children and sacrificing them.

The priests told me that they had learned some of this by inquiry, but that they were sure of what had happened in their own country.

<milestone n="120" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>' priests said this, and I myself believe their story about <name type="pers">Helen</name>, for I reason thus: had <name type="pers">Helen</name> been in <name key="tgn,7002329" type="place" reg=" +Troy [26.25,39.95] (deserted settlement), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName></name>, then with or without the will of <name type="pers">Alexandrus</name> she would have been given back to the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For surely <name type="pers">Priam</name> was not so mad, or those nearest to him, as to consent to risk their own persons and their children and their city so that <name type="pers">Alexandrus</name> might cohabit with <name type="pers">Helen</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Even if it were conceded that they were so inclined in the first days, yet when not only many of the <name type="ethnic">Trojans</name> were slain in fighting against the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, but <name type="pers">Priam</name> himself lost to death two or three or even more of his sons in every battle (if the poets are to be believed), in this turn of events, had <name type="pers">Helen</name> been <name type="pers">Priam</name>'s own wife, I cannot but think that he would have restored her to the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, if by so doing he could escape from the evils besetting him.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Alexandrus</name> was not even heir to the throne, in which case matters might have been in his hands since <name type="pers">Priam</name> was old, but <name type="pers">Hector</name>, who was an older and a better man than <name type="pers">Alexandrus</name>, was going to receive the royal power at <name type="pers">Priam</name>'s death, and ought not have acquiesced in his brother's wrongdoing, especially when that brother was the cause of great calamity to <name type="pers">Hector</name> himself and all the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Trojans</name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But since they did not have <name type="pers">Helen</name> there to give back, and since the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> would not believe them although they spoke the truth&mdash;I am convinced and declare&mdash;the divine powers provided that the <name type="ethnic">Trojans</name>, perishing in utter destruction, should make this clear to all mankind: that retribution from the gods for terrible wrongdoing is also terrible. This is what I think, and I state it.

<milestone unit="para"/>The next to reign after <name type="pers">Proteus</name> (they said) was <name type="pers">Rhampsinitus</name>. The memorial of his name left by him was the western forecourt of the temple of <name type="pers">Hephaestus</name>; he set two statues here forty-one feet high; the northernmost of these the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> call Summer, and the southernmost Winter; the one that they call Summer they worship and treat well, but do the opposite to the statue called Winter.

<milestone n="121A" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>This king (they told me) had great wealth in silver, so great that none of the succeeding kings could surpass or come near it. To store his treasure safely, he had a stone chamber built, one of its walls abutting on the outer side of his palace. But the builder of it shrewdly provided that one stone be so placed as to be easily removed by two men or even by one.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>So when the chamber was finished, the king stored his treasure in it, and as time went on, the builder, drawing near the end of his life, summoned his sons (he had two) and told them how he had provided for them, that they have an ample livelihood, by the art with which he had built the king's treasure-house; explaining clearly to them how to remove the stone, he gave the coordinates of it, and told them that if they kept these in mind, they would be the custodians of the king's riches.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So when he was dead, his sons got to work at once: coming to the palace by night, they readily found and managed the stone in the building, and took away much of the treasure.

<milestone n="121B" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>When the king opened the building, he was amazed to see the containers lacking their treasure; yet he did not know whom to accuse, seeing that the seals were unbroken and the building shut fast. But when less treasure appeared the second and third times he opened the building (for the thieves did not stop plundering), he had traps made and placed around the containers in which his riches were stored.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The thieves came just as before, and one of them crept in; when he came near the container, right away he was caught in the trap. When he saw the trouble he was in, he called to his brother right away and explained to him the problem, and told him to come in quickly and cut off his head, lest he be seen and recognized and destroy him, too. He seemed to have spoken rightly to the other, who did as he was persuaded and then, replacing the stone, went home, carrying his brother's head.

<milestone n="121C" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>When day came, the king went to the building, and was amazed to see in the trap the thief's body without a head, yet the building intact, with no way in or out. At a loss, he did as follows: he suspended the thief's body from the wall and set guards over it, instructing them to seize and bring to him any whom they saw weeping or making lamentation.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But the thief's mother, when the body had been hung up, was terribly stricken: she had words with her surviving son, and told him that he was somehow to think of some way to cut loose and bring her his brother's body, and if he did not obey, she threatened to go to the king and denounce him as having the treasure.

<milestone n="121D" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>So when his mother bitterly reproached the surviving son and for all that he said he could not dissuade her, he devised a plan: he harnessed asses and put skins full of wine on the asses, then set out driving them; and when he was near those who were guarding the hanging body, he pulled at the feet of two or three of the skins and loosed their fastenings;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
and as the wine ran out, he beat his head and cried aloud like one who did not know to which ass he should turn first, while the guards, when they saw the wine flowing freely, ran out into the road with cups and caught what was pouring out, thinking themselves in luck;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
feigning anger, the man cursed all; but as the guards addressed him peaceably, he pretended to be soothed and to relent in his anger, and finally drove his asses out of the road and put his harness in order.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And after more words passed and one joked with him and got him to laugh, he gave them one of the skins: and they lay down there just as they were, disposed to drink, and included him and told him to stay and drink with them; and he consented and stayed.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When they cheerily saluted him in their drinking, he gave them yet another of the skins; and the guards grew very drunk with the abundance of liquor, and lay down right there where they were drinking, overpowered by sleep;
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
but he, when it was late at night, cut down the body of his brother and shaved the right cheek of each of the guards for the indignity, and loading the body on his asses, drove home, fulfilling his mother's commands.

<milestone n="121E" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the king learned that the body of the thief had been taken, he was beside himself and, obsessed with finding who it was who had managed this, did as follows&mdash;they say, but I do not believe it.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He put his own daughter in a brothel, instructing her to accept all alike and, before having intercourse, to make each tell her the shrewdest and most impious thing he had done in his life; whoever told her the story of the thief, she was to seize and not let get out.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The girl did as her father told her, and the thief, learning why she was doing this, did as follows, wanting to get the better of the king by craft.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>He cut the arm off a fresh corpse at the shoulder, and went to the king's daughter, carrying it under his cloak, and when asked the same question as the rest, he said that his most impious act had been when he had cut the head off his brother who was caught in a trap in the king's treasury; and his shrewdest, that after making the guards drunk he had cut down his brother's hanging body.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When she heard this, the princess grabbed for him; but in the darkness the thief let her have the arm of the corpse; and clutching it, she held on, believing that she had the arm of the other; but the thief, after giving it to her, was gone in a flash out the door.

<milestone n="121F" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When this also came to the king's ears, he was astonished at the man's ingenuity and daring, and in the end, he sent a proclamation to every town, promising the thief immunity and a great reward if he would come into the king's presence.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The thief trusted the king and came before him; <name type="pers">Rhampsinitus</name> was very admiring and gave him his daughter to marry on the grounds that he was the cleverest of men; for as the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> (he said) surpassed all others in craft, so he surpassed the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>They worked in gangs of a hundred thousand men, each gang for three months.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
(for the road is nearly a mile long and twenty yards wide, and elevated at its highest to a height of sixteen yards, and it is all of stone polished and carved with figures). The aforesaid ten years went to the building of this road and of the underground chambers in the hill where the pyramids stand; these, the king meant to be burial-places for himself, and surrounded them with water, bringing in a channel from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>The pyramid itself was twenty years in the making. Its base is square, each side eight hundred feet long, and its height is the same; the whole is of stone polished and most exactly fitted; there is no block of less than thirty feet in length.

<milestone n="125" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This pyramid was made like stairs, which some call steps and others, tiers.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When this, its first form, was completed, the workmen used short wooden logs as levers to raise the rest of the stones<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">That is, the stones which were to fill up the angles of the steps, and make the side of the pyramid a smooth inclined plane.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
when the stone had been raised, it was set on another lever that stood on the first tier, and the lever again used to lift it from this tier to the next.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>It may be that there was a new lever on each tier of steps, or perhaps there was only one lever, quite portable, which they carried up to each tier in turn; I leave this uncertain, as both possibilities were mentioned.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But this is certain, that the upper part of the pyramid was finished off first, then the next below it, and last of all the base and the lowest part.

<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Now if that is so, how much must have been spent on the iron with which they worked, and the workmen's food and clothing, considering that the time aforesaid was spent in building, while hewing and carrying the stone and digging out the underground parts was, as I suppose, a business of long duration.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Though mild toward his people and conducting himself as he did, yet he suffered calamities, the first of which was the death of his daughter, the only child of his household.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The king took this badly, and sent back to the oracle a message of reproach, blaming the god that his father and his uncle, though they had shut up the temples, and disregarded the gods, and destroyed men, had lived for a long time, but that he who was pious was going to die so soon.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But a second oracle came announcing that for this very reason his life was hastening to a close: he had done what was contrary to fate; <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> should have been afflicted for a hundred and fifty years, and the two kings before him knew this, but not he.

for very many years later than these kings who left the pyramids came <name type="pers">Rhodopis</name>, who was <name type="ethnic">Thracian</name> by birth, and a slave of <name type="pers">Iadmon</name> son of <name type="pers">Hephaestopolis</name> the <name type="ethnic">Samian</name>, and a fellow-slave of <name type="pers">Aesop</name> the story-writer.

when the <name type="ethnic">Delphians</name>, obeying an oracle, issued many proclamations summoning anyone who wanted it to accept compensation for the killing of <name type="pers">Aesop</name>, no one accepted it except the son of <name type="pers">Iadmon</name>'s son, another <name type="pers">Iadmon</name>; hence <name type="pers">Aesop</name>, too, was <name type="pers">Iadmon</name>'s.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Seeing that to this day anyone who likes can calculate what one tenth of her worth was, she cannot be credited with great wealth.

so she spent one tenth of her substance on the manufacture of a great number of iron beef spits, as many as the tenth would pay for, and sent them to <name key="perseus,Delphi" type="place" reg="Delphi [22.5167,38.4917] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName></name>; these lie in a heap to this day, behind the altar set up by the <name type="ethnic">Chians</name> and in front of the shrine itself.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This island was never discovered before the time of <name type="pers">Amyrtaeus</name>; all the kings before him sought it in vain for more than seven hundred years.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The priest, in this quandary, went into the temple shrine and there before the god's image bitterly lamented over what he expected to suffer.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now three hundred generations are ten thousand years, three generations being equal to a hundred. And over and above the three hundred, the remaining forty-one cover thirteen hundred and forty years.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Thus the whole period is eleven thousand three hundred and forty years; in all of which time (they said) they had had no king who was a god in human form, nor had there been any such either before or after those years among the rest of the kings of <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me wooden figures there which they counted to the total they had already given, for every high priest sets up a statue of himself there during his lifetime;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
pointing to these and counting, the priests showed me that each succeeded his father; they went through the whole line of figures, back to the earliest from that of the man who had most recently died.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Thus, when <name type="pers">Hecataeus</name> had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting; for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god; they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a &ldquo;Piromis&rdquo; the son of a &ldquo;Piromis&rdquo;; in <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>, one who is in all respects a good man.

<milestone unit="para"/>With regard to these two, Pan and <name type="pers">Dionysus</name>, one may follow whatever story one thinks most credible; but I give my own opinion concerning them here.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
but as it is, the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> story has it that no sooner was <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> born than <name type="pers">Zeus</name> sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to <name key="perseus,Nysa" type="place" reg=" +Nysa [28.1667,37.8667] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Nysa">Nysa</placeName></name> in <name key="tgn,7000489" type="place" reg="Ethiopia [39,8] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName></name> beyond <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>; and as for Pan, the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> do not know what became of him after his birth.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Though the pyramids beggar description and each one of them is a match for many great monuments built by <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, this maze surpasses even the pyramids.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>It has twelve roofed courts with doors facing each other: six face north and six south, in two continuous lines, all within one outer wall. There are also double sets of chambers, three thousand altogether, fifteen hundred above and the same number under ground.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>We ourselves viewed those that are above ground, and speak of what we have seen, but we learned through conversation about the underground chambers;
the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> caretakers would by no means show them, as they were, they said, the burial vaults of the kings who first built this labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Thus we can only speak from hearsay of the lower chambers; the upper we saw for ourselves, and they are creations greater than human. The exits of the chambers and the mazy passages hither and thither through the courts were an unending marvel to us as we passed from court to apartment and from apartment to colonnade, from colonnades again to more chambers and then into yet more courts.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Over all this is a roof, made of stone like the walls, and the walls are covered with cut figures, and every court is set around with pillars of white stone very precisely fitted together. Near the corner where the labyrinth ends stands a pyramid two hundred and forty feet high, on which great figures are cut. A passage to this has been made underground.

Its length is from north to south; the deepest part has a depth of fifty fathoms.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>That it has been dug out and made by men's hands the lake shows for itself; for almost in the middle of it stand two pyramids, so built that fifty fathoms of each are below and fifty above the water; atop each is a colossal stone figure seated on a throne.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Thus these pyramids are a hundred fathoms high; and a hundred fathoms equal a furlong of six hundred feet, the fathom measuring six feet or four cubits, the foot four spans and the cubit six spans.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The water of the lake is not natural (for the country here is exceedingly arid) but brought by a channel from the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></name>; six months it flows into the lake, and six back into the river.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>What then (one may ask) becomes of them? I shall explain this too.

<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>There are no men who respect pledges more than the <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
after this is done, the one who has given his pledge commends the stranger (or his countryman if the other be one) to his friends, and his friends hold themselves bound to honor the pledge.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>They believe in no other gods except <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> and the Heavenly <name type="pers">Aphrodite</name>; and they say that they wear their hair as <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> does his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This is the most credible of the stories told; but I must relate the less credible tale also, since they tell it.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When all the sons had been slaughtered, they poured wine and water into the bowl, and the mercenaries drank this and then gave battle. The fighting was fierce, and many of both armies fell; but at last the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> were routed.

<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>I saw a strange thing on the site of the battle, of which the people of the country had told me. The bones of those killed on either side in this fight lying scattered separately (for the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> bones lay in one place and the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> in another, where the armies had first separately stood), the skulls of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> are so brittle that if you throw no more than a pebble it will pierce them, but the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> skulls are so strong that a blow of a stone will hardly crack them.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And this, the people said (which for my own part I readily believed), is the explanation of it: the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> shave their heads from childhood, and the bone thickens by exposure to the sun.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This also is the reason why they do not grow bald; for nowhere can one see so few bald heads as in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Their skulls then are strong for this reason; while the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> skulls are weak because they cover their heads throughout their lives with the felt hats (called tiaras) which they wear. Such is the truth of the matter. I saw too the skulls of those <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> at <name type="place">Papremis</name> who were killed with <name type="pers">Darius</name>' son <name type="pers">Achaemenes</name> by <name type="pers">Inaros</name> the <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name>, and they were like the others.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He dressed the daughter of the king as a slave and sent her out with a pitcher to fetch water, together with other girls from the families of the leading men, dressed like the daughter of the king.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So when the girls went out before their fathers' eyes crying and lamenting, all the rest answered with cries and weeping, seeing their children abused; but <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name>, having seen with his own eyes and learned all, bowed himself to the ground.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>After the water-carriers had passed by, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> next made <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name>' son go out before him with two thousand <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> of the same age, all with ropes bound round their necks and bridle-bits in their mouths;
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
they were led out to be punished for those <name type="ethnic">Mytileneans</name> who had perished with their boat at <name key="tgn,7001186" type="place" reg="Mit Rahina [31.25,29.85] (inhabited place), Giza, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName></name>; for such was the judgment of the royal judges, that every man's death be paid for by the deaths of ten noble <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name> saw them passing and perceived that his son was being led out to die, and all the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> who sat with him wept and showed their affliction, he did as he had done at the sight of his daughter.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>After these too had gone out, it happened that there was one of his companions, a man past his prime, who had lost all his possessions, and had only what a poor man might have, and begged of the army; this man now went out before <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name> son of <name type="pers">Amasis</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> confined in the outer part of the city. When <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name> saw him, he broke into loud weeping, striking his head and calling on his companion by name.
<milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Now there were men set to watch <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name>, who told <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> all that he did as each went forth. Wondering at what the king did, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> made this inquiry of him by a messenger:
<milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;<name type="pers">Psammenitus</name>, <name type="pers">Lord Cambyses</name> wants to know why, seeing your daughter abused and your son going to his death, you did not cry out or weep, yet you showed such feeling for the beggar, who (as <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> learns from others) is not one of your kindred?&rdquo; So the messenger inquired. <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name> answered:
<milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, my private grief was too great for weeping; but the unhappiness of my companion deserves tears&mdash;a man fallen from abundance and prosperity to beggary come to the threshold of old age.&rdquo; When the messenger reported this, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> and his court, it is said, thought the answer good.
<milestone n="11" unit="section"/>And, the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> say, <name type="pers">Croesus</name> wept (for it happened that he too had come with <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>) and the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> that were there wept; <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> himself felt some pity, and he ordered that <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name>' son be spared from those that were to be executed, and that <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name> himself be brought in from the outer part of the city and brought before him.

<milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Those that went for him found that the son was no longer alive, but had been the first to be slaughtered; but they brought <name type="pers">Psammenitus</name> up and led him to <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>; and there he lived, and no violence was done him for the rest of his life.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And if he had known how to mind his own business, he would have regained <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> to govern; for the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> are inclined to honor kings' sons; even though kings revolt from them, they give back to their sons the sovereign power.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>There are many instances showing that it is their custom so to do, and notably the giving back of his father's sovereign power to <name type="pers">Thannyras</name> son of <name type="pers">Inaros</name>, and also to <name type="pers">Pausiris</name> son of <name type="pers">Amyrtaeus</name>; yet none ever did the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> more harm than <name type="pers">Inaros</name> and <name type="pers">Amyrtaeus</name>.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The revolt of the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> <name type="pers">Inaros</name> and <name type="pers">Amyrtaeus</name> against the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> governor lasted from 460 to <date value="-455">455</date> B.C.</note>

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When they were weary of doing this (for the body, being embalmed, remained whole and did not fall to pieces), <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> gave orders to burn it, a sacrilegious command; for the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> hold fire to be a god;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
therefore neither nation thinks it right to burn the dead, the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> for the reason given, as they say it is wrong to give the dead body of a man to a god; while the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> believe fire to be a living beast that devours all that it catches, and when sated with its meal dies together with that on which it feeds.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Now it is by no means their custom to give the dead to beasts; and this is why they embalm the corpse, that it may not lie and feed worms. Thus what <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> commanded was contrary to the custom of both peoples.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> say, however, that it was not <name type="pers">Amasis</name> to whom this was done, but another <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> of the same age as <name type="pers">Amasis</name>, whom the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> abused thinking that they were abusing <name type="pers">Amasis</name>.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>For their story is that <name type="pers">Amasis</name> learned from an oracle what was to be done to him after his death, and so to escape this fate buried this dead man, the one that was scourged, near the door inside his own vault, and ordered his son that he himself should be laid in the farthest corner of the vault.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>I think that these commands of <name type="pers">Amasis</name>, regarding the burial-place and the man, were never given at all, and that the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> believe in them in vain.

<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Fish-eaters</name> arrived from <name type="place">Elephantine</name> at <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>' summons, he sent them to <name key="tgn,7000489" type="place" reg="Ethiopia [39,8] (nation), Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName></name>, with orders what to say, and bearing as gifts a red cloak and a twisted gold necklace and bracelets and an alabaster box of incense and an earthenware jar of palm wine. These <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name>, to whom <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> sent them, are said to be the tallest and most handsome of all men.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Their way of choosing kings is different from that of all others, as (it is said) are all their laws; they consider that man worthy to be their king whom they judge to be tallest and to have strength proportional to his stature.

<milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Fish-eaters</name> arrived among these men, they gave the gifts to their king and said: &ldquo;<name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, the king of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, wishing to become your friend and ally, sent us with orders to address ourselves to you; and he offers you as gifts these things which he enjoys using himself.&rdquo;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But the <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name>, perceiving that they had come as spies, spoke thus to them: &ldquo;It is not because he values my friendship that the <name type="pers">Persian King</name> sends you with gifts, nor do you speak the truth (for you have come to spy on my realm), nor is that man just; for were he just, he would not have coveted a land other than his own, nor would he try to lead into slavery men by whom he has not been injured. Now, give him this bow, and this message:
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&lsquo;The King of the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name> advises the King of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to bring overwhelming odds to attack the long-lived <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name> when the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> can draw a bow of this length as easily as I do; but until then, to thank the gods who do not incite the sons of the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name> to add other land to their own.&rsquo;&rdquo;

<milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So speaking he unstrung the bow and gave it to the men who had come. Then, taking the red cloak, he asked what it was and how it was made; and when the <name type="ethnic">Fish-eaters</name> told him the truth about the color and the process of dyeing, he said that both the men and their garments were full of deceit.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Next he inquired about the twisted gold necklace and the bracelets; and when the <name type="ethnic">Fish-eaters</name> told him how they were made, the king smiled, and, thinking them to be fetters, said: &ldquo;We have stronger chains than these.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Thirdly he inquired about the incense; and when they described making and applying it, he made the same reply as about the cloak. But when he came to the wine and asked about its making, he was vastly pleased with the drink, and asked further what food their king ate, and what was the greatest age to which a <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> lived.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>They told him their king ate bread, showing him how wheat grew; and said that the full age to which a man might hope to live was eighty years. Then, said the <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name>, it was no wonder that they lived so few years, if they ate dung;<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">i.e. grain produced by the manured soil.</note> they would not even have been able to live that many unless they were refreshed by the drink&mdash;signifying to the <name type="ethnic">Fish-eaters</name> the wine&mdash;for in this, he said, the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> excelled the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name>.

<milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Fish-eaters</name> then in turn asking of the <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name> length of life and diet, he said that most of them attained to a hundred and twenty years, and some even to more; their food was boiled meat and their drink milk.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The spies showed wonder at the tale of years; whereupon he led them, it is said, to a spring, by washing in which they grew sleeker, as though it were of oil; and it smelled of violets.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So light, the spies said, was this water, that nothing would float on it, neither wood nor anything lighter than wood, but all sank to the bottom. If this water is truly such as they say, it is likely that their constant use of it makes the people long-lived.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>When they left the spring, the king led them to a prison where all the men were bound with fetters of gold. Among these <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name> there is nothing so scarce and so precious as bronze. Then, having seen the prison, they saw what is called the Table of the Sun.

<milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>Last after this they viewed the <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name> coffins; these are said to be made of alabaster, as I shall describe:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
they cause the dead body to shrink, either as the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> do or in some other way, then cover it with gypsum and paint it all as far as possible in the likeness of the living man;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
then they set it within a hollow pillar of alabaster, which they dig in abundance from the ground, and it is easily worked; the body can be seen in the pillar through the alabaster, no evil stench nor anything unpleasant proceeding from it, and showing clearly all its parts, as if it were the man himself.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The nearest of kin keep the pillar in their house for a year, giving it of the first-fruits and offering it sacrifices; after which they bring the pillars out and set them round about the city.

<milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Having seen everything, the spies departed again. When they reported all this, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> was angry, and marched at once against the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name>, neither giving directions for any provision of food nor considering that he was about to lead his army to the ends of the earth;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
being not in his right mind but mad, however, he marched at once on hearing from the <name type="ethnic">Fish-eaters</name>, ordering the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> who were with him to await him where they were, and taking with him all his land army.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When he came in his march to <name key="tgn,7001297" type="place" reg="Thebes [32.666,25.683] (deserted settlement), Qina, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001297">Thebes</placeName></name>

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But before his army had accomplished the fifth part of their journey they had come to an end of all there was in the way of provision, and after the food was gone, they ate the beasts of burden until there was none of these left either.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Now had <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, when he perceived this, changed his mind and led his army back again, he would have been a wise man at last after his first fault; but as it was, he went ever forward, taking account of nothing.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>While his soldiers could get anything from the earth, they kept themselves alive by eating grass; but when they came to the sandy desert, some did a terrible thing, taking by lot one man out of ten and eating him.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>Hearing this, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> feared their becoming cannibals, and so gave up his expedition against the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name> and marched back to <name key="tgn,7001297" type="place" reg="Thebes [32.666,25.683] (deserted settlement), Qina, Upper Egypt, Egypt, Africa"><placeName key="tgn,7001297">Thebes</placeName></name>

 across sandy desert; this place is called, in the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> language, <name type="place">Islands of the Blest</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Thus far, it is said, the army came; after that, except for the <name type="ethnic">Ammonians</name> themselves and those who heard from them, no man can say anything of them; for they neither reached the <name type="ethnic">Ammonians</name> nor returned back.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But this is what the <name type="ethnic">Ammonians</name> themselves say: when the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> were crossing the sand from Oasis to attack them, and were about midway between their country and Oasis, while they were breakfasting a great and violent south wind arose, which buried them in the masses of sand which it bore; and so they disappeared from sight.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The rulers told him that a god, wont to appear after long intervals of time, had now appeared to them; and that all <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> rejoiced and made holiday whenever he so appeared.

<milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Having put them to death, he next summoned the priests before him. When they gave him the same account, he said that if a tame god had come to the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> he would know it; and with no more words he bade the priests bring <name type="pers">Apis</name>. So they went to fetch and bring him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This <name type="pers">Apis</name>, or <name type="pers">Epaphus</name>, is a calf born of a cow that can never conceive again. By what the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> say, the cow is made pregnant by a light from heaven, and thereafter gives birth to <name type="pers">Apis</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The marks of this calf called <name type="pers">Apis</name> are these: he is black, and has on his forehead a three-cornered white spot, and the likeness of an eagle on his back; the hairs of the tail are double, and there is a knot under the tongue.

<milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the priests led <name type="pers">Apis</name> in, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>&mdash;for he was all but mad&mdash;drew his dagger and, meaning to stab the calf in the belly, stuck the thigh; then laughing he said to the priests:

&ldquo;Simpletons, are these your gods, creatures of flesh and blood that can feel weapons of iron? That is a god worthy of the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name>. But for you, you shall suffer for making me your laughing-stock.&rdquo; So saying he bade those, whose business it was, to scourge the priests well, and to kill any other <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> whom they found holiday-making.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> festival ended, and the priests were punished, and <name type="pers">Apis</name> lay in the temple and died of the wound in the thigh.

<milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, the <name type="ethnic">Egyptians</name> say, owing to this wrongful act immediately went mad, although even before he had not been sensible.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Smerdis</name> having gone to <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> saw in a dream a vision, in which it seemed to him that a messenger came from <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> and told him that <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> sitting on the royal throne touched heaven with his head.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Fearing therefore for himself, lest his brother might slay him and so be king, he sent <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, the most trusted of his <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, to <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> to kill him. <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name> went up to <name key="tgn,7017509" type="place" reg="Shush [48.333,32.2] (inhabited place), Khuzestan, Iran, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName></name> and killed <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>; some say that he took <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> out hunting, others that he brought him to the Red<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Not our <name key="tgn,7016791" type="place" reg=" +Red Sea [42,15] (sea) "><placeName key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName></name> (<foreign lang="greek">*)ara/bios ko/lpos</foreign>) but the <name key="tgn,7016761" type="place" reg="Persian Gulf [53.83,25.583] (gulf), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7016761">Persian Gulf</placeName></name>, probably; but it is to be noted that <name type="pers">Herodotus</name> has no definite knowledge of a gulf between <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> and <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name>.</note> Sea and there drowned him.

<milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This, they say, was the first of <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>' evil acts; next, he destroyed his full sister, who had come with him to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>, and whom he had taken to wife.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He married her in this way (for before this, it had by no means been customary for <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to marry their sisters): <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> was infatuated with one of his sisters and when he wanted to marry her, because his intention was contrary to usage, he summoned the royal judges<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">A standing body of seven; cp. <bibl n="Esther 1.14">Book of Esther, i. 14</bibl>.</note> and inquired whether there were any law enjoining one, that so desired, to marry his sister.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>These royal judges are men chosen out from the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to function until they die or are detected in some injustice; it is they who decide suits in <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> and interpret the laws of the land; all matters are referred to them.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>These then replied to <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> with an answer which was both just and prudent, namely, that they could find no law enjoining a brother to marry his sister; but that they had found a law permitting the King of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> to do whatever he liked.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Thus, although they feared <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> they did not break the law, and, to save themselves from death for keeping it, they found another law abetting one who wished to marry sisters.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>So <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> married the object of his desire; yet not long afterwards he took another sister as well.

<milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>There are two tales of her death, as there are of the death of <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>. The <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> say that <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> had set a lion cub to fight a puppy, and that this woman was watching too; and that as the puppy was losing, its brother broke its leash and came to help, and the two dogs together got the better of the cub.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, they say, was pleased with the sight, but the woman wept as she sat by. <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> perceiving it asked why she wept, and she said that when she saw the puppy help its brother she had wept, recalling <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> and knowing that there would be no avenger for him.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>For saying this, according to the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> story, she was killed by <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>. But the <name type="ethnic">Egyptian</name> tale is that as the two sat at table the woman took a lettuce and plucked off the leaves, then asked her husband whether he preferred the look of it with or without leaves. &ldquo;With the leaves,&rdquo; he said; whereupon she answered:
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Yet you have stripped <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' house as bare as this lettuce.&rdquo; Angered at this, they say, he sprang upon her, who was great with child, and she miscarried and died of the hurt he gave her.

<milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Such were <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>' mad acts to his own household, whether they were done because of <name type="pers">Apis</name> or grew from some of the many troubles that are wont to beset men; for indeed he is said to have been afflicted from his birth with that grievous disease which some call &ldquo;sacred.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Epilepsy.</note> It is not unlikely then that when his body was grievously afflicted his mind too should be diseased.

&ldquo;What manner of man, <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, do the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> think me to be, and how do they speak of me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, &ldquo;for all else they greatly praise you, but they say that you love wine too well.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So he reported of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>. The king angrily replied: &ldquo;If the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> now say that it is my fondness for wine that drives me to frenzy and madness, then it would seem that their former saying also was a lie.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For it is said that before this, while some <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and <name type="pers">Croesus</name> were sitting with him, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> asked what manner of man they thought him to be in comparison with <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> his father; and they answered, &ldquo;<name type="pers">Cambyses</name> was the better man; for he had all of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' possessions and had won <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> and the sea besides.&rdquo;
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So said the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>; but <name type="pers">Croesus</name>, who was present, and was dissatisfied with their judgment, spoke thus to <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>: &ldquo;To me, son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, you do not seem to be the equal of your father; for you have as yet no son such as he left after him in you.&rdquo; This pleased <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, and he praised <name type="pers">Croesus</name>' judgment.

<milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Remembering this, then, he said to <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name> in his anger: &ldquo;Judge then if the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> speak the truth, or rather are themselves out of their minds when they speak of me so.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Yonder stands your son in the porch; now if I shoot and pierce his heart, that will prove the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to be wrong; if I miss, then say that they are right and that I am out of my senses.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So saying, he strung his bow and hit the boy, and gave orders to open the fallen body and examine the wound: and the arrow being found in the heart, <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> laughed in great glee and said to the boy's father:
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;It is plain, <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, that I am in my right mind and the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> mad; now tell me: what man in the world did you ever see that shot so true to the mark?&rdquo; <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, it is said, replied (for he saw that <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> was mad, and he feared for his own life), &ldquo;Master, I think that not even the god himself could shoot so true.&rdquo;

The boy told him that <name type="pers">Procles</name> had treated them kindly, but did not mention what he had said at parting; for he had paid no attention. <name type="pers">Periander</name> said that by no means could <name type="pers">Procles</name> not have dropped some hint, and interrogated him persistently;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
until the boy remembered, and told him. And <name type="pers">Periander</name>, comprehending, and wishing to show no weakness, sent a message to those with whom his banished son was living and forbade them to keep him.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So when the boy, driven out, would go to another house, he would be driven from this also, since <name type="pers">Periander</name> threatened all who received him and ordered them to shut him out; so when driven forth, he would go to some other house of his friends, and they, although he was the son of <name type="pers">Periander</name>, and although they were afraid, nonetheless took him in.

<milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>In the end <name type="pers">Periander</name> made a proclamation, that whoever sheltered the boy in his house or spoke to him, would owe a fine to <name type="pers">Apollo</name>, and he set the amount.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In view of this proclamation no one wished to address or receive the boy into his house; and besides, the boy himself did not think it right to attempt what was forbidden, but accepting it slept in the open.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>On the fourth day, when <name type="pers">Periander</name> saw him starved and unwashed, he took pity on him, and his anger being softened, he came near and said: &ldquo;My son, which is preferable&mdash;to follow your present way of life, or by being well-disposed toward your father to inherit my power and the goods which I now possess?
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Though my son and a prince of prosperous <name key="perseus,Corinth" type="place" reg="Corinth [22.9083,37.9083] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName></name>, you prefer the life of a vagrant, by opposing and being angry with me with whom you least ought to be. For if something has happened as a result of which you have a suspicion about me, it has happened to my disadvantage and I bear the brunt of it, inasmuch as I am the cause.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But bearing in mind how much better it is to be envied than to be pitied, and at the same time what sort of thing it is to be angry with your parents and with those that are stronger than you, come back to the house.&rdquo;
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>With these words <name type="pers">Periander</name> tried to move his son, but he said nothing else to his father, only told him that because he had conversed with him he owed the fine to <name type="pers">Apollo</name>. When <name type="pers">Periander</name> saw that his son's stubbornness could not be got around or overcome, he sent him away out of his sight in a ship to <name key="tgn,7010883" type="place" reg=" +Corfu [19.916,39.633] (inhabited place), Corfu, Kerkira, Ionian Islands, Greece, Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7010883">Corcyra</placeName></name>; for <name key="tgn,7010883" type="place" reg=" +Corfu [19.916,39.633] (inhabited place), Corfu, Kerkira, Ionian Islands, Greece, Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7010883">Corcyra</placeName></name> too was subject to him.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>And when he had sent him away, he sent an army against <name type="pers">Procles</name> his father-in-law, since he was most to blame for his present troubles; and he took <name key="perseus,Epidauros" type="place" reg="Epidauros [23.0917,37.6] (Perseus)"><placeName key="perseus,Epidauros">Epidaurus</placeName></name>, captured <name type="pers">Procles</name>, and imprisoned him.

<milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>As time went on, <name type="pers">Periander</name>, now grown past his prime and aware that he could no longer oversee and direct all his affairs, sent to <name key="tgn,7010883" type="place" reg=" +Corfu [19.916,39.633] (inhabited place), Corfu, Kerkira, Ionian Islands, Greece, Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7010883">Corcyra</placeName></name> inviting <name type="pers">Lycophron</name> to be sovereign; for he saw no hope in his eldest son, who seemed to him to be slow-witted.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Lycophron</name> did not dignify the invitation with a reply. Then <name type="pers">Periander</name>, pressing the young man, sent to him (as the next best way) his daughter, the boy's sister, thinking that he would listen to her.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>She came and said, &ldquo;Child, would you want the power to fall to others, and our father's house destroyed, rather than to return and have it yourself? Come home and stop punishing yourself.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Pride is an unhappy possession. Do not cure evil by evil.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So she spoke communicating their father's inducements.

<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>When she brought this answer back, <name type="pers">Periander</name> sent a third messenger, through whom he proposed that he should go to <name key="tgn,7010883" type="place" reg=" +Corfu [19.916,39.633] (inhabited place), Corfu, Kerkira, Ionian Islands, Greece, Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7010883">Corcyra</placeName></name>, and that the boy should return to <name key="perseus,Corinth" type="place" reg="Corinth [22.9083,37.9083] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName></name> and be the heir of his power.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The mercenaries and many of the <name type="ethnic">Samians</name> themselves sallied out near the upper tower on the ridge of the hill and withstood the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonian</name> advance for a little while; then they fled back, with the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> pursuing and destroying them.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
for they were in need of money; and the <name type="ethnic">Siphnians</name> were at this time very prosperous and the richest of the islanders, because of the gold and silver mines on the island.

At this time the market-place and town-hall of <name type="place">Siphnus</name> were adorned with <name type="ethnic">Parian</name> marble.

<milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>They could not understand this oracle either when it was spoken or at the time of the <name type="ethnic">Samians</name>' coming.

now in ancient times all ships were painted with vermilion;<note anchored="yes" resp="ed"><foreign lang="greek">miltopa/rh|oi</foreign> is one of the Homeric epithets of ships.</note> and this was what was meant by the warning given by the priestess to the <name type="ethnic">Siphnians</name>, to beware a wooden force and a red herald.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The messengers, then, demanded from the <name type="ethnic">Siphnians</name> a loan of ten talents; when the <name type="ethnic">Siphnians</name> refused them, the <name type="ethnic">Samians</name> set about ravaging their lands.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Hearing this the <name type="ethnic">Siphnians</name> came out at once to drive them off, but they were defeated in battle, and many of them were cut off from their town by the <name type="ethnic">Samians</name>; who presently exacted from them a hundred talents.

<name type="pers">Patizeithes</name> the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> persuaded this man that he would manage everything for him; he brought his brother and set him on the royal throne; then he sent heralds to all parts, one of whom was to go to <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> and proclaim to the army that henceforth they must obey not <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> but <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>, the son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>.

&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, &ldquo;this is not true, sire, that your brother <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> has rebelled against you; he cannot have any quarrel with you, small or great; I myself did as you instructed, and I buried him with my own hands.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So when he now inquired and learned the name of the town, the shock of his wound, and of the misfortune that came to him from the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>, brought him to his senses; he understood the prophecy and said: &ldquo;Here <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> is to die.&rdquo;

<milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>At this time he said no more. But about twenty days later, he sent for the most prominent of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> that were about him, and thus addressed them: &ldquo;<name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, I have to make known to you something which I kept most strictly concealed.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When I was in <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name> I had a dream, which I wish I had not had; it seemed to me that a messenger came from home to tell me that <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> sitting on the royal throne touched heaven with his head.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Then I feared that my brother would take away my sovereignty from me, and I acted with more haste than wisdom; for it is not in the power of human nature to run away from what is to be; but I, blind as I was, sent <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name> to <name key="tgn,7017509" type="place" reg="Shush [48.333,32.2] (inhabited place), Khuzestan, Iran, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName></name> to kill <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>. When that great wrong was done I lived without fear, for I never thought that when <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> was removed another man might rise against me.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But I mistook altogether what was to be; I have killed my brother when there was no need, and I have lost my kingdom none the less; for it was the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> that the divinity forewarned in the dream would revolt.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Now he has been done for by me, and I would have you believe that <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son no longer lives; the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> rule the kingdom, the one that I left caretaker of my house, and his brother <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>. So then, the man is dead of an unholy destiny at the hands of his relations who ought to have been my avenger for the disgrace I have suffered from the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name>;
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
and as he is no longer alive, necessity constrains me to charge you, men of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, in his place, with the last desire of my life. In the name of the gods of my royal house I charge all of you, but chiefly those <name type="pers">Achaemenids</name> that are here, not to let the sovereignty fall again into Median hands; if they have it after getting it by trickery, take it back through trickery of your own; if they have got it away by force, then by force all the stronger get it back.
<milestone n="7" unit="section"/>And if you do this, may your land bring forth fruit, and your women and your flocks and herds be blessed with offspring, remaining free for all time; but if you do not get the kingdom back or attempt to get it back, then I pray things turn out the opposite for you, and on top of this, that every <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> meet an end such as mine.&rdquo; With that <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> wept bitterly for all that had happened to him.

<milestone n="66" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> saw their king weep, they all tore the clothing which they wore and wailed loud and long.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But when after this the bone rotted and the thigh rapidly putrefied, it carried off <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, who had reigned in all seven years and five months, but was altogether childless, without male or female issue.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>To the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> who were present it was quite incredible that the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> were masters of the kingdom; they believed that <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>' intent was to deceive them with his story of <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>' death, so that all <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> might be embroiled in a war against him.

<milestone n="67" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So they believed that it was <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> who had been made king. For <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name> stoutly denied that he had killed <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>, since now that <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> was dead, it was not safe for him to say that he had slain the son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> with his own hands.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Cambyses</name> being dead, the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>, pretending to be the <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> of like name, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son, reigned without fear for the seven months by which <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> had fallen short of reigning eight years.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>In this time he benefitted all his subjects to such an extent that after his death all the <name type="ethnic">Asiatics</name> except the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> wished him back; for he sent to every nation he ruled and proclaimed an exemption for three years from military service and from tribute.

<milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Such was his proclamation at the beginning of his reign; but in the eighth month he was exposed in the following manner. There was one <name type="pers">Otanes</name>, son of <name type="pers">Pharnaspes</name>, as well-born and rich a man as any <name type="ethnic">Persian</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This <name type="pers">Otanes</name> was the first to guess that the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> was not <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> and who, in fact, he was; the reason was, that he never left the acropolis nor summoned any notable <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> into his presence. And having formed this suspicion <name type="pers">Otanes</name> did as follows:
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Cambyses</name> had taken his daughter, whose name was <name type="pers">Phaedyme</name>; this same girl the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> had now and he lived with her and with all <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>' other wives. <name type="pers">Otanes</name> sent to this daughter, asking at what man's side she lay, with <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>, <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son, or with some other?
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>She sent back a message that she did not know; for (she said) she had never seen <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>, nor did she know who her bedfellow was. Then <name type="pers">Otanes</name> sent a second message, to this effect: &ldquo;If you do not know <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> yourself, then find out from <name type="pers">Atossa</name> who it is that she and you are living with; for surely she knows her own brother.&rdquo;
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>To this his daughter replied: &ldquo;I cannot communicate with <name type="pers">Atossa</name>, nor can I see any other of the women of the household; for no sooner had this man, whoever he is, made himself king, than he sent us to live apart, each in her own appointed place.&rdquo;

<milestone n="69" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Otanes</name> heard that, he saw more clearly how the matter stood; and he sent her this third message:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Daughter, your noble birth obliges you to run any risk that your father commands you to face. If this man is not <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> but who I think he is, then he must not get away with sleeping with you and sitting on the throne of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>, but be punished.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now, then, when he lies with you and you see that he is sleeping, feel his ears; if he has ears, rest assured that you are living with <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>; but if he has none, it is <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Phaedyme</name> answered by messenger that she would run a very great risk by so doing; for if it should turn out that he had no ears, and she were caught feeling for them, he would surely kill her; nevertheless she would do it.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So she promised to do this for her father. <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> son of <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> during his reign cut off the ears of this <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> for some grave reason.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>So <name type="pers">Phaedyme</name>, daughter of <name type="pers">Otanes</name>, performed her promise to her father. When it was her turn to go to the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> (for their wives go in sequence to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>), she came to his bed and felt for the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>' ears while he slumbered deeply; and having with no great difficulty assured herself that he had no ears, she sent and told this to her father as soon as it was morning.

<milestone n="70" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Otanes</name> then took aside two <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> of the highest rank whom he thought worthiest of trust, <name type="pers">Aspathines</name> and <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>, and told them the whole story.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They resolved that each should take into his confidence that <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> whom he most trusted; <name type="pers">Otanes</name> brought in <name type="pers">Intaphrenes</name>, <name type="pers">Gobryas</name> brought <name type="pers">Megabyzus</name>, and <name type="pers">Aspathines</name> <name type="pers">Hydarnes</name>.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The names in the <name key="tgn,6000824" type="place" reg=" +Bisitun [47.483,34.366] (inhabited place), Bakhtaran, Iran, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,6000824">Behistun</placeName></name> inscription (the trilingual inscription set up by <name type="pers">Darius</name> at <name key="tgn,6000824" type="place" reg=" +Bisitun [47.483,34.366] (inhabited place), Bakhtaran, Iran, Asia "><placeName key="tgn,6000824">Behistun</placeName></name>, after he had crushed the revolts in his empire) are: <name type="pers">Vindapana</name>, <name type="pers">Utana</name>, <name type="pers">Gaubaruwa</name>, <name type="pers">Vidarna</name>, <name type="pers">Bagabukhsa</name>, <name type="pers">Ardumanis</name>; all but the last corresponding with <name type="pers">Herodotus</name>' list.</note>
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When they were six, <name type="pers">Darius</name>, whose father, <name type="pers">Hystaspes</name>, was a subordinate governor of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, arrived at <name key="tgn,7017509" type="place" reg="Shush [48.333,32.2] (inhabited place), Khuzestan, Iran, Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName></name>. When he came, then, the six <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> resolved to include <name type="pers">Darius</name> too.

<milestone n="71" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The seven then met and gave each other tokens of good faith and spoke together; and when it was <name type="pers">Darius</name>' turn to declare his mind, he spoke as follows:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;I thought that I alone knew that it was the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> who was king and that <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> was dead; and it was for this reason that I made haste to come, that I might effect the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>' death; but since it turns out that you know too and not only I, I think that we should act at once and not put it off.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Otanes</name> replied, &ldquo;son of <name type="pers">Hystaspes</name>, you have a good father and seem likely yourself to be in no way inferior to your father; do not hurry this undertaking without thinking, but take it up more prudently; there must be more of us to try it.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>To this <name type="pers">Darius</name> answered: &ldquo;You gentlemen who are here, if you do as <name type="pers">Otanes</name> says, know that you will die horribly; for someone will inform the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>, looking to enrich himself alone.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>You ought to have done it by yourselves; but since you decided to confide in others and have included me, let us either act today or else understand that if the present day passes, nobody else will betray you before I do, for I shall myself betray you to the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>.&rdquo;

<milestone n="72" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>To this <name type="pers">Otanes</name> replied, seeing <name type="pers">Darius</name>' vehemence, &ldquo;Since you force us to hurry and will tolerate no delay, tell us now yourself how we shall pass into the palace and attack them. For you know yourself, I suppose, if not because you have seen them then you have heard, that guards are stationed all around; how shall we go past the guards?&rdquo;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;<name type="pers">Otanes</name>,&rdquo; answered <name type="pers">Darius</name>, &ldquo;there are many things that cannot be described in words, but in deed; and there are other things that can be described in words, but nothing illustrious comes of them. You know well that the guards who are set are easy to go by.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>There is no one who will not allow us to pass, from respect or from fear, because of who we are; and further, I have myself the best pretext for entering, for I shall say that I have just arrived from <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> and have a message for the king from my father.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>When it is necessary to lie, lie. For we want the same thing, liars and those who tell the truth; some lie to win credence and advantage by lies, while others tell the truth in order to obtain some advantage by the truth and to be more trusted; thus we approach the same ends by different means.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>If the hope of advantage were taken away, the truth-teller would be as ready to lie as the liar to tell the truth. Now if any of the watchmen willingly let us pass, it will be better for him later. But if any tries to withstand us, let us note him as an enemy, and so thrust ourselves in and begin our work.&rdquo;

<milestone n="73" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Then <name type="pers">Gobryas</name> said, &ldquo;Friends, when shall we have a better chance to win back the kingship, or, if we cannot, to die, since we who are <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> are ruled by a <name type="ethnic">Mede</name>, a <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>, and he a man that has no ears?
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Those of you that were with <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> at his death-bed of course remember the curse which he pronounced as he died on the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> if they should not try to get back the kingship, although we did not believe <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> then, but thought that he spoke to deceive us.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now therefore my vote is that we follow <name type="pers">Darius</name>' plan, and not quit this council to do anything else but attack the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> at once.&rdquo; So spoke <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>; and they all consented to what he said.

<milestone n="74" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>While they were making these plans, by coincidence the following happened. The <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> had resolved after consideration to make a friend of <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, because he had been wronged by <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> (who had killed his son with an arrow) and because he alone knew of the death of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son <name type="pers">Smerdis</name>, having himself been the slayer; but besides this, because he was in great repute among the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For these reasons they summoned him and tried to make him a friend, having bound him by tokens of good faith and oaths to keep to himself and betray to no one their deception of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and promising to give him all things in great abundance.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name> agreed to do this, since the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> importuned him, the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> made this second proposal to him, that they should call an assembly of all the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> before the palace wall, and he should go up on to a tower and declare that it was <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> and no other who was king of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>They gave him this charge, because they thought him to be the man most trusted by the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and because he had often asserted that <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' son <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> was alive, and had denied the murder.

<milestone n="75" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name> said that he was ready to do this too, the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> summoned the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> together, and brought him up on to a tower and bade him speak. Then, deliberately forgetting all the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name>'s instructions, he traced the lineage of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> from <name type="pers">Achaemenes</name> downwards; when he came at last to the name of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, he recounted all the good which that king had done to <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
and after he had narrated this, he revealed the truth, saying that he had concealed it before, as it had not been safe for him to tell what had happened, but at the present time necessity forced him to reveal it: and he said that he himself, forced by <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>, had killed <name type="pers">Smerdis</name> son of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>, and that the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> were in power.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Then, invoking a terrible curse on the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> if they did not win back the throne and take vengeance on the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name>, he threw himself headlong down from the tower; so <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>, a man who was always well thought of, perished in this way.

<milestone n="76" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The seven <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, when they had decided to attack the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> at once and not delay, prayed to the gods and set forth, knowing nothing of what had happened to <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But when they had gone half way they learned what had happened to <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>. Then they argued there, standing beside the road, <name type="pers">Otanes</name>' party demanding that they delay and not attack while events were in flux, and <name type="pers">Darius</name>' party that they go directly and do what they had decided and not put it off.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>While they were arguing, they saw seven pairs of hawks chase and slash and tear to bits two pairs of vultures. And seeing this all seven consented to <name type="pers">Darius</name>' opinion, and went on to the palace, encouraged by the birds.

<milestone n="77" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When they came to the gate, it turned out as <name type="pers">Darius</name> had expected; the guards, out of respect for the leading men in <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> and never suspecting that there would be trouble from them, allowed them to pass, who enjoyed divine guidance, and no one asked any questions.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And when they came to the court, they met the eunuchs that carry messages, who asked the seven why they had come; and while they were questioning these, they were threatening the watchmen for letting them pass, and restraining the seven who wanted to go on.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>These gave each other the word, drew their knives, and stabbing the eunuchs who barred their way, went forward at a run to the men's apartment.

<milestone n="78" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Both the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> were within, deliberating about the consequences of <name type="pers">Prexaspes</name>' act. Seeing the eunuchs in confusion and hearing their cries they both sprang up: and when they realized what was happening they turned to defending themselves.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>One rushed to take down a bow, the other went for a spear. Then the fighting started. The one that had caught up the bow found it was no use to him, as the antagonists were close and jostling one another; but the other defended himself with his spear, wounding <name type="pers">Aspathines</name> in the thigh and <name type="pers">Intaphrenes</name> in the eye; <name type="pers">Intaphrenes</name> lost his eye from the wound but was not killed.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So one of the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> wounded these; the other, as the bow was no use to him, fled into a chamber adjoining the men's apartment and would have shut its door.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Two of the seven flung into the room with him, <name type="pers">Darius</name> and <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>; as <name type="pers">Gobryas</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> wrestled together, <name type="pers">Darius</name> stood helpless in the darkness, afraid of stabbing <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Gobryas</name>, seeing <name type="pers">Darius</name> stand helpless, asked why he did not lend a hand; and he said, &ldquo;Because I am afraid for you, that I might stab you.&rdquo; And <name type="pers">Gobryas</name> answered, &ldquo;Stick your sword even if it goes through us both.&rdquo; So <name type="pers">Darius</name> complying stabbed with his knife and somehow stuck the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>.

<milestone n="79" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When they had killed the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> and cut off their heads, they left their wounded there because of their infirmity and for the sake of guarding the acropolis, while five of them carrying the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name>'s heads ran outside with much shouting and commotion, calling all <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to aid, telling what they had done and showing the heads; at the same time they killed every <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> that came in their way.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This day is the greatest holy day that all <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> alike keep; they celebrate a great festival on it, which they call the Massacre of the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name>; while the festival lasts no <name type="ethnic">Magus</name> may go outdoors, but during this day the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> remain in their houses.

<name type="pers">Otanes</name> was for turning the government over to the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> people: &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there can no longer be a single sovereign over us, for that is not pleasant or good.

Give this power to the best man on earth, and it would stir him to unaccustomed thoughts. Insolence is created in him by the good things to hand, while from birth envy is rooted in man.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Acquiring the two he possesses complete evil; for being satiated he does many reckless things, some from insolence, some from envy. And yet an absolute ruler ought to be free of envy, having all good things; but he becomes the opposite of this towards his citizens; he envies the best who thrive and live, and is pleased by the worst of his fellows; and he is the best confidant of slander.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Of all men he is the most inconsistent; for if you admire him modestly he is angry that you do not give him excessive attention, but if one gives him excessive attention he is angry because one is a flatter. But I have yet worse to say of him than that; he upsets the ancestral ways and rapes women and kills indiscriminately.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But the rule of the multitude has in the first place the loveliest name of all, equality, and does in the second place none of the things that a monarch does. It determines offices by lot, and holds power accountable, and conducts all deliberating publicly. Therefore I give my opinion that we make an end of monarchy and exalt the multitude, for all things are possible for the majority.&rdquo;

<milestone unit="para"/>Such was the judgment of <name type="pers">Otanes</name>: but <name type="pers">Megabyzus</name> urged that they resort to an oligarchy. &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with all that <name type="pers">Otanes</name> says against the rule of one; but when he tells you to give the power to the multitude, his judgment strays from the best. Nothing is more foolish and violent than a useless mob;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
for men fleeing the insolence of a tyrant to fall victim to the insolence of the unguided populace is by no means to be tolerated. Whatever the one does, he does with knowledge, but for the other knowledge is impossible; how can they have knowledge who have not learned or seen for themselves what is best, but always rush headlong and drive blindly onward, like a river in flood?

<milestone n="82" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Such was the judgment of <name type="pers">Megabyzus</name>. <name type="pers">Darius</name> was the third to express his opinion. &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that <name type="pers">Megabyzus</name> speaks well concerning democracy but not concerning oligarchy. For if the three are proposed and all are at their best for the sake of argument, the best democracy and oligarchy and monarchy, I hold that monarchy is by far the most excellent.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>One could describe nothing better than the rule of the one best man; using the best judgment, he will govern the multitude with perfect wisdom, and best conceal plans made for the defeat of enemies.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But in an oligarchy, the desire of many to do the state good service often produces bitter hate among them; for because each one wishes to be first and to make his opinions prevail, violent hate is the outcome, from which comes faction and from faction killing, and from killing it reverts to monarchy, and by this is shown how much better monarchy is.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Then again, when the people rule it is impossible that wickedness will not occur; and when wickedness towards the state occurs, hatred does not result among the wicked, but strong alliances; for those that want to do the state harm conspire to do it together. This goes on until one of the people rises to stop such men. He therefore becomes the people's idol, and being their idol is made their monarch; and thus he also proves that monarchy is best.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>But (to conclude the whole matter in one word) tell me, where did freedom come from for us and who gave it, from the people or an oligarchy or a single ruler? I believe, therefore, that we who were liberated through one man should maintain such a government, and, besides this, that we should not alter our ancestral ways that are good; that would not be better.&rdquo;

<milestone n="83" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Having to choose between these three options, four of the seven men preferred the last. Then <name type="pers">Otanes</name>, whose proposal to give the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> equality was defeated, spoke thus among them all:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Fellow partisans, it is plain that one of us must be made king (whether by lot, or entrusted with the office by the choice of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, or in some other way), but I shall not compete with you; I desire neither to rule nor to be ruled; but if I waive my claim to be king, I make this condition, that neither I nor any of my descendants shall be subject to any one of you.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>To these terms the six others agreed; <name type="pers">Otanes</name> took no part in the contest but stood aside; and to this day his house (and no other in <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name>) remains free, and is ruled only so far as it is willing to be, so long as it does not transgress <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> law.

<milestone n="84" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The rest of the seven then considered what was the fairest way of making a king; and they decided that if another of the seven than <name type="pers">Otanes</name> should gain the royal power, that <name type="pers">Otanes</name> and his descendants should receive a yearly gift of Median clothing and everything else that the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> hold most valuable. The reason for this decision was that it was he who had first planned the matter and assembled the conspirators.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For <name type="pers">Otanes</name>, then, they choose this particular honor; but with regard to all of them they decreed that any one of the seven should, if he wished, enter the king's palace unannounced, except when the king was sleeping with a woman; and that the king should be forbidden to take a wife except from the households of the conspirators.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>As for the making of a king, they decided that he should be elected whose horse, after they were all in their saddles in the suburb of the city, should first be heard to neigh at sunrise.

<milestone n="85" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now <name type="pers">Darius</name> had a clever groom, whose name was <name type="pers">Oebares</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; <name type="pers">Oebares</name> answered, &ldquo;if this is to determine whether you become king or not, be confident for this reason and have an easy mind, for no one else shall be king before you, such are the tricks I have.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said <name type="pers">Darius</name>, &ldquo;if you have any trick such as you say, use it and don't put it off, for tomorrow is the day of decision.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Oebares</name> heard that, he did as follows.

<milestone n="86" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>At dawn of day the six came on horseback as they had agreed. As they rode out through the suburb and came to the place where the mare had been tethered in the past night, <name type="pers">Darius</name>' horse trotted forward and whinnied;

and as he so did there came lightning and thunder out of a clear sky. These signs given to <name type="pers">Darius</name> were thought to be foreordained and made his election perfect; his companions leapt from their horses and bowed to him.

<milestone unit="para"/>All this abundance of gold, from which the <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> send the aforementioned gold-dust to the king, they obtain in the following way.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>To the east of the <name type="ethnic">Indian</name> country is sand.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>There are many <name type="ethnic">Indian</name> nations, none speaking the same language; some of them are nomads, some not; some dwell in the river marshes and live on raw fish, which they catch from reed boats.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>These <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> wear clothes of bullrushes; they mow and cut these from the river, then weave them crosswise like a mat, and wear them like a breastplate.

<milestone n="99" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Other <name type="ethnic">Indians</name>, to the east of these, are nomads and eat raw flesh; they are called <name type="ethnic">Padaei</name>. It is said to be their custom that when anyone of their fellows, whether man or woman, is sick, a man's closest friends kill him, saying that if wasted by disease he will be lost to them as meat; though he denies that he is sick, they will not believe him, but kill and eat him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When a woman is sick, she is put to death like the men by the women who are her close acquaintances. As for one that has come to old age, they sacrifice him and feast on his flesh; but not many reach this reckoning, for before that everyone who falls ill they kill.

<milestone n="100" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>There are other <name type="ethnic">Indians</name>, again, who kill no living creature, nor plant anything, nor are accustomed to have houses; they eat grass, and they have a grain growing naturally from the earth in its husk, about the size of a millet-seed, which they gather with the husk and boil and eat. When any one of them falls sick, he goes into the desert and lies there, and no one notices whether he is sick or dies.

<milestone n="101" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>These <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> whom I have described have intercourse openly like cattle; they are all black-skinned, like the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Their semen too, which they ejaculate into the women, is not white like other men's, but black like their skin, and resembles in this respect that of the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name>.

<milestone n="102" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Other <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> dwell near the town of <name type="place">Caspatyrus</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Pactyic</name> country,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">N.E. <name type="place"><placeName key="tgn,7016612">Afghanistan</placeName></name>. <name type="place">Caspatyrus</name> (or <name type="place">Caspapyrus</name>) is said to be probably <name type="place">Cabul</name>.</note> north of the rest of <name key="tgn,7000198" type="place" reg=" +India [77,20] (nation), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName></name>; these live like the <name type="ethnic">Bactrians</name>; they are of all <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> the most warlike, and it is they who are sent for the gold; for in these parts all is desolate because of the sand.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In this sandy desert are ants,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">It is suggested that the &ldquo;ants&rdquo; may have been really marmots. But even this does not seem to make the story much more probable.</note> not as big as dogs but bigger than foxes; the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> king has some of these, which have been caught there.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>It is for this sand that the <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> set forth into the desert. They harness three camels apiece, males on either side sharing the drawing, and a female in the middle: the man himself rides on the female, that when harnessed has been taken away from as young an offspring as may be. Their camels are as swift as horses, and much better able to bear burdens besides.

<milestone n="103" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>I do not describe the camel's appearance to <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, for they know it; but I shall tell them something that they do not know concerning it: the hindlegs of the camel have four thighbones and four knee-joints; its genitals are turned towards the tail between the hindlegs.

<milestone n="104" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Thus and with teams so harnessed the <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> ride after the gold, being careful to be engaged in taking it when the heat is greatest; for the ants are then out of sight underground.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now in these parts the sun is hottest in the morning, not at midday as elsewhere, but from sunrise to the hour of market-closing. Through these hours it is much hotter than in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name> at noon, so that men are said to sprinkle themselves with water at this time.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>At midday the sun's heat is nearly the same in <name key="tgn,7000198" type="place" reg=" +India [77,20] (nation), Asia "><placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName></name> as elsewhere.

<milestone n="105" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So when the <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> come to the place with their sacks, they fill these with the sand and drive back as fast as possible; for the ants at once scent them out, the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> say, and give chase. They say nothing is equal to them for speed, so that unless the <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> have a headstart while the ants were gathering, not one of them would get away.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They cut loose the male trace-camels, which are slower than the females, as they begin to lag, one at a time; the mares never tire, for they remember the young that they have left. Such is the tale. Most of the gold (say the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>) is got in this way by the <name type="ethnic">Indians</name>; they dig some from mines in their country, too, but it is less abundant.

<milestone n="106" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The most outlying nations of the world have somehow drawn the finest things as their lot, exactly as <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></name> has drawn the possession of far the best seasons.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>There, too, wool more beautiful and excellent than the wool of sheep grows on wild trees; these trees supply the <name type="ethnic">Indians</name> with clothing.

<milestone unit="para"/>Again, <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name> is the most distant to the south of all inhabited countries: and this is the only country which produces frankincense and myrrh and casia and cinnamon and gum-mastich. All these except myrrh are difficult for the <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name> to get.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They gather frankincense by burning that storax<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">A kind of gum, producing an acrid smoke when burnt, and therefore used as a disinfectant.</note> which <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name> carry to <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe"><placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName></name>; they burn this and so get the frankincense; for the spice-bearing trees are guarded by small winged snakes of varied color, many around each tree; these are the snakes that attack <name key="tgn,7016833" type="place" reg="Egypt [30,27] (nation), Africa "><placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></name>. Nothing except the smoke of storax will drive them away from the trees.

<milestone n="108" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name> also say that the whole country would be full of these snakes if the same thing did not occur among them that I believe occurs among vipers.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Somehow the forethought of God (just as is reasonable) being wise has made all creatures prolific that are timid and edible, so that they do not become extinct through being eaten, whereas few young are born to hardy and vexatious creatures.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>On the one hand, because the hare is hunted by every beast and bird and man, therefore it is quite prolific; alone of all creatures it conceives during pregnancy; some of the unborn young are hairy, some still naked, some are still forming in the womb while others are just conceived.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>On the one hand there is this sort of thing, but on the other hand the lioness, that is so powerful and so bold, once in her life bears one cub; for in the act of bearing she casts her uterus out with her cub. The explanation of this is that when the cub first begins to stir in the mother, its claws, much sharper than those of any other creature, tear the uterus, and the more it grows the more it scratches and tears, so that when the hour of birth is near seldom is any of the uterus left intact.

<milestone n="109" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So too if the vipers and the winged serpents of <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name> were born in the natural manner of serpents life would be impossible for men; but as it is, when they copulate, while the male is in the act of procreation and as soon as he has ejaculated his seed, the female seizes him by the neck, and does not let go until she has bitten through.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The male dies in the way described, but the female suffers in return for the male the following punishment: avenging their father, the young while they are still within the womb gnaw at their mother and eating through her bowels thus make their way out.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Other snakes, that do no harm to men, lay eggs and hatch out a vast number of young. The <name type="ethnic">Arabian</name> winged serpents do indeed seem to be numerous; but that is because (although there are vipers in every land) these are all in <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name> and are found nowhere else.

<milestone n="110" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name> get frankincense in the foregoing way, and casia in the following way: when they go after it they bind oxhides and other skins all over their bodies and faces except for the eyes. Casia grows in a shallow lake; around this and in it live winged creatures, very like bats, that squeak similarly and make a fierce resistance; these have to be kept away from the eyes in order to take the casia.

<milestone n="111" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>As for cinnamon, they gather it in an even stranger way. Where it comes from and what land produces it they cannot say, except that it is reported, reasonably enough, to grow in the places where <name type="pers">Dionysus</name> was reared.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>There are great birds, it is said, that take these dry sticks which we have learned from the <name type="ethnic">Phoenicians</name> to call cinnamon and carry them off to nests stuck with mud to precipitous cliffs, where man has no means of approach.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Arabian</name> solution to this is to cut dead oxen and asses and other beasts of burden into the largest possible pieces, then to set these near the eyries and withdraw far off. The birds then fly down (it is said) and carry the pieces of the beasts up to their nests, while these, not being able to bear the weight, break and fall down the mountain side, and then the <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name> come and gather them up. Thus is cinnamon said to be gathered, and so to come from <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name> to other lands.

<milestone n="112" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But ledanon, which the <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name> call ladanon, is produced yet more strangely than this. For it is the most fragrant thing produced in the most malodorous; for it is found in he-goats' beards, forming in them like gum among timber. This is used in the manufacture of many perfumes; there is nothing that the <name type="ethnic">Arabians</name> burn so often as incense.

<milestone n="113" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Enough of marvels, and yet the land of <name key="tgn,1012700" type="place" reg="Arabian Peninsula [45,25] (region (general)), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName></name> gives off a scent as sweet as if divine. They have besides two marvellous kinds of sheep, found nowhere else. One of these has tails no less than nine feet long. Were the sheep to trail these after them they would suffer by the chafing of the tails on the ground;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
but every shepherd there knows enough of carpentry to make little carts which they fix under the tails, binding the tail of each sheep on its own cart. The other kind of sheep has a tail a full three feet broad.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But I do not believe this, that there are one-eyed men who have a nature otherwise the same as other men.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The most outlying lands, though, as they enclose and wholly surround all the rest of the world, are likely to have those things which we think the finest and the rarest.

<milestone n="117" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>There is a plain in <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)"><placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName></name> shut in on all sides by mountains through which there are five passes.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">All this description appears to be purely imaginative.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now from the encircling mountains flows a great river whose name is the Aces. Its stream divides into five channels and formerly watered the lands of the above-mentioned peoples, going to each through a different pass, but since the beginning of the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> rule
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
the king has blocked the mountain passes, and closed each passage with a gate; with the water barred from outlet, the plain within the mountains becomes a lake, seeing that the river pours into it and finds no way out.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Those therefore who before were accustomed to use the water endure great hardship in not being able to use it; for during the winter, god rains for them just as for the rest of mankind, but in the summer they are in need of the water for their sown millet and sesame.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So whenever no water is given to them, they come into <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia"><placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></name> with their women, and cry and howl before the door of the king's palace, until the king commands that the river-gate should be opened for those whose need is greatest;
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
then, when this land has drunk its fill of water, that gate is shut, and the king has another opened for those of the rest who most require it. I know by hearsay that he gets a lot of money, over and above the tribute, for opening the gates. So much for these matters.

<milestone unit="para"/>Of the seven men who revolted against the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>, one, <name type="pers">Intaphrenes</name>, got his death through his own violence immediately after the rebellion.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Intaphrenes</name>, as one of the seven, claimed his right to enter unannounced; but the gatekeeper and the messenger forbade him, telling him that the king was having intercourse with one of his wives. <name type="pers">Intaphrenes</name> thought that they were lying; drawing his scimitar he cut off their noses and ears, then strung these on his horse's bridle and hung it around the men's necks, and so let them go.

&ldquo;O King,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I may have another husband, if a god is willing, and other children, if I lose these; but since my father and mother are no longer living, there is no way that I can have another brother; I said what I did with that in mind.&rdquo;

<milestone unit="para"/>So when <name type="pers">Darius</name> became king, he wanted to punish <name type="pers">Oroetes</name> for all his wrongdoing, and especially for killing <name type="pers">Mitrobates</name> and his son.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Bagaeus</name>, having drawn the lot, did as follows: he had many letters written concerning many things and put the seal of <name type="pers">Darius</name> on them, and then went with them to <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When he got there and came into <name type="pers">Oroetes</name>' presence, he took out each letter in turn and gave it to one of the royal scribes to read (all of the governors of the King have scribes); <name type="pers">Bagaeus</name> gave the letters to test the spearmen, whether they would consent to revolt against <name type="pers">Oroetes</name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Seeing that they were greatly affected by the rolls and yet more by what was written in them, he gave another, in which were these words: &ldquo;<name type="ethnic">Persians</name>! <name type="pers">King Darius</name> forbids you to be <name type="pers">Oroetes</name>' guard.&rdquo; Hearing this, they lowered their spears for him.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Bagaeus</name> saw that they obeyed the letter so far, he was encouraged and gave the last roll to the scribe, in which was written: &ldquo;<name type="pers">King Darius</name> instructs the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> in <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) "><placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></name> to kill <name type="pers">Oroetes</name>.&rdquo; Hearing this the spearmen drew their scimitars and killed him at once.

&ldquo;To me, as you know, have come <name type="pers">Polycrates</name>' scepter and all of his power, and it is in my power now to rule you.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Such was <name type="pers">Maeandrius</name>' promise to the <name type="ethnic">Samians</name>.

<milestone n="143" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This was the speech of <name type="pers">Telesarchus</name>, a man of consequence among the citizens. But <name type="pers">Maeandrius</name>, realizing that if he let go of the sovereignty someone else would make himself sovereign instead, resolved not to let it go.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>So they were imprisoned, and afterwards <name type="pers">Maeandrius</name> fell sick.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
whereupon he cried with a loud voice that he wanted to talk to <name type="pers">Maeandrius</name>. His brother, hearing him, had <name type="pers">Charilaus</name> loosed and brought before him.

<milestone unit="para"/>This was what <name type="pers">Charilaus</name> said; and <name type="pers">Maeandrius</name> took his advice, to my thinking not because he was so foolish as to suppose that he would be strong enough to defeat the king, but because he did not want <name type="pers">Syloson</name> to recover <name key="tgn,7002673" type="place" reg=" +Nisos Samos [26.8,37.75] (island), Samos, Aegean Islands, Greece, Europe "><placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName></name> safe and sound with no trouble.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>They were engaged in this when the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> force came up in reinforcement, and, hard-pressed, the guards retreated into the acropolis.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He could think of no other way to bring the city down than to mutilate himself and then desert to the <name type="ethnic">Babylonians</name>; so, making light of it, he mutilated himself beyond repair, and after cutting off his nose and ears and cropping his hair as a disfigurement and scourging himself, he came before <name type="pers">Darius</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When he got this from them, he did exactly as he had arranged with <name type="pers">Darius</name>.

According to them, their reason for doing this is that blowing makes the mare's veins swell and her udder drop.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When done milking, they pour the milk into deep wooden buckets, and make their slaves stand around the buckets and shake the milk; they draw off what stands on the surface and value this most; what lies at the bottom is less valued.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
and the <name type="ethnic">Cimmerians</name>, at the advance of the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, deliberated as men threatened by a great force should. Opinions were divided; both were strongly held, but that of the princes was the more honorable; for the people believed that their part was to withdraw and that there was no need to risk their lives for the dust of the earth; but the princes were for fighting to defend their country against the attackers.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Neither side could persuade the other, neither the people the princes nor the princes the people; the one party planned to depart without fighting and leave the country to their enemies, but the princes were determined to lie dead in their own country and not to flee with the people, for they considered how happy their situation had been and what ills were likely to come upon them if they fled from their native land.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Having made up their minds, the princes separated into two equal bands and fought with each other until they were all killed by each other's hands; then the <name type="pers">Cimmerian</name> people buried them by the <name type="place">Tyras river</name>, where their tombs are still to be seen, and having buried them left the land; and the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> came and took possession of the country left empty.

<milestone unit="para"/>Of these too, then, we have knowledge; but as for what is north of them, it is from the <name type="ethnic">Issedones</name> that the tale comes of the one-eyed men and the griffins that guard gold; this is told by the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, who have heard it from them; and we have taken it as true from the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, and call these people by the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> name, <name type="ethnic">Arimaspians</name>; for in the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> tongue &ldquo;arima&rdquo; is one, and &ldquo;spou&rdquo; is the eye.

<milestone unit="para"/>All the aforesaid country is exceedingly cold: for eight months of every year there is unbearable frost, and during these you do not make mud by pouring out water but by lighting a fire; the sea freezes, as does all the <name key="tgn,1115171" type="place" reg="Kerchenskiy Proliv [36.650,45.250] (strait), Europe">Cimmerian Bosporus</name>; and the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> living on this side of the trench lead armies over the ice, and drive their wagons across to the land of the <name key="tgn,1059424" type="place" reg="+Sindi [24.666,58.4] (inhabited place), lost &amp; found/Estonia, Estonia, Europe">Sindi</name>.

and when there are thunderstorms in other lands, here there are none, but in summer there are plenty of them; if there is a thunderstorm in winter they are apt to wonder at it as at a portent.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Horses have the endurance to bear the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> winter; mules and asses cannot bear it at all; and yet in other lands, while asses and mules can endure frost, horses that stand in it are frostbitten.

<milestone unit="para"/>And in my opinion it is for this reason that the hornless kind of cattle grow no horns in <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name>. A verse of Homer in the <title>Odyssey</title> attests to my opinion:

<milestone unit="para"/>In <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name>, then, this happens because of the cold.

but whenever the season is at hand for the mares to conceive, they drive them into the countries of their neighbors, and then send the asses after them, until the mares are pregnant, and then they drive them home again.

<milestone unit="para"/>But regarding the feathers of which the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> say that the air is full, so thickly that no one can see or traverse the land beyond, I have this opinion.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Whoever has seen snow falling thickly near him knows himself my meaning; for snow is like feathers; and because of the winter, which is as I have said, the regions to the north of this continent are uninhabited.

<milestone unit="para"/>With these rivers aforesaid, and many others, too, as its tributaries, the <name type="place">Ister</name> becomes the greatest river of all, while river for river the <name key="tgn,1127805" type="place" reg="Nahr an- Nil [31.1,30.166] (river), Africa">Nile</name> surpasses it in volume, since that owes its volume of water to no tributary river or spring.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But the <name type="place">Ister</name> is always the same height in summer and winter, the reason for which, I think, is this. In winter it is of its customary size, or only a little greater than is natural to it, for in that country in winter there is very little rain, but snow everywhere.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>In the summer, the abundant snow that has fallen in winter melts and pours from all sides into the <name type="place">Ister</name>; so this snow-melt pours into the river and helps to swell it and much violent rain besides, as the summer is the season of rain.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>And in proportion as the sun draws to itself more water in summer than in winter, the water that commingles with the <name type="place">Ister</name> is many times more abundant in summer than it is in winter; these opposites keep the balance true, so that the volume of the river appears always the same.

<milestone n="60" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>In all their sacred rites they follow the same method of sacrifice; this is how it is offered. The victim stands with its forefeet shackled together; the sacrificer stands behind the beast, and throws it down by pulling the end of the rope;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
as the victim falls, he invokes whatever god it is to whom he sacrifices. Then, throwing a noose around the beast's neck, he thrusts in a stick and twists it and so strangles the victim, lighting no fire nor offering the first-fruits, nor pouring any libation; and having strangled and skinned the beast, he sets about cooking it.

<milestone n="61" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now as the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> land is quite bare of wood, this is how they contrive to cook the meat. When they have skinned the victims, they strip the meat from the bones and throw it into the cauldrons of the country, if they have them: these are most like <name type="ethnic">Lesbian</name> bowls, except that they are much bigger; they throw the meat into these, then, and cook it by lighting a fire beneath with the bones of the victims. But if they have no cauldron, then they put all the meat into the victims' stomachs, adding water, and make a fire of the bones beneath,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
which burn nicely; the stomachs easily hold the meat when it is stripped from the bones; thus a steer serves to cook itself, and every other victim does likewise. When the flesh is cooked, the sacrificer takes the first-fruits of the flesh and the entrails and casts them before him. They use all grazing animals for sacrifice, but mainly horses.

<milestone n="62" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This is their way of sacrificing to other gods and these are the beasts offered; but their sacrifices to <name type="pers">Ares</name> are of this sort. Every district in each of the governments has a structure sacred to <name type="pers">Ares</name>; namely, a pile of bundles of sticks three eighths of a mile wide and long, but of a lesser height, on the top of which there is a flattened four-sided surface; three of its sides are sheer, but the fourth can be ascended.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Every year a hundred and fifty wagon-loads of sticks are heaped upon this; for the storms of winter always make it sink down. On this sacred pile an ancient scimitar of iron is set for each people: their image of <name type="pers">Ares</name>. They bring yearly sacrifice of sheep and goats and horses to this scimitar, offering to these symbols even more than they do to the other gods.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Of enemies that they take alive, they sacrifice one man in every hundred, not as they sacrifice sheep and goats, but differently. They pour wine on the men's heads and cut their throats over a bowl; then they carry the blood up on to the pile of sticks and pour it on the scimitar.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>They carry the blood up above, but down below by the sacred pile they cut off all the slain men's right arms and hands and throw these into the air, and depart when they have sacrificed the rest of the victims; the arm lies where it has fallen, and the body apart from it.

<milestone n="63" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>These then are their established rites of sacrifice; but these <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> make no offerings of swine; nor are they willing for the most part to rear them in their country.

<milestone n="64" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>As to war, these are their customs. A <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> drinks the blood of the first man whom he has taken down. He carries the heads of all whom he has slain in the battle to his king; for if he brings a head, he receives a share of the booty taken, but not otherwise.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He scalps the head by making a cut around it by the ears, then grasping the scalp and shaking the head off. Then he scrapes out the flesh with the rib of a steer, and kneads the skin with his hands, and having made it supple he keeps it for a hand towel, fastening it to the bridle of the horse which he himself rides, and taking pride in it; for he who has most scalps for hand towels is judged the best man.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Many <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> even make garments to wear out of these scalps, sewing them together like coats of skin. Many too take off the skin, nails and all, from their dead enemies' right hands, and make coverings for their quivers;the human skin was, as it turned out, thick and shining, the brightest and whitest skin of all, one might say.

<milestone unit="para"/>The heads themselves, not all of them but those of their bitterest enemies, they treat this way. Each saws off all the part beneath the eyebrows, and cleans the rest. If he is a poor man, then he covers the outside with a piece of raw hide, and so makes use of it; but if he is rich, he covers the head with the raw hide, and gilds the inside of it and uses it for a drinking-cup.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Such a cup a man also makes out of the head of his own kinsman with whom he has been feuding, and whom he has defeated in single combat before the king; and if guests whom he honors visit him he will serve them with these heads, and show how the dead were his kinsfolk who fought him and were beaten by him; this they call manly valor.

<milestone unit="para"/>There are many diviners among the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, who divine by means of many wi!low wands as I will show.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
this manner of divination is hereditary among them. The <name type="ethnic">Enarees</name>, who are hermaphrodites, say that <name type="pers">Aphrodite</name> gave them the art of divination, which they practise by means of lime-tree bark.

<milestone unit="para"/>Whenever the king of the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> falls ill, he sends for the three most reputable diviners, who prophesy in the aforesaid way; and they generally tell him that such and such a man (naming whoever it may be of the people) has sworn falsely by the king's hearth;
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
for when the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> will swear their mightiest oath, it is by the king's hearth that they are accustomed to swear. Immediately, the man whom they allege to have sworn falsely is seized and brought in, and when he comes the diviners accuse him, saying that their divination shows him to have sworn falsely by the king's hearth, and that this is the cause of the king's sickness; and the man vehemently denies that he has sworn falsely.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When he denies it, the king sends for twice as many diviners: and if they too, consulting their art, prove him guilty of perjury, then he is instantly beheaded, and his goods are divided among the first diviners;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
but if the later diviners acquit him, then other diviners come, and yet again others. If the greater number of them acquit the man, it is decreed that the first diviners themselves be put to death.

<milestone unit="para"/>As for giving sworn pledges to those who are to receive them, this is the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> way: they take blood from the parties to the agreement by making a little cut in the body with an awl or a knife, and pour it mixed with wine into a big earthenware bowl, into which they then dip a scimitar and arrows and an axe and a javelin; and when this is done those swearing the agreement, and the most honorable of their followers, drink the blood after solemn curses.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then those who receive the dead man on his arrival do the same as do the Royal <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>: that is, they cut off a part of their ears, shave their heads, make cuts around their arms, tear their foreheads and noses, and pierce their left hands with arrows.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>From there, the escorts transport the king's body on the wagon to another of the tribes that they rule, and those to whom they have already come follow them; and having carried the dead man to all in turn, they are at the place of burial, in the country of the <name type="ethnic">Gerrhi</name>, the farthest distant tribe of all under their rule.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Then, having laid the body on a couch in the tomb, they plant spears on each side of the body and lay wooden planks across them, which they then roof over with braided osiers; in the open space which is left in the tomb they bury one of the king's concubines, his cupbearer, his cook, his groom, his squire, and his messenger, after strangling them, besides horses, and first-fruits of everything else, and golden cups; for the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> do not use silver or bronze.

and strangle fifty of these and fifty of their best horses and empty and clean the bellies of them all, fill them with chaff, and sew them up again.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Then they fasten half of a wheel to two posts, the hollow upward, and the other half to another pair of posts, until many posts thus prepared are planted in the ground, and, after driving thick stakes lengthways through the horses' bodies to their necks, they place the horses up on the wheels

so that the wheel in front supports the horse's forequarters and the wheel behind takes the weight of the belly by the hindquarters, and the forelegs and hindlegs hang free; and putting bridles and bits in the horses' mouths, they stretch the bridles to the front and fasten them with pegs.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Then they take each one of the fifty strangled young men and mount him on the horse; their way of doing it is to drive an upright stake through each body passing up alongside the spine to the neck leaving enough of the stake projecting below to be fixed in a hole made in the other stake, which passes through the horse. So having set horsemen of this fashion around the tomb, they ride away.

<milestone unit="para"/>This is the way they bury their kings.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>After the burial the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> cleanse themselves as follows: they anoint and wash their heads and, for their bodies, set up three poles leaning together to a point and cover these over with wool mats; then, in the space so enclosed to the best of their ability, they make a pit in the center beneath the poles and the mats and throw red-hot stones into it.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For when <name type="pers">Anacharsis</name> was coming back to the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> country after having seen much of the world in his travels and given many examples of his wisdom, he sailed through the <name key="tgn,7002638" type="place" reg="Canakkale Bogazi (strait), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia ">Hellespont</name> and put in at <name key="perseus,Cyzicus" type="place" reg=" +Cyzicus [27.9,40.4167] (Perseus) ">Cyzicus</name>;

where, finding the <name type="ethnic">Cyzicenes</name> celebrating the feast of the Mother of the Gods with great ceremony, he vowed to this same Mother that if he returned to his own country safe and sound he would sacrifice to her as he saw the <name type="ethnic">Cyzicenes</name> doing, and establish a nightly rite of worship.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So when he came to <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name>, he hid himself in the country called Woodland (which is beside the Race of <name type="pers">Achilles</name>, and is all overgrown with every kind of timber); hidden there, <name type="pers">Anacharsis</name> celebrated the goddess' ritual with exactness, carrying a small drum and hanging images about himself.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Then some <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> saw him doing this and told the king, <name type="pers">Saulius</name>; who, coming to the place himself and seeing <name type="pers">Anacharsis</name> performing these rites, shot an arrow at him and killed him. And now the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, if they are asked about <name type="pers">Anacharsis</name>, say they have no knowledge of him; this is because he left his country for <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> and followed the customs of strangers.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>But according to what I heard from <name type="pers">Tymnes</name>, the deputy for <name type="pers">Ariapithes</name>, <name type="pers">Anacharsis</name> was an uncle of <name type="pers">Idanthyrsus</name> king of <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name>, and he was the son of <name type="pers">Gnurus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Lycus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Spargapithes</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But this is a tale pointlessly invented by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> themselves; and be this as it may, the man was put to death as I have said.

<milestone n="78" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This, then, was how <name type="pers">Anacharsis</name> fared, owing to his foreign ways and consorting with <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>; and a great many years afterward, <name type="pers">Scyles</name>, son of <name type="pers">Ariapithes</name>, suffered a like fate. <name type="pers">Scyles</name> was one of the sons born to <name type="pers">Ariapithes</name>, king of <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name>; but his mother was of <name key="tgn,7009395" type="place" reg=" +Istra [14,45.25] (region (general)), Croatia, Europe ">Istria</name>,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">In what is now the <name key="tgn,7016652" type="place" reg=" +Dobruja (region (general)), Europe ">Dobrudja</name>.</note> and not native-born; and she taught him to speak and read <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>As time passed, <name type="pers">Ariapithes</name> was treacherously killed by <name type="pers">Spargapithes</name>, king of the <name type="place">Agathyrsi</name>, and <name type="pers">Scyles</name> inherited the kingship and his father's wife, a <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> woman whose name was <name type="pers">Opoea</name>, and she bore <name type="pers">Scyles</name> a son, <name type="pers">Oricus</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So <name type="pers">Scyles</name> was king of <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name>; but he was in no way content with the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> way of life, and was much more inclined to <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> ways, from the upbringing that he had received. So this is what he would do: he would lead the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> army to the city of the <name type="ethnic">Borysthenites</name> (who say that they are <name type="ethnic">Milesians</name>), and when he arrived there would leave his army in the suburb of the city,
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
while he himself, entering within the walls and shutting the gates, would take off his <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> apparel and put on <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> dress; and in it he would go among the townsfolk unattended by spearmen or any others (who would guard the gates, lest any <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> see him wearing this apparel), and in every way follow the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> manner of life, and worship the gods according to <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> usage.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When he had spent a month or more like this, he would put on <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> dress and leave the city. He did this often; and he built a house in <name key="tgn,7014779" type="place" reg=" +Dnepr (river), Europe ">Borysthenes</name>, and married a wife of the people of the country and brought her there.

<milestone n="79" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But when things had to turn out badly for him, they did so for this reason: he conceived a desire to be initiated into the rites of the <name type="pers">Bacchic Dionysus</name>; and when he was about to begin the sacred mysteries, he saw the greatest vision.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He had in the city of the <name type="ethnic">Borysthenites</name> a spacious house, grand and costly (the same house I just mentioned), all surrounded by sphinxes and griffins worked in white marble; this house was struck by a thunderbolt.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> reproach the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> for this Bacchic revelling, saying that it is not reasonable to set up a god who leads men to madness.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So when <name type="pers">Scyles</name> had been initiated into the Bacchic rite, some one of the <name type="ethnic">Borysthenites</name> scoffed at the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>: &ldquo;You laugh at us, <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, because we play the Bacchant and the god possesses us; but now this deity has possessed your own king, so that he plays the Bacchant and is maddened by the god.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>The leading men among the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> followed him, and the <name type="ethnic">Borysthenite</name> brought them up secretly onto a tower; from which, when <name type="pers">Scyles</name> passed by with his company of worshippers, they saw him playing the Bacchant; thinking it a great misfortune, they left the city and told the whole army what they had seen.

<milestone unit="para"/>After this <name type="pers">Scyles</name> rode off to his own place; but the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> rebelled against him, setting up his brother <name type="pers">Octamasades</name>, son of the daughter of <name type="pers">Teres</name>, for their king.

<name type="pers">Scyles</name>, learning what had happened concerning him and the reason why it had happened, fled into <name key="tgn,7001303" type="place" reg="Thrace (region (general)), Europe">Thrace</name>; and when <name type="pers">Octamasades</name> heard this he led his army there.

<name type="pers">Sitalces</name> then took his brother and carried him away, but <name type="pers">Octamasades</name> beheaded <name type="pers">Scyles</name> on the spot.

<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> could not understand the business; for they did not recognize the women's speech or their dress or their nation, but wondered where they had come from, and imagined them to be men all of the same age; and they met the <name type="ethnic">Amazons</name> in battle. The result of the fight was that the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> got possession of the dead, and so came to learn that their foes were women.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Therefore, after deliberation they resolved by no means to slay them as before, but to send their youngest men to them, of a number corresponding (as they guessed) to the number of the women. They directed these youths to camp near the <name type="ethnic">Amazons</name> and to imitate all that they did; if the women pursued them, not to fight, but to flee; and when the pursuit stopped, to return and camp near them. This was the plan of the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, for they desired that children be born of the women. The young men who were sent did as they were directed.

and since they did not understand each other's speech and she could not speak to him, she signed with her hand that he should come the next day to the same place and bring another youth with him (showing by signs that there should be two), and she would bring another woman with her.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The youth went away and told his comrades; and the next day he came himself with another to the place, where he found the <name type="ethnic">Amazon</name> and another with her awaiting them.

&ldquo;By no means stand aside and let us be destroyed,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;rather, let us unite and oppose this invader. If you will not, then we shall either be driven out of our country or stay and make terms.

&ldquo;Had it not been you who wronged the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> first and began the war, what you now ask would seem to us right, and we would listen and act together with you.

their two other divisions, namely, the greater whose ruler was <name type="pers">Idanthyrsus</name>, and the third whose king was <name type="pers">Taxakis</name>, were to unite, and taking with them also the <name type="ethnic">Geloni</name> and <name type="ethnic">Budini</name>, to draw off like the others at the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> approach, always keeping one day's march ahead of the enemy, avoiding a confrontation and doing what had been determined.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>First, then, they were to retreat in a straight line toward the countries which refused their alliance, so as to involve these, too, in the war; for if they did not of their own accord support the war against the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, they must be involved against their will; and after that, the division was to turn back to its own country, and attack the enemy, if in deliberation they thought this best.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They then sent the division of the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> to which the <name type="ethnic">Sauromatae</name> were attached, and which was led by <name type="pers">Scopasis</name>, to speak with those <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> guarding the bridge over the <name type="place">Ister</name>; as for those of the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> who remained behind, it was decided that they should no longer decoy the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, but attack them whenever they were foraging for provision.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> horse always routed the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> horse, and when the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> cavalry would fall back in flight on their infantry, the infantry would come up to their aid; and the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, once they had driven in the horse, turned back for fear of the infantry.

<milestone n="129" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Very strange to say, what aided the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and thwarted the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> in their attacks on <name type="pers">Darius</name>' army was the braying of the asses and the appearance of the mules.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For, as I have before indicated, <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name> produces no asses or mules; and there is not in most of <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name> an ass or a mule, because of the cold.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
and often, when they were in the act of charging the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, the horses would shy in fear if they heard the asses bray or would stand still with ears erect, never having heard a noise like it or seen a like creature.

<milestone n="130" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> thus gained very little in the war, for when the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> saw that the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> were shaken, they formed a plan to have them remain longer in <name key="tgn,6005315" type="place" reg="Scythia (region (general)), Asia">Scythia</name> and, remaining, be distressed by lack of necessities: they would leave some of their flocks behind with the shepherds, moving away themselves to another place; and the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> would come and take the sheep, and be encouraged by this achievement.

<milestone n="131" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>After such a thing had happened several times, <name type="pers">Darius</name> was finally at a loss; and when they perceived this, the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> kings sent a herald to <name type="pers">Darius</name> with the gift of a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> asked the bearer of these gifts what they meant; but he said that he had only been told to give the gifts and then leave at once; he told the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to figure out what the presents meant themselves, if they were smart enough.

<milestone n="132" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When they heard this, the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> deliberated. <name type="pers">Darius</name>' judgment was that the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> were surrendering themselves and their earth and their water to him; for he reasoned that a mouse is a creature found in the earth and eating the same produce as men, and a frog is a creature of the water and a bird particularly like a horse; and the arrows signified that the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> surrendered their fighting power.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This was the opinion declared by <name type="pers">Darius</name>; but the opinion of <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>, one of the seven who had slain the <name type="ethnic">Magus</name>, was contrary to it. He reasoned that the meaning of the gifts was,
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Unless you become birds, <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and fly up into the sky, or mice and hide in the earth, or frogs and leap into the lakes, you will be shot by these arrows and never return home.&rdquo;

<milestone n="133" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> reasoned thus about the gifts. But when the first division of the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> came to the bridge&mdash;the division that had first been appointed to stand on guard by the <name type="place">Maeetian lake</name> and had now been sent to the <name type="place">Ister</name> to speak with the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name>&mdash;they said,

&ldquo;<name type="ethnic">Ionians</name>, we have come to bring you freedom, if you will only listen to us. We understand that <name type="pers">Darius</name> has directed you to guard the bridge for sixty days only, and if he does not come within that time, then to go away to your homes.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now then, do what will leave you guiltless in his eyes as in ours: stay here for the time appointed; and after that, leave.&rdquo; So the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> promised to do this, and the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> made their way back with all haste.

<milestone n="134" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But after sending the gifts to <name type="pers">Darius</name>, the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> who had remained there came out with foot and horse and offered battle to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>. But when the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> ranks were set in order, a rabbit ran out between the armies; and every <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> that saw it gave chase. So there was confusion and shouting among the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>; <name type="pers">Darius</name> asked about the clamor among the enemy; and when he heard that they were chasing a rabbit, he said to those with whom he was accustomed to speak,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;These men hold us in deep contempt; and I think now that <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>' opinion of the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> gifts was true. Since, then, my own judgment agrees with his, we need to consider carefully how we shall return safely.&rdquo; To this <name type="pers">Gobryas</name> said : &ldquo;O King, I understood almost by reason alone how difficult it would be to deal with these <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>; but when I came here, I understood even better, watching them toying with us.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now then, my advice is that at nightfall we kindle our campfires in the usual way, deceive those in our army who are least fit to endure hardship, and tether all our asses here, and ourselves depart, before the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> can march straight to the <name type="place">Ister</name> to break up the bridge, or the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> take some action by which we may well be ruined.&rdquo;

<milestone n="135" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This was <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>' advice, and at nightfall <name type="pers">Darius</name> followed it. He left the men who were worn out, and those whose loss mattered least to him, there in the camp, and all the asses, too, tethered.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>His reasons for leaving the asses, and the infirm among his soldiers, were the following: the asses, so that they would bray; the men, who were left because of their infirmity, he pretended were to guard the camp while he attacked the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> with the fit part of his army.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Giving this order to those who were left behind, and lighting campfires, <name type="pers">Darius</name> made all haste to reach the <name type="place">Ister</name>. When the asses found themselves deserted by the multitude, they brayed the louder for it; and the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> heard them and assumed that the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> were in the place.

<milestone n="136" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But when it was day, the men left behind perceived that <name type="pers">Darius</name> had betrayed them, and they held out their hands to the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> and explained the circumstances; they, when they heard this, assembled their power in haste, the two divisions of their horde and the one division that was with the <name type="ethnic">Sauromatae</name> and <name type="ethnic">Budini</name> and <name type="ethnic">Geloni</name>, and made straight for the <name type="place">Ister</name> in pursuit of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And as the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> army was for the most part infantry and did not know the roads (which were not marked), while the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> were horsemen and knew the short cuts, they went wide of each other, and the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> reached the bridge long before the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>There, perceiving that the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> had not yet come, they said to the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name>, who were in their ships, &ldquo;<name type="ethnic">Ionians</name>, the days have exceeded the number, and you are wrong to be here still.

<milestone n="137" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

<milestone unit="para"/>When these accepted <name type="pers">Histiaeus</name>' view, they decided to act upon it in the following way: to break as much of the bridge on the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> side as a bowshot from there carried, so that they seem to be doing something when in fact they were doing nothing, and that the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> not try to force their way across the bridge over the <name type="place">Ister</name>; and to say while they were breaking the portion of the bridge on the <name type="ethnic">Scythian</name> side, that they would do all that the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> desired.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>This was the plan they adopted; and then <name type="pers">Histiaeus</name> answered for them all, and said, &ldquo;You have come with good advice, <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, and your urgency is timely: you guide us well and we do you a convenient service; for, as you see, we are breaking the bridge, and will be diligent about it, as we want to be free.

<milestone n="140" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, trusting the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name>' word once more, turned back to look for the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>; but they missed the way by which their enemies returned.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Had they not done, they could, if they had wished, easily have found the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>. But as it was, that part of their plan which they had thought the best was the very cause of their going astray.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>So the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> went searching for their enemies through the parts of their own country where there was forage for the horses and water, supposing that they, too, were heading for such places in their flight; but the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> kept to their own former tracks, and so with much trouble they found the crossing.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But as they arrived at night and found the bridge broken, they were in great alarm lest the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> had abandoned them.

<milestone unit="para"/>At a distance of ten days' journey again from the <name type="ethnic">Ammonians</name> along the sandy ridge, there is a hill of salt like that of the <name type="ethnic">Ammonians</name>, and springs of water, where men live; this place is called <name key="tgn,7000650" type="place" reg=" +Awjilah [21.2,29.15] (inhabited place), Banghazi, Libya, Africa ">Augila</name>; it is to this that the <name type="ethnic">Nasamones</name> come to gather palm-fruit.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The shortest way to the <name type="ethnic">Lotus Eaters</name>' country is from here, thirty days' journey distant. Among the <name type="ethnic">Garamantes</name> are the cattle that go backward as they graze, the reason being that their horns curve forward;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
therefore, not being able to go forward, since the horns would stick in the ground, they walk backward grazing. Otherwise, they are like other cattle, except that their hide is thicker and harder to the touch.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>These <name type="ethnic">Garamantes</name> go in their four-horse chariots chasing the cave-dwelling <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name>: for the <name type="pers">Ethiopian</name> cave-dwellers are swifter of foot than any men of whom tales are brought to us.

<milestone n="184" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Another ten days' journey from the <name type="ethnic">Garamantes</name> there is again a salt hill and water, where men live called <name type="ethnic">Atarantes</name>. These are the only men whom we know who have no names; for the whole people are called <name type="ethnic">Atarantes</name>, but no man has a name of his own.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When the sun is high, they curse and very foully revile him, because his burning heat afflicts their people and their land.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>After another ten days' journey there is again a hill of salt, and water, and men living there. Near to this salt is a mountain called Atlas, whose shape is slender and conical; and it is said to be so high that its heights cannot be seen, for clouds are always on them winter and summer. The people of the country call it the pillar of heaven.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>These men get their name, which is <name type="ethnic">Atlantes</name>, from this mountain. It is said that they eat no living creature, and see no dreams in their sleep.

<milestone n="185" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>I know and can tell the names of all the peoples that live on the ridge as far as the <name type="ethnic">Atlantes</name>, but no farther than that. But I know this, that the ridge reaches as far as the Pillars of <name type="pers">Heracles</name> and beyond them.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>There is a mine of salt on it every ten days' journey, and men live there. Their houses are all built of blocks of the salt; for these are parts of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa">Libya</name> where no rain falls; for the walls, being of salt, could not stand firm if there were rain.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The salt there is both white and purple. Beyond this ridge, the southern and inland parts of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa">Libya</name> are desolate and waterless: there are no wild beasts, no rain, no forests; this region is wholly without moisture.

<milestone unit="para"/>Thus it is with this region. But west of the <name type="place">Tritonian lake</name> the <name type="ethnic">Libyans</name> are not nomads; they do not follow the same customs, or treat their children as the nomads do.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For the practice of many <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> nomads (I cannot say absolutely whether it is the practice of all) is to take their children when four years old, and to burn the veins of their scalps or sometimes of their temples with grease of sheep's wool, so that the children may never afterward be afflicted by phlegm draining from the head.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>They say that this makes their children quite healthy. In fact, the <name type="ethnic">Libyans</name> are the healthiest of all men whom we know; whether it is because of this practice, I cannot say absolutely; but they certainly are healthy. When the children smart from the pain of the burning, the <name type="ethnic">Libyans</name> have found a remedy; they soothe them by applications of goats' urine. This is what the <name type="ethnic">Libyans</name> themselves say.

<milestone n="188" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The nomads' way of sacrificing is to cut a piece from the victim's ear for first-fruits and throw it over the house; then they wring the victim's neck. They sacrifice to no gods except the sun and moon; that is, this is the practice of the whole nation; but the dwellers by the <name type="place">Tritonian lake</name> sacrifice to <name type="pers">Athena</name> chiefly, and next to <name type="pers">Triton</name> and <name type="pers">Poseidon</name>.

<milestone n="189" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>It would seem that the robe and aegis of the images of <name type="pers">Athena</name> were copied by the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> from the <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> women; for except that <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> women dress in leather, and that the tassels of their goatskin cloaks are not snakes but thongs of hide, in everything else their equipment is the same.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>And in fact, the very name betrays that the attire of the statues of <name type="pers">Pallas</name> has come from <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa">Libya</name>; for <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> women wear the hairless tasselled &ldquo;aegea&rdquo; over their dress, colored with madder, and the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> have changed the name of these aegeae into their &ldquo;aegides.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">The aegis is the conventional buckler of <name type="pers">Pallas</name>.

<milestone unit="para"/>The dead are buried by the nomads in <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> fashion, except by the <name type="ethnic">Nasamones</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>For the eastern region of <name key="tgn,1000172" type="place" reg="Libya [17,25] (nation), Africa">Libya</name>, which the nomads inhabit, is low-lying and sandy as far as the <name type="place">Triton river</name>; but the land west of this, where the farmers live, is exceedingly mountainous and wooded and full of wild beasts.

<milestone unit="para"/>Off their coast (the <name type="ethnic">Carthaginians</name> say) lies an island called <name type="place">Cyrauis</name>, twenty-five miles long and narrow across, accessible from the mainland; it is full of olives and vines.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It is said that there is a lake on this island from which the maidens of the country draw gold-dust out of the mud on feathers smeared with pitch.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Whatever falls into the pool is carried under the ground and appears again in the sea, which is about a half a mile distant from the pool. So, then, the story that comes from the island lying off the <name type="ethnic">Libyan</name> coast is like the truth, too.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then the <name type="ethnic">Carthaginians</name> disembark and examine the gold; if it seems to them a fair price for their cargo, they take it and go away; but if not, they go back aboard and wait, and the people come back and add more gold until the sailors are satisfied.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>In this transaction, it is said, neither party defrauds the other: the <name type="ethnic">Carthaginians</name> do not touch the gold until it equals the value of their cargo, nor do the people touch the cargo until the sailors have taken the gold.

<milestone unit="para"/>Now the <name type="ethnic">Naxians</name> had no suspicion at all that it was they who were to be attacked by that force.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
 The <name type="ethnic">Naxians</name>, then, made all preparations to face the onset of war.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> had exhausted all the money with which they had come, and <name type="pers">Aristagoras</name> himself had spent much beside, they built a stronghold for the banished <name type="ethnic">Naxians</name>, and went off to the mainland in poor spirits since still more money was needed for the siege.

<milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Aristagoras</name> had no way of fulfilling his promise to <name type="pers">Artaphrenes</name>, and he was hard-pressed by demands for the costs of the force.

It was likely, he thought, that his lordship of <name key="perseus,Miletus" type="place" reg="Miletus [27.3,37.5] (Perseus) ">Miletus</name> would be taken away from him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>With all these fears in his mind, he began to plan revolt, for it chanced that at that very time there came from <name key="tgn,7017509" type="place" reg="Shush [48.333,32.2] (inhabited place), Khuzestan, Iran, Asia">Susa</name> <name type="pers">Histiaeus</name>' messenger, the man with the marked head, signifying that <name type="pers">Aristagoras</name> should revolt from the king.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Since <name type="pers">Histiaeus</name> desired to give word to <name type="pers">Aristagoras</name> that he should revolt and had no other safe way of doing so because the roads were guarded, he shaved and branded the head of his most trustworthy slave.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>This <name type="pers">Histiaeus</name> did because he greatly disliked his detention at <name key="tgn,7017509" type="place" reg="Shush [48.333,32.2] (inhabited place), Khuzestan, Iran, Asia">Susa</name> and fully expected to be sent away to the coast in the case that there should be a revolt.

<milestone unit="para"/>With this intent, then, <name type="pers">Histiaeus</name> sent his messenger, and it chanced that all these things came upon <name type="pers">Aristagoras</name> at one and the same time.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In the course of this struggle, they did the <name type="ethnic">Epidaurians</name> much damage and stole their images of <name type="pers">Damia</name> and <name type="pers">Auxesia</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Having set them up in this place they sought their favor with sacrifices and female choruses in the satirical and abusive mode.

<milestone unit="para"/>When these images were stolen, the <name type="ethnic">Epidaurians</name> ceased from fulfilling their agreement with the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When they could not obtain possession of them in this manner, they tied cords around the images with which they could be dragged.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This is how this man met his end, and the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> found the action of their women to be more dreadful than their own misfortune.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For seven days they obeyed him and did his bidding; but on the next day, untried as they were in such labor and worn out by hard work and by the sun, the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> began to say each to other:
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Against what god have we sinned that we have to fulfill this task? We have lost our minds and launched out into folly, committing ourselves into the hands of this <name type="ethnic">Phocaean</name> braggart, who brings but three ships; and having got us he afflicts us with afflictions incurable. Many of us have fallen sick already, and many are likely to suffer the same thing; instead of these ills, it would be better for us to suffer anything, and endure this coming slavery, whatever it will be, rather than be oppressed by that which is now upon us. Come, let us obey him no longer!&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So they spoke, and from then on no man would obey. As if they were an army, they raised tents on the island where they stayed in the shade, and they were unwilling to embark upon their ships or to continue their exercises.

<milestone unit="para"/>When the generals of the <name type="ethnic">Samians</name> learned what the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> were doing, they recalled that message which <name type="pers">Aeaces</name> son of <name type="pers">Syloson</name> had already sent them at the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>' bidding, entreating them to desert the <name type="ethnic">Ionian</name> alliance; seeing great disorder on the <name type="ethnic">Ionian</name> side, they consented to the message; moreover, it seemed impossible to them to overcome the king's power, and they were well assured that if they overcame <name type="pers">Darius</name>' present fleet, another one five times as large would come.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Therefore, as soon as they saw the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> refusing to be useful, they took up that for a pretext, considering it advantageous to save their own temples and houses. This <name type="pers">Aeaces</name>, from whom they received the message, was the son of <name type="pers">Syloson</name> son of <name type="pers">Aeaces</name>, and had been tyrant of <name key="tgn,7002673" type="place" reg=" +Nisos Samos [26.8,37.75] (island), Samos, Aegean Islands, Greece, Europe ">Samos</name> until he was deposed from his rule by <name type="pers">Aristagoras</name> of <name key="perseus,Miletus" type="place" reg="Miletus [27.3,37.5] (Perseus) ">Miletus</name>, just like the other <name type="ethnic">Ionian</name> tyrants.

<milestone unit="para"/>Now when the <name type="ethnic">Phoenician</name> fleet came sailing against them, the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> put out to sea against them with their ships in column.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Samians</name> are said, according to their agreement with <name type="pers">Aeaces</name>, to have raised their sails and gone off to <name key="tgn,7002673" type="place" reg=" +Nisos Samos [26.8,37.75] (island), Samos, Aegean Islands, Greece, Europe ">Samos</name>, leaving their post, all except eleven ships.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The captains of these stood their ground and fought, disobeying their admirals.

<milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The most roughly handled of those that stood their ground in the sea-fight were the <name type="ethnic">Chians</name>, since they refused to be cowards and achieved deeds of renown. They brought a hundred ships to the fleet, as was mentioned above, and on each ship were forty picked men of their citizens.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Seeing themselves betrayed by the greater part of their allies, they did not think it right to act like the worst among them; with only a few allies to aid them they fought on and broke the enemy's line, until they had taken many ships but lost most of their own.

<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Chians</name> escaped to their own country with their remaining ships, but the crews of the <name type="ethnic">Chian</name> ships that were damaged and disabled were pursued and took refuge in <name key="perseus,Mykale" type="place" reg="Mykale [26.8667,38.1] (Perseus)">Mykale</name>.

When <name type="pers">Glaucus</name> heard this, he entreated the god to pardon him for what he had said. The priestess answered that to tempt the god and to do the deed had the same effect.

<milestone n="8A" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Men of <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia">Persia</name>, I am not bringing in and establishing a new custom, but following one that I have inherited. As I learn from our elders, we have never yet remained at peace ever since <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> deposed <name type="pers">Astyages</name> and we won this sovereignty from the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name>. It is the will of heaven; and we ourselves win advantage by our many enterprises. No one needs to tell you, who already know them well, which nations <name type="pers">Cyrus</name> and <name type="pers">Cambyses</name> and <name type="pers">Darius</name> my father subdued and added to our realm.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Ever since I came to this throne, I have considered how I might not fall short of my predecessors in this honor, and not add less power to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>; and my considerations persuade me that we may win not only renown, but a land neither less nor worse, and more fertile, than that which we now possess; and we would also gain vengeance and requital. For this cause I have now summoned you together, that I may impart to you what I intend to do.

<milestone n="8B" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>It is my intent to bridge the <name key="tgn,7002638" type="place" reg="Canakkale Bogazi (strait), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia ">Hellespont</name> and lead my army through <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)">Europe</name> to <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>, so I may punish the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> for what they have done to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and to my father.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>You saw that <name type="pers">Darius</name> my father was set on making an expedition against these men. But he is dead, and it was not granted him to punish them. On his behalf and that of all the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, I will never rest until I have taken <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)">Athens</name> and burnt it, for the unprovoked wrong that its people did to my father and me.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>First they came to <name key="perseus,Sardis" type="place" reg="Sardis [28.0167,38.475] (Perseus) ">Sardis</name> with our slave <name type="pers">Aristagoras</name> the <name type="ethnic">Milesian</name> and burnt the groves and the temples; next, how they dealt with us when we landed on their shores, when <name type="pers">Datis</name> and <name type="pers">Artaphrenes</name> were our generals, I suppose you all know.

<milestone n="8C" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>For these reasons I am resolved to send an army against them; and I reckon that we will find the following benefits among them: if we subdue those men, and their neighbors who dwell in the land of <name type="pers">Pelops</name> the <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name>, we will make the borders of <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> territory and of the firmament of heaven be the same.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>No land that the sun beholds will border ours, but I will make all into one country, when I have passed over the whole of <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)">Europe</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>I learn that this is the situation: no city of men or any human nation which is able to meet us in battle will be left, if those of whom I speak are taken out of our way. Thus the guilty and the innocent will alike bear the yoke of slavery.

<milestone n="8D" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>This is how you would best please me: when I declare the time for your coming, every one of you must eagerly appear; and whoever comes with his army best equipped will receive from me such gifts as are reckoned most precious among us.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Thus it must be done; but so that I not seem to you to have my own way, I lay the matter before you all, and bid whoever wishes to declare his opinion.&rdquo; So spoke <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> and ceased.

<milestone n="9A" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>What have we to fear from them? Have they a massive population or abundance of wealth? Their manner of fighting we know, and we know how weak their power is; we have conquered and hold their sons, those who dwell in our land and are called <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Aeolians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Dorians</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>I myself have made trial of these men, when by your father's command I marched against them. I marched as far as <name key="tgn,7001349" type="place" reg="Macedonia (region (general)), Europe">Macedonia</name> and almost to <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)">Athens</name> itself, yet none came out to meet me in battle.

<milestone n="9B" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>Yet the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> are accustomed to wage wars, as I learn, and they do it most senselessly in their wrongheadedness and folly. When they have declared war against each other, they come down to the fairest and most level ground that they can find and fight there, so that the victors come off with great harm; of the vanquished I say not so much as a word, for they are utterly destroyed.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Since they speak the same language, they should end their disputes by means of heralds or messengers, or by any way rather than fighting; if they must make war upon each other, they should each discover where they are in the strongest position and make the attempt there. The <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> custom, then, is not good; and when I marched as far as the land of <name key="tgn,7001349" type="place" reg="Macedonia (region (general)), Europe">Macedonia</name>, it had not come into their minds to fight.

<milestone n="9C" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>But against you, O king, who shall make war? You will bring the multitudes of <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)">Asia</name>, and all your ships. I think there is not so much boldness in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> as that; but if time should show me wrong in my judgment, and those men prove foolhardy enough to do battle with us, they would be taught that we are the greatest warriors on earth. Let us leave nothing untried; for nothing happens by itself, and all men's gains are the fruit of adventure.&rdquo;

<milestone unit="para"/>Thus <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> smoothed <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>' resolution and stopped.

<milestone n="10A" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;O king, if opposite opinions are not uttered, it is impossible for someone to choose the better; the one which has been spoken must be followed. If they are spoken, the better can be found; just as the purity of gold cannot be determined by itself, but when gold is compared with gold by rubbing,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">i.e. rubbing against the touchstone, which would be stained by pure gold.</note> we then determine the better.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now I advised <name type="pers">Darius</name>, your father and my brother, not to lead his army against the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>, who have no cities anywhere to dwell in. But he hoped to subdue the nomadic <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> and would not obey me; he went on the expedition and returned after losing many gallant men from his army.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>You, O king, are proposing to lead your armies against far better men than the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>&mdash;men who are said to be excellent warriors by sea and land. It is right that I should show you what danger there is in this.

<milestone n="10B" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>You say that you will bridge the <name key="tgn,7002638" type="place" reg="Canakkale Bogazi (strait), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia ">Hellespont</name> and march your army through <name key="tgn,1000003" type="place" reg="Europe (continent)">Europe</name> to <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>. Now suppose you happen to be defeated either by land or by sea, or even both; the men are said to be valiant, and we may well guess that it is so, since the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> alone destroyed the great army that followed <name type="pers">Datis</name> and <name type="pers">Artaphrenes</name> to <name key="tgn,7002681" type="place" reg="Attica [23.5,38.83] (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Attica</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Suppose they do not succeed in both ways; but if they attack with their ships and prevail in a sea-fight, and then sail to the <name key="tgn,7002638" type="place" reg="Canakkale Bogazi (strait), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia ">Hellespont</name> and destroy your bridge, that, O king, is the hour of peril.

<milestone n="10C" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>It is from no wisdom of my own that I thus conjecture; it is because I know what disaster once almost overtook us, when your father, making a highway over the <name key="tgn,1115068" type="place" reg="Karadeniz Bogazi (strait), Istanbul, Marmara, Turkey, Asia">Thracian Bosporus</name> and bridging the river <name type="place">Ister</name>, crossed over to attack the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>.

Yet it is dreadful even in the telling, that one man should hold in his hand all the king's fortunes.

<milestone n="10D" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>So do not plan to run the risk of any such danger when there is no need for it. Listen to me instead: for now dismiss this assembly; consider the matter by yourself and, whenever you so please, declare what seems best to you.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>A well-laid plan is always to my mind most profitable; even if it is thwarted later, the plan was no less good, and it is only chance that has baffled the design; but if fortune favor one who has planned poorly, then he has gotten only a prize of chance, and his plan was no less bad.

<milestone n="10E" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>You see how the god smites with his thunderbolt creatures of greatness and does not suffer them to display their pride, while little ones do not move him to anger; and you see how it is always on the tallest buildings and trees that his bolts fall; for the god loves to bring low all things of surpassing greatness. Thus a large army is destroyed by a smaller, when the jealous god sends panic or the thunderbolt among them, and they perish unworthily; for the god suffers pride in none but himself.

<milestone n="10F" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>Now haste is always the parent of failure, and great damages are likely to arise; but in waiting there is good, and in time this becomes clear, even though it does not seem so in the present.

<milestone n="10G" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>This, O king, is my advice to you. But you, <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> son of <name type="pers">Gobryas</name>, cease your foolish words about the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, for they do not deserve to be maligned. By slandering the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> you incite the king to send this expedition; that is the end to which you press with all eagerness. Let it not be so.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Slander is a terrible business; there are two in it who do wrong and one who suffers wrong. The slanderer wrongs another by accusing an absent man, and the other does wrong in that he is persuaded before he has learned the whole truth; the absent man does not hear what is said of him and suffers wrong in the matter, being maligned by the one and condemned by the other.

<milestone n="10H" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>If an army must by all means be sent against these <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, hear me now: let the king himself remain in the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> land, and let us two stake our children's lives upon it; you lead out the army, choosing whatever men you wish and taking as great an army as you desire.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>If the king's fortunes fare as you say, let my sons be slain, and myself with them; but if it turns out as I foretell, let your sons be so treated, and you likewise, if you return.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But if you are unwilling to submit to this and will at all hazards lead your army overseas to <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>, then I think that those left behind in this place will hear that <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> has done great harm to <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia">Persia</name>, and has been torn apart by dogs and birds in the land of <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)">Athens</name> or of <name key="tgn,7011065" type="place" reg="Sparta [22.416,37.83] (inhabited place), Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece, Europe ">Lacedaemon</name>, if not even before that on the way there; and that you have learned what kind of men you persuade the king to attack.&rdquo;

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>It is not possible for either of us to turn back: to do or to suffer is our task, so that what is ours be under the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, or what is theirs under the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>; there is no middle way in our quarrel.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Honor then demands that we avenge ourselves for what has been done to us; thus will I learn what is this evil that will befall me when I march against these <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>&mdash;men that even <name type="pers">Pelops</name> the <name type="ethnic">Phrygian</name>, the slave of my forefathers, did so utterly subdue that to this day they and their country are called by the name of their conqueror.&rdquo;

<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The discussion went that far; then night came, and <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> was pricked by the advice of <name type="pers">Artabanus</name>. Thinking it over at night, he saw clearly that to send an army against <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> was not his affair. He made this second resolve and fell asleep; then (so the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> say) in the night he saw this vision: It seemed to <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> that a tall and handsome man stood over him and said,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
 &ldquo;Are you then changing your mind, <name type="ethnic">Persian</name>, and will not lead the expedition against <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>, although you have proclaimed the mustering of the army? It is not good for you to change your mind, and there will be no one here to pardon you for it; let your course be along the path you resolved upon yesterday.&rdquo;

<milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So the vision spoke, and seemed to <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> to vanish away. When day dawned, the king took no account of this dream, and he assembled the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> whom he had before gathered together and addressed them thus:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;<name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, forgive me for turning and twisting in my purpose; I am not yet come to the fullness of my wisdom, and I am never free from people who exhort me to do as I said. It is true that when I heard <name type="pers">Artabanus</name>' opinion my youthful spirit immediately boiled up, and I burst out with an unseemly and wrongful answer to one older than myself; but now I see my fault and will follow his judgment.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Be at peace, since I have changed my mind about marching against <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>.&rdquo;

<milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> heard that, they rejoiced and made obeisance to him. But when night came on, the same vision stood again over <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> as he slept, and said, &ldquo;Son of <name type="pers">Darius</name>, have you then plainly renounced your army's march among the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and made my words of no account, as though you had not heard them? Know for certain that, if you do not lead out your army immediately, this will be the outcome of it: as you became great and mighty in a short time, so in a moment will you be brought low again.&rdquo;

<milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Greatly frightened by the vision, <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> leapt up from his bed, and sent a messenger to summon <name type="pers">Artabanus</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Yet, though I desire to, I cannot do it; ever since I turned back and repented, a vision keeps coming to haunt my sight, and it will not allow me to do as you advise; just now it has threatened me and gone.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now if a god is sending the vision, and it is his full pleasure that there this expedition against <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> take place, that same dream will hover about you and give you the same command it gives me.

<milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Xerxes</name> said this, but <name type="pers">Artabanus</name> would not obey the first command, thinking it was not right for him to sit on the royal throne; at last he was compelled and did as he was bid, saying first:

<milestone n="16A" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;O king, I judge it of equal worth whether a man is wise or is willing to obey good advice; to both of these you have attained, but the company of bad men trips you up; just as they say that sea, of all things the most serviceable to men, is hindered from following its nature by the blasts of winds that fall upon it.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It was not that I heard harsh words from you that stung me so much as that, when two opinions were laid before the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, one tending to the increase of pride, the other to its abatement, showing how evil a thing it is to teach the heart continual desire of more than it has, of these two opinions you preferred that one which was more fraught with danger to yourself and to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>.

<milestone n="16B" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>Now when you have turned to the better opinion, you say that, while intending to abandon the expedition against the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, you are haunted by a dream sent by some god, which forbids you to disband the expedition.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But this is none of heaven's working, my son. The roving dreams that visit men are of such nature as I shall teach you, since I am many years older than you. Those visions that rove about us in dreams are for the most part the thoughts of the day; and in these recent days we have been very busy with this expedition.

<milestone n="16C" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>But if this is not as I determine and it has something divine to it, then you have spoken the conclusion of the matter; let it appear to me just as it has to you, and utter its command. If it really wishes to appear, it should do so to me no more by virtue of my wearing your dress instead of mine, and my sleeping in your bed rather than in my own.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Whatever it is that appears to you in your sleep, surely it has not come to such folly as to infer from your dress that I am you when it sees me. We now must learn if it will take no account of me and not deign to appear and haunt me, whether I am wearing your robes or my own, but will come to you; if it comes continually, I myself would say that it is something divine.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>If you are determined that this must be done and there is no averting it, and I must lie down to sleep in your bed, so be it; this duty I will fulfill, and let the vision appear also to me. But until then I will keep my present opinion.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Are you the one who dissuades <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> from marching against <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>, because you care for him?

<milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>With this threat (so it seemed to <name type="pers">Artabanus</name>) the vision was about to burn his eyes with hot irons. He leapt up with a loud cry, then sat by <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> and told him the whole story of what he had seen in his dream, and next he said:
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;O King, since I have seen, as much as a man may, how the greater has often been brought low by the lesser, I forbade you to always give rein to your youthful spirit, knowing how evil a thing it is to have many desires, and remembering the end of <name type="pers">Cyrus</name>' expedition against the <name type="ethnic">Massagetae</name> and of <name type="pers">Cambyses</name>' against the <name type="ethnic">Ethiopians</name>, and I myself marched with <name type="pers">Darius</name> against the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Knowing this, I judged that you had only to remain in peace for all men to deem you fortunate. But since there is some divine motivation, and it seems that the gods mark <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> for destruction, I myself change and correct my judgment. Now declare the gods' message to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and bid them obey your first command for all due preparation. Do this, so that nothing on your part be lacking to the fulfillment of the gods' commission.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>After this was said, they were incited by the vision, and when daylight came <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> imparted all this to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>. <name type="pers">Artabanus</name> now openly encouraged that course which he alone had before openly discouraged.

<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Xerxes</name> was now intent on the expedition and then saw a third vision in his sleep, which the <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> interpreted to refer to the whole earth and to signify that all men should be his slaves.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Magi</name> interpreted it in this way, and immediately every single man of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> who had been assembled rode away to his own province and there used all zeal to fulfill the kings command, each desiring to receive the promised gifts.

<milestone unit="para"/>So this was done by those who were appointed to the thankless honor, and new engineers set about making the bridges. They made the bridges as follows: in order to lighten the strain of the cables, they placed fifty-oared ships and triremes alongside each other, three hundred and sixty to bear the bridge nearest the <name key="tgn,7016619" type="place" reg="Black Sea [38,42] (sea)">Euxine sea</name>, and three hundred and fourteen to bear the other; all lay obliquely to the line of the <name key="tgn,7016619" type="place" reg="Black Sea [38,42] (sea)">Pontus</name> and parallel with the current of the <name key="tgn,7002638" type="place" reg="Canakkale Bogazi (strait), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia ">Hellespont</name>.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Or it may mean, as <name type="pers">Stein</name> thinks, that the ships of the upper or N.E. bridge were <foreign lang="greek">e)pikarsi/ai</foreign>, and those of the lower or S.W. one were <foreign lang="greek">kata\ r(o/on</foreign>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>After putting the ships together they let down very great anchors, both from the end of the ships on the <name key="tgn,7016619" type="place" reg="Black Sea [38,42] (sea)">Pontus</name> side to hold fast against the winds blowing from within that sea, and from the other end, towards the west and the <name key="tgn,7002675" type="place" reg="Aegean Sea [25,38.5] (sea)">Aegean</name>, to hold against the west and south winds.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>After doing this, they stretched the cables from the land, twisting them taut with wooden windlasses; they did not as before keep the two kinds apart, but assigned for each bridge two cables of flax and four of papyrus.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>All these had the same thickness and fine appearance, but the flaxen were heavier in proportion, for a cubit of them weighed a talent.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">About 80 lbs.</note>
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>When the strait was thus bridged, they sawed logs of wood to a length equal to the breadth of the floating supports,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">i.e. the line of ships supporting the cables.</note> and laid them in order on the taut cables; after placing them together they then made them fast. After doing this, they carried brushwood onto the bridge; when this was all laid in order they heaped earth on it and stamped it down; then they made a fence on either side, so that the beasts of burden and horses not be frightened by the sight of the sea below them.

<name type="pers">Xerxes</name> supposed that <name type="pers">Pythius</name> would demand anything rather than what he did ask and answered that he would grant the request, bidding him declare what he desired.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>With that reply, he immediately ordered those who were assigned to do these things to find the eldest of <name type="pers">Pythius</name> sons and cut him in half, then to set one half of his body on the right side of the road and the other on the left, so that the army would pass between them.

<milestone unit="para"/>This they did, and the army passed between.

Misfortunes fall upon us and sicknesses trouble us, so that they make life, though short, seem long.

<name type="pers">Artabanus</name> answered and said, &ldquo;O king, may the vision that appeared in my dream bring such an end as we both desire!

These two are the land and the sea.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The sea has nowhere any harbor, as I conjecture, that will be able to receive this navy and save your ships if a storm arise. Yet there has to be not just one such harbor, but many of them all along the land you are sailing by.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Since there are no harbors able to receive you, understand that men are the subjects and not the rulers of their accidents. I have spoken of one of the two, and now I will tell you of the other.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The land is your enemy in this way: if nothing is going to stand in your way and hinder you, the land becomes more your enemy the further you advance, constantly unaware of what lies beyond; no man is ever satisfied with success.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>So I say that if no one opposes you, the increase of your territory and the time passed in getting it will breed famine. The best man is one who is timid while making plans because he takes into account all that may happen to him, but is bold in action.&rdquo;

<milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Xerxes</name> answered, &ldquo;<name type="pers">Artabanus</name>, you define these matters reasonably. But do not fear everything, nor take account of all alike; If you wanted to take everything equally into account on every occasion that happens, you would never do anything; it is better to do everything boldly and suffer half of what you dread than to fear all chances and so never suffer anything.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But if you quarrel with whatever is said yet cannot put forth a secure position, you must be proved as wrong on your part as he who holds the contrary opinion. In this both are alike: how can someone who is only human know where there is security? I think it is impossible. Those who have the will to act most often win the rewards, not those who hesitate and take account of all chances.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>You see what power <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia">Persia</name> has attained. Now if those kings who came before me had held such opinions as yours, or if they had not held them but had had advisers like you, you would never have seen our fortunes at their present height; but as it is those kings ran the risks and advanced them to this height.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Great successes are not won except by great risks.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>If they deal very unjustly they bring us no great advantage, but by dealing very justly they may well do great harm to your army. Take to heart the truth of that ancient saying, that the end of every matter is not revealed at its beginning.&rdquo;

<milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Xerxes</name> answered, &ldquo;<name type="pers">Artabanus</name>, in all your pronouncements you are most mistaken when you fear that the <name type="ethnic">Ionians</name> might change sides; we have the surest guarantee for them, and you and all who marched with <name type="pers">Darius</name> against the <name type="ethnic">Scythians</name> can bear witness.

<milestone unit="para"/><name type="pers">Demaratus</name> heard this and said, &ldquo;O King, since you bid me by all means to speak the whole truth, and to say what you will not later prove to be false, in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> poverty is always endemic, but courage is acquired as the fruit of wisdom and strong law; by use of this courage <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> defends herself from poverty and tyranny.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now I praise all the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> who dwell in those <name type="pers">Dorian</name> lands, yet I am not going to speak these words about all of them, but only about the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>.

<milestone n="103" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When he heard this, <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> smiled and said, &ldquo;What a strange thing to say, <name type="pers">Demaratus</name>, that a thousand men would fight with so great an army! Come now, tell me this: you say that you were king of these men. Are you willing right now to fight with ten men? Yet if your state is entirely as you define it,<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">This no doubt alludes to the double portion given to a <name type="ethnic">Spartan</name> king at feasts; cp. <bibl n="Hdt. 6.57">Hdt. 6.57</bibl>.</note> you as their king should by right encounter twice as many according to your laws.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>If each of them is a match for ten men of my army, then it is plain to me that you must be a match for twenty; in this way you would prove that what you say is true. But if you <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> who so exalt yourselves are just like you and the others who come to speak with me, and are also the same size, then beware lest the words you have spoken be only idle boasting.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Let us look at it with all reasonableness: how could a thousand, or ten thousand, or even fifty thousand men, if they are all equally free and not under the rule of one man, withstand so great an army as mine? If you <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> are five thousand, we still would be more than a thousand to one.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>If they were under the rule of one man according to our custom, they might out of fear of him become better than they naturally are, and under compulsion of the lash they might go against greater numbers of inferior men; but if they are allowed to go free they would do neither. I myself think that even if they were equal in numbers it would be hard for the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> to fight just against the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>What you are talking about is found among us alone, and even then it is not common but rare; there are some among my <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> spearmen who will gladly fight with three <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> at once.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>You yourself best know what love I bear them: they have robbed me of my office and the privileges of my house, and made me a cityless exile; your father received me and gave me a house and the means to live on. It is not reasonable for a sensible man to reject goodwill when it appears; rather he will hold it in great affection.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>I myself do not promise that I can fight with ten men or with two, and I would not even willingly fight with one; yet if it were necessary, or if some great contest spurred me, I would most gladly fight with one of those men who claim to be each a match for three <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>So is it with the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>; fighting singly they are as brave as any man living, and together they are the best warriors on earth.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>They do whatever it bids; and its bidding is always the same, that they must never flee from the battle before any multitude of men, but must abide at their post and there conquer or die.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>These verses confounded the opinion of those who said that their ships were the wooden wall, for the readers of oracles took the verses to mean that they should offer battle by sea near <name key="tgn,7011052" type="place" reg="Salamis (island), Attica, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Salamis</name> and be there overthrown.

<milestone n="143" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now there was a certain <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name>, by name and title <name type="pers">Themistocles</name> son of <name type="pers">Neocles</name>, who had lately risen to be among their chief men.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Correctly understood, the gods' oracle was spoken not of the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> but of their enemies, and his advice was that they should believe their ships to be the wooden wall and so make ready to fight by sea.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When <name type="pers">Themistocles</name> put forward this interpretation, the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> judged him to be a better counsellor than the readers of oracles, who would have had them prepare for no sea fight, and, in short, offer no resistance at all, but leave <name key="tgn,7002681" type="place" reg="Attica [23.5,38.83] (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Attica</name> and settle in some other country.

<milestone n="149" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This, they say, was the answer of their council, although the oracle forbade them to make the alliance with the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>; furthermore, they, despite their fear of the oracle, were eager to secure a thirty years treaty so that their children might have time in those years to grow to be men.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Then those of the envoys who were <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> replied to the demands of the council, saying that they would refer the question of the truce to their own government at home; as for the command, however, they themselves had been commissioned to say that the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> had two kings, and the <name type="ethnic">Argives</name> but one.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>At that, say the <name type="ethnic">Argives</name>, they decided that the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name>' covetousness was past all bearing and that it was better to be ruled by the foreigners than give way to the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>.

<milestone unit="para"/>This is how the campaign in <name key="tgn,7003122" type="place" reg="Sicily [14,37.5] (region), Italy, Europe ">Sicily</name> fell out.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now this answer seemed fair enough, but when the time came for sending help, their minds changed.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Their course of action, therefore, had been planned with a view to being able to say to the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name>, &ldquo;O king, we whose power is as great as any and who could have furnished as many ships as any state save <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)">Athens</name>,&mdash;we, when the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> attempted to gain our aid in this war, would not resist you nor do anything displeasing to you.&rdquo; This plea, they hoped, would win them some advantage more than ordinary; and so, I believe, it would have been.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> bore down upon the <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name> and attacked.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> fought memorably, showing themselves skilled fighters amidst unskilled on many occasions, as when they would turn their backs and feign flight.

<milestone unit="para"/>It is said that during these assaults in the battle the king, as he watched, jumped up three times from the throne in fear for his army.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
 In this part of the mountain one thousand armed men of the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> were on watch, as I have already shown, defending their own country and guarding the path. The lower pass was held by those I have mentioned, but the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> had voluntarily promised <name type="pers">Leonidas</name> to guard the path over the mountain.

<milestone n="218" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> learned in the following way that the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> had climbed up: they had ascended without the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name>' notice because the mountain was entirely covered with oak trees. Although there was no wind, a great noise arose like leaves being trodden underfoot. The <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> jumped up and began to put on their weapons, and in a moment the barbarians were there.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>When they saw the men arming themselves, they were amazed, for they had supposed that no opposition would appear, but they had now met with an army. <name type="pers">Hydarnes</name> feared that the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> might be <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> and asked <name type="pers">Epialtes</name> what country the army was from.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name>, assailed by thick showers of arrows and supposing that the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> had set out against them from the start, fled to the top of the mountain and prepared to meet their destruction.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name> then took counsel, but their opinions were divided. Some advised not to leave their post, but others spoke against them.

<milestone n="220" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>It is said that <name type="pers">Leonidas</name> himself sent them away because he was concerned that they would be killed, but felt it not fitting for himself and the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> to desert that post which they had come to defend at the beginning.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>I, however, tend to believe that when <name type="pers">Leonidas</name> perceived that the allies were dispirited and unwilling to run all risks with him, he told then to depart. For himself, however, it was not good to leave; if he remained, he would leave a name of great fame, and the prosperity of <name key="perseus,Sparta" type="place" reg="Sparta [22.4417,37.0667] (Perseus) ">Sparta</name> would not be blotted out.

<milestone n="221" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Not the least proof I have of this is the fact that <name type="pers">Leonidas</name> publicly dismissed the seer who attended the expedition, for fear that he might die with them.

<name type="pers">Xerxes</name> and his barbarians attacked, but <name type="pers">Leonidas</name> and his <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name>, knowing they were going to their deaths, advanced now much farther than before into the wider part of the pass.

<milestone unit="para"/>Next spoke <name type="pers">Achaemenes</name>, <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>' brother and admiral of the fleet; it chanced that he was present during their conversation, and he feared that <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> would be persuaded to follow <name type="pers">Demaratus</name>' counsel. &ldquo;O king,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I see that you are listening to a man who is jealous of your good fortune or is perhaps even a traitor to your cause.

for assuredly I will never believe that he is no friend to my cause.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The purpose of their parting from the rest of the army and marching this way was that they might plunder the temple at <name key="perseus,Delphi" type="place" reg="Delphi [22.5167,38.4917] (Perseus) ">Delphi</name> and lay its wealth before <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>, who (as I have been told) had better knowledge of the most notable possessions in the temple than of what he had left in his own palace, chiefly the offerings of <name type="pers">Croesus</name> son of <name type="pers">Alyattes</name>; so many had always spoken of them.

<milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Delphians</name> learned all this, they were very much afraid, and in their great fear they inquired of the oracle whether they should bury the sacred treasure in the ground or take it away to another country. The god told them to move nothing, saying that he was able to protect what belonged to him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Upon hearing that, the <name type="ethnic">Delphians</name> took thought for themselves. They sent their children and women overseas to <name key="tgn,7002733" type="place" reg=" +Achaea [21.75,38.25] (department), Peloponnese, Greece, Europe ">Achaia</name>.

<milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now when the barbarians drew near and could see the temple, the prophet, whose name was <name type="pers">Aceratus</name>, saw certain sacred arms, which no man might touch without sacrilege, brought out of the chamber within and laid before the shrine.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>So he went to tell the <name type="ethnic">Delphians</name> of this miracle, but when the barbarians came with all speed near to the temple of <name type="pers">Athena Pronaea</name>, they were visited by miracles yet greater than the aforesaid. Marvellous indeed it is, that weapons of war should of their own motion appear lying outside in front of the shrine, but the visitation which followed was more wondrous than anything else ever seen.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When the barbarians were near to the temple of <name type="pers">Athena Pronaea</name>, they were struck by thunderbolts from the sky, and two peaks broken off from <name key="tgn,7011022" type="place" reg=" +Parnassus (mountain), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Parnassus</name> came rushing among them with a mighty noise and overwhelmed many of them.

<milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>All of this together struck panic into the barbarians, and the <name type="ethnic">Delphians</name>, perceiving that they fled, descended upon them and killed a great number.

&ldquo;If they depart from <name key="tgn,7011052" type="place" reg=" Salamis (island), Attica, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Salamis</name>, you will no longer be fighting for one country.

<milestone n="60A" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;It is in your hands to save <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>, if you will obey me and remain here to fight, and not obey the words of these others and move your ships back to the Isthmus. Compare each plan after you have heard. If you join battle at the Isthmus, you will fight in the open sea where it is least to our advantage, since our ships are heavier and fewer in number. You will also lose <name key="tgn,7011052" type="place" reg=" Salamis (island), Attica, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Salamis</name> and <name key="perseus,Megara" type="place" reg=" +Megara [23.35,38] (Perseus) ">Megara</name> and <name key="tgn,7011087" type="place" reg=" +Aegina [23.433,37.75] (inhabited place), Aegina, Attica, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Aegina</name>, even if we succeed in all else.

<milestone n="60B" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>But if you do what I say, you will find it useful in these ways: first, by engaging many ships with our few in the strait, we shall win a great victory, if the war turns out reasonably, for it is to our advantage to fight in a strait and to their advantage to fight in a wide area. Second, <name key="tgn,7011052" type="place" reg=" Salamis (island), Attica, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Salamis</name> will survive, where we have carried our children and women to safety. It also has in it something you are very fond of: by remaining here you will be fighting for the <name key="tgn,7017076" type="place" reg=" +Peloponnese [22,37.5] (region), Greece, Europe ">Peloponnese</name> just as much as at the Isthmus, and you will not lead them to the <name key="tgn,7017076" type="place" reg=" +Peloponnese [22,37.5] (region), Greece, Europe ">Peloponnese</name>, if you exercise good judgment.

<milestone n="60C" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>If what I expect happens and we win the victory with our ships, you will not have the barbarians upon you at the Isthmus.

<milestone unit="para"/>As <name type="pers">Themistocles</name> said this, <name type="pers">Adeimantus</name> the <name type="ethnic">Corinthian</name> attacked him again, advising that a man without a city should keep quiet and that <name type="pers">Eurybiades</name> should not ask the vote of a man without a city.

 This time <name type="pers">Themistocles</name> said many things against him and the <name type="ethnic">Corinthians</name>, declaring that so long as they had two hundred manned ships, the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> had both a city and a land greater than theirs, and that none of the <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name> could repel them if they attacked.

<milestone n="62" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Themistocles</name> said this, <name type="pers">Eurybiades</name> changed his mind.

<milestone unit="para"/>I cannot say exactly how each of the other barbarians or <name type="ethnic">Hellenes</name> fought, but this is what happened to <name type="pers">Artemisia</name>, and it gave her still higher esteem with the king:

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>But when she rammed and sank it, she had the luck of gaining two advantages.

but many of the barbarians drowned in the sea since they did not know how to swim.

&ldquo;Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed because of what has befallen us.

<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Therefore, since the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army.

<milestone unit="para"/>It was for giving this answer and refusing to give what was asked of them that they were besieged.

but they took no account of that; they had always wanted to see the war, and they followed the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>' march. For this reason, when all the six of them returned back scatheless, their father tore out their eyes.

<milestone n="117" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This was their reward.

<milestone n="118" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In the course of this voyage he was caught by a strong wind called the <name type="ethnic">Strymonian</name>, which lifted up the waves. This storm bearing the harder upon him by reason of the heavy load of the ship (for the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> of his company who were on the deck were so many), the king grew afraid and cried to the ship's pilot asking him if there were any way of deliverance. To this the man said,
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;Sire, there is none, if we do not rid ourselves of these many who are on board.&rdquo; Hearing that, it is said, <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> said to the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, &ldquo;Now it is for you to prove your concern for your king, for it seems that my deliverance rests with you.&rdquo;
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>At this they bowed and leapt into the sea.

<milestone unit="para"/>This is the other tale of <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>' return; but I for my part believe neither the story of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>' fate nor any other part of it.

No, the truth is that <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> did as I have already said, and returned to <name key="tgn,1000004" type="place" reg="Asia (continent)">Asia</name> with his army by road.

<milestone n="120" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

They had heard that the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> would send their envoys with all speed.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>That would be unjust and dishonorable for any <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>, but for you most of all, on many counts; it was you who stirred up this war, by no desire of ours, and your territory was first the stake of that battle in which all <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> is now engaged.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Apart from that, it is unbearable that not all this alone but slavery too should be brought upon the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> by you <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, who have always been known as givers of freedom to many.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>In requital for this the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> and their allies declare that they will nourish your women and all of your household members who are unserviceable for war, so long as this war will last.

for as he is a tyrant so must he be the tyrant's fellow-worker; it is not your business, if you are men rightly minded, for you know that in foreigners there is no faith nor truth.&rdquo; These are the words of the envoys.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now carry this answer back to <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> from the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, that as long as the sun holds the course by which he now goes, we will make no agreement with <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Come no more to <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> with such a plea, nor under the semblance of rendering us a service, counsel us to act wickedly.

<milestone n="144" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For there are many great reasons why we should not do this, even if we so desired; first and foremost, the burning and destruction of the adornments and temples of our gods, whom we are constrained to avenge to the utmost rather than make pacts with the perpetrator of these things, and next the kinship of all <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> in blood and speech, and the shrines of gods and the sacrifices that we have in common, and the likeness of our way of life, to all of which it would not befit the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> to be false.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Know this now, if you knew it not before, that as long as one <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> is left alive we will make no agreement with <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>.

When <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> heard that, he no longer desired to remain in <name key="tgn,7002681" type="place" reg="Attica [23.5,38.83] (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Attica</name>. Before he had word of it, he had held his land, desiring to know the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>' plan and what they would do; he neither harmed nor harried the land of <name key="tgn,7002681" type="place" reg="Attica [23.5,38.83] (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Attica</name>, for he still supposed that they would make terms with him.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But when he could not prevail upon them and learned the truth of the matter, he withdrew before <name type="pers">Pausanias</name>' army prior to its entering the Isthmus. First, however, he burnt <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)">Athens</name>, and utterly overthrew and demolished whatever wall or house or temple was left standing.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>The reason for his marching away was that <name key="tgn,7002681" type="place" reg="Attica [23.5,38.83] (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Attica</name> was not a land fit for horses, and if he should be defeated in a battle, there was no way of retreat save one so narrow that a few men could prevent his passage.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">He would have to retreat into <name key="tgn,7002683" type="place" reg="Boeotia (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Boeotia</name> by way of the pass over <name type="place">Cithaeron</name>.</note> He therefore planned to retreat to <name key="perseus,Thebes" type="place" reg="Thebes [23.3333,38.325] (Perseus) ">Thebes</name> and do battle where he had a friendly city at his back and ground suitable for horsemen.

<milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> drew his men off, and when he had now set forth on his road there came a message that in addition to the others, an advance guard of a thousand <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> had arrived at <name key="perseus,Megara" type="place" reg=" +Megara [23.35,38] (Perseus) ">Megara</name>.

<milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Presently there came a message to <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> that the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> were gathered together on the Isthmus.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Here he camped for the night, and on the next day he turned from there to <name type="place">Scolus</name>, where he was in <name type="ethnic">Theban</name> territory. There he laid waste the lands of the <name type="ethnic">Thebans</name>, though they sided with the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> part. This he did, not for any ill-will that he bore them, but because sheer necessity drove him to make a stronghold for his army and to have this for a refuge if the fortune of battle were other than he wished.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>His army, stationed along the <name type="place">Asopus river</name>, covered the ground from <name type="place">Erythrae</name> past <name type="place">Hysiae</name> and up to the lands of <name key="perseus,Plataea" type="place" reg="Plataea [23.2667,38.2] (Perseus) ">Plataea</name>. I do not mean to say that the walled camp which he made was of this size; each side of it was of a length of about ten furlongs.

<milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>While the barbarians were engaged in this task, <name type="pers">Attaginus</name> son of <name type="pers">Phrynon</name>, a <name type="ethnic">Theban</name>, made great preparations and invited <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> with fifty who were the most notable of the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> to be his guests at a banquet. They came as they were bidden; the dinner was held at <name key="perseus,Thebes" type="place" reg="Thebes [23.3333,38.325] (Perseus) ">Thebes</name>. What follows was told me by <name type="pers">Thersander</name> of <name key="tgn,7011030" type="place" reg="Orkhomenos (deserted settlement), Boeotia, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Orchomenus</name>, one of the most notable men of that place. <name type="pers">Thersander</name> too (he said) was invited to this dinner, and fifty <name type="ethnic">Thebans</name> in addition. <name type="pers">Attaginus</name> made them sit, not each man by himself but on each couch a <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> and a <name type="ethnic">Theban</name> together.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now as they were drinking together after dinner, the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> who sat with him asked <name type="pers">Thersander</name> in the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> tongue from what country he was. <name type="pers">Thersander</name> answered that he was from <name key="tgn,7011030" type="place" reg="Orkhomenos (deserted settlement), Boeotia, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Orchomenus</name>. Then said the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name>: &ldquo;Since you have eaten at the board with me and drunk with me afterwards, I would like to leave a memorial of my belief, so that you yourself may have such knowledge as to take fitting counsel for your safety.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Do you see these <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> at the banquet and that host which we left encamped by the river side? In a little while you shall see but a small remnant left alive of all these.&rdquo; As he said this, the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> wept bitterly.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Marvelling at these words, <name type="pers">Thersander</name> answered: &ldquo;Must you not then tell this to <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> and those honorable <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> who are with him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name>, &ldquo;that which a god wills to send no man can turn aside, for even truth sometimes finds no one to believe it.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>What I have said is known to many of us <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, but we follow, in the bonds of necessity. It is the most hateful thing for a person to have much knowledge and no power.&rdquo; This tale I heard from <name type="pers">Thersander</name> of <name key="tgn,7011030" type="place" reg="Orkhomenos (deserted settlement), Boeotia, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Orchomenus</name> who told me in addition that he had straightway told this to others before the battle of <name key="perseus,Plataea" type="place" reg="Plataea [23.2667,38.2] (Perseus) ">Plataea</name>.

<milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> was making his encampment in <name key="tgn,7002683" type="place" reg="Boeotia (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Boeotia</name>. All the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> of that region who sided with the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> furnished fighting men, and they joined with him in his attack upon <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)">Athens</name>, with the exception of the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name>; as for taking the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> side, that they did right away, though from necessity rather than willingly.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>A few days after the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>' coming to <name key="perseus,Thebes" type="place" reg="Thebes [23.3333,38.325] (Perseus) ">Thebes</name>, a thousand <name type="ethnic">Phocian</name> men-at-arms under the leadership of <name type="pers">Harmocydes</name>, the most notable of their countrymen, arrived. When these men too were in <name key="perseus,Thebes" type="place" reg="Thebes [23.3333,38.325] (Perseus) ">Thebes</name>, <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> sent horsemen and bade the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> take their station on the plain by themselves.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When they had done so, the whole of the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> cavalry appeared, and presently word was spread through all of the <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> army which was with <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>, and likewise among the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> themselves, that <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> would shoot them to death with javelins.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Then their general <name type="pers">Harmocydes</name> exhorted them: &ldquo;Men of <name key="tgn,4003963" type="place" reg=" +Phocis (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Phocis</name>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;seeing that death at these fellows' hands is staring us in the face (we being, as I surmise, maligned by the <name type="ethnic">Thessalians</name>), it is now time for every one of you to be noble; for it is better to end our lives in action and fighting than tamely to suffer a shameful death. No, rather we will teach them that they whose slaying they have devised are men of <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>.&rdquo; Thus he exhorted them.

<milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>But when the horsemen had encircled the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name>, they rode at them as if to slay them, and drew their bows to shoot; it is likely too that some did in fact shoot. The <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name> opposed them in every possible way, drawing in together and closing their ranks to the best of their power. At this the horsemen wheeled about and rode back and away.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Now I cannot with exactness say whether they came at the <name type="ethnic">Thessalians</name>' desire to slay the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name>, but when they saw the men preparing to defend themselves, they feared lest they themselves should suffer some hurt, and so rode away (for such was <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>' command),&mdash;or if <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> wanted to test the <name type="ethnic">Phocians</name>' mettle.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When the horsemen had ridden away, <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> sent a herald, with this message: &ldquo;Men of <name key="tgn,4003963" type="place" reg=" +Phocis (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Phocis</name>, be of good courage, for you have shown yourselves to be valiant men, and not as it was reported to me.

<milestone n="19" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>As for the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>, when they had come to the Isthmus, they encamped there. When the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Peloponnesians</name> who chose the better cause heard that, seeing the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> setting forth to war, they thought that they should not lag behind the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> in so doing.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Accordingly, they all marched from the Isthmus (the omens of sacrifice being favorable) and came to <name key="perseus,Eleusis" type="place" reg=" +Eleusis [23.5583,38.0417] (Perseus) ">Eleusis</name>. When they had offered sacrifice there also and the omens were favorable, they continued their march, having now the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> with them, who had crossed over from <name key="tgn,7011052" type="place" reg=" Salamis (island), Attica, Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe">Salamis</name> and joined with them at <name key="perseus,Eleusis" type="place" reg=" +Eleusis [23.5583,38.0417] (Perseus) ">Eleusis</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>When they came (as it is said) to <name type="place">Erythrae</name> in <name key="tgn,7002683" type="place" reg="Boeotia (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Boeotia</name>, they learned that the barbarians were encamped by the <name type="place">Asopus</name>. Taking note of that, they arrayed themselves opposite the enemy on the lower hills of <name type="place">Cithaeron</name>.

<milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> did not come down into the plain, <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> sent against them his entire cavalry, whose commander was <name type="pers">Masistius</name> (whom the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> call <name type="pers">Macistius</name>), a man much honored among the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>; he rode a <name type="ethnic">Nesaean</name> horse which had a golden bit and was elaborately adorned all over. Thereupon the horsemen rode up to the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> and charged them by squadrons; as they attacked, they did them much hurt, and called them women all the while.

<milestone n="21" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now it chanced that the <name type="ethnic">Megarians</name> were posted in that part of the field which was most open to attack, and here the horsemen found the readiest approach. Therefore, being hard-pressed by the charges, the <name type="ethnic">Megarians</name> sent a herald to the generals of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, who came to them and spoke as follows :
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
&ldquo;From the men of <name key="perseus,Megara" type="place" reg=" +Megara [23.35,38] (Perseus) ">Megara</name> to their allies: we cannot alone withstand the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> cavalry (although we have till now held our ground with patience and valor, despite the fact that we were hard-pressed) in the position to which we were first appointed. Know that now we will abandon our post, unless you send others to take our place there.&rdquo;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This the herald reported, and <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> inquired among the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> if any would offer to go to that place and relieve the <name type="ethnic">Megarians</name> by holding the post. All the others did not want to, but the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> took it upon themselves, that is three hundred picked men of <name key="perseus,Athens" type="place" reg="Athens [23.7333,37.9667] (Perseus)">Athens</name>, whose captain was <name type="pers">Olympiodorus</name> son of <name type="pers">Lampon</name>.

<milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Those who volunteered themselves, were posted at <name type="place">Erythrae</name> in front of the whole <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> army, and they took with them the archers also. They fought for a long time and the end of the battle was as I will now tell. The cavalry charged by squadrons, and <name type="pers">Masistius</name>' horse, being at the head of the rest, was struck in the side by an arrow. Rearing up in pain, it threw <name type="pers">Masistius</name>,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
who when he fell, was straightaway set upon by the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>. His horse they took then and there, and he himself was killed fighting. They could not, however, kill him at first, for he was outfitted in the following manner: he wore a purple tunic over a cuirass of golden scales which was within it; thus they accomplished nothing by striking at the cuirass, until someone saw what was happening and stabbed him in the eye. Then he collapsed and died.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>But as chance would have it, the rest of the horsemen knew nothing of this, for they had not seen him fall from his horse, or die. They wheeled about and rode back without perceiving what was done. As soon as they halted, however, they saw what they were missing since there was no one to give them orders. Then when they perceived what had occurred, they gave each other the word, and all rode together to recover the dead body.

<milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> saw the horsemen riding at them, not by squadrons as before, but all together, they cried to the rest of the army for help. While all their infantry was rallying to aid, there was a bitter fight over the dead body.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>As long as the three hundred stood alone, they had the worst of the battle by far, and were ready to leave the dead man. When the main body came to their aid, then it was the horsemen who could no longer hold their ground, nor help to recover the dead man, but rather lost others of their comrades in addition to <name type="pers">Masistius</name>. They accordingly withdrew and halted about two furlongs away, where they deliberated what they should do. Since there was no one to give them orders, they resolved to report to <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>.

<milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the cavalry returned to camp, <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> and the whole army mourned deeply for <name type="pers">Masistius</name>, cutting their own hair and the hair of their horses and beasts of burden, and lamenting loudly; the sound of this was heard over all <name key="tgn,7002683" type="place" reg="Boeotia (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Boeotia</name>, for a man was dead who, next to <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>, was most esteemed by all <name key="tgn,7000231" type="place" reg="Iran [53,32] (nation), Asia">Persia</name> and the king.

<milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So the barbarians honored <name type="pers">Masistius</name>' death in their customary way, but the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> were greatly encouraged that they withstood and drove off the charging horsemen. First they laid the dead man on a cart and carried him about their ranks, and the body was well worth seeing, because of its stature and grandeur; therefore, they would even leave their ranks and come to view <name type="pers">Masistius</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Presently they resolved that they would march down to <name key="perseus,Plataea" type="place" reg="Plataea [23.2667,38.2] (Perseus) ">Plataea</name>, for they saw that the ground there was generally more suited for encampment than that at <name type="place">Erythrae</name>, and chiefly because it was better watered. It was to this place and to the <name type="ethnic">Gargaphian</name> spring which was there, that they resolved to go and pitch camp in their several battalions;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>They took up their arms and marched along the lower slopes of <name type="place">Cithaeron</name> past <name type="place">Hysiae</name> to the lands of <name key="perseus,Plataea" type="place" reg="Plataea [23.2667,38.2] (Perseus) ">Plataea</name>, and when they arrived, they arrayed themselves nation by nation near the <name type="ethnic">Gargaphian</name> spring and the precinct of the hero <name type="pers">Androcrates</name>, among low hills and in a level country.

<milestone unit="para"/>During the drawing up of battle formation there arose much dispute between the <name type="ethnic">Tegeans</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, for each of them claimed that they should hold the second<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">That is, the wing which was not held by the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> themselves.</note> wing of the army, justifying themselves by tales of deeds new and old.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>First the <name type="ethnic">Tegeans</name> spoke: &ldquo;We, among all the allies, have always had the right to hold this position in all campaigns, of the united <name type="ethnic">Peloponnesian</name> armies, both ancient and recent, ever since that time when the <name type="pers">Heraclidae</name> after <name type="pers">Eurystheus</name>' death attempted to return to the <name key="tgn,7017076" type="place" reg=" +Peloponnese [22,37.5] (region), Greece, Europe ">Peloponnese</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>We gained because of the achievement which we will relate.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Peloponnesians</name>, resolving that this should be so, swore a compact that if <name type="pers">Hyllus</name> should overcome the <name type="ethnic">Peloponnesian</name> champion, the <name type="pers">Heraclidae</name> should return to the land of their fathers, but if he were himself beaten, then the <name type="pers">Heraclidae</name> should depart and lead their army away, not attempting to return to the <name key="tgn,7017076" type="place" reg=" +Peloponnese [22,37.5] (region), Greece, Europe ">Peloponnese</name> until a hundred years had passed.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Then our general and king <name type="pers">Echemus</name>, son of <name type="pers">Phegeus</name>' son <name type="pers">Eeropus</name>, volunteered and was chosen out of all the allied host; he fought that duel and killed <name type="pers">Hyllus</name>. It was for that feat of arms that the <name type="ethnic">Peloponnesians</name> granted us this in addition to other great privileges which we have never ceased to possess, namely that in all united campaigns we should always lead the army's second wing.
<milestone n="6" unit="section"/>Now with you, men of <name key="tgn,7011065" type="place" reg="Sparta [22.416,37.83] (inhabited place), Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece, Europe ">Lacedaemon</name>, we have no rivalry, but forbear and bid you choose the command of whichever wing you want.

<milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>To these words the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> replied: &ldquo;It is our belief that we are gathered for battle with the barbarian, and not for speeches; but since the man of <name key="perseus,Tegea" type="place" reg="Tegea [22.4,37.5] (Perseus) ">Tegea</name> has made it his business to speak of all the valorous deeds, old and new, which either of our nations has at any time achieved, we must prove to you how we, rather than <name type="ethnic">Arcadians</name>, have by virtue of our valor a hereditary right to the place of honor.

On the eleventh day from their first encampment opposite each other, the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> growing greatly in number and <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> being greatly vexed by the delay, there was a debate held between <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> son of <name type="pers">Gobryas</name> and <name type="pers">Artabazus</name> son of <name type="pers">Pharnaces</name>, who stood as high as only few others in <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>' esteem.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Their opinions in council were as I will show. <name type="pers">Artabazus</name> thought it best that they should strike their camp with all speed and lead the whole army within the walls of <name key="perseus,Thebes" type="place" reg="Thebes [23.3333,38.325] (Perseus) ">Thebes</name>.

they could take the great store they had of gold, minted and other, and silver drinking-cups, and send all this to all places in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> without stint, excepting none, but especially to the chief men in the cities of <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>. Let them do this (he said) and the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> would quickly surrender their liberty; but do not let the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> risk the event of a battle.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>This opinion of his was the same as the <name type="ethnic">Thebans</name>, inasmuch as he too had special foreknowledge. <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>' counsel, however, was more vehement and intemperate and not at all leaning to moderation. He said that he thought that their army was much stronger than the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> and that they should give battle with all speed so as not to let more <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> muster than were mustered already.

<milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>No one withstood this argument, and his opinion accordingly prevailed; for it was he and not <name type="pers">Artabazus</name> who was commander of the army by the king's commission. He therefore sent for the leaders of the battalions and the generals of those <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> who were with him and asked them if they knew any oracle which prophesied that the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> should perish in <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Those who were summoned said nothing, some not knowing the prophecies, and some knowing them but thinking it perilous to speak, and then <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> himself said: &ldquo;Since you either have no knowledge or are afraid to declare it, hear what I tell you based on the full knowledge that I have.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Therefore, as many of you as wish the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> well may rejoice in that we will overcome the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.&rdquo; Having spoken in this way, he gave command to have everything prepared and put in good order for the battle which would take place early the next morning.

<milestone unit="para"/>After this inquiry about oracles and <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>' exhortation, night fell, and the armies posted their sentries.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
 The greater part of the sentries remained where they were, but the rest ran to their generals and told them that a horseman had ridden in from the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> camp, imparting no other word save that he desired to speak to the generals and called them by their names.

<milestone n="45" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Hearing that, the generals straightway went with the men to the outposts.

Now, however, it is his purpose to pay no heed to the sacrifices, and to attack at the first glimmer of dawn, for he fears, as I surmise, that your numbers will become still greater. Therefore, I urge you to prepare, and if (as may be) <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> should delay and not attack, wait patiently where you are; for he has but a few days' provisions left.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>If, however, this war ends as you wish, then must you take thought how to save me too from slavery, who have done so desperate a deed as this for the sake of <name key="tgn,1000074" type="place" reg="Greece [22,39] (nation), Europe">Hellas</name> in my desire to declare to you <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>' intent so that the barbarians may not attack you suddenly before you yet expect them.

<milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> generals went to the right wing and told <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> what they had heard from <name type="pers">Alexander</name>.

&ldquo;Since, therefore, the battle is to begin at dawn, it is best that you <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> should take your stand opposite the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name>, and we opposite the <name type="ethnic">Boeotians</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> who are posted opposite you; for you have fought with the <name type="ethnic">Medes</name> at Marathon and know them and their manner of fighting while we have no experience or knowledge of those men.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>No, rather let us take up our equipment and change places, you to this wing and we to the left.&rdquo; &ldquo;We, too,&rdquo; the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> answered, &ldquo;even from the moment when we saw the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> posted opposite you, had it in mind to make that suggestion which now has first come from you. We feared, however, that we would displease you by making it. But since you have spoken the wish yourselves, we too hear your words very gladly and are ready to do as you say.

<milestone n="47" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Since both were satisfied with this, they exchanged their places in the ranks at the first light of dawn. The <name type="ethnic">Boeotians</name> noticed that and made it known to <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>.

When <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> perceived what was being done, he saw that his action had been discovered and led the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> back to the right wing; <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> did the same thing on the left of his army.

<milestone n="48" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When all were at their former posts again, <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> sent a herald to the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> with this message: &ldquo;Men of <name key="tgn,7011065" type="place" reg="Sparta [22.416,37.83] (inhabited place), Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece, Europe ">Lacedaemon</name>, you are said by the people of these parts to be very brave men. It is their boast of you that you neither flee from the field nor leave your post, but remain there and either slay your enemies or are yourselves killed. It would seem, however, that there is no truth in all this,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
for before we could attack and fight hand to hand, we saw you even now fleeing and leaving your station, using <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> for the first trial of your enemy and arraying yourselves opposite those who are but our slaves.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>This is not the action of brave men. No, we have been grievously mistaken about you, for in accordance with what we heard about you, we expected that you would send us a herald challenging the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and none other to fight with you. That we were ready to do; but we find you making no such offer, but rather quailing before us. Now, therefore, since the challenge comes not from you, take it from us instead.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>What is there to prevent us from fighting with equal numbers on both sides, you for the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> (since you have the reputation of being their best), and we for the barbarians? If it is desirable that the others fight also, let them fight after us, but if, on the contrary the opinion prevails that we alone suffice, then let us fight it out. Let the winner in this contest determine victory for the whole army.&rdquo;

<milestone n="49" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This is the proclamation made by the herald; and when he had waited a while and no one answered him, he went back again, and at his return told what had happened to him. <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> was overjoyed and proud of this semblance of victory, and sent his cavalry to attack the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The horsemen rode at them and shot arrows and javelins among the whole <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> army to its great hurt, since they were mounted archers and difficult to deal with in an encounter; they spoiled and blocked the <name type="ethnic">Gargaphian</name> spring, from which the entire <name type="ethnic">Greek</name> army drew its water.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>None indeed but the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> were posted near the spring, and it was far from the several stations of the other <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, whereas the <name type="place">Asopus</name> was near; nevertheless, they would always go to the spring, since they were barred from the <name type="place">Asopus</name>, not being able to draw water from that river because of the horsemen and the arrows.

<milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When this happened, seeing that their army was cut off from water and thrown into confusion by the horsemen, the generals of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> went to <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> on the right wing, and debated concerning this and other matters; for there were other problems which troubled them more than what I have told. They had no food left, and their followers whom they had sent into the <name key="tgn,7017076" type="place" reg=" +Peloponnese [22,37.5] (region), Greece, Europe ">Peloponnese</name> to bring provisions had been cut off by the horsemen and could not make their way to the army.

<milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So they resolved in their council that if the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> held off through that day from giving battle, they would go to the Island.<note anchored="yes" resp="ed">Several streams flow north or northwest from <name type="place">Cithaeron</name>, and unite eventually form the small river <name type="place">Oeroe</name>. Between two of these there is a long strip of land, which is perhaps the <foreign lang="greek">nh=sos</foreign>; but it is not now actually surrounded by water, as <name type="pers">Herodotus</name> describes it.</note> This is ten furlongs distant from the <name type="place">Asopus</name> and the <name type="ethnic">Gargaphian</name> spring, near which their army then lay, and in front of the town of <name key="perseus,Plataea" type="place" reg="Plataea [23.2667,38.2] (Perseus) ">Plataea</name>.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It is like an island on dry land because the river in its course down from <name type="place">Cithaeron</name> into the plain is parted into two channels, and there is about three furlongs space in between till presently the two channels unite again, and the name of that river is <name type="place">Oeroe</name>, who (as the people of the country say ) was the daughter of <name type="pers">Asopus</name>.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>To that place then they planned to go so that they might have plenty of water for their use and not be harmed by the horsemen, as now when they were face to face with them; and they resolved to change places in the second watch of the night, lest the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> should see them setting forth and the horsemen press after them and throw them into confusion.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Furthermore, they resolved that when they had come to that place, which is encircled by the divided channels of <name type="place">Asopus</name>' daughter <name type="place">Oeroe</name> as she flows from <name type="place">Cithaeron</name>, they would in that night send half of their army to <name type="place">Cithaeron</name>, to remove their followers who had gone to get the provisions; for these were cut off from them on <name type="place">Cithaeron</name>.

<milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Having made this plan, all that day they suffered constant hardship from the cavalry which continually pressed upon them. When the day ended, however, and the horsemen stopped their onslaught, then at that hour of the night at which it was agreed that they should depart, most of them rose and departed, not with intent to go to the place upon which they had agreed. Instead of that, once they were on their way, they joyfully shook off the horsemen and escaped to the town of <name key="perseus,Plataea" type="place" reg="Plataea [23.2667,38.2] (Perseus) ">Plataea</name>. In the course of their flight they came to the temple of <name type="pers">Hera</name> which is outside of that town, twenty furlongs distant from the <name type="ethnic">Gargaphian</name> spring and piled their arms in front of the temple.

<milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So they encamped around the temple of <name type="pers">Hera</name>. <name type="pers">Pausanias</name>, however, seeing their departure from the camp, gave orders to the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> to take up their arms likewise and follow the others who had gone ahead, supposing that these were making for the place where they had agreed to go.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Thereupon, all the rest of the captains being ready to obey <name type="pers">Pausanias</name>, <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> son of <name type="pers">Poliades</name>, the leader of the <name type="ethnic">Pitanate</name><note anchored="yes" resp="ed"><name type="pers">Thucydides</name> (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.20">Thuc. 1.20</bibl>) denies the existence of a <foreign lang="greek">*pitana/ths lo/xos</foreign> as a formal part of the <name type="ethnic">Spartan</name> army; it is not clear what <name type="pers">Herodotus</name> means.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
<name type="pers">Pausanias</name> and <name type="pers">Euryanax</name> were outraged that <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> disobeyed them. Still more, however, they disliked that his refusing would compel them to abandon the <name type="ethnic">Pitanate</name> battalion, for they feared that if they fulfilled their agreement with the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> and abandoned him, <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> and his men would be left behind to perish.
<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Bearing this in mind, they kept the <name type="ethnic">Laconian</name> army where it was and tried to persuade <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> that he was in the wrong.

<milestone n="54" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>So they reasoned with <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name>, he being the only man left behind of all the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Tegeans</name>. As for the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, they stood unmoved at their post, well aware that the purposes and the promises of <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> were not alike.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>But when the army left its station, they sent a horseman of their own to see whether the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> were attempting to march or whether they were not intending to depart, and to ask <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> what the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> should do.

<milestone n="55" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When the messenger arrived among the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>, he saw them arrayed where they had been, and their chief men by now in hot dispute. For though <name type="pers">Euryanax</name> and <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> reasoned with <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name>, that the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> should not be endangered by remaining there alone, they could in no way prevail upon him. At last, when the <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> messenger came among them, angry words began to pass.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>In this wrangling <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> took up a stone with both hands and threw it down before <name type="pers">Pausanias</name>' feet, crying that it was the pebble with which he voted against fleeing from the strangers (meaning thereby the barbarians). <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> called him a madman; then when the <name type="ethnic">Athenian</name> messenger asked the question with which he had been charged, <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> asked the man to tell the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> of his present condition, and begged them to join themselves to the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> and, as for departure, to do as they did.

<milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>The messenger then went back to the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>. When dawn found the dispute still continuing, <name type="pers">Pausanias</name>, who had up to this point kept his army where it was, now gave the word and led all the rest away between the hillocks, the <name type="ethnic">Tegeans</name> following, for he supposed that <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> would not stay behind when the rest of the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> left him; this was in fact exactly what happened.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> marshalled themselves and marched, but not by the same way as the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>, who stayed close to the broken ground and the lower slopes of <name type="place">Cithaeron</name> in order to stay clear of the <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> horse. The <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> marched down into the plain instead.

<milestone n="57" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>Now <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> at first supposed that <name type="pers">Pausanias</name> would never have the heart to leave him and his men, and he insisted that they should remain where they were and not leave their post. When <name type="pers">Pausanias</name>' men had already proceeded some distance, he thought that they had really left him. He accordingly bade his battalion take up its arms and led it in marching step after the rest of the column,
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
which after going a distance of ten furlongs, was waiting for <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name> by the stream <name type="place">Molois</name> and the place called <name type="place">Argiopium</name>, where there is a shrine of <name type="pers">Eleusinian Demeter</name>.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>No sooner had <name type="pers">Amompharetus</name>' men come up than the barbarians' cavalry attacked the army, for the horsemen acted as they always had. When they saw no enemy on the ground where the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> had been on the days before this, they kept riding forward and attacked the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> as soon as they overtook them.

<milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>When <name type="pers">Mardonius</name> learned that the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> had departed under cover of night and saw the ground deserted, he called to him <name type="pers">Thorax</name> of <name type="pers">Larissa</name> and his brothers <name type="pers">Eurypylus</name> and <name type="pers">Thrasydeius</name> and said:

&ldquo;What will you say now, sons of <name type="pers">Aleuas</name>, when you see this place deserted?

<milestone unit="para"/>With that, he led the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> with all speed across the <name type="place">Asopus</name> in pursuit of the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, supposing that they were in flight; it was the army of <name key="tgn,7011065" type="place" reg="Sparta [22.416,37.83] (inhabited place), Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece, Europe ">Lacedaemon</name> and <name key="perseus,Tegea" type="place" reg="Tegea [22.4,37.5] (Perseus) ">Tegea</name> alone which was his goal, for the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> marched another way over the broken ground, and were out of his sight.

<milestone n="60" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>

<milestone unit="para"/>When the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> heard that, they attempted to help the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> and defend them with all their might.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>The <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> and <name type="ethnic">Tegeans</name> accordingly stood alone, men-at-arms and light-armed together; there were of the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> fifty thousand and of the <name type="ethnic">Tegeans</name>, who had never been parted from the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>, three thousand.

<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>They could get no favorable omen from their sacrifices, and in the meanwhile many of them were killed and by far more wounded (for the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> set up their shields for a fence, and shot showers of arrows).

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>First they fought by the fence of shields, and when that was down, there was a fierce and long fight around the temple of <name type="pers">Demeter</name> itself, until they came to blows at close quarters. For the barbarians laid hold of the spears and broke them short.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Now the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> were neither less valorous nor weaker, but they had no armor; moreover, since they were unskilled and no match for their adversaries in craft, they would rush out singly and in tens or in groups great or small, hurling themselves on the <name type="ethnic">Spartans</name> and so perishing.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>It is indeed a marvel that although the battle was right by the grove of <name type="pers">Demeter</name>, there was no sign that any <name type="ethnic">Persian</name> had been killed in the precinct or entered into it; most of them fell near the temple in unconsecrated ground.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>He had with him a great army, as many as forty thousand men. He knew full well what the outcome of the battle would be, and no sooner had the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> and <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> met than he led these with a fixed purpose, telling them to follow him all together wherever he should lead them, whatever they thought his intent might be.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>With that command he pretended to lead them into battle. As he came farther on his way, he saw the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> already fleeing and accordingly led his men, no longer in the same array, but took to his heels and fled with all speed not to the wooden fort nor to the walled city of <name key="perseus,Thebes" type="place" reg="Thebes [23.3333,38.325] (Perseus) ">Thebes</name>, but to <name key="tgn,4003963" type="place" reg=" +Phocis (department), Central Greece and Euboea, Greece, Europe ">Phocis</name>, so that he might make his way with all haste to the <name key="tgn,7002638" type="place" reg="Canakkale Bogazi (strait), Canakkale, Marmara, Turkey, Asia ">Hellespont</name>.

<milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/><milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
<milestone unit="para"/>This flight of theirs which took place before the actual closing of battle and was prompted because they saw the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> flee, proves to me that it was on the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> that the fortune of the barbarians hung.

<milestone unit="para"/>So the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name>, now having the upper hand, followed <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>' men, pursuing and slaying.

But when the <name type="ethnic">Persians</name> and the rest of the multitude had fled within the wooden wall, they managed to get up on the towers before the coming of the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name>; then they strengthened the wall as best they could. When the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> arrived, an intense battle for the wall began.
<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>For as long as the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> were not there, the barbarians defended themselves and had a great advantage over the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> who had no skill in the assault of walls. When the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> came up, however, the fight for the wall became intense and lasted for a long time. In the end the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name>, by valor and constant effort, scaled the wall and breached it. The <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> poured in through the opening they had made;
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
the first to enter were the <name type="ethnic">Tegeans</name>, and it was they who plundered the tent of <name type="pers">Mardonius</name>, taking from it besides everything else the feeding trough of his horses which was all of bronze and a thing well worth looking at.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>As for the barbarians, they did not form a unified body again once the wall was down, nor did anyone think of defense because the terrified men in the tiny space and the many myriads herded together were in great distress.
<milestone n="5" unit="section"/>Such a slaughter were the <name type="ethnic">Greeks</name> able to make, that of two hundred and sixty thousand who remained after <name type="pers">Artabazus</name> had fled with his forty thousand, scarcely three thousand were left alive.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>Of this my only clear proof is (for all these conquered the foes opposed to them) the fact that the <name type="ethnic">Lacedaemonians</name> fought with the strongest part of the army, and overcame it.

<milestone n="4" unit="section"/>This they may have said merely out of jealousy, but all the aforesaid who were killed in that fight received honor, save <name type="pers">Aristodemus</name>; he, because he desired death because of the reproach previously mentioned, received none.

and sacks they found on wagons, in which were seen cauldrons of gold and silver. They stripped from the dead who lay there their armlets and torques, and golden daggers; as for the embroidered clothing, it was disregarded.
<milestone n="3" unit="section"/>Much of all this the helots showed, as much as they could not conceal, but much they stole and sold to the <name type="ethnic">Aeginetans</name>.

<milestone n="2" unit="section"/>They did his bidding, but <name type="pers">Pausanias</name>, when he saw golden and silver couches richly covered, and tables of gold and silver, and all the magnificent service of the banquet, was amazed at the splendor before him, and for a joke commanded his own servants to prepare a dinner in <name type="ethnic">Laconian</name> fashion.

<name type="pers">Artabazus</name> understood that if he told them the whole truth about the fighting, he would endanger his own life and the lives of all those with him, for he thought that every man would set upon him if they heard the story.

&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said deceitfully to <name type="pers">Xerxes</name>, &ldquo;there is here the house of a certain <name type="ethnic">Greek</name>, who met a just death for invading your territory with an army; give me this man's house, so that all may be taught not to invade your territory.&rdquo; One would think that this plea would easily persuade <name type="pers">Xerxes</name> to give him a man's house, since the latter had no suspicion of <name type="pers">Artayctes</name>' meaning.

<milestone unit="para"/>Since the siege continued into the late autumn, the <name type="ethnic">Athenians</name> grew weary of their absence from home and their lack of success at taking the fortress.
