         <div1 type="section" n="0">
            <p>Now that the nuptial ceremonies are over, and that the
					priestess of Ceres has joined you both together in the bands
					of matrimony according to the custom of the country, I
					thought a short discourse of this nature might not be either
					unacceptable or unseasonable, but rather serve as a kind
					epithalamium to congratulate your happy conjunction;
					more especially, since there can be nothing more useful in
					conjugal society than the observance of wise and wholesome
					precepts, suitable to the harmony of matrimonial converse.
					For among the variety of musical moods and measures
					there is one which is called Hippothoros, a sort of composition to the flute and hautboy, made use of to encourage
					and provoke stallions to cover mares. But philosophy
					being furnished with many noble and profitable discourses,
					there is not any one subject that deserves a more serious
					study than that of wedlock, whereby they who are engaged
					in a long community of bed and board are more steadfastly
					united in affection, and made more pliable one to another
					in humor and condition. To this purpose, having reduced
					under several short heads and similes some certain instructions and admonitions which you, as tutored up in philosophy, have frequently already heard, I send you the collection
					as a present, beseeching the Muses so with their presence
					to assist the Goddess Venus, that the harmony of your
					mutual society and complacency in domestic diligences may
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.487"/>
					
					outcry the melodious concords of lute or harp, while you
					live united together by reason and philosophy. Therefore
					it was that the ancients placed the statue of Venus by that
					of Mercury, to signify that the pleasures of matrimony
					chiefly consist in the sweetness of conversation. They also
					set the Graces and Suadela, the Goddess of Eloquence, together, to show that the married couple were to act only
					by persuasion, and not to use the violences of wrangling
					and contention.</p>

            <p>Solon advised that the bride should eat a quince before she entered the nuptial sheets; intimating thereby, in
				my opinion, that the man was to expect his first pleasures
				from the breath and speech of his new-married bed-fellow.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>In Boeotia it is the custom, when they veil the virgin
				bride, to set upon her head a chaplet of wild asparagus,
				which from a thorny stalk affords a most delicious fruit,
				to let us understand that a new-married woman, discreetly
				brooking at the beginning the first distastes of marriage
				restraints, grows yieldingly complaisant at length, and
				makes conforming wedlock a happiness to each. And indeed such husbands who cannot bear with the little disdains
				and first froppishness of imprudent youth are like to those
				that choose the sour grapes and leave to others the ripe
				delicious clusters. On the other side, those young ladies
				that take a disdain to their husbands by reason of their
				first debates and encounters may be well compared to those
				that patiently endure the sting but fling away the honey.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>It especially behooves those people who are newly
				married to avoid the first occasions of discord and dissension; considering that vessels newly formed are subject to
				be bruised and put out of shape by many slight accidents,
				but when the materials come once to be settled and hardened by time, nor fire nor sword will hardly prejudice the
				solid substance.</p>

				soon goes out again, unless fed with an addition of more
				fuel. Thus that same love, whose flames are nourished
				only by heat of youth and looser charms of beauty, seldom proves of long continuance or grows to wedlock
				maturity, unless it have taken a deep root in conformity
				of manners, and mutual affection be enlivened by the
				intermixture of souls as well as bodies, while prudence
				and discretion feed the noble flame.</p>

            <p>They who bait their hooks with intoxicated drugs
				with little pains surprise the hungry fish, but then they
				prove unsavory to the taste and dangerous to eat. Thus
				women that by the force of charms and philters endeavor
				to subdue their husbands to the satisfaction of their pleasure become at length the wives of madmen, sots, and
				fools. For they whom the sorceress Circe had enchanted,
				being then no better than swine and asses, were no longer
				able to please or do her service. But she loved Ulysses
				entirely, whose prudence avoided her venomous intoxications and rendered his conversation highly grateful.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>They who rather choose to be the mistresses of senseless fools than the obedient wives of wise and sober husbands are like those people that prefer misguidance of the

            <p>They will not believe that Pasiphae, the consort of
				a prince, could ever be enamored of a bull, and yet
				themselves are so extravagant as to abandon the society

            <p>Some men, either unable or unwilling to mount

				some persons who, having married young ladies not less
				considerable for the nobility of their birth than their wealthy
				dowries, take little care themselves to improve the advantages of such a splendid conjunction, but with a severe
				moroseness labor to depress and degrade their wives,
				proud of the mastery and vaunting in domestic tyranny.
				Whereas in this case it becomes a man to use the reins of
				government with as equal regard to the quality and dignity
				of the woman as to the stature of the horse.</p>

            <p>We behold the moon then shining with a full and
				glorious orb, when farthest distant from the sun; but, as
				she warps back again to meet her illustrious mate, the
				nearer she makes her approach, the more she is eclipsed
				until no longer seen. Quite otherwise, a woman ought to
				display the charms of her virtue and the sweetness of her
				disposition in her husband's presence, but in his absence
				to retire to silence and reservedness at home.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="10">
            <p>Nor can we approve the saying of Herodotus, that
				a woman lays aside her modesty with her shift. For

				secret signals and testimonies of mutual affection.</p>

            <p>As in musical concords, when the upper strings are
				so tuned as exactly to accord, the base always gives the
				tone; so in well-regulated and well-ordered families, all

				agreement of both parties, but the conduct and contrivance
				chiefly redounds to the reputation and management of the

            <p>It is a common proverb, that the sun is too strong
				for the north wind; for the more the wind ruffles and
				strives to force a man's upper garment from his back, the
				faster he holds it, and the closer he wraps it about his
				shoulders. But he who so briskly defended himself from

				being plundered by the wind, when once the sun begins to
				scald the air, all in a dropping sweat is then constrained
				to throw away not only his flowing garment but his tunic
				also. This puts us in mind of the practice of most women,
				who, being limited by their husbands in their extravagances of feasting and superfluities of habit, presently fill
				the house with noise and uproar; whereas, if they would
				but suffer themselves to be convinced by reason and soft
				persuasion, they would of themselves acknowledge their
				vanity and submit to moderation.</p>

            <p>Cato ejected a certain Roman out of the senate for

				kissing and colling and hugging in the sight of others be
				so unseemly, as indeed it is, how much more indecent is it
				to chide and brawl and maunder one at another while
				strangers are in company? If lawful familiarity and
				caresses between man and wife are not to be allowed
				but in their private retirements, shall the bitter interchanges and loud discoveries of invective and inconsiderate passion be thought an entertainment pleasingly proper
				for unconcerned and public ears ?</p>

            <p>As there is little or no use to be made of a mirror,

				variety of the richest gems, unless it render back the true
				similitude of the image it receives; so is there nothing of
				profit in a wealthy dowry, unless the conditions, the temper, the humor of the wife be conformable to the natural
				disposition and inclination of the husband, and he sees
				the virtues of his own mind exactly represented in hers.
				Or, if a fair and beautiful mirror that makes a sad and
				pensive visage look jocund and gay, or a wanton or smiling countenance show pensive and mournful, is therefore
				presently rejected as of no value; thus may not she be
				thought an angry, peevish, and importunate woman, that

				louts and lowers upon the caresses of a husband, and
				when he courts the pastime of her affections, entertains
				him with frumps and taunts, but when she finds him
				serious in business, allures him then with her unseasonable toyings to pleasure and enjoyment? For the one is
				an offence of impertinency, the other a contempt of her
				husband's kindness. But, as geometricians affirm that
				lines and surfaces are not moved of themselves, but according to the motions of the bodies to which they belong,
				so it behooves a woman to challenge no peculiar passion
				or affection as her own, but to share with her husband
				in business, in his recreations, in his cares, and in his
				mirth.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="15">
            <p>As they who are offended to see their wives eat and
				drink freely in their company do but whet their appetites
				to glut and gormandize in corners by themselves; so they
				who refuse to frolic in retirement with their wives, or to
				let them participate of their private pastimes and dalliances, do but instruct them to cater for their own pleasures and delights.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="16">
            <p>The Persian kings, when they contain themselves
				within the limits of their usual banquets, suffer their married wives to sit down at their tables; but when they once
				design to indulge the provocations of amorous heats and
				wine, then they send away their wives, and call for their
				concubines, their gypsies, and their songstresses, with their
				lascivious tunes and wanton galliards. Wherein they do
				well, not thinking it proper to debauch their wives with
				the tipsy frolics and dissolute extravagances of their intemperance.</p>
            <p>If therefore any private person, swayed by the unruly
					motions of his incontinency, happen at any time to make
					a trip with a kind she-friend or his wife's chambermaid, it
					becomes not the wife presently to lower and take pepper
					in the nose, but rather to believe that it was his respect to
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.492"/>
					
					her which made him unwilling she should behold the follies of ebriety and foul intemperance.</p>

            <p>Princes that be addicted to music increase the number of excellent musicians; if they be lovers of learning,
				all men strive to excel in reading and in eloquence; if
				given to martial exercises, a military ardor rouses straight
				the drowsy sloth of all their subjects. Thus husbands
				effeminately finical only teach their wives to paint and polish themselves with borrowed lustre. The studious of
				pleasure render them immodest and whorish. On the other
				side, men of serious, honest, and virtuous conversations
				make sober, chaste, and prudent wives.</p>

            <p>A young Lacedaemonian lass, being asked by an
				acquaintance of hers whether she had yet embraced her
				husband, made answer, No; but that he had embraced her.
				And after this manner, in my opinion, it behooves an honest
				woman to behave herself toward her husband, never to
				shun nor to disdain the caresses and dalliances of his
				amorous inclinations, when he himself begins; but never
				herself to offer the first occasion of provocation. For the
				one savors of impudent harlotry, the other displays a female pride and imperiousness void of conjugal affection.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="19">
            <p>It behooves a woman not to make peculiar and private friendships of her own, but to esteem only her husband's acquaintance and familiars as hers. Now as the
				Gods are our chiefest and most beneficial friends, it behooves her to worship and adore only those Deities which
				her husband reputes and reverences for such. But as for
				quaint opinions and superstitious innovations, let them be
				exterminated from her outermost threshold. For no sacrifices or services can be acceptable to the Gods, performed
				by women, as it were, by stealth and in secret, without the
				knowledge of the husband.</p>

				           <q direct="unspecified">This is not mine,</q> are seldomest made use of. For that
				then the citizens enjoy in common, so far as is convenient,
				those things that are of greatest importance. But in wedlock those expressions are utterly to be abolished. For
				as the physicians say that the right side being bruised or
				beaten communicates its pain to the left; so indeed the
				husband ought to sympathize in the sorrows and afflictions
				of the woman, and much more does it become the wife to
				be sensible of the miseries and calamities of the husband;
				to the intent that, as knots are made fast by knitting the
				bows of a thread one within another, so the ligaments of
				conjugal society may be strengthened by the mutual interchange of kindness and affection. This Nature herself
				instructs us, by mixing us in our bodies; while she takes
				a part from each, and then blending the whole together
				produces a being common to both, to the end that neither
				may be able to discern or distinguish what was belonging
				to another, or lay claim to assured propriety. Therefore
				is community of estate and purses chiefly requisite among
				married couples, whose principal aim it ought to be to mix
				and incorporate their purchases and disbursements into one
				substance, neither pretending to call this hers or that his,
				but accounting all inseparable peculiar to both. However,
				as in a goblet where the proportion of water exceeds the
				juice of the grape, yet still we call the mixture wine; in

				in such things as most delight a husband, pleasantness of
				converse, sweetness of disposition, and briskness of humor,
				there to show nothing of harshness, nothing distasteful,
				nothing offensive, but from day to day to study behavior
				jocund, blithe, and conformable to his temper. For as
				physicians are much more afraid of fevers that proceed

				presents will procure more infamy than honor to my

				Thus it is with women, who in honoring and submitting to
				their husbands win for themselves honor and respect, but
				when they strive to get the mastery, they become a greater
				reproach to themselves than to those that are so ignominiously henpecked. But then again, it behooves a husband to control his wife, not as a master does his vassal,
				but as the soul governs the body, with the gentle hand
				of mutual friendship and reciprocal affection. For as
				the soul commands the body, without being subject to
				its pleasures and inordinate desires, in like manner should

				 Thus, where people wed for pure affection, that

				bodies whose parts are contiguous and cleave close to one
				another; and they who only bed together, if there be any
				such, resemble bodies whose parts are distinct and without
				dependency. Now, as physicians say that liquids are the
				only bodies which most easily intermix without any difference of propriety or respect one with another; so should
				it be said of people joined together in matrimony, that
				there is a perfect mixture of bodies and estates, of friends
				and relations. Therefore the Roman law prohibits new
				married people from giving and receiving mutual presents
				one from another; not that they should not participate
				one with another, but to show that they were not to enjoy

				Rather it becomes the daughter to avoid all occasions of
				distaste. For it is natural to some mothers to be jealous
				that the wife deprives her of that filial tenderness which
				she expects from her son. For which there is no better

				show the choicest of her respects and to be more complaisant to the kindred of her husband than to her own
