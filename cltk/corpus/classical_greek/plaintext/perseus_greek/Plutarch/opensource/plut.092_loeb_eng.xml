            <head>THE OBSOLESCENCE OF
					ORACLES
					(DE DEFECTU ORACULORUM)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					Plutarch's answer to the question why many
					oracles in Greece have ceased to function is that the
					population is now much less than it was, and so there
					is less need for oracles now than in earlier times.
					For example, at Delphi there used to be twro prophetic priestesses with a third held in reserve ; now
					there is only one, and yet she is sufficient for every
					need.
				</p>
            <p>
					The statement of this simple fact hardly requires
					twenty-nine folio pages, but in this essay, as in the
					two preceding, there is much of the conversation of
					cultured persons which is not directly connected with
					the subject. Thus we find a discussion of whether
					the year is growing shorter, whether the number of
					the worlds is one or some number not more than five
					or is one hundred and eighty-three. We have further
					discussion of the number five, some astronomy, and
					a good deal of geometry, some interesting bits of
					information about Britain and the East and a rather
					long discussion of the <hi rend="italics">daimones</hi>, the beings a little
					lower than the gods and considerably higher than
					mortals ; perhaps the translation <q direct="unspecified">demi-gods</q> might
					best convey the idea in English. These beings are
					thought by many persons to be in charge of the
					oracles ; certainly the god himself does not appear
					personally at his oracles ; and in the case of the
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.349"/>
					
					oracle at Delphi some account is given of the accidental discovery by a shepherd of the peculiar
					powers of the exhalation from the cleft in the
					rocks.
				</p>
            <p>
					Students of English literature will be interested in
					the dramatic description of the announcement of the
					death of Pan ; and students of religion will be interested in the essay as a very early effort to reconcile science and religion. That the essay had an
					appeal to theologians is clear from the generous
					quotations made from it by Eusebius and Theodoretus.
					We could wish that they had quoted even more,
					since their text is usually superior to that contained
					in the manuscripts, which in some places are quite
					hopeless. The mss. have also an unusual number of
					lacunae. Much has been done in the way of correction, sometimes perhaps too much, since Plutarch's
					thought is not always necessarily so logical as the
					editors would make it.
				</p>
            <p>
					Some parts of the essay make rather difficult
					reading, but it also contains passages of considerable
					interest and even beauty.
				</p>
            <p>
					The essay is No. 88 in Lamprias's list of Plutarch's
					works.
				</p>
            <p>
					The conversation is professedly narrated by
					Plutarch's brother Lamprias to Terentius Priscus,
					but some have thought that Plutarch has used the
					person of Lamprias to represent himself, possibly
					because of the official position held by Plutarch at
					Delphi.

					that certain eagles or swans, flying from the uttermost parts of the earth towards its centre, met in
					Delphi at the omphalus, as it is called ; and at a later
					time Epimenides<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Diels, <hi rend="italics">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</hi>, ii. p. 191, Epimenides, no. b 11.</note> of Phaestus put the story to test
					by referring it to the god and upon receiving a vague
					and ambiguous oracle said,
					<quote rend="blockquote">

					have more than enough, and so he employed his
					leisure for such purposes ; he was getting together
					a history to serve as a basis for a philosophy that had
					as its end and aim theology, as he himself named it.
					He had recently been at the shrine of Ammon, and
					it was plain that he was not particularly impressed by
					most of the things there, but in regard to the everburning lamp he related a story told by the priests
					which deserves special consideration ; it is that the
					lamp consumes less and less oil each year, and they
					hold that this is a proof of a disparity in the years,
					which all the time is making one year shorter in
					duration than its predecessor ; for it is reasonable
					that in less duration of time the amount consumed
					should be less.

            <p>The company was surprised at this, and Demetrius went so far as to say that it was ridiculous to try

					          <q direct="unspecified">Neither of these things,</q> said Cleombrotus,

						concede any superior accuracy to the mathematicians,

						movements and cycles so far away, should elude
						mathematical calculation than that the measurement
						of the oil should elude the very men who were always
						giving careful attention to the anomaly and watching it closely because of its strangeness. Besides,
						Demetrius, not to allow that small things are indication of great stands directly in the way of many arts ;
						for it will result in taking away from us the demonstration of many facts and the prognostication of many
						others. Yet you people try to demonstrate to us
						also a matter of no small importance : that the heroes
						of old shaved their bodies with a razor, because you
						meet with the word <q direct="unspecified">razor</q> in Homer<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                     <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> x. 173.</note>; also that
						they lent money on interest because Homer<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                     <hi rend="italics">Od.</hi> iii. 367-368.</note> somewhere says that <q direct="unspecified">a debt is owing, not recent nor
							small,</q> the assumption being that <q direct="unspecified">owing</q> signifies
						<q direct="unspecified">accumulating.</q> And again when Homer<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                     <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> x. 394, for example; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 923 b. Further explanation of the idea that <foreign lang="greek">qoo/s</foreign> may mean <q direct="unspecified">conical</q> may be found in the <hi rend="italics">Life and Poetry of Homer</hi>, 21 (Bernardakis's edition, vol. vii. p. 347).</note> speaks of
						the night as <q direct="unspecified">swift,</q> you cling to the expression with
						great satisfaction and say that it means this : that the
						Earth's shadow is by him called conical, being caused
						by a spherical body ; and as for the idea that medical
						science can predict a pestilential summer by a multitude of spiders' webs or by the fig-leaves in the spring
						when they are like crows' feet, who of those that
						insist that small things are not indications of great
						will allow this to go unchallenged ? Who will endure

						that the magnitude of the sun be measured by reference to a quart or a gill, or that, in the sun-diai here,
						the inclination of the acute angle which its shadow
						makes with the level plane be called the measurement of the elevation of the ever-visible pole above
						the horizon ? This was what one might hear from
						the priests of the prophetic shrine there ; so some
						other rejoinder must be offered to them, if we would
						make for the sun the wonted order of its course
						immutable, in accord with the tradition of the ages.</q>

            <p>Thereupon Ammonius the philosopher, who was
					present, exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">Not for the sun only, but for
						the whole heavens. For the sun's course in passing
						from solstice to solstice must inevitably become
						shorter and not continue to be so large a part of the
						horizon as the mathematicians say it is, since the
						southern portion is constantly subject to a contracting movement, which brings it closer to the northern
						portion ; and so our summer must become shorter
						and its temperature lower, as the sun turns about
						within narrower limits and touches fewer parallels
						of latitude at the solstitial points ; moreover, the
						phenomenon observed at Syen&ecirc;,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Syen&ecirc; was on the Tropic of Cancer, and because of the fact that on the day of the summer solstice the sun was directly overhead it was used by Eratosthenes (third century b.c.) as one of the termini in calculating the circumference of the Earth. Cleomedes, <hi rend="italics">On the Circular Movement of Heavenly Bodies</hi>, i. 10, describes Eratosthenes' method.</note> where the upright
						rods on the sun-dials cast no shadow at the time of
						the summer solstice, is bound to be a thing of the
						past; many of the fixed stars must have gone below
						the horizon, and some of them must be touching one
						another, or have become coalescent, as the space
						separating them has disappeared ! But if, on the
						other hand, they are going to assert that, while all
						the other bodies are without change, the sun displays
						
						<pb id="v.5.p.359"/>
						
						irregularity in its movements, they will not be able
						to state the cause of the acceleration which affects the
						sun alone among so many bodies, and they will throw
						into confusion almost all the celestial mechanics,
						and into complete confusion those relating to the
						moon, so that they will have no need of measures of
						oil to prove the difference. In fact, the eclipses will
						prove it, as the sun more frequently casts a shadow
						on the moon and the moon on the earth ; the other
						facts are clear, and there is no need to disclose in
						further detail the imposture in the argument.</q>
				        </p>
            <p>
					          <q direct="unspecified">But,</q> said Cleombrotus, <q direct="unspecified">I myself actually saw
						the measure ; for they had many of them to show,
						and that of this past year failed to come up to the
						very oldest by not a little.</q>
				        </p>
            <p>
					          <q direct="unspecified">Then,</q> said Ammonius, taking up the argument
					again, <q direct="unspecified">this fact has escaped the notice of the other
						peoples among whom ever-burning fires have been
						cherished and kept alive for a period of years which
						might be termed infinite ? But on the assumption
						that the report is true, is it not better to assign the
						cause to some coldness or moisture in the air by which
						the flame is made to languish, and so very likely does
						not take up nor need very much to support it ? Or,
						quite the reverse, may we assign the cause to spells of
						dryness and heat ? In fact, I have heard people say
						before this regarding fire, that it burns better in the
						winter,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Comment. on Hesiod, Works and Days</hi>, 559 (Bernardakis's edition, vol. vii. p. 78).</note> being strongly compacted and condensed by
						the cold ; whereas in warm, dry times it is very weak
						and loses its compactness and intensity, and if it burns
						in the sunlight, it does even worse, and takes hold of
						the fuel without energy, and consumes it more slowly.
						Best of all, the cause might be assigned to the oil
						itself; for it is not unlikely that in days of old it
						
						
						<pb id="v.5.p.361"/>
						
						contained incombustible material and water, being
						produced from young trees ; but that later, being
						ripened on full-grown trees and concentrated, it
						should, in an equal quantity, show more strength and

					the oracles have now failed completely, even as if they
					were streams of flowing water, and a great drought in
					prophecy has overspread the land ? For nowhere

					Boeotia aught to offer to those who would draw from
					the well-spring of prophecy. As for the rest, silence

					accustomed in former times to use the Aeolic dialect,
					on that occasion took the side of the barbarians and
					gave forth an oracle such that no one else of those
					present comprehended it, but only Mys himself, since
					it is quite clear from the inspired language then used

					then next he tried to push him away with his hands,
					and, when the man persisted in staying, took up a
					large stone and smote him on the head. All this was

						questioning the mere possibility that the god had been

						prophetic priestess told them in another oracle that a
						crow would show them the spot. So they went away
						and, when they reached Chaeroneia, they heard the

						oracle with some strangers who were on their way
						to Tegyrae. The strangers, as they were leaving,

					Ammonius, addressing himself to me, said, <q direct="unspecified">See
						what it is that we are doing, Lamprias, and concentrate your thoughts on our subject so that we shall
						not relieve the god of responsibility. The fact is that
						the man who holds that the obsolescence of such
						of the oracles as have ceased to function has been
						brought about by some other cause and not by the
						will of a god gives reason for suspecting that he
						believes that their creation and continued existence
						was not due to the god, but was brought about in
						some other way. For prophecy is something created
						by a god, and certainly no greater or more potent
						force exists to abolish and obliterate it. Now I do not
						like what Planetiades said, and one of the reasons is
						the inconsistency which it creates regarding the god,
						
						<pb id="v.5.p.373"/>
						
						who in one way turns away from wickedness and
						disavows it, and again in another way welcomes its
						presence ; just as if some king or despot should shut
						out bad men at certain doors and let them in at others
						and have dealings with them. Now moderation,
						adequacy, excess in nothing, and complete selfsufficiency are above all else the essential characteristics of everything done by the gods ; and if anyone
						should take this fact as a starting-point, and assert
						that Greece has far more than its share in the general
						depopulation which the earlier discords and wars have
						wrought throughout practically the whole inhabited
						earth, and that to-day the whole of Greece would
						hardly muster three thousand men-at-arms, which is
						the number that the one city of the Megarians sent
						forth to Plataeae<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Herodotus, ix. 21 and 28.</note> (for the god's abandoning of many
						oracles is nothing other than his way of substantiating
						the desolation of Greece), in this way such a man
						would give some accurate evidence of his keenness in
						reasoning. For who would profit if there were an
						oracle in Tegyrae, as there used to be, or at Ptoiim,
						where during some part of the day one might possibly
						meet a human being pasturing his flocks ? And
						regarding the oracle here at Delphi, the most ancient
						in time and the most famous in repute, men record
						that for a long time it was made desolate and unapproachable by a fierce creature, a serpent; they
						do not, however, put the correct interpretation upon
						its lying idle, but quite the reverse ; for it was the
						desolation that attracted the creature rather than
						that the creature caused the desolation. But when
						Greece, since God so willed, had grown strong in
						cities and the place was thronged with people, they
						
						<pb id="v.5.p.375"/>
						
						used to employ two prophetic priestesses who were
						sent down in turn ; and a third was appointed to be
						held in reserve. But to-day there is one priestess
						and we do not complain, for she meets every need.
						There is no reason, therefore, to blame the god ; the
						exercise of the prophetic art which continues at the
						present day is sufficient for all, and sends away all
						with their desires fulfilled. Agamemnon,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, <hi rend="italics">Il.</hi> ii. 96.</note> for example, used nine heralds and, even so, had difficulty in
						keeping the assembly in order because of the vast
						numbers ; but here in Delphi, a few days hence, in
						the theatre you will see that one voice reaches all.
						In the same way, in those days, prophecy employed
						more voices to speak to more people, but to-day,
						quite the reverse, we should needs be surprised at the
						god if he allowed his prophecies to run to waste, like
						water, or to echo like the rocks with the voices of
						shepherds and flocks in waste places.</q>

						The father of Aemilianus the orator, to whom some
						of you have listened, was Epitherses, who lived in
						our town and was my teacher in grammar. He said
						that once upon a time in making a voyage to Italy
						he embarked on a ship carrying freight and many
						passengers. It was already evening when, near the
						Echinades Islands, the wind dropped, and the ship
						drifted near Paxi. Almost everybody was awake,
						and a good many had not finished their after-dinner
						wine. Suddenly from the island of Paxi was heard
						the voice of someone loudly calling Thamus, so that
						all were amazed. Thamus was an Egyptian pilot, not
						known by name even to many on board. Twice he
						was called and made no reply, but the third time he
						answered ; and the caller, raising his voice, said,
						<q direct="unspecified">When you come opposite to Palodes, announce
							that Great Pan is dead.</q> On hearing this, all, said
						Epitherses, were astounded and reasoned among
						themselves whether it were better to carry out the
						order or to refuse to meddle and let the matter go.
						Under the circumstances Thamus made up his mind
						that if there should be a breeze, he would sail past
						and keep quiet, but with no wind and a smooth sea
						
						<pb id="v.5.p.403"/>
						
						about the place he would announce what he had
						heard. So, when he came opposite Palodes, and
						there was neither wind nor wave, Thamus from the
						stern, looking toward the land, said the words as he
						had heard them : <q direct="unspecified">Great Pan is dead.</q> Even before
						he had finished there was a great cry of lamentation, not of one person, but of many, mingled with
						exclamations of amazement. As many persons were
						on the vessel, the story was soon spread abroad in
						Rome, and Thamus was sent for by Tiberius Caesar.
						Tiberius became so convinced of the truth of the
						story that he caused an inquiry and investigation to
						be made about Pan ; and the scholars, who were
						numerous at his court, conjectured that he was the
						son born of Hermes and Penelop&ecirc;.</q>

					if they are bad and sinful, that they should be happy
					and of long life, inasmuch as vice has a large measure
					of blindness and the tendency to encounter destructive agencies, so that argument of theirs is silly. For
					by this reasoning Epicurus will be shown to be a
					worse man than Gorgias the sophist, and Metrodorus
					worse than Alexis the comic poet; for Alexis lived
					twice as long as Metrodorus and Gorgias more than
					a third as long again as Epicurus. It is in another

					destructive agencies. No, immunity from emotion
					and destruction ought to reside in the blessed Being,

					are not present does not show great consideration.

               <q direct="unspecified">In the first place, then,</q> said I, &ldquo;the considerations that prevent our making an infinite
					number of worlds do not preclude our making more
					than one. For it is possible for God and prophecy
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.423"/>
					
					and Providence to exist in more worlds than one, and
					for the incidence of chance to be reduced to the very
					smallest limits, while the vast majority of things and
					those of the highest importance attain to genesis
					and transmutation in a quite orderly sequence,
					none of which things does infinity, by its nature,
					admit. Then again it is more consistent with reason
					that the world should not be the only-begotten of
					God and quite alone. For He, being consummately
					good, is lacking in none of the virtues, and least of all
					in those which concern justice and friendliness ; for
					these are the fairest and are fitting for gods. Nor is
					it in the nature of God to possess anything to no
					purpose or for no use. Therefore there exist other
					gods and other worlds outside, in relation with
					which He exercises the social virtues. For not in
					relation with Himself nor with any part of Himself
					is there any exercise of justice or benevolence or
					kindness, but only in relation with others. Thus it
					is not likely that this world, friendless, neighbourless,
					and unvisited, swings back and forth in the infinite
					void, since we see that Nature includes individual
					things in classes and species, like seeds in pods and
					envelopes. For there is nothing in the whole list of
					existing things for which there is not some general
					designation, nor does anything that does not possess
					certain qualities, either in common with others or
					solely by itself, obtain such an appellation. Now the
					world is not spoken of as having qualities in common
					with others. It has its qualities, therefore, solely by
					itself, by virtue of the difference when it is compared
					with other things which are akin to it and similar in
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.425"/>
					
					appearance, since it has been created with such
					qualities as it possesses. If in all creation such a
					thing as one man, one horse, one star, one god, one
					demigod does not exist, what is there to prevent
					creation from having, not one world, but more than
					one ? For he who says that creation has but one
					land and one sea overlooks a matter which is perfectly
					plain, the doctrine of similar parts<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes"/>; for we divide the
					earth into parts which bear similar names, and the
					sea likewise. A part of the world, however, is not
					a world, but something combined from the differing

         <div1 type="section" n="25">
            <p>&ldquo;Again, as for the dread which some people
					especially have felt, and so use up the whole of
					matter on the one world, so that nothing may be left
					over outside to disturb the structure of it by resisting
					or striking it—this fear of theirs is unwarranted. For
					if there are more worlds than one, and each of them
					has received, as its meet portion, substance and
					matter having a restricted measure and limit, then
					there will be nothing left unplaced or unorganized,
					an unused remnant, as it were, to crash into them
					from the outside. For the law of reason over each
					world, having control over the matter assigned to
					each, will not allow anything to be carried away from
					it nor to wander about and crash into another world,
					nor anything from another world to crash into it,
					because Nature has neither unlimited and infinite
					magnitude nor irrational and disorganized movement.
					Even if any emanation is carried from some worlds to
					others, it is certain to be congenial, agreeable, and to
					unite peaceably with all, like the rays of starlight and
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.427"/>
					
					their blending ; and the worlds themselves must
					experience joy in gazing at one another with kindly
					eyes; and for the many good gods in each, they must
					provide opportunities for visits and a friendly welcome. Truly in all this there is nothing impossible
					or fabulous or contrary to reason unless, indeed,
					because of Aristotle's<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Aristotle, <hi rend="italics">De Caelo</hi>, i. 7 (276 a 18).</note> statements some persons shall
					look upon it with suspicion as being based on physical
					grounds. For if each of the bodies has its own
					particular place, as he asserts, the earth must of
					necessity turn toward the centre from all directions
					and the water be above it, settling below the lighter
					elements because of its weight. If, therefore, there
					be more worlds than one, it will come to pass that in
					many places the earth will rest above the fire and the
					air, and in many places below them ; and the air and
					the water likewise, in some places existing in positions in keeping with nature and in other places in
					positions contrary to nature. As this, in his opinion,
					is impossible, the inference is that there are neither
					two worlds nor more, but only this one, composed of
					the whole of matter and resting firmly in keeping
					with Nature, as befits the diversity of its bodies.

         <div1 type="section" n="26">
            <p>All this, however, has been put in a way that is
					more plausible than true. Look at it in this way, my
					dear Demetrius,&rdquo; said I ; &ldquo;when he says of the
					bodies that some have a motion towards the centre
					and downwards, others away from the centre and
					upwards, and others around the centre and in a
					circular path, in what relation does he take the
					centre ?<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 925 b and 1054 b.</note> Certainly not in relation to the void, for
					according to him it does not exist. And according to
					those for whom it does exist, it has no centre, just
					as it has no point where it begins or where it ends ;
					
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.429"/>
					
					for these are limitations, and the infinite has no limitations. And if a man could force himself, by reasoning, to dare the concept of a violent motion of the
					infinite, what difference, if referred to this, is created
					for the bodies in their movements ? For in the void
					there is no power in the bodies, nor do the bodies
					have a predisposition and an impetus, by virtue of
					which they cling to the centre and have a universal
					tendency in this one direction. It is equally difficult,
					in the case of inanimate bodies and an incorporeal and
					undifferentiated position, to conceive of a movement
					created from the bodies or an attraction created by
					the position. Thus one conclusion is left : when the
					centre is spoken of it is not with reference to any
					place, but with reference to the bodies. For in this
					world of ours, which has a single unity in its organization from numerous dissimilar elements, these differences necessarily create various movements towards
					various objects. Evidence of this is found in the fact
					that everything, when it undergoes transformation,
					changes its position coincidently with the change
					in its substance. For example, dispersion distributes
					upwards and round about the matter rising from the
					centre and condensation and consolidation press it
					down towards the centre and drive it together.

					for Nature to compose and fit together. It happens,
					however, that they do not all have one form of
					construction, nor have they all a similar origin, but
					the pyramid is the simplest and smallest, while the
					dodecahedron is the largest and most complicated.
					Of the remaining two the icosahedron is more than
					double the octahedron in the number of its triangles.
					For this reason it is impossible for them all to derive
					their origin from one and the same matter. For those
					that are simple and small and more rudimentary
					in their structure would necessarily be the first to
					respond to the instigating and formative power, and
					to be completed and acquire substantiality earlier
					than those of large parts and many bodies, from
					which class comes the dodecahedron, which requires
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.443"/>
					
					more labour for its construction. Hence it follows
					that the only primal body is the pyramid, and not one
					of the others, since by their nature they are outdistanced by it in coming into being. Accordingly,
					the remedy which exists for this strange state of
					affairs consists in the division and separation of matter
					into five worlds, one where the pyramid shall acquire
					substantiality first, another for the octahedron, and
					another for the icosahedron ; then from the one that
					first acquires substantiality in each world the rest
					will have their origin, since a transmutation for everything into everything takes place according to the
					adaptability of parts to fit together, as Plato<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Timaeus</hi>, 55 e ff.</note> himself
					has indicated, going into the details of nearly all cases.
					But for us it will suffice to acquire the knowledge
					in brief form. Since air is formed when fire is extinguished, and when rarefied again gives off fire out of
					itself, we must observe the behaviour of each of the
					generative elements and their transmutations. The
					generative elements of fire are the pyramid,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Does Plutarch (or Plato before him) see an etymological relation between <q direct="unspecified">pyramid</q> and <q direct="unspecified">pyr</q> (fire)?

					for air the octahedron, composed of forty-eight of the
					same. Therefore one element of air is produced
					from two corpuscles of fire combined and united ; and
					that of air again, when divided, is separated into two
					corpuscles of fire, and again, when compressed and
					condensed, it goes off into the form of water. The
					result is that in every case the one which first acquires
					substantiality always affords the others a ready means
					of coming into being through transmutation ; and it
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.445"/>
					
					is not one alone that first exists, but another in a
					different environment is endowed with movement,
					which takes the lead and forestalls the others in
					coming into being, and thus the name of being first
					is kept by all.</q>

						construction at the same time, but the simplest always,
						which requires the least trouble to construct, shall
						first issue forth into being. Then, as a corollary to
						this, and not conflicting with it, he lays down the
						principle that not all matter brings forth the simplest
						and most rudimentary form first, but that sometimes
						the ponderous and complex forms, in the time of their
						coming into being, are earlier in arising out of matter.
						But apart from this, five bodies having been postulated
						as primary, and on the strength of this the number of
						worlds being put as the same, he adduces probability
						with reference to four only ; the cube he has taken off
						the board, as if he were playing a game with counters,
						since, because of its nature, it cannot transmute itself
						into them nor confer upon them the power of transmutation into itself, inasmuch as the triangles are not
						homologous triangles. For in the others the common
						triangle which underlies them all is the half-triangle ;

						triangle, which makes no convergence towards the

					nothing more plausible to offer; but perhaps it is better
					to submit to examination on views of one's own rather
					than on another's. I repeat, therefore, what I said
					at the beginning, that if two natures be postulated,
					one evident to the senses, subject to change in creation and dissolution, carried now here now there,
					while the other is essentially conceptual and always
					remains the same, it is a dreadful thing that, while
					the conceptual nature has been parcelled out and
					has variety within itself, we should feel indignant
					and annoyed if anyone does not leave the corporeal
					and passive nature as a unity knit together and converging upon itself, but separates and parts it. For
					it is surely fitting that things permanent and divine
					should hold more closely together and escape, so far
					as may be, all segmentation and separation. But
					even on these the power of Differentiation has laid
					its hand and has wrought in things conceptual dissimilarities in reasons and ideas, which are vaster
					than the separations in location. Wherefore Plato,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Sophist</hi>, 256 c; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 391 b, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note>
					opposing those who declare for the unity of the whole,
					says that these five things exist: Being, Identity,
					
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.449"/>
					
					Differentiation, and, to crown all, Movement and
					Rest. Granted, then, that these five exist, it is not
					surprising if each of these five corporeal elements has
					been made into a copy and image of each of them
					respectively, not unmixed and unalloyed, but it is
					because of the fact that each of them participates
					most in its corresponding faculty. The cube is
					patently a body related to rest because of the security
					and stability of its plane surfaces. In the pyramid
					everybody may note its fiery and restless quality in
					the simplicity of its sides and the acuteness of its
					angles. The nature of the dodecahedron, which is
					comprehensive enough to include the other figures,
					may well seem to be a model with reference to all
					corporeal being. Of the remaining two, the icosahedron shares in the nature of Differentiation mostly,
					and the octahedron in that of Identity. For this
					reason the octahedron contributed air, which in a
					single form holds all being in its embrace, and the
					icosahedron water, which by admixture assumes the
					greatest variety of qualities. If, therefore, Nature
					demands an equal distribution in all things, there is
					a reasonable probability that the wrorlds which have
					been created are neither more nor less in number
					than the patterns, so that each pattern in each world
					may have the leading rank and power just as it has
					acquired it in the construction of the primary bodies.

					and to give your undivided attention to it: of
					those numbers which come at the very first (I mean
					the number one and the indeterminate duality), the
					second, being the element underlying all formlessness
					and disarrangement, has been called infinity; but
					the nature of the number one limits and arrests what
					is void and irrational and indeterminate in infinity,
					gives it shape, and renders it in some way tolerant
					and receptive of definition, which is the next step
					after demonstration regarding things perceptible.
					Now these first principles make their appearance at
					the beginning in connexion with number; rather,
					however, larger amounts are not number at all unless
					the number one, created from the illimitability of
					infinity, like a form of matter, cuts off more on
					one side and less on the other. Then, in fact, any of
					the larger amounts becomes number through being
					delimited by the number one. But if the number
					one be done away with, once more the indeterminate
					duality throws all into confusion, and makes it to be
					without rhythm, bounds, or measure. Inasmuch as
					form is not the doing away with matter, but a shaping
					and ordering of the underlying matter, it needs must
					be that both these first principles be existent in
					number, and from this has arisen the first and greatest
					divergence and dissimilarity. For the indeterminate
					first principle is the creator of the even, and the better
					one of the odd. Two is the first of the even numbers
					and three the first of the odd ; from the two combined comes five,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 388 a, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note> which in its composition is common
					to both numbers and in its potentiality is odd. For
					when the perceptible and corporeal was divided into
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.453"/>
					
					several parts because of the innate necessity of
					differentiation, that number had to be neither the
					first even nor the first odd, but the third number,
					which is formed from these two, so that it might
					be produced from both the primary principles, that
					which created the even and that which created the
					odd, because it was not possible for the one to
					be divorced from the other ; for each possesses the
					nature and the potentiality of a first principle. So
					when the twro were paired, the better one prevailed
					over the indeterminate as it was dividing the corporeal
					and checked it; and when matter was being distributed to the two, it set unity in the middle and
					did not allow the whole to be divided into two parts,
					but there has been created a number of worlds by
					differentiation of the indeterminate and by its being
					carried in varying directions ; yet the power of
					Identity and Limitation has had the effect of making
					that number odd, but the kind of odd that did not
					permit Nature to progress beyond what is best. If
					the number one were unalloyed and pure, matter
					would not have any separation at all ; but since it has
					been combined with the dividing power of duality, it
					has had to submit to being cut up and divided, but
					there it stopped, the even being overpowered by the
					odd.

					whether it is proper to speak of one or of five as in

					What takes place he describes more clearly by a
					simile,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Timaeus</hi>, 52 e.</note> saying that in a manner like to &lsquo;grain and

					it; and like always draws near1 to like, some things
					occupying one place and others another, before the
					universe becomes completely organized out of the
					elements. Thus, when matter was in that state in
					which, in all probability, is the universe from which God
					is absent, the first five properties, having tendencies

					because, when all things were amalgamated, the

					number of separate divisions with intervals between
					them, one not of pure fire, but fiery, another not of

					why deprive souls in bodies of that power by virtue
					of which the demigods possess the natural faculty
					of knowing and revealing future events before they
					happen ? For it is not likely that any power or portion accrues to souls when they have left the body,
					if they did not possess them before ; but the souls
					always possess them ; only they possess them to
					a slight degree while conjoined with the body, some
					of them being completely imperceptible and hidden,
					others weak and dim, and about as ineffectual and
					slow in operation as persons that try to see in a fog or
					to move about in water, and requiring much nursing
					and restoring of the functions that properly belong to
					them and the removal and clearing away of the covering which hides them. Just as the sun does not
					become bright when it bursts through the clouds,

					indistinct and dim, even so the soul does not acquire
					the prophetic power when it goes forth from the body
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.467"/>
					
					as from a cloud ; it possesses that power even now,
					but is blinded by being combined and commingled
					with the mortal nature. We ought not to feel surprised or incredulous at this when we see in the
					soul, though we see naught else, that faculty which
					is the complement of prophecy, and which we call
					memory, and how great an achievement is displayed
					in preserving and guarding the past, or rather what
					has been the present, since nothing of all that has
					come to pass has any existence or substantiality,
					because the very instant when anything comes to
					pass, that is the end of it — of actions, words, experiences alike ; for Time like an everflowing stream
					bears all things onward. But this faculty of the soul
					lays hold upon them, I know not how, and invests with
					semblance and being things not now present here.

            <p>&ldquo;It is not, therefore, anything to excite
					amazement if, although the earth sends up many
					streams, it is only such as these that dispose souls to
					inspiration and impressions of the future. Certainly
					the voice of legend also is in accord with my statement;
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.475"/>
					
					for they record that here the power hovering
					about this spot was first made manifest when a
					certain shepherd fell in by accident and later gave
					forth inspired utterances, which those who came into
					contact with him at first treated with disdain ; but
					later, when what he had foretold came to pass, they
					were amazed. The most learned of the people of
					Delphi still preserve the tradition of his name, which
					they say was Coretas. But I incline most to the
					opinion that the soul acquires towards the prophetic
					spirit a close and intimate connexion of the sort that
					vision has towards light, which possesses similar
					properties. For, although the eye has the power of
					vision, there is no function for it to perform without
					light<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See 436 d, <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>, and Plato, <hi rend="italics">Republic</hi>, 508 a - 509 b.</note>; and so the prophetic power of the soul, like an
					eye, has need of something kindred to help to kindle
					it and stimulate it further. Hence many among
					earlier generations regarded Apollo and the Sun as
					one and the same god ; but those who understood and
					respected fair and wise analogy conjectured that as
					body is to soul, vision to intellect, and light to truth,
					so is the power of the sun to the nature of Apollo ;
					and they would make it appear that the sun is his
					offspring and progeny, being for ever born of him that
					is for ever. For the sun kindles and promotes and
					helps to keep in activity the power of vision in our
					perceptive senses, just as the god does for the power
					of prophecy in the soul.

						logic in wresting the prophetic art from the gods and
						transferring it merely to the demigods. But now it
						seems to me that we are thrusting out these very
						demigods, in their turn, and driving them away from
						the oracle and the tripod here, when we resolve the
						origin of prophecy, or rather its very being and power,
						into winds and vapours and exhalations. For these
						temperings and heatings and hardenings that have
						been spoken of serve only the more to withdraw
						repute from the gods and suggest in regard to the
						final cause some such conclusion as Euripides<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Euripides, <hi rend="italics">Cyclops</hi>, 332-333.</note> makes

						But there is one difference : he says that he does not
						offer them in sacrifice to the gods, but to himself and
						to his &lsquo;belly, greatest of divinities,&rsquo; whereas we offer
						both sacrifices and prayers as the price for our oracles.
						What possesses us to do so, if our souls carry within
						themselves the prophetic power, and it is some
						particular state of the air or its currents which stirs
						this to activity ? And what is the significance of the
						
						<pb id="v.5.p.485"/>
						
						libations poured over the victims and the refusal to
						give responses unless the whole victim from the hoofjoints up is seized with a trembling and quivering, as
						the libation is poured over it ? Shaking the head is
						not enough, as in other sacrifices, but the tossing and
						quivering must extend to all parts of the animal alike
						accompanied by a tremulous sound ; and unless this
						takes place they say that the oracle is not functioning,
						and do not even bring in the prophetic priestess.
						Yet it is only on the assumption that they ascribe the
						cause almost entirely to a god or a demigod that it is
						reasonable for them to act and to believe thus ; but
						on the basis of what you say it is not reasonable. For
						the presence of the exhalation, whether the victim be
						excited or not, will produce the inspiration and will
						dispose the soul auspiciously, not only the soul of
						the priestess, but that of any ordinary person with
						whom it may come into contact. Wherefore it is
						silly to employ one woman alone for the purpose
						of the oracles and to give her trouble by watching
						her to keep her pure and chaste all her life. As a

						supply any means of knowing about the power
						with which the place is endowed, was not, I think,
						any different from the rest of the goatherds and

					argument and to upset or disturb any of the beliefs
					regarding the Deity which have been conceived in
					truth and in piety. I shall defend myself by citing
					Plato as my witness and advocate in one. That
					philosopher<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Phaedo</hi>, 97 b-c.</note> found fault with Anaxagoras, the one of
					early times, because he was too much wrapped up in
					the physical causes and was always following up and
					pursuing the law of necessity as it was worked out in
					the behaviour of bodies, and left out of account the
					purpose and the agent, which are better causes and
					origins. Plato himself was the first of the philosophers,
					or the one most prominently engaged in prosecuting
					investigations of both sorts, to assign to God, on the
					one hand, the origin of all things that are in keeping
					with reason, and on the other hand, not to divest
					matter of the causes necessary for whatever comes
					into being, but to realize that the perceptible universe, even when arranged in some such orderly way
					as this, is not pure and unalloyed, but that it takes
					its origin from matter when matter comes into conjunction with reason. Observe first how it is with the
					artists. Take as our first example the far-famed
					stand and base for the mixing-bowl here which

					but as yet they made no approach towards the compelling and natural causes. On the other hand the
					younger generation which followed them, and are
					called physicists or natural philosophers, reverse the
					procedure of the older school in their aberration from
					the beautiful and divine origin, and ascribe everything
					to bodies and their behaviour, to clashes, transmutations, and combinations. Hence the reasoning

					since the one ignores or omits the intermediary and the
					agent, the other the source and the means. He who
					was the first to comprehend clearly both these points
					and to take, as a necessary adjunct to the agent that
					creates and actuates, the underlying matter, which
					is acted upon, clears us also of all suspicion of wilful
					misstatement. The fact is that we do not make the
					prophetic art godless or irrational when we assign to
					it as its material the soul of a human being, and
					assign the spirit of inspiration and the exhalation as an
					instrument or plectrum for playing on it. For, in the
					first place, the earth, which generates the exhalation,
					and the sun, which endows the earth with all its power
					of tempering and transmutation, are, by the usage
					of our fathers, gods for us. Secondly, if we leave
					demigods as overseers, watchmen, and guardians of
					this tempered constitution, as if it were a kind of
					harmony, slackening here and tightening there on
					occasion, taking from it its too distracting and
					disturbing elements and incorporating those that are
					painless and harmless to the users, we shall not
					appear to be doing anything irrational or impossible.

            <p>Nor again, in offering the preliminary sacrifice
					to learn the god's will and in putting garlands on
					victims or pouring libations over them, are we doing
					anything to contradict this reasoning. For when the
					priests and holy men say that they are offering
					sacrifice and pouring the libation over the victim and
					observing its movements and its trembling, of what
					else do they take this to be a sign save that the god
					is in his holy temple ? For what is to be offered in
					sacrifice must, both in body and in soul, be pure,
					unblemished, and unmarred. Indications regarding
					the body it is not at all difficult to perceive, but they
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.495"/>
					
					test the soul by setting meal before the bulls and peas
					before the boars ; and the animal that does not eat of
					this they think is not of sound mind. In the case of
					the goat, they say, cold water gives positive proof;
					for indifference and immobility against being suddenly
					wet is not characteristic of a soul in a normal state.
					But for my part, even if it be firmly established that
					the trembling is a sign of the god's being in his holy
					temple and the contrary a sign of his not being there,
					I cannot see what difficulty in my statements results
					therefrom. For every faculty duly performs its
					natural functions better or worse concurrently with
					some particular time ; and if that time escapes our
					ken, it is only reasonable that the god should give
					signs of it.

            <p>&ldquo;I think, then, that the exhalation is not in
					the same state all the time, but that it has recurrent
					periods of weakness and strength. Of the proof on
					which I depend I have as witnesses many foreigners
					and all the officials and servants at the shrine. It is a
					fact that the room in which they seat those who would
					consult the god is filled, not frequently or with any
					regularity, but as it may chance from time to time,
					with a delightful fragrance coming on a current of air
					which bears it towards the worshippers, as if its source
					were in the holy of holies ; and it is like the odour
					which the most exquisite and costly perfumes send
					forth. It is likely that this efflorescence is produced
					by warmth or some other force engendered there.
					If this does not seem credible, you will at least all
					agree that the prophetic priestess herself is subjected
					to differing influences, varying from time to time,
					which affect that, part of her soul with which the spirit
					of inspiration comes into association, and that she
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.497"/>
					
					does not always keep one temperament, like a perfect
					concord, unchanged on every occasion. For many
					annoyances and disturbances of which she is conscious,
					and many more unpereeived, lay hold upon her body
					and filter into her soul; and whenever she is replete
					with these, it is better that she should not go there
					and surrender herself to the control of the god, when
					she is not completely unhampered (as if she were a
					musical instrument, well strung and well tuned), but
					is in a state of emotion and instability. Wine, for
					example, does not always produce the same state of
					intoxication in the toper,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 406 b, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note> nor the music of the flute
					the same state of exaltation in the votary ; but the
					same persons are roused now to less, now to more,
					extravagant conduct by the Bacchic revels or stimulated by the wine, as the temperament within them
					becomes different. But especially does the imaginative faculty of the soul seem to be swayed by the
					alterations in the body, and to change as the body
					changes, a fact which is clearly shown in dreams ; for
					at one time we find ourselves beset in our dreams by
					a multitude of visions of all sorts, and at another time
					again there comes a complete calmness and rest free
					from all such fancies. We ourselves know of Cleon
					here from Daulia and that he asserts that in all the
					many years he has lived he has never had a dream ;
					and among the older men the same thing is told of
					Thrasymedes of Heraea. The cause of this is the
					temperament of the body, just as that of persons who
					are prone to melancholy, at the other extreme, is
					subject to a multitude of dreams and visions ; wherefore they have the repute of possessing the faculty of
					dreaming straight; for since they turn now to this
					
					<pb id="v.5.p.499"/>
					
					and now to that in their imagery, like persons who
					shoot many arrows, they often manage to hit the
					mark.

            <p>&ldquo;Whenever, then, the imaginative and prophetic faculty is in a state of proper adjustment for
					attempering itself to the spirit as to a drug, inspiration
					in those who foretell the future is bound to come ;
					and whenever the conditions are not thus, it is bound
					not to come, or when it does come to be misleading,
					abnormal, and confusing, as we know in the case
					of the priestess who died not so long ago. As it
					happened, a deputation from abroad had arrhed to
					consult the oracle. The victim, it is said, remained
					unmoved and unaffected in any way by the first
					libations ; but the priests, in their eagerness to
					please, went far beyond their wonted usage, and only
					after the victim had been subjected to a deluge and
					nearly drowned did it at last give in. What, then,
					was the result touching the priestess ? She went
					down into the oracle unwillingly, they say, and halfheartedly ; and at her first responses it was at once
					plain from the harshness of her voice that she was not
					responding properly ; she was like a labouring ship
					and was filled with a mighty and baleful spirit.
					Finally she became hysterical and with a frightful
					shriek rushed towards the exit and threw herself
					down, with the result that not only the members of
					the deputation fled, but also the oracle-interpreter
					Nicander and those holy men that were present.
					However, after a little, they went in and took her
					up, still conscious ; and she lived on for a few
					days.

					&ldquo;It is for these reasons that they guard the chastity of the priestess, and keep her life free from all

					association and contact with strangers, and take the
					omens before the oracle, thinking that it is clear to the
					god when she has the temperament and disposition
					suitable to submit to the inspiration without harm to
					herself. The power of the spirit does not affect all
					persons nor the same persons always in the same way,
					but it only supplies an enkindling and an inception,
					as has been said, for them that are in a proper state
					to be affected and to undergo the change. The power
					comes from the gods and demigods, but, for all that,
					it is not unfailing nor imperishable nor ageless, lasting
					into that infinite time by which all things between
					earth and moon become wearied out, according to our
					reasoning. And there are some who assert that the
					things above the moon also do not. abide, but give
					out as they confront the everlasting and infinite, and
					undergo continual transmutations and rebirths.
