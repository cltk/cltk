            <p>AND does not justice rule the affairs of mortals,&mdash;nor
				impartiality, nor moderation, nor decorum? But was it
				of Fortune and long of Fortune that Aristides remained
				obstinate in his poverty, although he could have made
				himself master of much wealth? And that Scipio, when
				he had taken Carthage, neither received nor so much as
				saw any part of the booty ? Was it of Fortune and long
				of Fortune that Philocrates, having received a sum of
				gold of King Philip, laid it out in whores and fish? And
				that Lasthenes and Euthycrates, by measuring their happiness by their bellies and the most abject of follies, lost
				Olynthus? Was it of Fortune that Alexander son of
				Philip refrained from the captive women himself, and
				punished those that offered them any indignity; while
				Alexander, son of Priam, long of an evil Daemon and
				Fortune, first vitiated his host's wife and then took
				her away with him, and filled both the continents
				with war and calamities? And if such things as these
				can come by Fortune, what hinders but that we may
				as well plead that cats, goats, and monkeys are constrained by Fortune to be ravenous, lustful, and ridiculous?</p>
         </div1>

            <p>But if there be such things to be found as moderation, justice, and fortitude, how can it stand with reason
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.476"/>
				
				there should not be such a thing as wisdom also? And
				if there be wisdom, how can it be but there must be good
				counsel? For moderation is (as they are used to say) a
				certain sort of wisdom; and justice cannot subsist without wisdom. Certainly we call that good counsel and
				wisdom that render us manful in pleasures continence
				and moderation; in dangers and hardships, endurance
				and resolution; and in communities and public business,
				equality and justice. And therefore if we will needs have
				it that the effects of conduct belong to Fortune, let then
				both the effects of justice and moderation belong to Fortune also. Nay, by Jove, let stealing be ascribed to Fortune
				too, and cutting of purses, and a lustful lewd life ; and let
				us quit our reasoning quite, and turn ourselves loose to
				Fortune, to be carried and driven, like filth and dust, be
				fore an impetuous wind. If there be no such thing as
				conduct, it must of necessity follow, that there should be
				no such thing as advising about our affairs, nor any consultation or enquiry about utility; and that Sophocles did
				talk idly when he said:

            <p>and not by a certain power receptive of the strokes of the

					It would beseem us then, doubtless, to pay a due respect
					to our sense. But our sight, hearing, and smelling, with
					the other parts of our bodies' faculties, were bestowed
					upon us by nature to minister unto good conduct and discretion. And <q direct="unspecified">It is the mind that sees, and the mind that

            <p>Yea, in all these we are far more unhappy than the

            <p>Moreover, the affairs of carpenters are affairs of mortals, and so are those of copper-founders, builders, and
				statuaries; amongst whom yet we can see nothing brought
				to perfection by chance or at random. For that there falls in
				but little of Fortune to an expert artist, whether founder
				or builder, but that the most and greatest part of their
				workmanship is performed by mere art, hath been thus
				insinuated by a certain poet:
				<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <lg>
                     <l>Go forth into the street, ye craftsmen all,
				</l>
                     <l>Who on grim-visaged Ergana do call,
				</l>
                     <l>That's stuck with sacred baskets all around.</l>
                  </lg>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.479"/>
            <p>For the trades have Ergana and Minerva for their patroness,
					and not Fortune. It is indeed reported of one that, as he
					was drawing a horse and had hit right in all the rest, both
					shapes and colors, but was not well satisfied with the
					draught he had made of a puff of froth that was tempered by the bit and wrought out with the horse's breathing, he therefore had often wiped it off; but that at length
					he in a great fume struck his sponge full of colors, as it
					was, against the board, and that this, as it lighted, to admiration made a most lively impress, and so filled up what was
					defective in the piece. This is the only artificial work of
					Fortune that history mentions. Artists everywhere make
					use of rules, lines, measures, and arithmetical proportions,
					that their works may nowhere have in them any thing that
					is casual or fortuitous. And the truth is, arts are styled a
					sort of petty wisdoms, though they might be much better
					called certain sheddings or filings of it sprinkled upon the
					several needful services of human life; as is obscurely riddled to us in the fire feigned to have been first divided by
					Prometheus, and then scattered up and down the world.
					For just so, certain little particles and fragments of wisdom
					as it were crumbled and broken small fell into ranks and
					methods.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>It seems therefore very strange how it came to pass
				that arts should stand in no need of Fortune to compass
				their proper end, but that which is the greatest and most
				complete of all arts, and which is the very sum of man's
				worth and commendation, should prove to be nothing at
				all. But there is a kind of good counsel in stretching and
				slackening of strings, which they call the art of music; and
				in dressing of meats, which we call cookery; and in washing of clothes, which we call the art of fulling; and we
				teach our children how to put on their shoes and clothes,
				and to take their meat in their right hand, and hold their
				bread in their left; as being sensible that even such common
				
				<pb id="v.2.p.480"/>
				
				 things as these do not come by Fortune, but require
				attention and heed. But do the greatest things and the most
				important to a happy state require no wisdom, and have
				no share in rational proceeding and forecast? Yet no
				man ever wetted clay and then left it, as if there would
				be bricks by chance and Fortune; nor, having provided
				wool and leather, sat him down and prayed to Fortune that
				they might be made clothes and shoes for him; nor can
				any man, when he hath amassed together much gold and
				silver, and furnished himself with a multitude of slaves
				and attendants, and enclosed himself in a great palace with
				many gates, and set out costly couches and tables, fancy to
				himself that, if he have not wisdom with them, these things
				will be his happiness, and an undisturbed, blissful, and unchangeable life. One asked Iphicrates the general, by way
				of taunt, what he was ? For he was neither spearman nor
				archer, nor yet bore light armor. I am (replied he) one
				that commands and uses all these.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>In like manner wisdom is itself neither gold nor
				silver nor fame nor wealth nor health nor strength nor
				beauty. What then is it? It is what can use all these
				with decorum, and by means of which every one of these
				is made pleasant, commendable, and useful, and without
				which they become useless, unprofitable, and prejudicial,
				and the burthen and shame of their possessors. Hesiod's
				Prometheus therefore gives very good advice to Epimetheus:
				<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <lg>
                     <l>Brother, be sure you never take
				</l>
                     <l>A boon from Jove, but giv't him back,</l>

                  </lg>
               </quote>
            </p>
            <p>meaning things of Fortune and external. For, as if he
					had bid him not to play on a flute if ignorant of music,
					nor to read a book if he knew not his letters, nor to ride if
					he understood not a horse, so it would be if he advised
					him not to govern if a fool, nor to be a rich man if a miser,
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.481"/>
					
					and not to marry if apt to be ruled by a woman. For success above desert is to fools an occasion of misthinking, as
					Demosthenes<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Olynth. I. p. 16, 1.</note> saith; yes, and good fortune above desert
					is to the unwise an occasion of misdoing.</p>
