            <head>HOW A MAN MAY BECOME AWARE OF HIS PROGRESS IN VIRTUE (QUOMODO QUIS SUOS IN
					VIRTUTE SENTIAT PROFECTUS) <lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>The essay on Progress in Virtue is one of Plutarch's polemics against the Stoics,
					and is directed mainly against two of the doctrines of the Stoic philosophy. The
					first is that the wise man alone is virtuous, and that wisdom with attendant
					virtue is a sudden acquisition with no preliminary stages ; the second is in a
					way the corollary of the first, since, if a man is not perfect (i.e. wise), it
					may be argued that it matters little how trivial is his imperfection and whether
					his faults be great or small. <q direct="unspecified">He that offendeth in one point is guilty
						of all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Against such doctrines as these Plutarch's strong common sense revolts, and he
					endeavours to show not only that ethical advance is possible, but that there are
					plenty of signs by which it can be recognized.</p>
            <p>The essay is addressed (or dedicated) to Q. Sosius <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">So spelled in the best MSS. of Pliny and in inscriptions. <foreign lang="greek">*so/ssios</foreign> is found in Greek inscriptions.</note> Senecio, one of Plutarch's
					numerous Roman friends, who was twice consul in the early years of Trajan's
					reign. It was at his request that Plutarch composed the Symposiacs, in which his
					name frequently appears, and to him are inscribed also the parallel lives of
					Theseus and Romulus, Demosthenes and Cicero, and Dion and Brutus. Plutarch had
					been with him much in Rome, and he had visited Plutarch in Greece. It is
					doubtless the same Sosius whom the younger Pliny addressed in two letters (i. 13
					and iv. 4) which have come down to us. a So spelled in the best mss. of Pliny
					and in inscriptions.</p>

            <p>What possible form of argument, my dear Sosius Senetio, will keep alive in a mak
					the consciousness that he is growing better in regard to virtue, if it is a fact
					that the successive stages of his progress produce no abatement of his unwisdom,
					but, on the contrary, vice constantly besets all progress, and with
					countervailing weight drags him down, <quote rend="blockquote">As leaden weights

               </quote> For, by the same token, in music or grammar a man
					would not realize that he was making any improvement if in the process of
					learning he should in no wise lower the level of his ignorance about these
					subjects, and his lack of proficiency should all the time persist to the same
					degree. So, too, in the case of a sick man, a course of treatment that should
					not in some way effect an easing and alleviation of the malady, by making it to
					yield and let go its hold on him, would not afford him any perception of a
					change for the better until the opposite condition had been unmistakably
					engendered, his body having completely recovered its strength. On the contrary,
					just as in these cases persons make no progress unless their progress is marked
					by such an abatement of what is oppressing them, that, when the scale turns <pb id="v1.p.403"/> and they swing upward in the opposite direction, they can
					note the change, so too, in the study of philosophy, neither progress nor any
					sense of progress is to be assumed, if the soul does not put aside any of its
					gross stupidity and purge itself thereof, and if, up to the moment of its
					attaining the absolute and perfect good, it is wedded to evil which is also
					absolute. Why, if this be so, the wise man in a moment or a second of time
					changes from the lowest possible depravity to an unsurpassable state of virtue ;
					and all his vice, of which he has not in long years succeeded in removing even a
					small portion, he suddenly leaves behind for ever. Yet you doubtless know that,
					on the other hand, the authors of such assertions make for themselves much
					trouble and great difficulties over the unwitting man,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plutarch deals more fully with this topic in the essay, <q direct="unspecified">Inconsistencies of the Stoics,</q> 
                  <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 1042 F.</note> who has as yet failed to
					apprehend the fact that he has become wise, but does not know, and hesitates to
					believe, that his advancement, which has been effected by the gradual and
					longcontinued process of divesting himself of some qualities and adding others,
					has, as walking brings one where he would be, imperceptibly and quietly brought
					him into virtue's company. But if there were such a swiftness in the change and
					a difference so vast, that the man who was the very worst in the morning should
					have become the very best at evening, or should the change so come about that he
					who was a worthless dolt when he fell asleep should awake wise, and, having
					dismissed from his soul his gross stupidities and false concepts of yesterday,
					could exclaim : <quote rend="blockquote">False dreams, farewell! Ye are but naught, it seems,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Euripides, <hi rend="italics">Iphigenia in Tauris</hi>, 569.</note>

               <pb id="v1.p.405"/> —who would fail to recognize that a great difference like
					this had been wrought in his own self, and that the light of wisdom had all at

					cowardly, foolish, and licentious, and transferred from a bestial to a godlike
					life, should for a single second not perceive what had happened to him. </p>

         <div1 type="section" n="2">

					rather try to force the facts into an unnatural agreement with their own
					assumptions, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Aimed at the Stoics.</note> have filled philosophy with a great number of difficulties, of
					which the greatest is that which would assign all men to a general category of
					badness with the single exception of the absolutely perfect man ; the result of
					which is to make a puzzle out of what we call progress, since it falls but
					little short of the uttermost foolishness, and represents men who have been
					released by it from all kinds of passions and weaknesses as living in a state of
					equal wretchedness with those who have not yet been freed from a single one of
					the worst evils. Now these men really refute themselves when, in their lectures,
					they put the wrongdoing of Aristeides on an equality with that of Phalaris, and
					the cowardice of Brasidas on an equality with that of Dolon, and the
					hard-hearted attitude of Plato 
					<pb id="v1.p.407"/> as actually not differing at all from that of Meletus;
					whereas in their life and practice they show an aversion for these latter men
					and avoid them as ruthless, but the former they seem to think are men of great
					worth, for they cite them with confidence in the most important matters. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>But as for us, we observe that there are degrees in every kind of evil, and
					especially in the indeterminate and undefined kind that has to do with the soul.
					(In the same way also there are different degrees of progress produced by the
					abatement of baseness like a receding shadow, as reason gradually illuminates
					and purifies the soul.) We do not, therefore, think that consciousness of the
					change is unreasonable in the case of persons who are, as it were, making their
					way upward out of some deep gorge, but that there are ways in which it can be
					computed. Of these I beg you to consider the first without further preface. Just
					as men sailing out into the open sea calculate their run by the time elapsed in
					conjunction with the strength of the wind, reckoning how much distance, after
					spending a certain time, while carried onward by a certain force, they are
					likely to have accomplished ; so too in philosophy a man may take for himself as
					a proof that he is gaining ground the uniformity and continuity of his course,
					which makes on the way no frequent halts, followed by leaps and bounds, but
					smoothly and regularly forges ahead, and goes through the course of philosophic
					reasoning without mishap. For the lines : <quote rend="blockquote">If even small upon the small you place
						And do this oft,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Hesiod, <hi rend="italics">Works and Days</hi>, 361. Quoted more fully <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>, 9 E.</note>
               </quote> are not merely well put in regard to the increase of <pb id="v1.p.409"/> money, but they apply to everything, and especially to
					advancement in virtue, since reason thereby gains the aid of constant and
					effective habit. But the variation and obtuseness often shown by students of
					philosophy not only cause delays and stoppages in their progress on the road to
					knowledge, but also bring about retrogressions, since vice always makes an onset
					on the man who yields ground by loitering, and carries him backward in the
					opposite direction. Mathematicians tell us that the planets, when their forward
					movement ceases, become for the moment stationary, but in the study of
					philosophy there is no intermission when progress halts, nor any such thing as
					remaining stationary, but Nature, being never free from motion of some sort, is
					wont to move up or down, as though suspended on a balance, and to be swayed by
					the better motives, or else under the influence of the contrary motives it moves
					rapidly towards what is worse. If therefore you follow the advice given by the
					god in the oracle, to <q direct="unspecified">fight the Cirrhaeans all days and all
						nights,</q> and are conscious that you likewise in the daytime and the
					nighttime have always carried on an unrelenting warfare against vice, or at
					least that you have not often relaxed your vigilance nor constantly granted
					admission to divers pleasures, recreations, and pastimes, which are, as it were,
					envoys sent by vice to treat for a truce, it is then quite probable that you may
					go on with good courage and confidence to what still remains. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="4">
            <p>However, even though it be that intermissions occur in one's philosophical
					studies, yet if the later periods of study are more constant and <pb id="v1.p.411"/> long-continued than they were earlier, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Somer editors would amen the text here, and perhaps rightly, to make the text correspond better to what the sense plainly requires.</note> this is no slight
					indication that the spirit of indifference is being expelled through industry
					and practice; but there is something pernicious in the opposite condition, when
					numerous and continued set-backs occur after no long time, as if the spirit of
					eagerness were withering away. We may compare a reed, the growth of which at its
					beginning has a very great impetus, which results in an even and continuous
					length, at first in long sections, since it meets with few obstacles and
					repulses, but later, as though for lack of breath as it gets higher up, it grows
					weak and weary, and is gathered up in the many frequent nodules, when the
					life-giving spirit meets with buffets and shocks ; so with philosophy, those who
					at the outset engage in long excursions into its realms and later meet with a
					long series of obstacles and distractions without becoming aware of any change
					toward the better, finally get wearied out, and give up. But a man of the other
					type <q direct="unspecified">is again given wings</q> 
               <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Homer, <hi rend="italics">Iliad</hi>, xix. 386.</note> by the help he gets as he is
					carried onward, and by the strength and eagerness born of successful
					accomplishment brushes aside pretences as though they were a hindering crowd in
					his path. In the same way that an indication of the beginning of love is to be
					found, not in the taking delight in the presence of the loved one (for this is
					usual), but in feeling a sting of pain when separated ; just so are many allured
					by philosophy and seem to take hold of the task of learning with high
					aspirations, but if they are forced by other business and occupations to leave
					it, all that excitement of theirs subsides and they no longer care. But <pb id="v1.p.413"/> 
               <quote rend="blockquote">He in whose heart the prick of youthful love <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Graec. Frag., Sophocles</hi>, No. 757; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 619 A.</note>

					but when he is separated and apart from them, behold him ardent and troubled,
					and dissatisfied with all business and occupations, and, cherishing the mere
					recollection, he is driven about like an irrational being by his yearning
					towards philosophy. For we ought not to enjoy being present at discussions as we
					enjoy the presence of perfumes, and then when we are removed from them not seek
					after them or even feel uneasy ; but we ought in our periods of separation to
					experience a sensation akin in a way to hunger and thirst, and so be led to
					cleave to what makes for real progress, whether it chance to be a wedding or
					wealth or the duties of friendship or military service that causes the temporary
					parting. For the greater the acquisition from philosophy is, the more annoyance
					there is in being cut off from it. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>Quite the same as this, or nearly the same, is the very ancient elucidation of
					progress found in Hesiod,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Works ad Days</hi>, 289.</note> which sets forth that the way is no longer uphill,
					nor very steep, but easy and smooth and readily accomplished, as though it were
					made smooth by practice, and as though it brought on a light, which is to be
					found in the study of philosophy, and an illumination succeeding upon
					perplexity, errant thought, and much vacillation, which students of philosophy
					encounter at the outset, like persons who have left behind the land which they
					know and are not yet in sight of the land to which they are sailing. For having
					given up the common and familiar things before gaining knowledge and possession
					of the better, they are carried hither and thither in the <pb id="v1.p.415"/>
					interval, and oftentimes in the wrong direction. An illustration is the story
					told about Sextius, the Roman, to the effect that he had renounced his honours
					and offices in the State for philosophy, but, because he was impatient and found
					the subject difficult at the outset, he came very near throwing himself down
					from an upper story. A similar tale, too, they record about Diogenes <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The story is found also in Aelian, <hi rend="italics">Var. Hist.</hi> xiii. 26.</note> of Sinope
					at the beginning of his devotion to philosophy. The Athenians were keeping
					holiday with public banquets and shows in the theatre and informal gatherings
					among themselves, and indulging in merry-making the whole night long, while
					Diogenes, huddled up in a corner trying to sleep, fell into some very disturbing
					and disheartening reflexions how he from no compulsion had entered upon a
					toilsome and strange mode of life, and as a result of his own act he was now
					sitting without part or parcel in all these good things. A moment later,
					however, a mouse, it is said, crept up and busied itself with the crumbs of his
					bread, whereupon he once more recovered his spirits, and said to himself as
					though rebuking himself for cowardice, <q direct="unspecified">What are you saying, Diogenes ?
						Your leavings make a feast for this creature, but as for you, a man of birth
						and breeding, just because you cannot be getting drunk over there, reclining
						on soft and flowery couches, do you bewail and lament your lot ?</q>
					Now when such fits of dejection become of infrequent occurrence and the
					objections and protests made by sound sense against them quickly come to our
					help, as though rallying after a temporary rout, and easily dissipate our
					depression and dismay, we may well believe that our progress rests on a firm
					foundation. <pb id="v1.p.417"/>
				        </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>Since, however, students of philosophy are not of themselves the only source of
					the dejecting and reactionary influences, which, as the result of weakness,
					affect them, but since also the sober advice of friends and the bitter
					criticisms of the unfriendly, in the form of scoffing and joking, cause a
					warping and weakening of purpose, and have even made some persons renounce
					philosophy altogether, no slight indication of progress would be shown by
					gentleness of demeanour in the face of such criticisms, and by not being
					disturbed or irritated by those who name this or that acquaintance of about the
					same age, and tell how he is prospering at Court, or getting a big dower at
					marriage, or going down to the Forum, attended by a great crowd, to stand for
					some office or to advocate some cause. For plainly the man who is not
					disconcerted or affected under such circumstances is one on whom philosophy has
					got a right hold. For to cease emulating what the great majority admire is
					impossible, except for those who have acquired the faculty of admiring virtue.
					For to confront the world boldly is with some people possible only under the
					influence of anger or mental derangement ; but to contemn actions which the
					world admires is quite impossible without real and solid wisdom. This is the
					reason why they compare their own state with the other and vaunt themselves over
					it, as does Solon : <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Bergk, <hi rend="italics">Poetae Lyrici Graeci</hi>, ii. 427, No. 15. Quoted by Plutarch also, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 92 E, 472 D, and <hi rend="italics">Life of Solon</hi>, ch. iii. (p. 79 F).</note>

					from Corinth to Athens, and from Athens to Corinth <pb id="v1.p.419"/> again,
					with the sojourns of the Persian king at Susa in the spring, at Babylon in the
					winter, and in Media in the summer. So too Agesilaus remarked in regard to the
					Great King, <q direct="unspecified">In what is he greater than I, unless he be more just ?
					</q> And Aristotle, writing to Antipater about Alexander, said that it was
					not Alexander alone who had the right to be proud because he held sway over
					many, but any man had just as good a right, if he had the correct ideas about
					God. <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

            <p>Whenever, then, by thus setting the advantages of virtue over against merely
					external advantages, you have succeeded in dispelling all envy and jealousy and
					the things that vex and depress many beginners in philosophy, you are thus again
					making clear to yourself in a significant way the reality of your progress. Of
					no slight significance either is the change which occurs in one's discourse. For
					practically all beginners in philosophy are more inclined to pursue those forms
					of discourse which make for repute ; some of these beginners, like birds, are
					led by their flightiness and ambition to alight on the resplendent heights of
					the Natural Sciences; while others, <q direct="unspecified">like puppies, delighting to pull and
						tear,</q> as Plato puts it, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Republic</hi>, 539 B.</note> go in for the disputations, knotty
					problems, and quibbles ; but the majority enter a course in Logic and
					Argumentation, where they straightway stock themselves up for the practice of
					sophistry ; while a few go about making a collection of apophthegms and
					anecdotes, but, as Anacharsis said of the Greeks that he never saw them put
					their money to any use <pb id="v1.p.421"/> save to count it, so these persons
					are for ever foolishly taking account and inventory of their literary stock, but
					they lay up nothing else which would be to their own profit. Quite in place here
					is Antiphanes' <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> the elaboration of this idea by Addison in the <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, No. 254 (Nov. 23, 1710), and by Rabelais in <hi rend="italics">Pantagruel</hi>, iv. 55 and 56, as well as the postilion's horn in Baron Munchausen's <hi rend="italics">Adventures</hi>, chap. vi.</note> story, which somebody has recounted and applied to Plato's
					close acquaintances. Antiphanes said humorously that in a certain city words
					congealed with the cold the moment they were spoken, and later, as they thawed
					out, people heard in the summer what they had said to one another in the winter
					; it was the same way, he asserted, with what was said by Plato to men still in
					their youth ; not until long afterwards, if ever, did most of them come to
					perceive the meaning, when they had become old men. And this is the general
					experience with philosophy as a whole until the judgement acquires a healthy
					stability, and begins to find itself in accord with principles productive of
					character and breadth of mind, and to look for the kind of discourse whose
					footprints, in the words of Aesop, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">In <hi rend="italics">Lion and Fox</hi>, No. 137 in the <hi rend="italics">Fables</hi> passing as Aesop's.</note> are turned toward us rather than away from
					us. For as Sophocles said, that only after handling with a light touch the
					turgidity of Aeschylus and next his harshness and artificiality in composition,
					did he, as a third step, change the character of the language, which has the
					most to do with moral character and goodness, so, in the same way, when students
					of philosophy pass from the ostentatious and artificial to the kind of discourse
					which deals with character and feeling they begin to make real and unaffected
					progress. </p>

            <p>Observe, then, not only when you are perusing the writings of philosophers and

					the alert for passages which involve something difficult and odd rather than for
					those which convey something useful, substantial, and beneficial; moreover, when
					you are busying yourself with poems and history, you must watch yourself to see
					whether anything escapes you among the ideas which are suitably expressed and
					tend to improvement of character or alleviation of emotion. For as Simonides <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Bergk, <hi rend="italics">Poet. Lyr. Graec.</hi> iii. 411, <hi rend="italics">Simon.</hi> No. 47; quoted also <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 41 F and 494 A.</note>

						care,</quote> while the rest of the world contents itself with their colour and
					fragrance, getting nothing else from them, so, while the rest of the world
					ranges amid poems for the sake of pleasure or diversion, if a man, through his
					own initiative, finds and collects something worth while, it is reasonable to
					expect that he at last, from force of habit and fondness for what is beautiful
					and appropriate, has made himself capable of appreciating it. In the case, for
					example, of persons who make use of Plato and Xenophon for their language, and
					gather therefrom nothing else but the purity of the Attic style, like dew and
					bloom, what can you say of them, save that they are the sort of persons that
					content themselves with the sweet odour and bouquet of medicines, but have no
					desire for their sedative and purgative virtues, nor the power to discern them ?
					But those who are making still more and more progress are always able to derive
					benefit, not only from what is said, but also from what is seen and done, and to
					gather what is appropriate and useful therefrom. <pb id="v1.p.425"/> Examples
					are found in the stories told of Aeschylus and of others like him. Aeschylus at
					the Isthmian games was watching a boxing-match, and when one of the men was hit
					the crowd in the theatre burst into a roar. Aeschylus nudged Ion of Chios, and
					said, <q direct="unspecified">You see what a thing training is ; the man who is hit says nothing

               <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Repeated in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 190 B and 219 C, and with some variation, 208 F.</note> Diogenes <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

					sight of a man drinking from his hands took his cup from his wallet and threw it
					away. Thus attention and intense application makes persons perceptive and
					receptive of anything that conduces to virtue, from whatever source it come.
					This is more apt to be the case if they combine theory with practice, not only,
					as Thucydides <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Thucydides, i. 18.</note> said, <q direct="unspecified">carrying on their practice amid dangers,</q>
					but also when confronted by pleasures or contentions, and when busy over

					still studying, and busily looking to see what they can get from philosophy
					which they can straightway haul out for display in the Forum, or at a gathering
					of young men, or at an evening party at Court, ought not to be thought to

            <p>It is therefore imperative that we consider carefully whether, as for ourselves,
					we employ our discourse for our own improvement, and whether, as it affects
					others, we employ it, not for the sake of momentary repute, nor from motives of
					ambition, but rather with the wish to hear and to impart something ; but most of
					all must we consider whether the spirit of contention and quarrelling over
					debatable questions has been put down, and whether we have ceased to equip
					ourselves with arguments, as with boxing-gloves or brass knuckles, with which to
					contend against one another, and to take more delight in scoring a hit or a
					knockout than in learning and imparting something. For reasonableness and
					mildness in such matters, and the ability to join in discussions without
					wrangling, and to close them without anger, and to avoid a sort of arrogance
					over success in argument and exasperation over defeat, are the marks of a man
					who is making adequate progress. Aristippus made this clear when he was once
					outwitted in an argument by a man who had plenty of assurance, but was otherwise
					foolish and flighty. For seeing that the man was rejoicing and in great conceit,
					Aristippus said, <q direct="unspecified">For all that I have been defeated I am going home to
						enjoy a sweeter sleep than you who have defeated me.</q> It is possible
					also in the practice of speaking to <pb id="v1.p.429"/> take some measure of
					ourselves, if, when a large audience has unexpectedly assembled, we do not
					suffer from stage-fright, and if we are not dispirited when arguing in the
					presence of a small number ; and if, when the need has arisen to speak before
					the people or a magistrate, we do not let the occasion slip through lack of time
					to put our discourse into orderly form, as is told, for instance, of Demosthenes
					and Alcibiades. For the latter, although most keen in thinking out his subject
					matter, yet because of a certain lack of confidence about his manner of
					speaking, used to interrupt himself in the midst of his subject, and oftentimes,
					through his quest and pursuit of an elusive word or phrase while actually
					engaged in speaking, he made a flat failure. But Homer felt no repugnance
					against making the very first of his lines unmetrical; <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Traditionally the reference is to *phlhia/dew</note>, <hi rend="italics">Iliad</hi>, i. 1. so abounding was his
					confidence regarding the rest on account of his ability. It is rather to be

					will avail themselves of the occasion and the subject, and give least thought to
					the shouting and applause that may be called forth by their manner of speaking.

            <p>Everybody, without exception, ought to pay careful attention, not only to his
					words, but also to his actions, to see whether the element of usefulness in them
					prevails over ostentation, and whether their whole aim is the truth rather than
					display For if true love for a youth or a woman does not seek witnesses, but
					enjoys the fruits of pleasure even if it consummate its desire in secret, it is
					even more to be expected that the lover of honour and wisdom, in the familiar
					intercourse with virtue which comes through his actions, should keep his pride
					in himself to himself <pb id="v1.p.431"/> and be silent, feeling no need of
					eulogists and auditors. Take, for example, the case of the man who in his own
					house called his maidservant and cried out, <q direct="unspecified">Look at me, Dionysia ; I
						have stopped being conceited</q> ; very much like this is the behaviour
					of the man who performs some gracious and civil action, and then by telling
					about it and circulating it everywhere makes it clear that he is still looking
					beyond himself, and is still attracted toward repute, and that he has not yet
					had even a glimpse of virtue, nay, that he is not really awake but only dreaming
					as he roams about amid the shadows and phantoms of virtue, and afterwards puts
					what he has done on view like a painting. It is therefore the mark of a man who
					is making progress, not only when he has given to a friend or done a kindness to
					an acquaintance to refrain from telling of it to others, but also when he has
					given an honest judgement amidst a numerous and dishonest majority, when he has
					peremptorily declined a discreditable conference with some rich man or some
					official, when he has scorned bribes, and even when he has felt a craving in the

					and taking root in his own self, and, in the words of Democritus, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Diels, <hi rend="italics">Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</hi>, ii. 88.</note> that he is

					assurance and a pose and a gait, and a countenance filled with a haughtiness and
					disdain which spares nobody ; but, as their heads begin to fill and to
					accumulate some fruitage from their lectures and reading, they lay aside their
					swagger and superficiality. And just as when empty vessels are being filled with
					a liquid the air inside is expelled by the pressure, so when men are being
					filled with the really good things, their conceit gives way and their
					self-opinion becomes less inflexible ; and, ceasing to feel pride in their
					philosopher's beard and gown, they transfer their training to their mind, and
					apply their stinging and bitter criticism most of all to themselves, and are
					milder in their intercourse with others. They do not arrogate to themselves, as
					before, the name of philosophy and the repute of studying it, or even give
					themselves the title of philosopher ; in fact, a young man of good parts, on

					are immediately attentive in awe and silence, so too at the beginning of
					philosophy ; about its portals also you will see great tumult and talking and

            <p>Of persons needing the services of a physician those who have a painful tooth or

					their assistance ; but those who have reached a state of melancholia or frenzy
					or delirium sometimes cannot endure even the physicians' visits, but either
					drive them away or run away from them, not realizing even that they are ill,
					because of the violence of their illness. So also of the erring : the incurable
					are those who take an hostile and savage attitude and show a hot temper toward
					those who take them to task and admonish them, while those who patiently submit
					to admonition and welcome it are in less serious plight. And for a man who is in
					error to submit himself to those who take him to task, to tell what is the
					matter with him, to disclose his depravity, and not to rejoice in hiding his
					fault or to take satisfaction in its not being known, but to confess it, and to
					feel the need of somebody to take him in hand and admonish him, is no slight
					indication of progress. So Diogenes <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Again referred to, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 74 C, and in 89 B it is ascribed to Antisthenes.</note> has somewhere said that, as a matter of
					self-preservation, a man should be concerned to find either an earnest friend or
					an ardent enemy, so that either by stern reprehension or by kindly attention he
					may escape vice. But just so long as a man, displaying a spot or a stain on his
					garment or a rip in his shoe, puts on airs in public by affecting a silly
					unconcern for such matters, or, by passing some jest about himself for being
					dwarfed or humpbacked, imagines that he is thus showing a spirit of youthful
					bravado, while, at the same time, the inward ugliness of his soul, the
					despicable acts of his life, his displays of pettiness or love of pleasure or
					malice or envy, he covers up and conceals as though they were ulcerous sores,
					and allows nobody to touch them or even see them because of his fear of being
						<pb id="v1.p.439"/> reprehended for them—such a man's part in progress is
					little, or rather none at all. But the man who grapples with these faults,
					especially if he shows himself able and willing to make himself unhappy and
					wretched over his errors, and, next to that, to submit to another's admonitions
					without flinching, and with a spirit made purer by such reproofs—such a man
					truly has every appearance of trying to divest himself of baseness and of
					abominating it. Beyond all question, anyone ought to have enough selfrespect to
					avoid even giving the impression of being bad; but the man who is more disturbed
					over the actual existence of baseness than over any ill-repute does not try to
					avoid uncomplimentary remarks to himself, or replying to them, when this may be
					made a means of improvement. Very neat was the remark made by Diogenes to a
					young man, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">According to Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 847 F, and Diogenes Laertius, vi. 2. 34, the young man was Demosthenes the orator.</note> who, being seen at a tavern, fled for refuge within. <q direct="unspecified">The
						farther you flee inside,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">the more you are in the

					the deeper does he become involved in vice, and cut off his escape therefrom.
					So, too, it is that among poor people those who make a show of being rich are
					even poorer because of their pretension ; but the man who is making true
					progress takes as his example Hippocrates, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Hippocrates' Works, ed. Chartier, ix. 340 F (Kuhn, iii. 561); <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> also Celsus, viii. 4; Quintilian, iii. 6. 64, and Julian, <hi rend="italics">Epist.</hi> 58 (<q direct="unspecified">To Dionysius</q>).</note> who published and recorded his
					failure to apprehend the facts about the cranial sutures ; for such a man
					accounts it a dreadful thing, that here was Hippocrates who declared his own
					error so that others should not repeat his experience, and yet he himself, a man
					bent on saving his soul alive, should not have the courage to submit to
					 <pb id="v1.p.441"/> being taken to task, and to confess his fatuity and ignorance. Indeed the
					declarations of Bion and Pyrrho might be construed as indication, not merely of
					progress, but rather of a higher state of mind and one which comes nearer to the
					ideal. Bion said to his intimate friends that they might well be justified in
					thinking that they were making progress when they could listen to their revilers
					as though they heard them say ; <quote rend="blockquote">Friend, since you have not the look of a man

            <p>Note also the significance of Zeno's statement. For he said that every man might
					fairly derive from his dreams a consciousness that he was making progress if he
					observed that during his period of sleep he felt no pleasure in anything
					disgraceful, and did not tolerate or commit any dreadful or untoward action, but
					as though in the clear depth of an absolute calm there came over him the radiant
					thought that the fanciful and emotional element in his soul had been dispelled
					by reason. Plato, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Republic</hi>, 571 D; the entire passage should be compared.</note> apparently realizing this even earlier, has given form and
					expression to the operations of the fanciful and irrational element in a
					naturally despotic soul <pb id="v1.p.443"/> during sleep. <q direct="unspecified">It attempts
						incest,</q> and feels a sudden hunger for a great variety of food,
					acting in lawless fashion, and giving loose rein to the desires which in the
					daytime the law keeps confined by means of shame and fear. Now well-trained
					beasts of burden, even if their driver lets go the reins, do not attempt to turn
					aside and leave the road, but in their accustomed manner they go on in their
					places and keep to their course without mishap ; and so it is in the case of
					persons in whom the irrational impulse has already been rendered obedient and
					gentle by reason and has been thoroughly chastened ; neither during sleep nor as
					a result of illness is it willing any longer to indulge readily in arrogance or
					lawlessness because of the desires, but it observes and bears in mind the habit
					it has acquired, and it is this which endows our vigilance with strength and
					intensity. For if the body by virtue of training is actually capable of
					rendering itself and its members so obedient to its injunctions of indifference
					that the eyes refrain from tears at a piteous sight, and the heart from
					throbbing in the midst of terrors, and the passions chastely remain unexcited
					and undisturbed in the presence of youthful or maidenly beauty, is it not indeed
					even more probable that training, by taking hold of the emotional element in the
					soul, will, as it were, do away with the irregularities and vagaries of our
					fancies and incitements, and carry its repression of them even into our slumbers
					? There is a story, illustrating this point, about the philosopher Stilpo, who
					thought in his slumber that he saw Poseidon, who was angry at him for not having
					offered up a bull, which was the customary sacrifice; but he himself, in his
					dream, nowise disconcerted, replied, <q direct="unspecified">What are you saying, <pb id="v1.p.445"/> Poseidon ? Do you come whining like a child because I
						did not run into debt to fill the city with the savour of burnt offerings,
						but presented a modest offering from what I had in my house ?</q> And
					then it seemed to him that Poseidon smiled and held out his hand, and said that
					he would send an abundance of anchovies to the Megarians for Stilpo's sake. So
					in the case of persons blessed with dreams so pleasant and bright and
					untroubled, who experience in their hours of slumber no revival of anything
					terrifying or repellent nor of any act of malice or improbity, men like Zeno
					assert that such manifestations are bright reflections of their progress, but
					that torturing memories, perturbations, ignoble desertions, and childish
					transports of joy and sorrow, such as are experienced in dismal or abnormal
					dreams, are like to billows that break and toss, inasmuch as the soul does not
					yet possess the power to keep itself in order, but is still being moulded by
					external opinions and laws, and when it gets farthest away from these during the
					hours of slumber, it is again made free and open to other influences by the
					emotions. <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

            <p>Inasmuch as complete indifference is a great and divine thing, whereas progress,
					as they say, resembles a sort of abatement and moderation of the emotions, it is
					our duty to compare our present emotions with their former selves and with one
					another, and thus determine the differences. We must compare them with their
					former selves, to see whether the desires and fears and angry passions <pb id="v1.p.447"/> which we experience to-day are less intense than they used
					to be, inasmuch as we, by means of reason, are rapidly getting rid of the cause
					that kindles and inflames them ; and we must compare them with one another, to
					see whether now we are more inclined to feel shame than fear, to be emulous
					rather than envious, more eager for good repute than for money, and, in general,
					whether, in case we err by going to extremes, we, after the manner of musicians,
					incline to the severity of the Dorian key rather than to the softness of the
					Lydian, as shown by our being strict rather than lax in our mode of life, and
					deliberate rather than precipitate in our actions, and given to expressing undue
					admiration rather than contempt of doctrines and persons. For just as the
					turning aside of a disease into the less vital parts of the body is an
					encouraging symptom, so it is reasonable to assume that when the vice of those
					who are making progress is transformed into more moderate emotions, it is being
					gradually blotted out. When Phrynis added two strings to the seven-stringed
					lyre, the Ephors inquired whether he preferred to let them cut out the two upper
					or the two lower strings; <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Repeated in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 220 C, with some change.</note> but in our case it is both the upper and the lower
					that require lopping off if we are to be brought to the state which is a mean
					between excess in either direction; and one of the first results of progress is
					an abatement of the excess and keenness of our emotions, <quote rend="blockquote">Wherein the frenzied
						are most vehement,</quote> as Sophocles <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Graec. Frag., Soph.</hi>, No. 758.</note> expresses it. </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="14">
            <p>Furthermore, as has already been said, the translating of our judgements into
					deeds, and not allowing our words to remain mere words, but to make them into
					actions, is, above all else, a specific mark of <pb id="v1.p.449"/> progress. An
					indication of this is, in the first place, the desire to emulate what we
					commend, eagerness to do what we admire, and, on the other hand, unwillingness
					to do, or even to tolerate, what we censure. For example, it was to be expected
					that all the Athenians should commend the daring and bravery of Miltiades, yet
					the remark of Themistocles <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Life of Themistocles</hi>, chap. iii. (113 B), and <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 92 C.</note> that the trophy of Miltiades would not suffer him
					to sleep, but roused him from his slumbers, made it plain at once that he was
					not merely commending and admiring, but emulating and imitating as well. We must
					therefore believe we are making but little progress so long as the admiration
					which we feel for successful men remains inert within us and does not of its own
					self stir us to imitation. In fact, love for a person is not active unless there
					is some jealousy with it, nor is that commendation of virtue ardent and
					efficacious which does not prod and prick us, and create in us not envy but an
					emulation over honourable things which strives earnestly for satisfaction. For
					not only, as Alcibiades <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Symposium</hi>, 215 E.</note> used to say, must the heart feel such anguish at the
					philosopher's words that tears will flow ; but more than that, the man who is
					truly making progress, comparing himself with the deeds and conduct of a good
					and perfect man, and being pricked by the consciousness of his own shortcomings,
					yet at the same time rejoicing because of his hope and yearning, and being
					filled with an urging that is never still, is ready in the words of Simonides <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Bergk, <hi rend="italics">Poet. Lyr.

					by a goodwill which accords to them a fair meed of honour. But, on the other

					betters, let him understand that he is merely chafing with jealousy at another's
					repute or power, but not honouring or even admiring virtue. </p>

         <div1 type="section" n="15">
            <p>Whenever, therefore, we begin so to love good men, that not only, as Plato <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Plato, <hi rend="italics">Laws</hi>, 711 E.</note> puts

					cement ourselves to him, then we must believe that we are truly making progress.
					Still more is this the case if we do not limit our admiration of the good to
					their days of unclouded fortune, but if, just as lovers fondly welcome even
					lisping or pallor in their fair ones,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">An echo from Plato, <hi rend="italics">Republic</hi>, 474 E, which Plutarch cites more fully in <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>, 45 A and 56 C.</note> and as the tears and dejection of
					Pantheia <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Cyropaedia</hi>, v. 1. 2, and vi. 1. 31.</note> in all her grief and wretchedness smote the heart of Araspes, so we do

					but because we believe that virtue, even when attended by such afflictions, is
					worthy of our love, we try to approach close to it, and at each experience of
					this sort give utterance to this sentiment of Euripides, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Nauck, <hi rend="italics">Trag. Gr. Frag., Eurip.</hi> No. 961.</note>

					          <quote rend="blockquote">The noble honour find in everything.</quote> For an enthusiasm which carries its
					possessor to the point where he feels no disquietude, but only admiration and
					emulation of what seems terrible, can never more be turned aside from what is
					honourable. With men of this sort it has already become a constant practice, on
					proceeding to any business, or on taking office, or on encountering any
					dispensation of Fortune, to set before their eyes good men of the present or of
					the past, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Seneca (<hi rend="italics">Epistulae Moral. ad Lucilium</hi>, i. II. 8) says that this idea comes from Epicurus.</note> and to reflect: <q direct="unspecified">What would Plato have done in this case ?

					speaking, they array themselves or readjust their habit, and either repress some
					of their more ignoble utterances, or resist the onset of some emotion. True it
					is that those who have got by heart the names of the Idaean Dactyls <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Fabulous gnomes associated with the Mount Ida of Crete and Phrygia.

(1923) pp. 128 ff.; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> also Plutarch, <hi rend="italics">Mor.</hi> 706 D.</note> use them
					as charms against terrors, repeating each name with calm assurance; but it is
					also true that the thought and recollection of good men almost instantly comes
					to mind and gives support to those who are making progress towards virtue, and
					in every onset of the emotions and in all difficulties keeps them upright and
					saves them from falling. Wherefore let this also serve you as a token by which
					you can mark the man who is advancing towards virtue. </p>

            <p>Moreover, to be no longer thrown into great confusion, or to blush, or to conceal
					or rearrange some personal detail at the sudden appearance of a man of high
					repute and principles, but to be able to advance and meet such persons without
					timidity, gives a man some assurance that he knows where he stands. So <pb id="v1.p.455"/> Alexander, as it appears, on seeing a messenger hastening
					toward him with exceeding joy and holding out his hand, said, <q direct="unspecified">What are

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Cicero, <hi rend="italics">Pro Archia</hi>, chap. x.</note> In the young man, however, who is still improving

					pursuits, his discourses, whether spoken or written ; and in consequence he
					feels a pang when he recalls a father or professor now dead who never saw him in
					such condition, and for no blessing would he pray God so earnestly as that they

            <p>Still another, and a not unimportant indication of progress, which, if you will,
					you may add to the foregoing, is this : a man no longer holds the opinion that
					any one of his sins is unimportant, but is studiously circumspect and heedful
					regarding all. For just as those who have given up the hope of ever being rich
					make nothing of their small expenditures, with the idea that whatever is added
					to a little will make nothing great, <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The reference is to Hesiod, <hi rend="italics">Works and Days</hi>, 361 (<hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> 9 E).</note> whereas Hope as it draws nearer to its

					the sentiments <q direct="unspecified">What difference does this <pb id="v1.p.457"/> make ?
					</q> and <q direct="unspecified">This way now ; better next time,</q> but who gives heed
					to each separate thing, and is impatient and vexed if vice ever finds its way
					into the most insignificant of his errors and suggests a reason for condoning
					it—this man already shows plainly that he is winning for himself a spotless
					treasure and that he scorns to sully himself in any way whatever. On the other
					hand, to imagine that nothing can cause any great disgrace, or can even be of
					any great importance, makes men easy-going and careless about little things.
					True enough, it makes no difference, when men are building some rough wall which
					is to have a coping, whether they throw into the foundation a chance piece of
					timber or a stone picked up from the ground, or whether they put into the lower
					courses a fallen slab from some tomb, the same sort of thing that moral slovens
					do when they bring together promiscuously and accumulate actions and conduct of
					every kind ; but those who are making progress, of whose life already, as of
					some holy temple or regal palace, <quote rend="blockquote">The golden foundation hath been wrought,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Pindar, <hi rend="italics">Frag.</hi> 205 in Christ's ed.</note>
               </quote> do
					not indiscriminately accept for it a single action, but, using reason to guide
