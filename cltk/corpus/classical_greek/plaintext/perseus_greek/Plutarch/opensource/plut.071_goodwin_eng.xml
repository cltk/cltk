         <head>How a man may be sensible of his progress in virtue.</head>
         <pb id="v.2.p.446"/>
         <div1 type="section" n="1">
            <head>My friend Sossius Senecio,</head>
            <p>Is it possible, do you think, that all the arguments in
					the world can make a man sensibly assured that he is a
					proficient in virtue, upon this supposition, that his proceedings do not in the least alleviate and abate his folly,
					but that the vice in him, weighing in equal balance against
					his good inclinations, holds him down, as
					<quote rend="blockquote">Heavy lead pulls down the yielding net?</quote>
            </p>
            <p>In the study of music or grammar, I am sure, such a
						conclusion would be very absurd; for the scholar could
						never be certain that he had made any improvement in
						those sciences, if all the while he is a learning he did not
						exhaust by little and little his former ignorance about them,
						but remained during the whole progress of his application
						under the same degree of unskilfulness as at first setting
						out.</p>
            <p>The like may be said of those that are under the hands
						of a physician. According to this assertion, if the patient
						take physic which does not recruit his strength or give
						him ease by abating the severity of the distemper, it is
						absolutely impossible that he should discern any alteration
						in himself, before the contrary habit is perfectly and in the
						highest degree induced, and his body thoroughly sound and
						well. As in these instances you cannot say the persons
						have advanced any thing, so long as they perceive no sensible
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.447"/>
						
						 change in themselves by the abatement of the contrary weight, and do not find that their minds are elevated,
						as it were, in the opposite scale; just so, in truth, is it with
						those that profess philosophy. They cannot be assured of
						any progress or improvement, if the soul do not gradually
						advance and purge off the rest of its former imperfections,
						but still lie under the like equal pressure and grievance of
						pure, absolute, unmixed evil, till it have attained the state
						of perfect, supreme good; for the truth of it is, a wise man
						cannot in a moment of time change from the lowest degree
						of vice imaginable to the most heroic perfection of virtue,
						if he only make a brisk attempt to throw off vice all at
						once, and do not constantly and resolutely endeavor by little
						and little to lighten the burthen and dispossess the evil
						habit of it.</p>
            <p>You know very well how much trouble those give themselves who maintain this assertion, and what strange questions they raise with regard to it,&mdash;for instance, why a wise
						virtuous man should never perceive how he became such,
						but should either be quite ignorant, or at least doubt, that
						ever by little and little, now adding something, now subtracting and removing others, he advanced to the aggregate perfection of virtue. Now if (as they affirm) the
						change from bad to good were either so quick and sudden,
						as that he was extremely vicious in the morning may
						become eminently virtuous at night, or that any one going
						to bed wicked might chance to rise a virtuous man next
						morning, and, having all the former day's errors and imperfections absolutely removed out of his mind, might say
						to them, as it is in the poet,

						eyes upon the beams of virtue and wisdom so fully and
						manifestly breaking in upon his soul? In my opinion, if
						any person should have Caeneus's foolish wish, and be
						changed (as it is reported he was) from one sex to the
						other, it is more probable that such a one should be altogether ignorant of the metamorphosis, than that any should,
						from a lazy, unthinking, debauched fellow, commence a
						wise, prudent, and valiant hero, and from a sottish bestiality advance to the perfection of divine life, and yet know
						nothing at all of the change.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>It is very good advice, Measure the stone by your
					rule, and not your rule by the stone. But the Stoics have
					not observed it; for they, not applying principles to things,
					but forcing things which have no foundation of agreement
					in nature to agree to their principles, have filled philosophy
					with a number of difficulties. One of the hardest to be
					solved is this, that all men whatsoever (except him who
					is absolutely perfect) are equally vicious. Hence is that
					enigma, called progress or proficiency, which, though it has
					puzzled the learned to solve, is in my opinion very foolish;
					for it represents those that have advanced a little, and are
					partly free from inordinate passions and distempers of mind,
					to be as unhappy as those that are guilty of the most heinous enormities. And indeed the assertion is so absurd,
					that their own actions are enough to confute it; for while
					they maintain in their schools that Aristides and Phalaris
					are equally unjust, that Brasidas and Dolon are equal cowards, and that Plato and Meletus are equally senseless, still
					in all affairs of life they seem to reject and avoid the latter
					of these, as too harsh and severe to be softened into compliance, but credit and quote the former in all their writings,
					as persons of extraordinary worth and esteem. This is
					what the Stoics assert.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>But we, who can better agree with Plato in this point,
					finding by observation that in all kinds of evils, especially
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.449"/>
					
					that of a weak and unmanaged disposition of mind, there
					are several degrees of more and less (for herein one advance differs from another, that the miserable darkness
					which the soul lies under begins more sensibly to abate,
					when reason by little and little illuminates and purges the
					soul), may be bold to affirm that the change from bad to
					good is very easily and manifestly discernible; not as if
					one were drawn out of a pit on a sudden, and could give
					no account of the degrees of the ascent, but so plain that
					the several steps and advances may be computed.</p>
            <p>The first argument that comes in my mind is this, by
						way of simile; pray examine it. You know the art of
						navigation; when the seamen hoist sail for the main ocean,
						they give judgment of their voyage by observing together
						the space of time and the force of the wind that driveth
						them, and compute that, in all probability, in so many
						months, with such a gale, they have gone forward to such
						or such a place. Just so it is in the study of philosophy;
						one may, if he mind it, give a probable conjecture of a
						scholar's proceedings. He that is always at his business,
						constantly upon the road, never makes any steps or halts,
						nor meets with obstacles and lets in the way, but under
						the conduct of right reason travels smoothly, securely, and
						quietly along, may be assured that he has one true sign of
						a proficient. This of the poet,
						<quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>not only holds true as to the increase of money, but also
						may serve as a rule to the knowledge of the advance of
						every thing else, especially of proficiency in virtue. Reason, besides its ordinary influence, requires the constancy
						of application and address which is necessary and usual
						in all other affairs. Whereas, on the contrary, the irregular proceedings and inconsistent silly assertions of some
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.450"/>
						
						philosophers do not only lay rubs in the way, and break
						the measures of a virtuous improvement, but seem to give
						great advantage to vice, during their lingering and idling
						upon their journey, to tempt them into by-paths, or over-persuade them to return whence they set out.</p>
            <p>Astronomers tell us that planets, after they have finished
						their progressive motion, for some small time acquiesce
						and become stationary, as they term it. Now in the study
						of philosophy it is not so; there is no point of rest or acquiescence during the whole procedure, for the nature of
						progress is to be always advancing, more or less. The
						scales in which our actions are, as it were, weighed cannot at all stand in equilibrio, but our soul is continually
						either raised by the addition of good, or cast with the
						counterpoise of evil.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as the oracle told the Cirrhaeans that they
						ought to fight continually, day and night; so you and
						every wise man ought to be perpetually upon your guard,
						and if you can be assured that you maintain a constant
						combat with vice, that you are always at enmity with it
						and never so much as come to terms, or receive any diversions, applications, or avocations, as so many heralds from
						the enemies' camp, in order to a treaty with it; then you
						may, with a great deal of confidence and alacrity, go on
						with the management of your warlike expedition, and very
						reasonably at last expect a conquest, and enjoy a crown of
						righteousness for your reward.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="4">
            <p>It is another very good argument to prove that by
					labor and exercise you have shaken off all stupidity and
					sluggishness of temper, and that you are arrived at a
					perfection of virtue, if for the future your resolutions be
					more firm and your application more intense than they were
					when you first set out. This appears true, if you but observe its contrary; for it is a very bad sign if, after a small
					time spent in trial, you find many and repeated intermissions,
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.451"/>
					
					 or your affections yielding or cool in the pursuit.
					This may be illustrated by what is observable in the growth
					of a cane. At first it appears above ground with a full
					and pleasing sprout, which by little and little, taper-wise,
					by a continued and equal distribution of matter, rises to a
					very great height. Towards the root you may observe that
					there are formed certain steps and joints, which are at a
					considerable distance from one another, because (there)
					the juice is plentiful and strong. But toward the top the
					nutrimentive particles vibrate and palpitate, as if they were
					quite spent with the length of their journey, and thereupon, you see, they form themselves many small, weak, and
					tender joints, as so many supports and breathing-places.
					So it happens with those that study philosophy: at first
					setting out they take long steps and make great advances;
					but if, after some attempts, they perceive not in themselves
					any alteration for the better, but meet with frequent checks
					and avocations the further they go, ordinarily they faint,
					make any excuses to be off from their engagement,
					despond of ever going through with it, and thereupon
					proceed no farther. But, on the contrary, he that is
					winged with desire flies at the proposed advantage, and by
					a stout and vigorous pursuit cuts off all pretences of
					delay from crowding in upon him or hindering his
					journey.</p>
            <p>In love, it is a sign the passion is predominant, if the
						lover be not only pleased in the enjoyment of the beloved
						object (for that's ordinary), but also troubled and grieved
						at the absence of it. After a manner not unlike this, many
						youngsters (as I've observed) stand affected at the study of
						philosophy. At first, they buckle to their work with the
						greatest concern and emulation imaginable; but as soon as
						ever they are diverted, either by business or any little pretences, the heat of their affection immediately flies off, and
						they sit down ignorant and very well content. But

            <p>will not only show that he is a proficient by his virtuous demeanor and agreeableness in all company and
						discourse; but if he be called from his business, you may
						perceive him all on fire, in pain, and uneasy in whatsoever
						he does, whether alone or in company, and so concerned
						that he is unmindful of his best friends till he is restored
						to the quest of his beloved philosophy. All of us ought
						to imitate such a noble example in all our studies. We
						must not be affected with good discourse only while we are
						in place, as we are with rich fragrant perfumes (which we
						never mind, but while we are a smelling to them); but if
						by chance marriage, an estate, love, or a campaign take us
						from our business, we must still hunger and thirst after virtue; and the more our proficiency is advanced, by so much
						the more ought our desire to know what we have not attained disquiet and excite us to the further pursuit and
						knowledge of it.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="5">
            <p>The grave account which Hesiod gives of proficiency
					is, in my judgment, either the very same, or comes very
					near to this which I have now set down. Proficiency is
					(says he) when all difficulties are removed, all unevenness
					smoothed and cleared, and the way made easy and passable. It must be smoothed by frequent exercise, cleared by
					beams of divine light that guide the way to true philosophy, nothing at all of the clouds of doubt, error, or
					inconstancy in good resolutions remaining, which are as
					usually incident to learners in their first attempts upon
					philosophy, as distraction and solicitudes are to those who,
					sailing from a known land, cannot yet discover the place
					whither they are bound. Thus I have known impatient
					sophisters skip over common and ordinary notions, before
					they have learned or attained better, and lose themselves
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.453"/>
					
					in the middle of their journey in so troublesome a maze,
					that they would be willing to return (if they could) to
					their primitive state of quiet, inactive ignorance. Sextius,
					a nobleman of Rome, may serve for an instance of this.
					He quitted all offices and places of honor, that he might
					more freely and undisturbedly apply himself to the study
					of philosophy. At first he met with many difficulties; and
					finding himself unable to encounter or conquer them, out
					of very despair and despondency, he had thoughts of
					throwing himself out of a little boat into the river Tiber.
					Parallel to this is a merry story told of Diogenes of Sinope;
					when he first put on his gown, it happened to be at a time
					when the Athenians celebrated a festival with extraordinary
					banquets, night-drinking, sports, and pageantry usual at
					great solemnities. The philosopher, as he lay in the holidays in the corner of the street, muffled up in his clothes,
					to try if he could take a nap, had some running thoughts
					in his head, which checked the resolutions he had taken as
					to a philosophical life, and troubled him extremely. He
					reasoned with himself, that there was no necessity for his
					entering into so troublesome and singular a way of living,
					that he thereby deprived himself of all the sweets and
					pleasures of life, and the like. While he was thinking
					thus with himself, he espied (as the story goes) a mouse
					venturing toward him, and now and then nibbling at a
					mouldy crust that he had in his pouch. This sight (which
					is much) turned his thoughts, and made him vexed and
					troubled at himself as much on the other side. What
					(says he) is the matter with thee, Diogenes? Thou seest
					this tiny mouse lives well, and is very glad of thy scraps;
					but thou, who must needs be a person of quality, forsooth,
					art extremely sorry and out of humor, because thou dost
					not feast upon down-beds, and cast not have the genteel privilege at this merry time to be drunk as well as
					others.</p>
            <pb id="v.2.p.454"/>
            <p>Another rational argument of gradual proficiency is when
						avocations are not frequent upon us, and when they happen, very short; while the substantial rules and precepts of
						wisdom, as if they had been violently driven out, presently
						return upon our minds, and dispossess all empty trouble
						and disconsolate thoughts.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="6">
            <p>And because scholars do not only fancy to themselves
					difficulties big enough to divert their weak resolutions, but
					also often meet with serious persuasions from their friends
					to leave their studies, and because sometimes such smart
					jests and drolls are put upon them as have often discouraged, frequently quite converted, the endeavors of some; it
					may seem to you a very good argument of a proficient, if
					you find yourself indifferent and unconcerned in that point.
					As, for example, not to be cut to the heart and repine,
					when you are told that such and such persons by name,
					your equals once, live splendidly at court, have married
					great fortunes, or have appeared publicly at the head of
					a great many freeholders, that are ready to vote for them
					for some great office or representative's place. He that is
					neither discomposed nor very much affected by such news
					as this is manifestly in the right, and has philosophy by the
					surer handle. For it is impossible we should leave admiring things which most men esteem, if the habit of virtue
					were not deeply rooted in us. To avoid passionately what
					every one cries down may be in some persons the effect of
					anger and ignorance; but utterly to despise what is admired
					abroad is a certain sign of true and solid wisdom and
					resolution. With what satisfaction and complacency many
					persons advanced to such a height of virtue compare
					themselves with others, and break out in these verses of
					Solon!

            <pb id="v.2.p.455"/>
            <p>None can deny but that it was very great in Diogenes to
						compare his shifting from the city of Corinth to Athens,
						and from Thebes to Corinth, to the king of Persia's taking
						his progress in the spring to Susa, in winter to Babylon,
						and to Media in summer. Nor was it an argument of a
						much less spirit in Agesilaus, who, hearing this same king
						of Persia styled the Great, presently asked, In what is he
						greater than I, if he be not juster than I am? Aristotle
						himself had exactly such notions in the like case; for,
						writing to Antipater about his scholar Alexander, he says
						of him, that he ought not to value himself in this respect,
						that he was advanced above others; for whoever had a
						true notion of God was really as great as he. And Zeno
						too deserves to be mentioned, who, hearing Theophrastus
						commended above any of the philosophers for his number
						of scholars, put it off thus: His choir is indeed larger
						than mine, but mine has the sweeter voices.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="7">
            <p>From all these instances you may collect this great
					truth, that whenever you do, by setting the comforts of virtue and the difficulties and errors of study one against the
					other, perceive that you have utterly expelled all emulation,
					jealousy, and every thing else that uses to disturb or discourage young men, you may then assuredly conclude with
					yourself that you have made very laudable progress.</p>
            <p>Another argument of proficiency in virtue is the alteration of your very style of writing, and of your way of
						managing any argument or discourse. Most of those that
						nowadays design for scholars (in ordinary speaking) do
						prosecute almost none but popular studies; to furnish out
						discourse, and make themselves, as the phrase is, plausible
						men; some few of them there are who, like silly larks,
						are taken with the glaring light of natural philosophy, and.
						measuring themselves by their own levity and conceit, think
						they are able presently to attain the height of that science.
						Others like young whelps ('tis Plato's simile) love to snap
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.456"/>
						
						and bite at one another, only to gratify a contentious, sceptical, and sophistical humor, which they at first got by bad
						tuition and ill-managed studies. Some again, as soon as
						ever they are initiated in the principles of logic, presently
						commence sophisters. Others spend their whole time in
						collecting sentences and historical narrations. These (as
						Anacharsis said of the Grecians, that he saw no occasion
						they had for money, but only to count and tell it over) have
						nothing at all to do, but go about singing and repeating
						what they have collected into commonplace books, without any other benefit or satisfaction from their labors. To
						these you may apply that of Antiphanes, which one ingeniously turned to Plato's scholars. This Antiphanes said
						merrily, that in a certain city the cold was so intense that
						words were congealed as soon as spoken, but that after
						some time they thawed and became audible, so that the
						words spoken in winter were articulated next summer.
						Even so, the many excellent precepts of Plato, which he
						instilled into the tender ears of his scholars, were scarce
						perceived and distinguished by many of them, till they
						grew men and attained the warm vigorous summer of their
						age.</p>
            <p>Such a cool disposition to virtue and philosophy, as that
						philosopher said was in Plato's scholars when young, often
						lasts in the most of us (as was hinted before) till our judgments grow to a solid firmness and maturity, and we begin
						to value those precepts that are able to beget a composure
						and greatness of mind, and diligently to trace and follow
						those discourses and precepts whose tracks (as it is in
						Aesop's fables) rather look inward than outward, to ourselves rather than others. Sophocles said of himself, that
						in writing his tragedies he first of all abated and pricked
						the tumor of Aeschylus's invention, then corrected the
						harshness and over artifice of his composition, and, last

						which is most considerably persuasive, and which most of
						all conduces to good manners. Even so, young students,
						when they pass from the fulness and luxuriancy of panegyric and declamation to that more solid part of philosophy
						that regulates manners and smooths all rugged and disorderly passions, then begin really to attain true and solid
						proficiency.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="8">
            <p>Hereupon let me advise you this,&mdash;whenever you
					read the writings or hear the orations of the philosophers,
					attend always things more than words, and be not taken
					with what is curious and of a delicate thread and contexture, more than that which is strong, nervous, and beneficial. So also, in perusing poems or histories, be sure that
					nothing escape you that is appositely said, in relation to
					the cultivating of manners or the calming turbulent, immoderate passions; but always give it a note, and make it
					surely your own. Simonides said that a student in philosophy should be like a bee. That laborious creature, when
					it is amongst flowers, makes it its business industriously to
					extract the yellow honey out of them all; while others
					care and seek for nothing else except the smell and the
					color. So, while some others employ their time in reading
					the poets only for diversion, or for the wit and fancy which
					usually adorn their works, you (my dear friend) like a bee
					amongst a swarm of drones, observe and collect what is
					sweet, palatable, and worthy your pains, and seem already,
					by your constant custom and application, to have attained a
					perfect knowledge of what is eminently good and proper.</p>
            <p>As to those that peruse the works of Plato and Xenophon only for the style's sake, and do cull out what is
						elegant and Attic, as the cream and flower of those authors,
						pray what do they do but as it were admire the fragrancy
						and flavor of medicinal drugs, yet, at the same time,
						neither understand nor enquire after their healing and
						purgative qualities? Whereas, those that have advanced
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.458"/>
						
						to a higher degree of perfection can extract benefit, not
						only from philosophical discourses, but also from every
						thing they see or do, and thence draw something that may
						be proper and fit for their purpose. I will give you some
						examples of Aeschylus and other very eminent men, which may be very pat to this purpose. Aeschylus chanced to
						be a spectator at the Isthmian games, where some were
						engaged at sword play; seeing one of the combatants
						wounded, and observing that the theatre immediately made
						a great shouting and hollowing upon it, he jogged one
						Ion, an inhabitant of the island Chios, who sat next to
						him, and whispered him thus, Do you see what exercise
						can do? He that is wounded holds his peace, and the
						spectators cry out.</p>
            <p>Brasidas, the Lacedaemonian captain, by chance caught
						a mouse among some dry figs; and, being bit by her, let
						her go, with this exclamation, By Hercules! there is no
						creature so little or so weak, that it cannot preserve its life
						if it dares but defend it.</p>
            <p>Diogenes may serve for a thousand instances; when he
						saw a boy drink out of the palm of his hand, he threw
						away his dish, which he used to carry always with him
						in his wallet. Thus sedulity and application have a
						singular virtue to make us knowing and able to extract
						motives to virtue from every thing that we meet with.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a difficult matter to attain such a temper of
						mind, if the candidates for virtue intermix discourse and
						reading with their actions; not only <q direct="unspecified">exercising themselves amidst dangers</q> (as Thucydides<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Thucyd. I. 18.</note> said to some), but
						also engaging pleasures, disputing hard questions, examining precedents, pleading causes, and so (to try themselves
						thoroughly) undertaking some magistracy or public office,
						giving thereby demonstration of their opinions and resolution, or rather establishing their resolution by exercise.
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.459"/>
						
						Whereas, those that are not bred to it, but like novices spy
						out and catch at any thing that is curious in books, and
						pragmatically run away with it either to the Exchange,
						the College, or some club or tavern, deserve no more the
						name of philosophers, than those quacks that only truck
						off vile drugs and potions merit the character and value
						of physicians. Those sophisters seem to me not unlike
						the bird mentioned in Homer, and to have something of
						its quality. Whatsoever they catch abroad they presently
						bring home with them, and cram it into their unfledged
						chicks, their illiterate scholars, starving their own empty
						crops the while, as the poet has it; for they neither digest
						nor convert what they take into true nourishment.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="9">
            <p>It is then indispensably our duty so to manage our
					discourse, that it may be beneficial both to ourselves and
					others, we not incurring the censure of being thought
					vain-glorious or arrogant by any; to be always readier to
					hear than to teach; and, especially, so to abate and moderate all vehemency and passionate quarrelling about trivial questions, as that we may cease to attend and manage
					disputations with the same indifferency as you may have
					seen some exercise hurlbats and cudgelling,&mdash;that is, so
					as to leave the stage with more satisfaction for having had
					a true hit or coming off conqueror, than for having either
					learned ourselves or taught our antagonist any manner of
					skill by the engagement.</p>
            <p>An evenness and mildness of temper in all such affairs,
						which never will suffer us to enter the lists with vehemency and passion, nor to be hot and concerned in settling
						an argument, nor to scold and give bad words when we
						have vanquished our adversary, nor to be very much dejected if we chance to be quite baffled, is (I think) a true
						sign of a great proficient in virtue. Aristippus was a
						great example of this; for when in a set disputation he
						was baffled by the sophistry and forehead of an impudent,
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.460"/>
						
						wild, and ignorant disputant, and observed him to be
						flushed and high with the conquest; Well! says the
						philosopher, I am certain, I shall sleep quieter to-night
						than my antagonist.</p>
            <p>Not only upon the close and event of our philosophical
						contests, but even in the midst of disputation, we may
						(privately) take an estimate of this good quality in us,
						which is a sign of a true proficient; for example, if, upon
						a greater appearance of auditors than was expected, we
						be not afraid nor in confusion; if, at the thinness of the
						congregation, when there are but a few to hear us, we be
						not dejected and troubled; and lastly, if, when we are to
						speak before a numerous or honorable assembly, we do
						not, for want of fitting preparation, miss the opportunity
						for ever.</p>
            <p>It is reported that two as famous orators as ever were,
						Demosthenes and Alcibiades, were somewhat weak and
						faulty in this point. The timorousness of the former is
						known to every school-boy; and as for Alcibiades, though
						he was (as must be confessed) as sagacious and happy in
						his thoughts as any man whatever, yet, for want of a little
						assurance in speaking a thing, he very often miserably lost
						himself in his pleadings; for he would falter and make
						pauses in the very middle of his orations, purely for want
						of a single word or some neat expression, that he had in
						his papers but could not presently remember. To give
						you another instance of the prince of poets, Homer; he
						was so blinded with an over-confidence of his abilities in
						poetry, that he has slipped a false quantity, and left it on
						record, in the very first verse of his Iliads.</p>
            <p>Seeing then the learnedest men and greatest artists have
						failed and may fail for want of caution or confidence, it
						ought more nearly to concern those that earnestly follow
						virtue, not to slip the least opportunity of improvement,
						either by company or otherwise; and not overmuch to
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.461"/>
						
						regard the throng or applause of the theatre, when they
						do exercise or make any solemn harangue.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="10">
            <p>Nor is it enough that one take care of all his discourses and orations; but he ought also to observe that
					the whole tenor of his actions be guided by profit rather
					than vain pomp, and by truth rather than ostentation.
					For if a passionate lover who has placed his affection
					upon any beloved object seeks no witnesses to attest its
					sincerity, but has such an eager desire when alone and in
					private, that, like a covered flame, it burns more vigorously and insensibly for being shut up; much more ought
					a moralist and a philosopher who has attained both the
					habit and exercise of virtue sit down self-contented, and
					applaud himself in private, neither needing nor desiring
					encomiasts or auditors from abroad.</p>
            <p>There is an humor in some of the poets, of an old peevish housekeeper, that calls to his maid aloud: Do you see,
						Dionysia (that is his maid's name), I am now pleased, and
						have laid by all choler and passion. Just such like is the
						practice of some, who, as soon as they have done any thing
						which is obliging and civil, presently blaze it abroad, and
						turn their own heralds. Such men show plainly that they
						look beyond themselves for satisfaction; that they are desirous of praise and applause; and that they never were
						admitted near spectators of virtue, never saw her in her
						noble, royal dress, but only had some transient sight of her
						in a dream or an empty airy phantasm; and indeed, that
						they expose their actions to the public, as painters do their
						pictures, to be gazed at and admired by the gaping multitude.</p>
            <p>Another sign of a proficient in virtue is, when the proficient has given any thing to his friend or done any kindness for any one, if he keeps it to himself and does not
						blab it to anybody; and (which is more) if he hath voted
						right against a majority of biassed suffragans, withstood
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.462"/>
						
						the dishonest attempts of some rich and powerful man,
						generously rejected bribes when offered, abstained from
						inordinate drinking when athirst and alone, or at night,
						when none sees or knows what he does, lastly, if he hath
						conquered the briskest attempts of love (as is said of
						Agesilaus); if (I say) he contain himself from speaking
						of such actions, and do not in company boast of his performances. This I affirm,&mdash;such a one as can prove and
						try himself by himself, and be fully satisfied in the verdict
						of his conscience, as of an unexceptionable witness and
						spectator of what is right and good, shows plainly that
						his reason looks inward and is well rooted within him. and
						that the man (as Democritus said) is accustomed to take
						satisfaction from himself.</p>
            <p>To borrow a simile from husbandmen and those that are
						concerned in the business of the fields, they are always
						best pleased to see those ears of corn which decline and
						by reason of their fulness bend downwards to the earth,
						but look upon those as empty, deceitful, and insignificant,
						which, because they have nothing in them, grow bolt upright and appear above the rest. So it is amongst students
						in philosophy; those that are most empty-headed, and
						have least firmness and solidity, have always the greatest
						share of confidence, formality, and stiffness in their address, look biggest, walk with the most state, and top upon
						and condemn others, with the highest arrogance and severity of any living. But when once their brains begin to
						fill and become well poised with solid notions, they look
						down into themselves, and quite lay aside that insolent and
						arrogant humor, which is proper only to youngsters.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to illustrate this by one simile more.
						When you pour water into bottles or any other vessels,
						upon its being instilled into them, the air that was in them
						before presently flies out and gives place to the more substantial body. Even so it is with those that have had many
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.463"/>
						
						good precepts instilled into them, and their minds replenished with solid truths. They presently find that all empty
						vanity flies off; that the imposthume of pride breaks ; that
						they do not value themselves for beard and gown only, but
						bend their actions and endeavors to the bettering of their
						rational faculties; and, lastly, that when they reprove they
						begin at home, turning the edge of their satire and invective upon themselves, even when at the same time they are
						civil and complaisant to all others beside. It is indeed an
						argument of a generous and truly brave disposition in a
						scholar, not to assume the name and character of one, and,
						as some use to do, to put the philosopher amongst his
						titles; but if any out of respect chance to give him that
						compellation, to be surprised, blush, and with a modest
						smile answer him in that of the poet,

						is seen and over, they attend with a profound silence and
						religious fear. So it is with the candidates in philosophy;
						you may perceive a throng, noise, and pother about the
						school-doors, by reason that several press thither eagerly,
						rudely, and violently for reputation, more than learning
						but when you are once in, and manifestly see the great
						light, as if some royal shrine were opened unto you, you
						are presently possessed with a quite different notion of
						things; are struck with silence and admiration, and begin,
						with humility and a reverend composure, to comply with
						and follow the divine oracle. That which Menedemus
						said in another case is very apposite to this sort of men.
						Those that went to the school of Athens were first of
						all (<foreign lang="greek">sofoi/</foreign>) <hi rend="italics">wise,</hi> next (<foreign lang="greek">filo/sofoi</foreign>) lovers of <hi rend="italics">wisdom,</hi> then orators, and at last, in course of time, plain common men;
						for the longer they applied themselves to study and philosophy, so much the more all vanity, pride, and pedantry
						abated in them, and the nearer they came to plain, downright, honest men.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="11">
            <p>Again, as it is with those that are indisposed and
					out of order,&mdash;some, if a tooth or finger do but ache,
					presently run to a physician; others send for one to their
					houses, if they find themselves but the least feverish and
					desire his advice and assistance; but those that are either
					melancholical, or but any ways crazed in their heads, cannot endure so much as the looks of a physician, but either
					keep out of sight when he comes or command him to be
					gone, being altogether insensible of their condition,&mdash;so, in persons that commit any heinous crime or fall into
					any error, I look upon those as perfectly incurable, who
					take it ill to be admonished of their fault and look upon
					reproof and admonition as the greatest rudeness and incivility in the world, whereas those that can quietly hearken
					and submit to the advice of friends and superiors deserve
					a more favorable opinion, and may be thought to be of a
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.465"/>
					
					much better disposition. But the greatest character of
					hopeful men, and such as may be probably excellent proficients in time, belongs to those who, upon a commission
					of a fault, immediately apply themselves to such as will
					reprove and correct them; who plainly disclose their grief
					and open their malady; who do not rejoice in concealing
					their distemper, and are not content to have their troubles
					unknown; lastly, who make a full confession of what they
					have done amiss, and desire the help of a friend to examine and direct them for the future. Diogenes, I am
					sure, was of this opinion. He said, that whosoever would
					be certainly and constantly in the right must get either a
					virtuous good friend or an incensed ill-natured enemy to
					his monitor; the one by gentle admonition to reprove and
					persuade him, the other to work upon him by severity, and
					awe him into a virtuous course of life.</p>
            <p>There is a sort of men in the world, that are so vain and
						foolish as to take a pride in being the first discoverers of
						their own imperfections; if they have but a rent or spot
						in their clothes, or have got a torn pair of shoes on, they
						are the most forward of any to tell it in company; and
						(which is more) they are very apt, out of a silly, empty,
						arrogant humor, to make themselves the subject of their
						drollery, if they are of a dwarfish stature or any way deformed; yet (which is strange) these very men, at the very
						same time, endeavor to excuse and palliate the internal imperfections of the mind and the more ugly deformities of
						the soul, as envy, evil-custom, detraction, voluptuousness,
						&amp;c., and will not suffer any one either to see or probe them.
						These are, as it were, so many sore places, and they cannot
						endure to have them touched and meddled with. Such
						men as these (I may be bold to say) have very few signs
						of proficiency, or rather none at all.</p>
            <p>Now, on the contrary, he that examines his own failings
						with the greatest severity, that impartially blames or corrects
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.466"/>
						
						 himself as often as he does amiss, or (which is almost
						as commendable) grows firmer and better by present advice, as well as more able and ready to endure a reprimand for the future, seems to me truly and sincerely to
						have rejected and forsaken vice.</p>
            <p>It is certainly our duty to avoid all appearance of evil,
						and to be ashamed to give occasion even to be reputed
						vicious; yet evil reports are so inconsiderable to a wise
						man, that, if he have a greater aversion to the nature of
						evil than to the infamy that attends it, he will not fear what
						is said of him abroad, nor what calumnies are raised, if so
						be he be made the better by them. It was handsomely
						said of Diogenes, when he saw a young spark coming out
						of a tavern, who at the sight of him drew back: Do not
						retire, says he, for the more you go backward, the more
						you will be in the tavern. Even so every vicious person,
						the more he denies and palliates vice, the more aggravates
						and confirms it, and with surer footing goes farther into
						wickedness; like some persons of ordinary rank and quality,
						who, while they assume above themselves, and out of arrogance would be thought rich, are made really poor and
						necessitous, by pretending to be otherwise.</p>
            <p>Hippocrates, a man of wonderful skill in physic, was
						very ingenuous in this point, and fit to be imitated by the
						greatest proficients in philosophy. He confessed publicly,
						that he had mistaken the nature of the sutures in the skull,
						and has left an acknowledgment of his ignorance upon
						record, under his own hand; for he thought it very unworthy a man of his profession not to discover where he
						was in the wrong, seeing others might suffer and err by
						his authority. And, indeed, it had been very unreasonable, if he, whose business and concern it was to save others
						and to set them right, should not have had the courage to
						cure himself, and to discover his weakness and imperfections in his own faculty.</p>

            <p>Pyrrhon and Bion (two eminent philosophers) have given
						rules of proficiency; but they seem rather signs of a complete habit of virtue, than a progressive disposition to it.
						Bion told his friend, that they then might be assured of
						their proficiency, when they could endure a reproof from
						anybody with the same indifferency and unconcernedness
						as they could hear the highest encomiums, even such a
						one as this of the poet:
						<quote rend="blockquote">

						notice (as the story goes) of a hog that was on board,
						which all the while very unconcernedly fed upon some corn
						which lay scattered about; he showed it to his companions,

         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="12">
            <p>The opinion which is said to be Zeno's may deserve
					our consideration. He said that any one might give a
					guess at his proficiency from the observation of his dreams,
					if when asleep he fancied nothing that was immodest, nor
					seemed to consent to any wicked actions or dishonest intentions, but found his fancy and passions of his mind
					undisturbed, in a constant calm, as it were, always serene,
					and enlightened with the beams of divine reason. This
					very notion was hinted by Plato<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Republic, IX. p. 571 C.</note> (as I interpret his words),
					where he is describing and delineating the soul which is
					tyrannical in its nature, and showing what manner of operations its fantasy and irrational appetite exert. When a
					man is asleep, he says, a vicious person designs the satisfying incestuous lust, has a longing for all sorts of meat indifferently,
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.468"/>
					
					 whether allowed or prohibited, and satisfies his
					appetite and desire in all manner of intemperance which
					is loose and unregarded, which, in the day-time, either the
					laws shame him out of, or fear to offend restrains.</p>
            <p>As now those brute beasts that are accustomed to labor
						will not, if the reins be let loose, either turn aside or offer
						to leave the track or stumble in it, so it is with the brutal
						faculty of the mind; when it is once made tame and manageable by the strength of reason, then it is unwilling carelessly to transgress or saucily to disobey its sovereign's
						commands or to comply with any inordinate lusts, either
						in sleep or sickness; but it carefully observes and maintains its dictates to which it is accustomed, and by frequent exercise advances to perfect strength and intention
						of virtue.</p>
            <p>We find even in our own nature the strange effects of
						custom. Man is naturally able, by much exercise and the
						use of a stoical apathy, to bring the body and all its members into subjection, so that not one organ shall perform its
						operation,&mdash;the eyes shall not burst out with tears upon
						the sight of a lamentable object, the heart shall not palpitate upon the apprehension of fear, and the passions shall
						not be roused at the sight of any beautiful person, whether
						man or woman. Now it is much more probable that the
						faculties of the sense may be so brought in subjection by
						undergoing such exercise as we speak of, that all its imaginations and motions may be smoothed and made agreeable
						to right reason, even when we are asleep and keep not sentry. It is reported of Stilpo the philosopher, that he
						thought he saw Neptune in his sleep, and that he seemed
						very much displeased with him, because he had not (as was
						usual with his priests) sacrificed an ox in honor of him.
						Not in the least daunted at the apparition, he thus boldly
						accosted it: Neptune! what's this business you here complain of? You come hither like a child, and are angry with
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.469"/>
						
						me, because I did not borrow money and run in debt to
						please you, and fill the city with costly odors, but privately
						sacrificed to you in my own house such ordinary victims as
						1 could get. At this confident reply, Neptune smiled, and
						(as the story goes) reached him his hand, as an assurance
						of his good-will to him, and told him that for his sake he
						would send the Megarians abundance of fish that season.</p>
            <p>In the main we may conclude thus much, that those that
						have clear and pleasant dreams, and are not troubled with
						any frightful, strange, vicious, or irregular apparitions in
						their sleep, may assure themselves that they have some
						indications and dawnings of proficiency; whereas, on the
						contrary, those dreams which are mixed with any pain,
						fear, cowardly aversions from good, childish exultation, or
						silly grief, so that they are both frightful and unaccountable, are like the breaking waves or the billows of the
						sea; for the soul, not having attained a perfect evenness of
						temper, but being under the formation of laws and precepts
						from whose guidance and discovery it is free in time of
						sleep, is then slacked from its usual intenseness, and laid
						open to all passions whatever.</p>
            <p>Whether this temper we speak of be an argument of
						proficiency, or an indication of some other habit which has
						taken deep root in the soul, grown strong and immovable
						by all the power of reason, I leave to you to consider and
						determine.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="13">
            <p>Seeing then an absolute apathy or freedom from all
					passions whatsoever is a great and divine perfection, and,
					withal, considering that progress seems to consist in a certain remission and moderation of those very passions we
					carry about us, it unavoidably follows, that if we will observe our passions, with relation to one another and also to
					themselves, we may easily find out their differences. For
					example, first, we may observe from the passions compared
					with themselves whether our desires be now more moderate
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.470"/>
					
					 than they used to be, fear and anger less and more
					calm, and whether or no we are more able to quench the
					heat and flame of our passions than we used to be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by comparing them with one another, we may
						observe whether we now have a greater share of shame
						than of fear, whether emulation be without any mixture of
						envy, whether we have greater desire of glory than of
						riches, whether we offend (as the musicians term it) in the
						Dorian or base or in the Lydian or treble notes,&mdash;that is,
						whether we are more inured to abstinence and hardship
						than otherwise,&mdash;whether we are unwilling rather than
						forward to appear in public, and, lastly, whether we are
						undue admirers of the persons or performances of others,
						or despisers both of them and what they can do.</p>
            <p>As it is a good sign of recovery of a sick person if the
						distemper lie in the less principal parts of the body; so in
						proficiency, if vicious habits be changed into more tolerable passions, it is a symptom that they are going off and
						ready to be quenched. Phrynis the musician, to his seven
						strings adding two more, was asked by the magistrates,
						whether he had rather they should cut the upper or lower
						of them, the base or treble. Now it is our business to cut
						off (as it were) both what is above and below, if we would
						attain to the true medium and equality; for proficiency in
						the first place remits the excess, and sweetens the harmony
						of the evil affections, which is (according to Sophocles)
						<quote rend="blockquote">The madman's greatest pleasure and disease.</quote>

         <div1 type="section" n="14">
            <p>We have already said that we ought to transfer our
					judgment to action, and not to suffer our words to remain
					bare and naked words, but to reduce them to deeds; and
					that this is the chiefest sign of a proficient. Now another
					manifest indication is a desire of those things we commend,
					and a readiness to perform those things which we admire,
					but whatsoever we discommend, neither to will or endure
					it. It is probable that all the Athenians highly extolled
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.471"/>
					
					the courage and valor of Miltiades. But Themistocles
					(who professed that the trophies of Miltiades broke his
					sleep, and often forced him out of his bed) did not only
					praise and admire what he had done, but was manifestly
					struck with a zeal and emulation of his performances.
					Therefore we may be assured that we have profited little,
					while we think it a vanity to admire those that have done
					well, and cannot possibly be raised to an imitation of
					them.</p>
            <p>To love the person of any man is not sufficient, except
						it have a mixture of emulation; no more is that love of
						virtue ardent and exciting, which does not put us forward,
						and create in our breasts (instead of envy to them) a zealous affection for all good men, and a desire of equal perfection with them. For it is not enough (as Alcibiades
						was wont to say) that the heart should be turned upside
						down by hearing the discourses of a philosopher, and that
						the tears should gush from the eyes; but he that is a proficient indeed, comparing himself with the designs and
						actions of a good perfect man, is pricked at the same with
						the consciousness of his own weakness, and transported
						with hope and desire, and big with irresistible assurance;
						and indeed such a one is (as Simonides says) like a little
						sucking foal running by the mother's side, and desires to
						be incorporated into the very same nature with a good
						man. For this is an especial sign of true proficiency, to
						love and affect their way of life whose actions we emulate,
						and, upon account of an honorable opinion we always entertain for them, to do as they do. But whosoever he is
						that entertains a contentious or malicious design against
						his betters, let him be assured that he is possessed with a
						greedy desire of honor or greatness, but has neither a
						true respect nor admiration for virtue.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="15">
            <p>When therefore we once begin so to love good

					man himself happy, and him who hears his discourses
					sharer in his felicity, but also to admire and love his
					habit, gait, look, and very smile, so as to wish ourselves
					to be that very person, then we may be assured that we
					have made very good proficiency.</p>
            <p>This assurance will be advanced, if we do not only admire good men in prosperity, but like lovers, who are
						taken ever with the lisping and pale looks of their mistresses (as Araspes is said to have been smitten with the
						tears and dejected looks of a mournful and afflicted Panthea), have an affection for virtue in its most mournful
						dress, so as not at all to dread the banishment of Aristides, the imprisonment of Anaxagoras, the poverty of
						Socrates, nor the hard fate of Phocion, but to embrace and
						respect their virtues, even under such injustice, and upon
						thoughts of it, to repeat this verse of Euripides,&mdash;
						<quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>This is certain, if any one addresses himself to virtue
						with this resolution, not to be dejected at the appearance
						of difficulty, but heartily admires and prosecutes its divine
						perfection, none of the evil we have spoken of can divert
						his good intentions. To what I have said I may add this,
						that when we go upon any business, undertake any office,
						or chance upon any affair whatever, we must set before
						our eyes some excellent person, either alive or dead; and
						consider with ourselves what Plato for the purpose would
						have done in this affair, what Epaminondas would have
						said, how Lycurgus or Agesilaus would have behaved
						themselves, that, addressing ourselves and adorning our
						minas at these mirrors, we may correct every disagreeing
						word and irregular passion. It is commonly said, that
						those that have got by heart the names of the Idaei Dactyli make use of them as charms to drive away fear, if they
						can but confidently repeat them one by one; so the con
						
						<pb id="v.2.p.473"/>
						
						sideration and remembrance of good men, being present
						and entertained in our minds, do preserve our proficiency
						in all affections and doubts regular and immovable; wherefore you may judge that this is also a token of a proficient in virtue.</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="16">
            <p>You may observe further, that not to be in a confusion, not to blush, not to hide or correct your clothes or
					any tiling about you, at the unexpected appearance of an
					honorable and wise person, but to have an assurance as if
					you were often conversant with such, is almost a perfect
					demonstration of a very intelligent person.</p>
            <p>It is reported of Alexander, that one night seeing a
						messenger joyfully running towards him and stretching
						out his hand, as if he had something to deliver to him,
						he said to the apparition, Friend, what news do you bring
						me? Is Homer risen from the dead? That admirable
						monarch thought that nothing was wanting to his great
						exploits but such a herald as Homer.</p>
            <p>Consider this, if a young man thrive in the world, it is
						customary for him to desire nothing more than to be seen
						in the company of virtuous and good men, to show them
						his whole furniture, his table, his wife and children, his
						study, his diary or collections; and he is so pleased
						with himself, that he wishes his father or tutor were alive,
						that they might see him in so good a way of living; and
						he could heartily pray that they were alive, to be spectators of his life and actions. But, on the contrary, those
						that have neglected their business, or lost themselves in
						the world, cannot endure the sight or company of their
						relations without a great deal of fear and confusion.</p>

         <div1 type="section" n="17">
            <p>Join this, if you please, to what we said before;
					for it is no small sign, if the proficient thus esteem every
					little fault a great one, and studiously observe and avoid
					all. For, as those persons who despair of ever being rich
					make little account of small expenses, thinking that little
					
					<pb id="v.2.p.474"/>
					
					added to a little will never make any great sum, but when
					they come once to have got a competency, and hope to be
					at last very rich, it advances their desires, so it happens
					in the affairs of virtue;&mdash;he that does not quiet his mind
					by saying with himself, <q direct="unspecified">What matters it what comes
						after? if for the present it be so and so, yet better days
						will come,</q> but who attends every thing, and is not careless if the least vice pass uncondemned, but is troubled
					and concerned at it, such a one makes it appear that he
					has attained something that is pure, which he brightens
					by use and will not suffer to corrupt. For a preconceived
					opinion that nothing we have is valuable (according to
					Aeschylus) makes us careless and indifferent about every
					thing.</p>
            <p>If any one be to make a dry wall or an ordinary hedge,
						it matters not much if he makes use of ordinary wood
						or common stone, any old gravestones, or the like; so
						wicked persons, who confusedly mix and blend all their
						designs and actions in one heap, care not what materials
						they put together. But the proficients in virtue, who
						have already laid the golden solid foundation of a virtuous life, as of a sacred and royal building, take special
						care of the whole work, examine and model every part
						of it according to the rule of reason, believing that it was
						well said by Polycletus, that the hardest work remained
