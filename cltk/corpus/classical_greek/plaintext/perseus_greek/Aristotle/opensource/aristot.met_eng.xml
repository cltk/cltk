					<milestone n="980a" unit="section"/><milestone n="21" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All men naturally desire knowledge. An
					indication of this is our esteem for the senses; for apart from their
					use we esteem them for their own sake, and most of all the sense of
					sight. Not only with a view to action, but even when no action is
					contemplated, we prefer sight, generally speaking, to all the other
					senses.<milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason of
					this is that of all the senses sight best helps us to know things, and
					reveals many distinctions.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now animals
					are by nature born with the power of sensation, and from this some
					acquire the faculty of memory, whereas others do not. <milestone n="980b" unit="section"/><milestone n="21" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Accordingly the former are more intelligent and
					capable of learning than those which cannot remember.<milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such as cannot hear sounds (as
					the bee, and any other similar type of creature) are intelligent, but
					cannot learn; those only are capable of learning which possess this
					sense in addition to the faculty of memory.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus the other animals live by impressions and
					memories, and have but a small share of experience; but the human race
					lives also by art and reasoning.<milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is from memory that men acquire experience,
					because the numerous memories of the same thing eventually produce the
					effect of a single experience. <milestone n="981a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Experience seems
					very similar to science and art,<milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but actually it is through experience that men
					acquire science and art; for as Polus rightly says, "experience
					produces art, but inexperience chance."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 448c">Plat. Gorgias 448c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 462b">Plat. Gorg. 462b-c</bibl>.</note> Art is produced
					when from many notions of experience a single universal judgement is
					formed with regard to like objects.<milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To have a judgement that when Callias was
					suffering from this or that disease this or that benefited him, and
					similarly with Socrates and
					various other individuals, is a matter of experience; but to judge
					that it benefits all persons of a certain type, considered as a class,
					who suffer from this or that disease (e.g. the phlegmatic or bilious
					when suffering from burning fever) is a matter of art.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It would seem that for practical purposes experience is in no way
					inferior to art; indeed we see men of experience succeeding more than
					those who have theory without experience.<milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason of this is a that experience is
					knowledge of particulars, but art of universals; and actions and the
					effects produced are all concerned with the particular. For it is not
					man that the physician cures, except incidentally, but Callias or
					Socrates or some other
					person similarly named, who is incidentally a man as well.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So if a man has theory without experience, and
					knows the universal, but does not know the particular contained in it,
					he will often fail in his treatment; for it is the particular that
					must be treated.<milestone n="1.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nevertheless we consider that knowledge and proficiency belong to
					art rather than to experience, and we assume that artists are wiser
					than men of mere experience (which implies that in all cases wisdom
					depends rather upon knowledge);<milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and this is because the former know the cause,
					whereas the latter do not. For the experienced know the fact, but not
					the wherefore; but the artists know the wherefore and the cause. For
					the same reason we consider that the master craftsmen in every
					profession are more estimable and know more and are wiser than the
					artisans, <milestone n="981b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because they know the reasons of the
					things which are done; but we think that the artisans, like certain
					inanimate objects, do things, but without knowing what they are doing
					(as, for instance, fire burns);<milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>only whereas inanimate objects perform all
					their actions in virtue of a certain natural quality, artisans perform
					theirs through habit. Thus the master craftsmen are superior in
					wisdom, not because they can do things, but because they possess a
					theory and know the causes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In general
					the sign of knowledge or ignorance is the ability to teach, and for
					this reason we hold that art rather than experience is scientific
					knowledge; for the artists can teach, but the others cannot.<milestone n="1.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, we do not consider
					any of the senses to be Wisdom. They are indeed our chief sources of
					knowledge about particulars, but they do not tell us the reason for
					anything, as for example why fire is hot, but only that it
					<emph>is</emph> hot.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is therefore probable that at first
					the inventor of any art which went further than the ordinary
					sensations was admired by his fellow-men, not merely because some of
					his inventions were useful, but as being a wise and superior
					person.<milestone n="1.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And as more
					and more arts were discovered, some relating to the necessities and
					some to the pastimes of life, the inventors of the latter were always
					considered wiser than those of the former,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because their branches of knowledge did
					not aim at utility.<milestone n="1.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence
					when all the discoveries of this kind were fully developed, the
					sciences which relate neither to pleasure nor yet to the necessities
					of life were invented, and first in those places where men had
					leisure. Thus the mathematical sciences originated in the neighborhood
					of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, because there the
					priestly class was allowed leisure.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 274">Plat. Phaedrus 274</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 2.109">Hdt. 2.109</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					difference between art and science and the other kindred mental
					activities has been stated in the<title>Ethics</title><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth.        1139b">Aristot. Nic. Eth.
						6.1139b 14-1141b 8</bibl>.</note>; the reason for our
					present discussion is that it is generally assumed that what is called
					Wisdom<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.
						Metaphysics.</note> is concerned with the primary causes and
					principles, so that, as has been already stated, the man of experience
					is held to be wiser than the mere possessors of any power of
					sensation, the artist than the man of experience, the master craftsman
					than the artisan; and the speculative sciences to be more learned than
					the productive. <milestone n="982a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Thus it is clear that Wisdom is
					knowledge of certain principles and causes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since
					we are investigating this kind of knowledge, we must consider what
					these causes and principles are whose knowledge is Wisdom. Perhaps it
					will be clearer if we take the opinions which we hold about the wise
					man.<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> We consider
					first, then, that the wise man knows all things, so far as it is
					possible, without having knowledge of every one of them individually;
					next, that the wise man is he who can comprehend difficult things,
					such as are not easy for human comprehension (for sense-perception,
					being common to all, is easy, and has nothing to do with Wisdom); and
					further that in every branch of knowledge a man is wiser in proportion
					as he is more accurately informed and better able to expound the
					causes.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again among
					the sciences we consider that that science which is desirable in
					itself and for the sake of knowledge is more nearly Wisdom than that
					which is desirable for its results, and that the superior is more
					nearly Wisdom than the subsidiary; for the wise man should give
					orders, not receive them; nor should he obey others, but the less wise
					should obey him.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such in kind<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in number are the opinions which we
					hold with regard to Wisdom and the wise. Of the qualities there
					described the knowledge of everything must necessarily belong to him
					who in the highest degree possesses knowledge of the universal,
					because he knows in a sense all the particulars which it comprises.
					These things, viz. the most universal, are perhaps the hardest for man
					to grasp, because they are furthest removed from the senses.<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the most exact of the
					sciences are those which are most concerned with the first principles;
					for those which are based on fewer principles are more exact than
					those which include additional principles; e.g., arithmetic is more
					exact than geometry.<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, the science which investigates causes is more instructive
					than one which does not, for it is those who tell us the causes of any
					particular thing who instruct us. Moreover, knowledge and
					understanding which are desirable for their own sake are most
					attainable in the knowledge of that which is most knowable. For the
					man who desires knowledge for its own sake will most desire the most
					perfect knowledge, <milestone n="982b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and this is the knowledge of the
					most knowable, and the things which are most knowable are first
					principles and causes; for it is through these and from these that
					other things come to be known, and not these through the particulars
					which fall under them.<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					that science is supreme, and superior to the subsidiary, which knows
					for what end each action is to be done; i.e. the Good in each
					particular case, and in general the highest Good in the whole of
					nature.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus as a result of all the above
					considerations the term which we are investigating falls under the
					same science, which must speculate about first principles and causes;
					for the Good, i.e. the <emph>end</emph> , is one of the
					causes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>That it is not a
					productive science is clear from a consideration of the first
					philosophers.<milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is
					through wonder that men now begin and originally began to
					philosophize; wondering in the first place at obvious perplexities,
					and then by gradual progression raising questions about the greater
					matters too, e.g. about the changes of the moon and of the sun, about
					the stars and about the origin of the universe.<milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now he who wonders and is perplexed
					feels that he is ignorant (thus the myth-lover is in a sense a
					philosopher, since myths are composed of wonders);<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>therefore if it was to escape ignorance
					that men studied philosophy, it is obvious that they pursued science
					for the sake of knowledge, and not for any practical
					utility.<milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The actual
					course of events bears witness to this; for speculation of this kind
					began with a view to recreation and pastime, at a time when
					practically all the necessities of life were already supplied. Clearly
					then it is for no extrinsic advantage that we seek this knowledge; for
					just as we call a man independent who exists for himself and not for
					another, so we call this the only independent science, since it alone
					exists for itself.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For this reason its acquisition might
					justly be supposed to be beyond human power, since in many respects
					human nature is servile; in which case, as Simonides<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Sim. Fr. 3">Simon. Fr. 3
						(Hiller)</bibl>.</note> says, "God alone can have this
					privilege," and man should only seek the knowledge which is within his
					reach.<milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed if the
					poets are right and the Deity is by nature jealous, <milestone n="983a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is probable that in this case He would be
					particularly jealous, and all those who excel in knowledge
					unfortunate. But it is impossible for the Deity to be jealous (indeed,
					as the proverb<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Sol. Fr. 26">Solon, Fr. 26 (Hiller)</bibl>; Leutsch and Schneidwin,
						<title>Paroemiographi</title>, 1.371.</note> says, "poets
					tell many a lie"), nor must we suppose that any other form of
					knowledge is more precious than this; for what is most divine is most
					precious.<milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now there
					are two ways only in which it can be divine. A science is divine if it
					is peculiarly the possession of God, or if it is concerned with divine
					matters. And this science alone fulfils both these conditions; for (a)
					all believe that God is one of the causes and a kind of principle, and
					(b) God is the sole or chief possessor of this sort of knowledge.
					Accordingly, although all other sciences are more necessary than this,
					none is more excellent.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The acquisition of this
					knowledge, however, must in a sense result in something which is the
					reverse of the outlook with which we first approached the inquiry. All
					begin, as we have said, by wondering that things should be as they
					are, e.g. with regard to marionettes, or the solstices, or the
					incommensurability<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.
						the fact that the diagonal of a square cannot be rationally
						expressed in terms of the side.</note> of the diagonal of a
					square; because it seems wonderful to everyone who has not yet
					perceived the cause that a thing should not be measurable by the
					smallest unit.<milestone n="2.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But we must
					end with the contrary and (according to the proverb)<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. <foreign lang="greek">deute/ron a)meino/nwn</foreign>("second thoughts are
						better"). Leutsch and Schneidwin 1.62.</note> the better view,
					as men do even in these cases when they understand them;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for a geometrician would wonder
					at nothing so much as if the diagonal were to become
					measurable.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus we have stated
					what is the nature of the science which we are seeking, and what is
					the object which our search and our whole investigation must
					attain.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of
					the primary causes, because it is when we think that we understand its
					primary cause that we claim to know each particular thing. Now there
					are four recognized kinds of cause. Of these we hold that one is the
					essence or essential nature of the thing (since the "reason why" of a
					thing is ultimately reducible to its formula, and the ultimate "reason
					why" is a cause and principle); another is the matter or substrate;
					the third is the source of motion; and the fourth is the cause which
					is opposite to this, namely the purpose or "good";<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for this is the end of every generative
					or motive process. We have investigated these sufficiently in the
					<title>Physics</title><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 2.3">Phys. 2.3</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 2.7">Phys. 2.7</bibl></note>; <milestone n="983b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>however, let us avail ourselves of the evidence of
					those who have before us approached the investigation of reality and
					philosophized about Truth. For clearly they too recognize certain
					principles and causes, and so it will be of some assistance to our
					present inquiry if we study their teaching; because we shall either
					discover some other kind of cause, or have more confidence in those
					which we have just described.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Most of the earliest
					philosophers conceived only of material principles as underlying all
					things. That of which all things consist, from which they first come
					and into which on their destruction they are ultimately resolved, of
					which the essence persists although modified by its
					affections&mdash;this, they say, is an element and principle of
					existing things. Hence they believe that nothing is either generated
					or destroyed, since this kind of primary entity always persists.
					Similarly we do not say that
					Socrates comes into being <emph>absolutely</emph> when he
					becomes handsome or cultured, nor that he is destroyed when he loses
					these qualities; because the substrate,
					Socrates himself, persists.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In the same way nothing else is
					generated or destroyed; for there is some one entity (or more than
					one) which always persists and from which all other things are
					generated. <milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All are not
					agreed, however,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as to the
					number and character of these principles.
					Thales,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Thales of
						<placeName key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, fl.
						<date value="-585">585</date> B.C.</note> the founder of

						of the Ionian monists, who sought a single material principle of

					why he also propounded that the earth floats on water). Presumably he
					derived this assumption from seeing that the nutriment of everything
					is moist, and that heat itself is generated from moisture and depends
					upon it for its existence (and that from which a thing is generated is
					always its first principle). He derived his assumption, then, from
					this; and also from the fact that the seeds of everything have a moist
					nature, whereas water is the first principle of the nature of moist
					things.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There are some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Crat. 402b">Plat.

						180c,d</bibl>.</note> who think that the men of very
					ancient times, long before the present era, who first speculated about
					the gods, also held this same opinion about the primary entity. For

					this view of the primary entity is really ancient and time-honored may

					assume one and others more than one corporeal principle, but both

					while they likewise spoke of two principles, made this further
					addition, which is peculiar to them: they believed, not that the

					unity, and assume as its matter some one nature, and that corporeal
					and extended, are clearly mistaken in many respects. They only assume
					elements of corporeal things, and not of incorporeal ones, which also
					exist. They attempt to state the causes of generation and destruction,
					and investigate the nature of everything; and at the same time do away
					with the cause of motion.<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then there is their failure to regard the <emph>essence</emph> or
					formula as a cause of anything; and further their readiness to call
					any one of the simple bodies&mdash;except earth&mdash;a first
					principle, without inquiring how their reciprocal generation is
					effected. I refer to fire, water, earth and air. Of these some are
					generated from each other by combination and others by
					differentiation;<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and
					this difference is of the greatest importance in deciding their
					relative priority. In one way it might seem that the most elementary
					body is that from which first other bodies are produced by
					combination; <milestone n="989a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and this will be that body which is
					rarest and composed of the finest particles.<milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence all who posit Fire as first principle
					will be in the closest agreement with this theory. However, even among
					the other thinkers everyone agrees that the primary corporeal element
					is of this kind. At any rate none of the Monists thought earth likely
					to be an element&mdash;obviously on account of the size of its
					particles&mdash;<milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but each of the other three has had an advocate; for some name fire

					too says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.984b">Aristot. Met. 4.1</bibl>.</note>
					that earth was generated first of corporeal things&mdash;so
					ancient and popular is the conception found to be. Thus according to
					this theory anyone who suggests any of these bodies other than fire,
					or who assumes something "denser than air but rarer than water,"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.988a">Aristot. Met.

					in generation is prior in nature, and that which is developed and
					combined is posterior in generation, then the reverse will be the
					case; water will be prior to air, and earth to water. So much for
					those who posit <emph>one</emph> cause such as we have
					described.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>The same will apply too if anyone
					posits more than one, as e.g. Empedocles says that matter consists of

					must occur in his case also, some the same as before, and some
					peculiar to him. First, we can see things being generated from each
					other in a way which shows that fire and earth do not persist as the
					same corporeal entity. (This subject has been treated in my works on
					Natural Science.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Cael. 3.7">Aristot. De Caelo, 3.7</bibl>;

					or any other such attribute; for it cannot have had any quality or

					further, assuming that it be granted to them or proved by them that

					Again, other things are not<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>in any accepted sense <emph>derived</emph> from the Forms.<milestone n="9.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To say that the Forms are

					things just mentioned.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, if the Forms are
					numbers, in what sense will they be causes? Is it because things are

					Socrates, such and such
					another Callias? then why are those numbers the causes of these? Even
					if the one class is eternal and the other not, it will make no
					difference.<milestone n="9.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if
					it is because the things of our world are ratios of numbers (e.g. a

					be a number of certain other things which are its substrate. The Idea

					one number can be composed of several numbers, but how can one Form be

					from what principles can these be derived? or on what grounds are they

					been no Timotheus. It is just the same in the case of those who have
					theorized about reality: we have derived certain views from some of
					them, and they in turn were indebted to others.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, philosophy is rightly called<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>a knowledge of Truth. The object of theoretic
					knowledge is truth, while that of practical knowledge is action; for
					even when they are investigating <emph>how</emph> a thing is so,
					practical men study not the eternal principle but the relative and
					immediate application.<milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					we cannot know the truth apart from the cause. Now every thing through
					which a common quality is communicated to other things is itself of
					all those things in the highest degree possessed of that quality (e.g.
					fire is hottest, because it is the cause of heat in everything else);
					hence that also is most true which causes all subsequent things to be
					true.<milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore in
					every case the first principles of things must necessarily be true
					above everything else&mdash;since they are not merely
					<emph>sometimes</emph> true, nor is anything the cause of their
					existence, but they are the cause of the existence of other
					things,&mdash;and so as each thing is in respect of existence, so
					it is in respect of truth. <milestone n="994a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, it is obvious that there is some first principle, and that
					the causes of things are not infinitely many either in a direct
					sequence or in kind. For the material generation of one thing from
					another cannot go on in an infinite progression (e.g. flesh from
					earth, earth from air, air from fire, and so on without a stop); nor
					can the source of motion (e.g. man be moved by air, air by the sun,
					the sun by Strife,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle is
						evidently thinking of Empedocles' system.</note> with no limit
					to the series).<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In the same
					way neither can the Final Cause recede to infinity&mdash;walking
					having health for its object, and health happiness, and happiness
					something else: one thing always being done for the sake of
					another.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is
					just the same with the Formal Cause. For in the case of all
					intermediate terms of a series which are contained between a first and
					last term, the prior term is necessarily the cause of those which
					follow it; because if we had to say which of the three is the cause,
					we should say "the first." At any rate it is not the last term,
					because what comes at the end is not the cause of anything. Neither,
					again, is the intermediate term, which is only the cause of
					one<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and it makes no
					difference whether there is one intermediate term or several, nor
					whether they are infinite or limited in number). But of series which
					are infinite in this way, and in general of the infinite, all the
					parts are equally intermediate, down to the present moment. Thus if
					there is no first term, there is no cause at all.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the
					other hand there can be no infinite progression downwards<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(where there is a beginning in
					the upper direction) such that from fire comes water, and from water
					earth, and in this way some other kind of thing is always being
					produced. There are two senses in which one thing "comes from"
					another&mdash;apart from that in which one thing is said to come
					<emph>after</emph> another, e.g. the Olympian "from"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)k</foreign> means not only "from" but "after"; Aristotle
						dismisses this latter meaning. The Isthmian fell alternatively
						in the same year as the Olympian festival; when this happened
						the former was held in the spring and the latter in the summer.
						Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1023b">Aristot. Met. 5.24.5.</bibl></note> the Isthmian
					games&mdash;either as a man comes from a child as it develops, or
					as air comes from water.<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now we say that a man "comes from" a child in the sense that that
					which <emph>has</emph> become something comes from that which
					<emph>is</emph> becoming: i.e. the perfect from the imperfect. (For
					just as "becoming" is always intermediate between being and not-being,
					so is that which is becoming between what is and what is not. The
					learner is becoming informed, and that is the meaning of the statement
					that the informed person "comes from" the learner.)<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other hand A comes from B in the
					sense that water comes from air by the destruction of B. Hence the
					former class of process is not reversible <milestone n="994b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(e.g.
					a child cannot come from a man, for the result of the process of
					becoming is not the thing which is becoming, but that which exists
					after the process is complete. So day comes from early dawn, because
					it is after dawn; and hence dawn does not come from day). But the
					other class is reversible.<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In both cases progression to infinity is impossible; for in the
					former the intermediate terms must have an end, and in the second the
					process is reversible, for the destruction of one member of a pair is
					the generation of the other. At the same time the first cause, being
					eternal, cannot be destroyed; because, since the process of generation
					is not infinite in the upper direction, that cause which first, on its
					destruction, became something else, cannot possibly be eternal.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The argument is elliptical and
						confused. The meaning is this: Since there is an upward limit,
						there is a first cause which is eternal, being independent of
						any other cause. Therefore this cause cannot cause other things
						by its destruction, in the manner just
						described.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, the Final cause of a
					thing is an <emph>end</emph> , and is such that it does not happen for
					the sake of some thing else, but all other things happen for its sake.
					So if there is to be a last term of this kind, the series will not be
					infinite; and if there is no such term, there will be no Final cause.
					Those who introduce infinity do not realize that they are abolishing
					the nature of the Good (although no one would attempt to do anything
					if he were not likely to reach some limit);<milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>nor would there be any intelligence in the
					world, because the man who has intelligence always acts for the sake
					of something, and this is a limit, because the <emph>end</emph> is a
					limit.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor again can the Formal
					cause be referred back to another fuller definition;<milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for the prior definition is
					always closer, and the posterior is not; and where the original
					definition does not apply, neither does the subsequent one.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Further, those who hold such a
					view do away with scientific knowledge, for on this view it is
					impossible to know anything until one comes to terms which cannot be
					analyzed.<milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Understanding, too, is impossible; for how can one conceive of
					things which are infinite in this way? It is different in the case of
					the line, which, although in respect of divisibility it never stops,
					yet cannot be conceived of unless we make a stop (which is why, in
					examining an infinite<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.
						infinitely divisible.</note> line, one cannot count the
					sections).<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">It does not
						follow that we can apprehend that which is infinite because we

						and regarding it simply as divisible into a very great (but not
						infinite) number of sections. An infinite number of sections can
						neither be apprehended nor counted.</note><milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Even matter has to be conceived under
					the form of something which changes,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Matter too, which is infinite in its varieties,

					kinds of causes were infinite in <emph>number</emph> it would still be
					impossible to acquire knowledge; for it is only when we have become

					the habits of the listener; because we expect the language to which we
					are accustomed, <milestone n="995a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and anything beyond this seems not to
					be on the same level, but somewhat strange and unintelligible on
					account of its unfamiliarity; for it is the familiar that is
					intelligible. The powerful effect of familiarity is clearly shown by
					the laws, in which the fanciful and puerile survivals prevail, through
					force of habit, against our recognition of them.<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus some people will not accept the
					statements of a speaker unless he gives a mathematical proof; others
					will not unless he makes use of illustrations; others expect to have a
					poet adduced as witness. Again, some require exactness in everything,
					while others are annoyed by it, either because they cannot follow the
					reasoning or because of its pettiness; for there is something about
					exactness which seems to some people to be mean, no less in an
					argument than in a business transaction.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence one must
					have been already trained how to take each kind of argument, because
					it is absurd to seek simultaneously for knowledge and for the method
					of obtaining it; and neither is easy to acquire. Mathematical accuracy
					is not to be demanded in everything, but only in things which do not
					contain matter.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence this
					method is not that of natural science, because presumably all nature
					is concerned with matter. Hence we should first inquire what nature
					is; for in this way it will become clear what the objects of natural
					science are [and whether it belongs to one science or more than one to
					study the causes<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					principles of things].<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">These

					Firstly, then, with respect to the first point raised: whether it is
					the province of one science or of more than one to study all the kinds
					of causes.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>How can
					<emph>one</emph> science comprehend the first principles unless they
					are contraries? Again, in many things they are not all

					Good"? for everything which is good in itself and of its own nature is
					an <emph>end</emph> and thus a cause, because for its sake other
					things come to be and exist; and the <emph>end</emph> and
					<emph>purpose</emph> is the end of some action, and all actions
					involve motion; thus it would be impossible either for this principle
					to exist in motionless things or for there to be any
					<emph>absolute</emph> Good.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence in mathematics too nothing is proved by means of this cause,
					nor is there any demonstration of the kind "because it is better or
					worse"; indeed no one takes any such consideration into
					account.<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And so for
					this reason some of the sophists, e.g. Aristippus,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Founder of the Cyrenaic school
						in the early fourth century.</note> spurned mathematics, on the
					ground that in the other arts, even the mechanical ones such as

					seeking, or whom of the masters of these sciences shall we consider to
					be most learned in the subject which we are investigating?<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it is possible for all the
					kinds of cause to apply to the same object; e.g. in the case of a
					house the source of motion is the art and the architect; the final
					cause is the function; the matter is earth and stones, and the form is
					the definition. Now to judge from our discussion some time ago<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.982a">Aristot. Met.

					Wisdom is the most sovereign and authoritative kind of knowledge,

					understanding the same thing, we say that the man who recognizes a
					thing by its being something knows more than he who recognizes it by
					its not being something; and even in the former case one knows more
					than another, and most of all he who knows <emph>what</emph> it is,
					and not he who knows its size or quality or natural capacity for
					acting or being acted upon.<milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, in all other cases too, even in such as admit of
					demonstration,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>we
					consider that we know a particular thing when we know
					<emph>what</emph> it is (e.g. what is the squaring of a rectangle?
					answer, the finding of a mean proportional to its sides; and similarly
					in other instances); but in the case of generations and actions and
					all kinds of change, when we know the source of motion.<milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is distinct from and

					healthy. Nor, at the same time, is it true that mensuration is
					concerned with sensible and perishable magnitudes; for then it would
					perish as they do. Nor, again, can astronomy be concerned with
					sensible magnitudes or with this heaven of ours; <milestone n="998a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.27" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for as sensible

					touches the ruler not at a point, but &lt;along a line&gt; as

					it will be sufficient to observe the following.<milestone n="2.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On this view it is not logical that
					only this should be so; in clearly it would be possible for the Forms
					also to be in sensible things; for the same argument applies to both.
					Further, it follows necessarily that two solids must occupy the same
					space; and that the Forms cannot be immovable, being present in
					sensible things, which move.<milestone n="2.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general, what is the object of assuming
					that Intermediates exist, but only in sensible things? The same

					still more impossible.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						problem is dealt with partly in <bibl n="Aristot.        Met. 12.1071b">Aristot.

					difficult to say, not only what view we should adopt in the foregoing
					questions in order to arrive at the truth, but also in the case of the
					first principles (vi.) whether we should assume that the genera, or
					the simplest constituents of each particular thing, are more truly the
					elements and first principles of existing things. E.g., it is
					generally agreed that the elements and first principles of speech are
					those things of which, in their simplest form, all speech is composed;
					and not the common term "speech"; and in the case of geometrical
					propositions we call those the "elements"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1014a">Aristot. Met.
						5.3.3</bibl>.</note> whose proofs are embodied in the proofs of all or
					most of the rest.<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, in
					the case of bodies, both those who hold that there are several
					elements and those who hold that there is one call the things of which
					bodies are composed and constituted first principles. E.g., Empedocles
					states that fire and water and the other things associated with them
					are the elements which are present in things and of which things are
					composed; he does not speak of them as genera of things.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover in the case of other
					things too, if a man wishes to examine their nature <milestone n="998b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>he observes, e.g., of what parts a bed consists and
					how they are put together; and then he comprehends its nature. Thus to
					judge from these arguments the first principles will not be the genera
					of things.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But from the point of view
					that it is through definitions that we get to know each particular
					thing, and that the genera are the first principles of definitions,
					the genera must also be the first principles of the things
					defined.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if to
					gain scientific knowledge of things is to gain it of the species after
					which things are named, the genera are first principles of the
					species. And apparently some even of those<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans and Plato.</note> who call Unity
					or Being or the Great and Small elements of things treat them as
					genera.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor again is it possible
					to speak of the first principles in both senses.<milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The formula of substance is one; but
					the definition by genera will be different from that which tells us of
					what <emph>parts</emph> a thing is composed.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Moreover, assuming that the genera are first
					principles in the truest sense, are we to consider the
					<emph>primary</emph> genera to be first principles, or the final terms
					predicated of individuals? This question too involves some
					dispute.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if
					universals are always more truly first principles, clearly the answer
					will be "the highest genera," since these are predicated of
					everything. Then there will be as many first principles of
					things<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as there are
					primary genera, and so both Unity and Being will be first principles
					and substances, since they are in the highest degree predicated of all
					things.<milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is
					impossible for either Unity or Being to be one genus of existing
					things. For there must <emph>be</emph> differentiae of each genus, and
					each differentia must be <emph>one</emph><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., each differentia must have Being and Unity
						predicated of it.</note>; but it is impossible either for the
					species of the genus to be predicated of the specific differentiae, or
					for the genus to be predicated without its species.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The reasons are given in <bibl n="Aristot. Top. 144a.36">Aristot. Topica, 144a 36-b11</bibl>.</note> Hence if
					Unity or Being is a genus, there will be no differentia Being or
					Unity.<milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if they
					are not genera, neither will they be first principles, assuming that
					it is the genera that are first principles. And further, the
					intermediate terms, taken together with the differentiae, will be
					genera, down to the individuals; but in point of fact, although some
					are thought to be such, others are not. Moreover the differentiae are
					more truly principles than are the genera; and if they also are
					principles, we get an almost infinite number of principles, especially
					if one makes the ultimate genus a principle. <milestone n="999a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, if Unity is really more of the
					nature of a principle, and the indivisible is a unity, and every thing
					indivisible is such either in quantity or in kind, and the indivisible
					in kind is prior to the divisible, and the genera are divisible into
					species, then it is rather the lowest predicate that will be a unity
					(for "man" is not the genus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc.
						but the species.</note> of individual men).<milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, in the case of things which
					admit of priority and posteriority, that which is predicated of the
					things cannot exist apart from them. E.g., if 2 is the first number,
					there will be no Number apart from the species of number; and
					similarly there will be no Figure apart from the species of figures.
					But if the genera do not exist apart from the species in these cases,
					they will scarcely do so in others; because it is assumed that genera
					are most likely to exist in these cases.<milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In individuals, however, there is no priority
					and posteriority. Further, where there is a question of better or
					worse, the better is always prior; so there will be no genus in these
					cases either.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From these considerations
					it seems that it is the terms predicated of individuals, rather than
					the genera, that are the first principles. But again on the other hand
					it is not easy to say in what sense we are to understand these to be
					principles;<milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for the
					first principle and cause must be apart from the things of which it is
					a principle, and must be able to exist when separated from them. But
					why should we assume that such a thing exists<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>alongside of the individual, except in
					that it is predicated universally and of all the terms? And indeed if
					this is a sufficient reason, it is the more universal concepts that
					should rather be considered to be principles; and so the primary
					genera will be the principles.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For partial solutions to the problem see <bibl n="Aristot.        Met. 7.1034b">Aristot.

					motion.<milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, if
					nothing is eternal, even generation is impossible; for there must be
					something which becomes something, i.e. out of which something is
					generated, and of this series the ultimate term must be ungenerated;
					that is if there is any end to the series and generation cannot take
					place out of nothing.<milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, if there is generation and motion, there must be limit too.

					thus much of his theory is consistent: he does not represent some
					things to be perishable and others imperishable, but makes
					everything<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>perishable
					except the elements. But the difficulty now being stated is why some
					things are perishable and others not, assuming that they are derived
					from the same principles.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The foregoing
					remarks may suffice to show that the principles cannot be the
					same.<milestone n="4.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If however
					they are different, one difficulty is whether they too are to be
					regarded as imperishable or as perishable. For if they are perishable,
					it is clearly necessary that they too must be derived from something
					else, since everything passes upon dissolution into that from which it
					is derived. Hence it follows that there are other principles prior to
					the first principles;<milestone n="4.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but
					this is impossible, whether the series stops or proceeds to infinity.
					And further, how can perishable things exist if their principles are
					abolished? On the other hand if the principles are imperishable, why
					should some imperishable principles produce perishable things, and
					others imperishable things? This is not reasonable; either it is
					impossible or it requires much explanation.<milestone n="4.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, no one has so much as attempted to
					maintain different principles; they maintain the same principles for
					everything. <milestone n="1001a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But they swallow down the difficulty
					which we raised first<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.,
						whether all things have the same principles.</note> as though
					they took it to be trifling.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For
						Aristotle's views about the principles of perishable and

					important with a view to the discovery of the truth, is whether after
					all Being and Unity are substances of existing things, and each of
					them is nothing else than Being and Unity respectively, or whether we
					should inquire what exactly Being and Unity are, there being some
					other nature underlying them.<milestone n="4.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some take the former, others the latter view
					of the nature of Being and Unity. Plato and the Pythagoreans hold that
					neither Being nor Unity is anything else than itself, and that this is
					their nature, their essence being simply Being and Unity.<milestone n="4.26" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the physicists, e.g.
					Empedocles, explain what Unity is by reducing it to something, as it
					were, more intelligible&mdash;or it would seem that by Love
					Empedocles means Unity; at any rate Love is the cause of Unity in all
					things. Others identify fire and others air with this Unity and Being
					of which things consist and from which they have been
					generated.<milestone n="4.27" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those who
					posit more numerous elements also hold the same view; for they too
					must identify Unity and Being with all the principles which they
					recognize.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And it
					follows that unless one assumes Unity and Being to be substance in
					some sense, no other universal term can be substance; for Unity and
					Being are the most universal of all terms,<milestone n="4.28" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and if there is no absolute Unity or absolute
					Being, no other concept can well exist apart from the so-called
					particulars. Further, if Unity is not substance, clearly number cannot
					be a separate characteristic of things; for number is units, and the
					unit is simply a particular kind of one.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>On the other
					hand, if there is absolute Unity and Being, their substance must be
					Unity and Being; for no other term is predicated universally of Unity
					and Being, but only these terms themselves. Again, if there is to be
					absolute Being and absolute Unity, it is very hard to see how there
					can be anything else besides these; I mean, how things can be more
					than one.<milestone n="4.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For that which
					is other than what is, is not; and so by Parmenides' argument<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">By <foreign lang="greek">to\
						o)/n</foreign> Parmenides meant "what is," i.e. the real

						distinction.</note> it must follow that all things are one, i.e.
					Being. <milestone n="1001b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>In either case there is a difficulty;
					for whether Unity is not a substance or whether there is absolute
					Unity, number cannot be a substance.<milestone n="4.31" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It has already been stated why this is so if
					Unity is not a substance; and if it is, there is the same difficulty
					as about Being. For whence, if not from the absolute One or Unity, can
					there be another one? It must be not-one; but all things are either
					one, or many of which each is one. Further, if absolute Unity is
					indivisible, by Zeno's axiom
					it will be nothing.<milestone n="4.32" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					that which neither when added makes a thing greater nor when
					subtracted makes it smaller is not an existent thing, he says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Zeno Eleat. Fr. 2">Zeno, Fr. 2</bibl>,
						and see Burnet, E.G.P. sects. 157 ff.</note>; clearly assuming
					that what exists is spatial magnitude. And if it is a spatial
					magnitude it is corporeal, since the corporeal exists in all
					dimensions, whereas the other magnitudes, the plane or line, when
					added to a thing in one way will increase it, but when added in
					another will not; and the point or unit will not increase a thing in
					any way whatever.<milestone n="4.33" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					since Zeno's view is unsound, and it is possible for a thing to be
					indivisible in such a way that it can be defended even against his
					argument (for such a thing<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">e.g.,
						a point is indivisible and has no magnitude, yet added to other

					even if one supposes the case to be<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>such that number is generated, as some say, from

					question whether numbers, bodies, planes and points are substances or
					not. If not, the question of what Being is, what the substances of
					things are, baffles us; for modifications and motions and relations
					and dispositions and ratios do not seem to indicate the substance of
					anything; they are all predicated of a substrate, and none of them is
					a definite thing.<milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for
					those things which might be especially supposed to indicate
					substance&mdash;water, earth, fire and air, of which composite
					bodies are composed&mdash; <milestone n="1002a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>their heat and cold
					and the like are modifications, not substances; and it is only the
					body which undergoes these modifications that persists as something
					real and a kind of substance.<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, the body is less truly substance than
					the plane, and the plane than the line, and the line than the unit or
					point; for it is by these that the body is defined, and it seems that
					they are possible without the body, but that the body cannot exist
					without them.<milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is why
					the vulgar and the earlier thinkers supposed that substance and Being
					are Body, and everything else the modifications of Body; and hence
					also that the first principles of bodies are the first principles of
					existing things; whereas later thinkers with a greater reputation for
					wisdom supposed that substance and Being are numbers.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As we
					have said, then, if these things are not substance, there is no
					substance or Being at all; for the attributes of these things surely
					have no right to be called existent things. On the other hand, if it
					be agreed that lines and points are more truly substance than bodies
					are, yet unless we can see to what <emph>kind</emph> of bodies they
					belong (for they cannot be in sensible bodies) there will still be no
					substance.<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further,
					it is apparent that all these lines are divisions of Body, either in
					breadth<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or in depth or
					in length. Moreover every kind of shape is equally present in a solid,
					so that if "Hermes is not in the stone,"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Apparently a proverbial expression.</note>
					neither is the half-cube in the cube as a determinate shape.<milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence neither is the plane; for
					if any kind of plane were in it, so would that plane be which defines
					the half-cube. The same argument applies to the line and to the point
					or unit. Hence however true it may be that body is substance, if
					planes, lines and points are more truly substance than Body is, and
					these are not substance in any sense, the question of what Being is
					and what is the substance of things baffles us.<milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Because, in addition to the above
					arguments, absurd results follow from a consideration of generation
					and destruction; for it seems that if substance, not having existed
					before, now exists, or having existed before, subsequently does not
					exist it suffers these changes in the process of generation and
					destruction. But points, lines and planes, although they exist at one
					time and at another do not, cannot be in process of being either
					generated or destroyed;<milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for
					whenever bodies are joined or divided, <milestone n="1002b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>at one
					time, when they are joined one surface is instantaneously produced,
					and at another, when they are divided, two. Thus when the bodies are
					combined the surface does not exist but has perished; and when they
					are divided, surfaces exist which did not exist before. (The
					indivisible point is of course never divided into two.) And if they
					<emph>are</emph> generated and destroyed, from what are they
					generated?<milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is
					very much the same with "the present moment" in time. This too cannot
					be generated and destroyed; but nevertheless it seems always to be
					different, not being a substance. And obviously it is the same with
					points, lines and planes, for the argument is the same; they are all
					similarly either limits or divisions.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For arguments against the substantiality of

					only.<milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus if this is
					necessarily so, it is necessary for this reason to posit the Forms

					"being " is used in various senses, but always with reference to one
					principle. For some things are said to "be" because they are
					substances; others because they are modifications of substance; others
					because they are a process towards substance, or destructions or
					privations or qualities of substance, or productive or generative of

					<emph>is</emph> not-being.)<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And so, just as there is one science of all

					concepts of humanity and existence are not dissociated in respect of
					either coming to be or ceasing to be), and similarly in the case of
					the term "one," so that obviously the additional term in these phrases
					has the same significance, and Unity is nothing distinct from
					Being;<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and further if
					the substance of each thing is one in no accidental sense, and

					privation of Unity, because in both cases we are studying Unity, to
					which the negation (or privation) refers, stated either in the simple
					form that Unity is not present, or in the form that it is not present
					in a particular class; in the latter case Unity is modified by the
					differentia, apart from the content of the negation (for the negation
					of Unity is its absence); but in privation there is a substrate of
					which the privation is predicated.&mdash;<milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The opposite of Unity, then, is
					Plurality; and so the opposites of the above-mentioned
					concepts&mdash;Otherness, Dissimilarity, Inequality and everything
					else which is derived from these or from Plurality or
					Unity&mdash;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>fall
					under the cognizance of the aforesaid science. And one of them is
					Oppositeness; for this is a form of Difference, and Difference is a
					form of Otherness.<milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence
					since the term "one" is used in various senses, so too will these
					terms be used; yet it pertains to one science to take cognizance of
					them all. For terms fall under different sciences, not if they are
					used in various senses, but if their definitions are neither identical
					nor referable to a common notion.<milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since everything is referred to that which
					is primary, e.g. all things which are called "one" are referred to the
					primary "One," we must admit that this is also true of Identity and
					Otherness and the Contraries. Thus we must first distinguish all the
					senses in which each term is used, and then attribute them to the
					primary in the case of each predicate, and see how they are related to
					it; for some will derive their name from possessing and others from
					producing it, and others for similar reasons.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus

					essence and the attributes of these concepts.<milestone n="2.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And those who investigate them err, not
					in being unphilosophical, but because the substance, of which they
					have no real knowledge, is prior. For just as number <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> number has its peculiar modifications, e.g. oddness
					and evenness, commensurability and equality, excess and defect, and
					these things are inherent in numbers both considered independently and
					in relation to other numbers; and as similarly other peculiar
					modifications are inherent in the solid and the immovable and the
					moving and the weightless and that which has weight; so Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being has certain peculiar modifications,
					and it is about these that it is the philosopher's function to
					discover the truth. And here is evidence of this fact.<milestone n="2.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Dialecticians and sophists
					wear the same appearance as the philosopher, for sophistry is Wisdom
					in appearance only, and dialecticians discuss all subjects,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and Being is a subject common to
					them all; but clearly they discuss these concepts because they
					appertain to philosophy.<milestone n="2.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For sophistry and dialectic are concerned with the same class of
					subjects as philosophy, but philosophy differs from the former in the
					nature of its capability and from the latter in its outlook on life.
					Dialectic treats as an exercise what philosophy tries to understand,
					and sophistry seems to be philosophy; but is not.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, the second column of contraries is privative, and
					everything is reducible to Being and Not being, and Unity and
					Plurality; e.g. Rest falls under Unity and Motion under Plurality. And
					nearly everyone agrees that substance and existing things are composed
					of contraries; at any rate all speak of the first principles as
					contraries&mdash;<milestone n="2.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>some as Odd and Even,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						Pythagoreans.</note> some as Hot and Cold,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Perhaps Parmenides.</note> some
					as Limit and Unlimited,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						Platonists.</note> some as Love and Strife.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Empedocles.</note> And it is
					apparent that all other things also are reducible to Unity and
					Plurality (we may assume this reduction); <milestone n="1005a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					the principles adduced by other thinkers fall entirely under these as
					genera.<milestone n="2.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear,
					then, from these considerations also, that it pertains to a single
					science to study Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being; for all
					things are either contraries or derived from contraries, and the first
					principles of the contraries are Unity and Plurality. And these belong
					to one science, whether they have reference to one common notion or
					not. Probably the truth is that they have not; but nevertheless even
					if the term "one" is used in various senses, the others will be
					related to the primary sense (and similarly with the
					contraries)&mdash;<milestone n="2.24" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>even if Being or Unity is not a universal and
					the same in all cases, or is not separable from particulars (as it
					presumably is not; the unity is in some cases one of reference and in
					others one of succession). For this very reason it is not the function
					of the geometrician to inquire what is Contrariety or Completeness or
					Being or Unity or Identity or Otherness, but to proceed from the
					assumption of them.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Clearly, then, it pertains to one
					science to study Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being, and the
					attributes inherent in it <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being; and the
					same science investigates, besides the concepts mentioned above,
					Priority and Posteriority, Genus and Species, Whole and Part, and all
					other such concepts.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must pronounce whether it pertains
					to the same science<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to study
					both the so-called axioms in mathematics and substance, or to
					different sciences. It is obvious that the investigation of these
					axioms too pertains to one science, namely the science of the
					philosopher; for they apply to all existing things, and not to a
					particular class separate and distinct from the rest. Moreover all
					thinkers employ them&mdash;because they are axioms of Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being, and every genus possesses
					Being&mdash;<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but
					employ them only in so far as their purposes require; i.e., so far as
					the genus extends about which they are carrying out their proofs.
					Hence since these axioms apply to all things <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being (for this is what is common to them), it is the
					function of him who studies Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being to
					investigate them as well.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For this reason no one who is pursuing a particular
					inquiry&mdash;neither a geometrician nor an
					arithmetician&mdash;attempts to state whether they are true or
					false; but some of the physicists did so, quite naturally; for they
					alone professed to investigate nature as a whole, and Being.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But inasmuch as there is a more
					ultimate type of thinker than the natural philosopher (for nature is
					only a genus of Being), the investigation of these axioms too will
					belong to the universal thinker who studies the primary reality.
					<milestone n="1005b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Natural philosophy is a kind of Wisdom,
					but not the primary kind.<milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for the attempts of some of those who discuss how the truth
					should be received, they are due to lack of training in logic; for
					they should understand these things before they approach their task,
					and not investigate while they are still learning.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Clearly then it is the function of the
					philosopher, i.e. the student of the whole of reality in its essential
					nature, to investigate also the principles of syllogistic reasoning.
					And it is proper for him who best understands each class of subject to
					be able to state the most certain principles of that subject; so that
					he who understands the modes of Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being
					should be able to state the most certain principles of all
					things.<milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now this
					person is the philosopher, and the most certain principle of all is
					that about which one cannot be mistaken; for such a principle must be
					both the most familiar (for it is about the unfamiliar that errors are
					always made), and not based on hypothesis.<milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the principle which the student of any
					form of Being must grasp is no hypothesis; and that which a man must
					know if he knows anything he must bring with him to his
					task.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Clearly, then, it is a
					principle of this kind that is the most certain of all principles. Let
					us next state <emph>what</emph> this principle is.<milestone n="3.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"It is impossible for the same
					attribute at once to belong and not to belong<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to the same thing and in the same
					relation"; and we must add any further qualifications that may be
					necessary to meet logical objections. This is the most certain of all
					principles, since it possesses the required definition;<milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is impossible for
					anyone to suppose that the same thing is and is not, as some imagine
					that Heraclitus says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For
						examples of Heraclitus's paradoxes cf. <bibl n="Heraclit. Fr. 36">Heraclitus
							Fr. 36, 57, 59 (Bywater)</bibl>; and for their meaning see
						Burnet, E.G.P. 80.</note>&mdash;for what a man says does not
					necessarily represent what he believes.<milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if it is impossible for contrary
					attributes to belong at the same time to the same subject (the usual
					qualifications must be added to this premiss also), and an opinion
					which contradicts another is contrary to it, then clearly it is
					impossible for the same man to suppose at the same time that the same
					thing is and is not; for the man who made this error would entertain
					two contrary opinions at the same time.<milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence all men who are demonstrating anything
					refer back to this as an ultimate belief; for it is by nature the
					starting-point of all the other axioms as well.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There
					are some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the
					same thing can be and not be, <milestone n="1006a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and say that it is
					possible to hold this view. Many even of the physicists adopt this
					theory. But we have just assumed that it is impossible at once to be
					and not to be, and by this means we have proved that this is the most
					certain of all principles.<milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some, indeed, demand to have the law proved, but this is because
					they lack education<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc., in
						logic.</note>; for it shows lack of education not to know of
					what we should require proof, and of what we should not. For it is
					quite impossible that everything should have a proof; the process
					would go on to infinity, so that even so there would be no proof.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Every proof is based upon some
						hypothesis, to prove which another hypothesis must be assumed,
						and so on ad infinitum.</note> If on the other hand there are
					some things of which no proof need be sought, they cannot say what
					principle they think to be more self-evident. Even in the case of this
					law, however, we can demonstrate the impossibility by refutation, if
					only our opponent makes some statement. If he makes none, it is absurd
					to seek for an argument against one who has no arguments of his own
					about anything, in so far as he has none; for such a person, in so far
					as he is such, is really no better than a vegetable.<milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And I say that proof by refutation
					differs from simple proof in that he who attempts to prove might seem
					to beg the fundamental question, whereas if the discussion is provoked
					thus by someone else, refutation and not proof will result.<milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The starting-point for all such
					discussions is not the claim that he should state that something is or
					is not so<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(because this
					might be supposed to be a begging of the question), but that he should
					say something significant both to himself and to another (this is
					essential if any argument is to follow; for otherwise such a person
					cannot reason either with himself or with another);<milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and if this is granted, demonstration
					will be possible, for there will be something already defined. But the
					person responsible is not he who demonstrates but he who acquiesces;
					for though he disowns reason he acquiesces to reason. Moreover, he who
					makes such an admission as this has admitted the truth of something
					apart from demonstration [so that not everything will be "so and not
					so"].<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus in the first place it is obvious that
					this at any rate is true: that the term "to be" or "not to be" has a
					definite meaning; so that not everything can be "so and not so."
					Again, if "man" has one meaning, let this be "two-footed
					animal."<milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By "has one
					meaning" I mean this: if X means "man," then if anything is a man, its
					humanity will consist in being X. And it makes no difference even if
					it be said that "man" has several meanings, provided that they are
					limited in number; <milestone n="1006b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for one could assign a different
					name to each formula.<milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					instance, it might be said that "man" has not one meaning but several,
					one of which has the formula "two-footed animal," and there might be
					many other formulae as well, if they were limited in number; for a
					particular name could be assigned to each for formula.<milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If on the other hand it be
					said that "man" has an infinite number of meanings, obviously there
					can be no discourse; for not to have one meaning is to have no
					meaning, and if words have no meaning there is an end of discourse
					with others, and even, strictly speaking, with oneself; because it is
					impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; and
					even if this were possible, one name might be assigned to that of
					which we think.<milestone n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now let
					this name, as we said at the beginning, have a meaning; and let it
					have one meaning. Now it is impossible that "being man" should have
					the same meaning as "not being man," that is, if "man" is not merely
					predicable of one subject but has one meaning<milestone n="4.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(for we do not identify "having one
					meaning" with "being predicable of one subject," since in this case
					"cultured" and "white" and "man" would have one meaning, and so all
					things would be one; for they would all have the same meaning). And it
					will be impossible for the same thing to be and not to be, except by
					equivocation, as e.g. one whom we call "man"<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>others might call "not-man";<milestone n="4.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but the problem is whether the
					same thing can at once be and not be "man," not in <emph>name</emph> ,
					but in <emph>fact</emph> . If "man" and "not-man" have not different
					meanings, clearly "not being a man" will mean nothing different from
					"being a man"; and so "being a man" will be "not being a man"; they
					will be one.<milestone n="4.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For "to be
					one" means, as in the case of "garment" and "coat," that the formula
					is one. And if "being man" and "being not-man" are to be one, they
					will have the same meaning; but it has been proved above that they
					have different meanings. If then anything can be truly said to be
					"man," it must be "two-footed animal"; for this is what "man" was
					intended to mean.<milestone n="4.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if
					this is necessarily so, it is impossible that at the same time the
					same thing should not be "two-footed animal." For "to be necessarily
					so" means this: that it is impossible not to be so. Thus it cannot be
					true to say at the same time that the same thing is and is not
					man.<milestone n="4.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the same
					argument holds also in the case of not being man; <milestone n="1007a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because "being man" and "being not-man" have different meanings if
					"being white" and "being man" have different meanings (for the
					opposition is much stronger in the former case so as to produce
					different meanings).<milestone n="4.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					if we are told that "white" too means one and the same thing,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. the same as "man."</note>
					we shall say again just what we said before,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1006b">Aristot. Met.
						4.4.12</bibl>.</note> that in that case all things, and not merely
					the opposites, will be one. But if this is impossible, what we have
					stated follows; that is, if our opponent answers our question; but if
					when asked the simple question he includes in his answer the
					negations, he is not answering our question.<milestone n="4.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is nothing to prevent the same thing
					from being "man" and "white" and a multitude of other things; but
					nevertheless when asked whether it is true to say that X is man, or
					not, one should return an answer that means one thing, and not add
					that X is white and large. It is indeed impossible to enumerate all
					the infinity of accidents; and so let him enumerate either all or
					none.<milestone n="4.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly
					therefore, even if the same thing is ten thousand times "man" and
					"not-man," one should not include in one's answer to the question
					whether it is "man" that it is at the same time also "not-man," unless
					one is also bound to include in one's answer all the other accidental
					things that the subject is or is not.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And if one does this, he is not arguing
					properly.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In general those who
					talk like this do away with substance and essence,<milestone n="4.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for they are compelled to assert that
					all things are accidents, and that there is no such thing as "being
					essentially man" or "animal." For if there is to be such a thing as
					"being essentially man," this will not be "being not-man" nor
					"not-being man" (and yet these are negations of it); for it was
					intended to have one meaning, i.e. the substance of
					something.<milestone n="4.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But to
					denote a substance means that the essence is that and nothing else;
					and if for it "being essentially man" is the same as either "being
					essentially not-man" or "essentially not-being man," the essence will
					be something else.<milestone n="4.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus
					they are compelled to say that nothing can have such a definition as
					this, but that all things are accidental; for this is the distinction
					between substance and accident: "white" is an accident of "man,"
					because although he is white, he is not white in essence.<milestone n="4.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since the accidental
					always implies a predication about some subject, if all statements are
					accidental, there will be nothing primary about which they are made;
					<milestone n="1007b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so the predication must proceed to
					infinity. But this is impossible, for not even more than two accidents
					can be combined in predication. An accident cannot be an accident of
					an accident unless both are accidents of the same thing.<milestone n="4.24" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>I mean, e.g., that "white" is
					"cultured" and "cultured" "white" merely because both are accidents of
					a man. But it is not in this sense&mdash;that both terms are
					accidents of something else&mdash;that
					Socrates is cultured. Therefore
					since some accidents are predicated in the latter and some in the
					former sense, such as are predicated in the way that "white" is of
					Socrates cannot be an
					infinite series in the upper direction; e.g. there cannot be another
					accident of "white Socrates,"
					for the sum of these predications does not make a single
					statement.<milestone n="4.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor can
					"white " have a further accident, such as "cultured"; for the former
					is no more an accident of the latter than vice versa; and besides we
					have distinguished that although some predicates are accidental in
					this sense, others are accidental in the sense that "cultured" is to
					Socrates; and whereas
					in the former case the accident is an accident of an accident, it is
					not so in the latter; and thus not all predications will be of
					accidents.<milestone n="4.26" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore
					even so there will be something which denotes substance. And if this
					is so, we have proved that contradictory statements cannot be
					predicated at the same time.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, if
					all contradictory predications of the same subject at the same time
					are true, clearly all things will be one.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.27" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if
					it is equally possible either to affirm or deny anything of anything,
					the same thing will be a trireme and a wall and a man; which is what
					necessarily follows for those who hold the theory of Protagoras.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., that all appearances and
						opinions are true.</note> For if anyone thinks that a man is not
					a trireme, he is clearly not a trireme; and so he also is a trireme if
					the contradictory statement is true.<milestone n="4.28" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the result is the dictum of Anaxagoras,
					"all things mixed together"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">
						<bibl n="Anaxag. Fr. 1">Fr. 1 (Diels).</bibl>
					</note>; so that nothing truly exists. It seems, then, that they are
					speaking of the Indeterminate; and while they think that they are
					speaking of what exists, they are really speaking of what does not;
					for the Indeterminate is that which exists potentially but not
					actually.<milestone n="4.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But indeed
					they must admit the affirmation or negation of any predicate of any
					subject, for it is absurd that in the case of each term its own
					negation should be true, and the negation of some other term which is
					not true of it should not be true. I mean, e.g., that if it is true to
					say that a man is not a man, it is obviously also true to say that he
					is or is not a trireme.<milestone n="4.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then if the affirmation is true, so must the negation be true; but
					if the affirmation is not true the negation will be even truer than
					the negation of the original term itself. <milestone n="1008a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Therefore if the latter negation is true, the negation of "trireme"
					will also be true; and if this is true, the affirmation will be true
					too.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And not only does this follow
					for those who hold this theory, but also that it is not necessary
					either to affirm or to deny a statement.<milestone n="4.31" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if it is true that X is both man and
					not-man, clearly he will be neither man nor not-man; for to the two
					statements there correspond two negations, and if the former is taken
					as a single statement compounded out of two, the latter is also a
					single statement and opposite to it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.32" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, either
					this applies to all terms, and the same thing is both white and
					not-white, and existent and non-existent, and similarly with all other
					assertions and negations; or it does not apply to all, but only to
					some and not to others.<milestone n="4.33" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if it does not apply to all, the exceptions will be
					admitted<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., it will be
						admitted that in certain cases where an attribute is true of a
						subject, the negation is not true; and therefore some
						propositions are indisputable.</note>; but if it does apply to
					all, again either (a) the negation will be true wherever the
					affirmation is true, and the affirmation will be true wherever the
					negation is true, or (d) the negation will be true wherever the
					assertion is true, but the assertion will not always be true where the
					negation is true. <milestone n="4.34" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in
					the latter case there will be something which definitely is not, and
					this will be a certain belief; and if that it is not is certain and
					knowable, the opposite assertion will be still more knowable. But if
					what is denied can be equally truly asserted, it must be either true
					or false to state the predicates separately and say, e.g.,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that a thing is white, and again
					that it is not-white.<milestone n="4.35" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					if it is not-true to state them separately, our opponent does not say
					what he professes to say, and nothing exists; and how can that which
					does not exist speak or walk?<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">If
						our opponent holds that you can only say "A is B and not B," (1)
						he contradicts every statement that he makes; (2) he must say
						that what exists does not exist. Therefore nothing exists, and
						so he himself does not exist; but how can he speak or walk if he
						does not exist?</note> And again all things will be one, as we
					said before,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1007b">Aristot. Met. 4.4.27</bibl>.</note>
					and the same thing will be "man" and "God" and "trireme" and the
					negations of these terms.<milestone n="4.36" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if it is equally possible to assert or deny anything of
					anything, one thing will not differ from another; for if anything does
					differ, it will be true and unique. And similarly even if it is
					possible to make a true statement while separating the predicates,
					what we have stated follows. Moreover it follows that all statements
					would be true and all false; and that our opponent himself admits that
					what he says is false. Besides, it is obvious that discussion with him
					is pointless, because he makes no real statement.<milestone n="4.37" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For he says neither "yes" nor "no," but
					"yes and no"; and again he denies both of these and says "neither yes
					nor no"; otherwise there would be already some definite
					statement.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, if when the
					assertion is true the negation is false, and when the latter is true
					the affirmation is false, it will be impossible to assert and deny
					with truth the same thing at the same time. <milestone n="1008b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.38" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But perhaps it
					will be said that this is the point at issue.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, is the man wrong who supposes that a thing
					is so or not so, and he who supposes both right? If he is right, what
					is the meaning of saying that "such is the nature of reality"?<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">If everything is both so and
						not so, nothing has any definite nature.</note> And if he is not
					right, but is more right than the holder of the first view, reality
					will at once have a definite nature, and this will be true, and not at
					the same time not-true.<milestone n="4.39" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if all men are equally right and wrong, an exponent of this view
					can neither speak nor mean anything, since at the same time he says
					both "yes" and "no." And if he forms no judgement, but "thinks" and
					"thinks not" indifferently, what difference will there be between him
					and the vegetables?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Hence it is quite
					evident that no one, either of those who profess this theory or of any
					other school, is really in this position.<milestone n="4.40" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Otherwise, why does a man walk to <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> and not stay at home, when
					he thinks he ought to make the journey? Why does he not walk early one
					morning into a well or ravine, if he comes to it, instead of clearly
					guarding against doing so, thus showing that he does <emph>not</emph>
					think that it is equally good and not good to fall in? Obviously then
					he judges that the one course is better and the other worse.<milestone n="4.41" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if this is so, he must
					judge that one thing is man and another not man,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and that one thing is sweet and another
					not sweet. For when, thinking that it is desirable to drink water and
					see a man, he goes to look for them, he does not look for and judge
					all things indifferently; and yet he should, if the same thing were
					equally man and not-man.<milestone n="4.42" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But as we have said, there is no one who does not evidently avoid
					some things and not others. Hence, as it seems, all men form
					unqualified judgements, if not about all things, at least about what
					is better or worse.<milestone n="4.43" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if
					they do this by guesswork and without knowledge, they should be all
					the more eager for truth; just as a sick man should be more eager for
					health than a healthy man; for indeed the man who guesses, as
					contrasted with him who knows, is not in a healthy relation to the
					truth.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.44" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, however much things may be "so and not
					so," yet differences of degree are inherent in the nature of things.
					For we should not say that 2 and 3 are equally even; nor are he who
					thinks that 4 is 5, and he who thinks it is 1000, equally wrong: hence
					if they are not equally wrong, the one is clearly less wrong, and so
					more right.<milestone n="4.45" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If then that
					which has more the nature of something is nearer to that something,
					<milestone n="1009a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>there will be some truth to which the
					more true is nearer. And even if there is not, still there is now
					something more certain and true, and we shall be freed from the
					undiluted doctrine which precludes any mental determination.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>From the same view proceeds the theory of Protagoras, and both alike
					must be either true or false. For if all opinions and appearances are
					true, everything must be at once true and false; for many people form
					judgements which are opposite to those of others, and imagine that
					those who do not think the same as themselves are wrong: hence the
					same thing must both be and not be.<milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if this is so, all opinions must be true;
					for those who are wrong and those who are right think contrarily to
					each other. So if reality is of this nature, everyone will be
					right.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Clearly then both these
					theories proceed from the same mental outlook. But the method of
					approach is not the same for all cases; for some require persuasion
					and others compulsion.<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					ignorance of those who have formed this judgement through perplexity
					is easily remedied, because we are dealing<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>not with the theory but with their
					mental outlook; but those who hold the theory for its own sake can
					only be cured by refuting the theory as expressed in their own speech
					and words.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This view comes to those who are perplexed
					from their observation of sensible things. (1.) The belief that
					contradictions and contraries can be true at the same time comes to
					them from seeing the contraries generated from the same
					thing.<milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then if what
					is not cannot be generated, the thing must have existed before as both
					contraries equally&mdash;just as Anaxagoras says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        4.1007b">Aristot. Met.
						4.4.28</bibl>.</note> that everything is mixed in
					everything; and also Democritus, for he too says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        1.985b">Aristot. Met.

					equally in any part, and yet the latter <emph>is</emph> , and the
					former <emph>is not</emph>.<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To those, then, who base their judgement on these considerations, we
					shall say that although in one sense their theory is correct, in
					another they are mistaken. For "being" has two meanings, so that there
					is a sense in which something can be generated from "not-being," and a
					sense in which it cannot; and a sense in which the same thing can at
					once be and not be; but not in the same respect. For the same thing
					can "be" contraries at the same time potentially, but not
					actually.<milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					further, we shall request them to conceive another kind also of
					substance of existing things, in which there is absolutely no motion
					or destruction or generation. <milestone n="1009b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And (2.) similarly
					the theory that there is truth in appearances has come to some people
					from an observation of sensible things.<milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>They think that the truth should not be judged
					by the number or fewness of its upholders; and they say that the same
					thing seems sweet to some who taste it, and bitter to others; so that
					if all men were diseased or all insane, except two or three who were
					healthy or sane, the latter would seem to be diseased or insane, and
					not the others.<milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And further
					they say that many of the animals as well get from the same things
					impressions which are contrary to ours, and that the individual
					himself does not always think the same in matters of sense-perception.
					Thus it is uncertain which of these impressions are true or false; for
					one kind is no more true than another, but equally so. And hence
					Democritus says<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. Ritter and
						Preller, 204.</note> that either there is no truth or we cannot
					discover it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general it is because they suppose that
					thought is sense-perception, and sense-perception physical alteration,
					that they say that the impression given through sense-perception is
					necessarily true; for it is on these grounds that both Empedocles and
					Democritus and practically all the rest have become obsessed by such
					opinions as these.<milestone n="5.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					Empedocles says that those who change their bodily condition change
					their thought:<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For according to that

					the same way:<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For as each at any time

					recorded a saying of Anaxagoras to some of his disciples, that things
					would be for them as they judged them to be.<milestone n="5.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And they say that in Homer too clearly held
					this view, because he made
					Hector,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The

						Hector.</note> when he was stunned by the blow, lie
					with thoughts deranged&mdash;thus implying that even those who are
					"out of their minds" still think, although not the same thoughts.
					Clearly then, if both are kinds of thought, reality also will be "both
					so and not so."<milestone n="5.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is
					along this path that the consequences are most difficult; for if those
					who have the clearest vision of such truth as is possible (and these
					are they who seek and love it most) hold such opinions and make these
					pronouncements about the truth, surely those who are trying to be
					philosophers may well despair; for the pursuit of truth will be
					"chasing birds in the air."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.

					<milestone n="1010a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the reason why these men hold this
					view is that although they studied the truth about reality, they
					supposed that reality is confined to sensible things, in which the
					nature of the Indeterminate, i.e. of Being in the sense which we have
					explained,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1007b">Aristot. Met. 4.4.28</bibl>.</note> is abundantly
					present. (Thus their statements, though plausible, are not
					true;<milestone n="5.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>this form of
					the criticism is more suitable than that which Epicharmus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Fl. early 5th century; held
						views partly Pythagorean, partly Heraclitean.</note> applied to
					Xenophanes.) And further, observing that all this indeterminate
					substance is in motion, and that no true predication can be made of
					that which changes, they supposed that it is impossible to make any
					true statement about that which is in all ways and entirely
					changeable.<milestone n="5.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it
					was from this supposition that there blossomed forth the most extreme
					view of those which we have mentioned, that of the professed followers
					of Heraclitus, and such as Cratylus held, who ended by thinking that
					one need not say anything, and only moved his finger; and who
					criticized Heraclitus for saying that one cannot enter the same river
					twice,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Heraclit. Fr. 41">Heraclitus Fr. 41 (Bywater)</bibl>.</note> for he himself
					held that it cannot be done even once.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But we shall
					reply to this theory also that although that which is changeable
					supplies them, when it changes, with some real ground for supposing
					that it "is not," yet there is something debatable in this; for that
					which is shedding any quality retains something of that which is being
					shed, and something of that which is coming to be must already
					exist.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general if a thing is
					ceasing to be, there will be something there which <emph>is</emph> ;
					and if a thing is coming to be, that from which it comes and by which
					it is generated must <emph>be</emph> ; and this cannot go on to
					infinity. But let us leave this line of argument and remark that
					quantitative and qualitative change are not the same.<milestone n="5.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Let it be granted that there
					is nothing permanent in respect of quantity; but it is by the
					<emph>form</emph> that we recognize everything. And again those
					who hold the theory that we are attacking deserve censure in that they
					have maintained about the whole material universe what they have
					observed in the case of a mere minority of sensible things.<milestone n="5.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it is only the realm of
					sense around us which continues subject to destruction and generation,
					but this is a practically negligible part of the whole; so that it
					would have been fairer for them to acquit the former on the ground of
					the latter than to condemn the latter on account of the
					former.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, we shall
					obviously say to these thinkers too the same as we said some time
					ago<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot.       Met. 4.1009a">Aristot.
						Met. 4.5.7</bibl>.</note>; for we must prove to them and
					convince them that there is a kind of nature that is not
					moved<milestone n="5.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and yet those
					who claim that things can at once be and not be are logically
					compelled to admit rather that all things are at rest than that they
					are in motion; for there is nothing for them to change into, since
					everything exists in everything). <milestone n="1010b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And as concerning
					reality, that not every appearance is real, we shall say, first, that
					indeed the perception, at least of the proper object of a sense, is
					not false, but the impression we get of it is not the same as the
					perception.<milestone n="5.24" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And then
					we may fairly express surprise if our opponents raise the question
					whether magnitudes and colors are really such as they appear at a
					distance or close at hand, as they appear to the healthy or to the
					diseased; and whether heavy things are as they appear to the weak or
					to the strong; and whether truth is as it appears to the waking or to
					the sleeping.<milestone n="5.25" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For clearly
					they do not really believe the latter alternative&mdash;at any
					rate no one, if in the night he thinks that he is at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> whereas he is really in
					<placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, starts off to

					the opinion of the doctor and that of the layman are presumably not
					equally reliable, e.g. as to whether a man will get well or
					not.<milestone n="5.26" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again in
					the case of the senses themselves, our perception of a foreign object
					and of an object proper to a given sense, or of a kindred object and
					of an actual object of that sense itself, is not equally reliable<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">An object of taste is foreign
						to the sense of sight; a thing may look sweet without tasting
						sweet. Similarly although the senses of taste and smell (and
						therefore their objects) are kindred (<bibl n="Aristot. Sens. 440b.29">Aristot. De
							Sensu 440b 29</bibl>), in judging tastes the sense of
						taste is the more reliable.</note>; but in the case of colors
					sight, and not taste, is authoritative, and in the case of flavor
					taste, and not sight. But not one of the senses ever asserts at the
					same time of the same object that it is "so and not so."<milestone n="5.27" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor even at another
					time<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>does it make a
					conflicting statement about the quality, but only about that to which
					the quality belongs. I mean, e.g., that the same wine may seem, as the
					result of its own change or of that of one's body, at one time sweet
					and at another not; but sweetness, such as it is when it exists, has
					never yet changed, and there is no mistake about it, and that which is
					to be sweet is necessarily of such a nature.<milestone n="5.28" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet all these theories destroy the possibility
					of anything's existing by necessity, inasmuch as they destroy the
					existence of its essence; for "the necessary" cannot be in one way and
					in another; and so if anything exists of necessity, it cannot be "both
					so and not so."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And in general, if only
					the sensible exists, without animate things there would be nothing;
					for there would be no sense-faculty.<milestone n="5.29" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That there would be neither sensible qualities
					nor sensations is probably true<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. de An. 425b.25">Aristot. De Anima 425b 25-426b
						8</bibl>.</note>(for these depend upon an effect produced in the
					percipient), but that the substrates which cause the sensation should
					not exist even apart from the sensation is impossible.<milestone n="5.30" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For sensation is not of
					itself, but there is something else too besides the sensation, which
					must be prior to the sensation; <milestone n="1011a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because that which
					moves is by nature prior to that which is moved, and this is no less
					true if the terms are correlative.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there are
					some, both of those who really hold these convictions and of those who
					merely profess these views, who raise a difficulty; they inquire who
					is to judge of the healthy man, and in general who is to judge rightly
					in each particular case. But such questions are like wondering whether
					we are at any given moment asleep or awake;<milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and all problems of this kind amount to the
					same thing. These people demand a reason for everything. They want a
					starting-point, and want to grasp it by demonstration; while it is
					obvious from their actions that they have no conviction. But their
					case is just what we have stated before<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1006a">Aristot. Met. 4.4.2</bibl>.</note>;
					for they require a reason for things which have no reason, since the
					starting-point of a demonstration is not a matter of
					demonstration.<milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					first class, then, may be readily convinced of this, because it is not
					hard to grasp. But those who look only for cogency in argument look
					for an impossibility, for they claim the right to contradict
					themselves, and lose no time in doing so.<milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet if not everything is relative, but some
					things are self-existent, not every appearance will be true; for an
					appearance is an appearance to someone. And so he who says that
					all<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>appearances are
					true makes everything relative.<milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence those who demand something cogent in
					argument, and at the same time claim to make out a case, must guard
					themselves by saying that the appearance is true; not in itself, but
					<emph>for him to whom</emph> it appears, and at, the time when
					it appears, and in the <emph>way</emph> and <emph>manner in which it
						appears</emph>. And if they make out a case without this
					qualification, as a result they will soon contradict
					themselves;<milestone n="6.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is
					possible in the case of the same man for a thing to appear honey to
					the sight, but not to the taste, and for things to appear different to
					the sight of each of his two eyes, if their sight is unequal. For to
					those who assert (for the reasons previously stated<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1009a">Aristot. Met. 4.5.7-17.</bibl>
					</note>) that appearances are true, and that all things are therefore
					equally false and true, because they do not appear the same to all,
					nor always the same to the same person, but often have contrary
					appearances at the same time<milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(since if one crosses the fingers touch says that an object is two,
					while sight says that it is only one<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Pr. 958b.14">Aristot. Problemata 958b 14, 959a
						5, 965a 36</bibl>.</note>), we shall say "but not to the
					same sense or to the same part of it in the same way and at the same
					time"; so that with this qualification the appearance will be true.
					<milestone n="1011b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But perhaps it is for this reason that
					those who argue not from a sense of difficulty but for argument's sake
					are compelled to say that the appearance is not true in itself, but
					true to the percipient;<milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and, as we have said before, are compelled also to make everything
					relative and dependent upon opinion and sensation, so that nothing has
					happened or will happen unless someone has first formed an opinion
					about it; otherwise clearly all things would not be relative to
					opinion.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, if a thing is
					one, it is relative to one thing or to something determinate. And if
					the same thing is both a half and an equal, yet the equal is not
					relative to the double.<milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If
					to the thinking subject "man" and the object of thought are the same,
					"man" will be not the thinking subject but the object of thought; and
					if each thing is to be regarded as relative to the thinking subject,
					the thinking subject will be relative to an infinity of specifically
					different things.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That the most certain of all beliefs is
					that opposite statements are not both true at the same time, and what
					follows for those who maintain that they are true, and why these
					thinkers maintain this, may be regarded as adequately stated. And
					since the contradiction of a statement cannot be true at the same time
					of the same thing, it is obvious that contraries cannot apply at the
					same time to the same thing.<milestone n="6.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in each pair of contraries one is a
					privation no less than it is a contrary&mdash;a privation of
					substance. And privation is the negation of a predicate<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to some defined genus. Therefore
					if it is impossible at the same time to affirm and deny a thing truly,
					it is also impossible for contraries to apply to a thing at the same
					time; either both must apply in a modified sense, or one in a modified
					sense and the other absolutely.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor indeed can
					there be any intermediate between contrary statements, but of one
					thing we must either assert or deny one thing, whatever it may be.
					This will be plain if we first define truth and falsehood. To say that
					what is is not, or that what is not is, is false; but to say that what
					is is, and what is not is not, is true; and therefore also he who says
					that a thing is or is not will say either what is true or what is
					false.<milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But neither
					what is nor what is not is said not to be <emph>or</emph> to be.
					Further, an intermediate between contraries will be intermediate
					either as grey is between black and white, or as "neither man nor
					horse" is between man and horse. If in the latter sense, it cannot
					change (for change is from not-good to good, or from good to
					not-good);<milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in
					fact it is clearly always changing; for change can only be into the
					opposite and the intermediate. And if it is a true intermediate, in
					this case too there would be a kind of change into white not from
					not-white; but in fact this is not seen.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">It is not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> grey (i.e.

					<milestone n="1012a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Further, the understanding either affirms or denies
					every object of understanding or thought (as is clear from the
					definition<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1011b">Aristot. Met.
						4.7.1</bibl>.</note>)<milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>whenever it is right or wrong. When, in asserting or denying, it
					combines the predicates in one way, it is right; when in the other, it
					is wrong.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, unless it is maintained
					merely for argument's sake, the intermediate must exist beside all
					contrary terms; so that one will say what is neither true nor false.
					And it will exist beside what is and what is not; so that there will
					be a form of change beside generation and destruction.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, there will also be an intermediate in all classes in which
					the negation of a term implies the contrary assertion; e.g., among
					numbers there will be a number which is neither odd nor not-odd. But
					this is impossible, as is clear from the definition.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">What definition Aristotle had
						in mind we cannot tell; but it must have stated that every

					existing things will be not only half as many again, but even
					more.<milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For again it
					will be possible to deny the intermediate in reference both to its
					assertion and to its negation, and the result will be something<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">If besides A and not-A there is
						an intermediate B, besides B and not-B there will be an

					for its essence is something distinct.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, when a man is asked whether a thing is white and says "no,"
					he has denied nothing except that it is &lt;white&gt;, and its

					this view has occurred to certain people in just the same way as other

					then, hold the theory for this kind of reason, and others because they
					require an explanation for everything. In dealing with all such

					the same time. Nor can they all be false, although from what we have
					said, this might seem more possible.<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But in opposing all such theories we must
					demand, as was said in our discussion above,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1006a">Aristot. Met. 4.4.5</bibl>.</note>
					not that something should be or not be, but some significant
					statement; and so we must argue from a definition, having first
					grasped what "falsehood" or "truth" means. And if to assert what is
					true is nothing else than to deny what is false, everything cannot be
					false; for one part of the contradiction must be true.<milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, if everything must be
					either asserted or denied, both parts cannot be false; for one and
					only one part of the contradiction is false. Indeed, the consequence
					follows which is notorious in the case of all such theories, that they
					destroy themselves;<milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for he
					who says that everything is true makes the opposite theory true too,
					and therefore his own untrue (for the opposite theory says that his is
					not true); and he who says that everything is false makes himself a
					liar.<milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if they
					make exceptions, the one that the opposite theory alone is not true,
					and the other that his own theory alone is not false,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it follows none the less that they
					postulate an infinite number of true and false statements. For the
					statement that the true statement is true is also true; and this will
					go on to infinity.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor, as is obvious, are those right who
					say that all things are at rest; nor those who say that all things are
					in motion. For if all things are at rest, the same things will always
					be true and false, whereas this state of affairs is obviously subject
					to change; for the speaker himself once did not exist, and again he
					will not exist. And if all things are in motion, nothing will be true,
					so everything will be false; but this has been proved to be
					impossible.<milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, it
					must be that which <emph>is</emph> that changes, for change is from
					something into something. And further, neither is it true that all
					things are at rest or in motion sometimes, but nothing continuously;
					for there is something <note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						sphere of the fixed stars; cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1071b">Aristot. Met. 12.6</bibl>,

					thing may best come into being; e.g., a course of study should
					sometimes be begun not from what is primary or from the starting-point
					of the subject, but from the point from which it is easiest to learn.
					(c) That thing as a result of whose presence something first comes
					into being; e.g., as the keel is the beginning of a ship, and the
					foundation that of a house, and as in the case of animals some
					thinkers suppose the heart<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This
						was Aristotle's own view,<bibl n="Aristot. GA 738b.16">Aristot. De Gen. An. 738b

					similar, whatever it may be. (d) That from which, although not present
					in it, a thing first comes into being, and that from which motion and
					change naturally first begin, as the child comes from the father and
					mother, and fighting from abuse. (e) That in accordance with whose
					deliberate choice that which is moved is moved, and that which is
					changed is changed; such as magistracies, authorities, monarchies and
					despotisms.<milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(f) Arts
					are also called "beginnings,"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">As
						directing principles.</note> especially the architectonic arts.
					(g) Again, "beginning" means the point from which a thing is first
					comprehensible, this too is called the "beginning" of the thing; e.g.
					the hypotheses of demonstrations. ("Cause" can have a similar number
					of different senses, for all causes are "beginnings.")<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is a common property, then, of all "beginnings" to be the first
					thing from which something either exists or comes into being or
					becomes known; and some beginnings are originally inherent in things,
					while others are not.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence
					"nature" is a beginning, and so is "element" and "understanding" and
					"choice" and "essence" and "final cause"&mdash;for in many cases
					the Good and the Beautiful are the beginning both of knowledge and of
					motion.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Cause" means: (a) in one sense, that as the
					result of whose presence something comes into being&mdash;e.g. the
					bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup, and the classes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. of
						material&mdash;metal, wood, etc.</note> which contain these;
					(b) in another sense, the <emph>form</emph> or pattern; that is, the
					essential formula and the classes which contain it&mdash;e.g. the
					ratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the
					octave&mdash;and the parts of the formula.<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) The source of the first beginning
					of change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father
					is the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the
					cause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which
					is changed. (d) The same as "end"; i.e. the final cause; e.g., as the
					"end" of walking is health.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For why does a man walk? "To be healthy," we say, and by saying this
					we consider that we have supplied the cause. (e) All those means
					towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else, as,
					e.g. fat-reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of
					health; <milestone n="1013b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for they all have the <emph>end</emph>
					as their object, although they differ from each other as being some
					instruments, others actions.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These are roughly all the
					meanings of "cause," but since causes are spoken of with various
					meanings, it follows that there are several causes (and that not in an
					accidental sense) of the same thing. E.g., both <emph>statuary</emph>
					and <emph>bronze</emph> are causes of the statue; not in different
					connections, but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> statue. However, they are
					not causes in the same way, but the one as <emph>material</emph> and
					the other as the <emph>source of motion</emph>. And things are causes
					of each other; as e.g. labor of vigor, and vigor of
					labor&mdash;but not in the same way; the one as an
					<emph>end</emph> , and the other as <emph>source</emph> of
					<emph>motion</emph> .<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And again the same thing is sometimes the cause of contrary results;
					because that which by its presence is the cause of so-and-so we
					sometimes accuse of being, by its absence, the cause of the
					contrary&mdash;as, e.g., we say that the absence of the pilot is
					the cause of a capsize, whereas his presence was the cause of
					safety.<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And both,
					presence and privation, are <emph>moving</emph> causes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now there are four senses which are most
					obvious under which all the causes just described may be
					classed.<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					components of syllables; the material of manufactured articles; fire,
					earth and all such bodies; the parts of a whole;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the premisses of a syllogistic
					conclusion; are causes in the <emph>material</emph> sense. Of these
					some are causes as substrate: e.g. the parts; and others as
					<emph>essence</emph> : the whole, and the composition, and the
					form.<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The seed and
					the physician and the contriver and in general that which produces,
					all these are the source of change or stationariness. The remainder
					represent the <emph>end</emph> and <emph>good</emph> of the others;
					for the final cause tends to be the greatest good and <emph>end</emph>
					of the rest.<milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Let it be
					assumed that it makes no difference whether we call it "good" or
					"apparent good." In <emph>kind</emph> , then, there are these four
					classes of cause.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The <emph>modes</emph>
					of cause are numerically many, although these too are fewer when
					summarized.<milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					causes are spoken of in many senses, and even of those which are of
					the same kind, some are causes in a prior and some in a posterior
					sense; e.g., the physician and the expert are both causes of health;
					and the ratio 2:1 and number are both causes of the octave; and the
					universals which include a given cause are causes of its particular
					effects.<milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, a
					thing may be a cause in the sense of an accident, and the classes
					which contain accidents; e.g., the cause of a statue is in one sense
					Polyclitus and in another a sculptor, because it is an accident of the
					sculptor to be Polyclitus. <milestone n="1014a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And the universal
					terms which include accidents are causes; e.g., the cause of a statue
					is a man, or even, generally, an animal; because Polyclitus is a man,
					and man is an animal.<milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					even of accidental causes some are remoter or more proximate than
					others; e.g., the cause of the statue might be said to be "white man"
					or "cultured man," and not merely "Polyclitus" or "man."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And besides the distinction of causes as
					<emph>proper</emph> and <emph>accidental</emph> , some are
					termed causes in a <emph>potential</emph> and others in an
					<emph>actual</emph> sense; e.g., the cause of building is either
					the builder or the builder who builds.<milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the same distinctions in meaning as we
					have already described will apply to the <emph>effects</emph> of the
					causes; e.g. to <emph>this</emph> statue, or <emph>a</emph> statue, or
					generally an image; and to <emph>this</emph> bronze, or bronze, or
					generally material.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Effects,
						just like causes (10), may be particular or general. The
						metal-worker produces (a) the bronze for a particular statue by
						the sculptor, (b) bronze for a statue, (c) metal for an
						image.</note> And it is the same with accidental effects. Again, the
					proper and accidental senses will be combined; e.g., the cause is
					neither "Polyclitus" nor "a sculptor" but "the sculptor
					Polyclitus."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>However, these classes of cause are in
					all six in number, each used in two senses. Causes are (1.)
					particular, (2.) generic, (3.) accidental, (4.) generically
					accidental; and these may be either stated singly or (5, 6) in
					combination<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The cause of a
						statue may be said to be (1) a sculptor, (2) an artist, (3)
						Polyclitus, (4) a man, (5) the sculptor Polyclitus (combination
						of (1) and (3)), (6) an artistic man (combination of (2) and
						(4)).</note>;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					further they are all either actual or potential.<milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there is this difference between
					them, that actual and particular causes coexist or do not coexist with
					their effects (e.g. <emph>this</emph> man giving medical treatment
					with <emph>this</emph> man recovering his health, and
					<emph>this</emph> builder with <emph>this</emph> building in course of
					erection); but potential causes do not always do so; for the house and
					the builder do not perish together.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Element" means
					(a) the primary immanent thing, formally indivisible into another
					form, of which something is composed. E.g., the elements of a sound
					are the parts of which that sound is composed and into which it is
					ultimately divisible, and which are not further divisible into other
					sounds formally different from themselves. If an element be divided,
					the parts are formally the same as the whole: e.g., a part of water is
					water; but it is not so with the syllable.<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) Those who speak of the elements of
					<emph>bodies</emph> similarly mean the parts into which bodies
					are ultimately divisible, and which are not further divisible into
					other parts different in form. And whether they speak of one such
					element or of more than one, this is what they mean.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) The term is applied with a very
					similar meaning to the "elements" of geometrical figures, and
					generally to the "elements" of demonstrations; for the primary
					demonstrations which are contained in a number of other demonstrations
					<milestone n="1014b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>are called "elements" of
					demonstrations.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.998a">Aristot. Met. 3.3.1</bibl>.</note> Such are the
					primary syllogisms consisting of three terms and with one middle
					term.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) The term
					"element" is also applied metaphorically to any small unity which is
					useful for various purposes; and so that which is small or simple or
					indivisible is called an "element."<milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(e) Hence it comes that the most universal
					things are elements; because each of them, being a simple unity, is
					present in many things&mdash;either in all or in as many as
					possible. Some too think that unity and the point are first
					principles.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(f)
					Therefore since what are called genera<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This must refer to the highest genera, which have
						no definition because they cannot be analyzed into genus and
						differentia (
						Ross).</note> are universal and indivisible (because they
					have no formula), some people call the genera elements, and these
					rather than the differentia, because the genus is more universal. For
					where the differentia is present, the genus also follows; but the
					differentia is not always present where the genus is. And it is common
					to all cases that the element of each thing is that which is primarily
					inherent in each thing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Nature"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">On the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> cf. Burnet, E.G.P. pp. 10-12, 363-364.</note>
					means: (a) in one sense, the genesis of growing things&mdash;as
					would be suggested by pronouncing the <foreign lang="greek">u</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign>
					long&mdash;and (b) in another, that immanent thing<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Probably the seed
						(Bonitz).</note> from which a growing thing first begins to grow. (c)
					The source from which the primary motion in every natural object is
					induced in that object as such.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>All things are said to grow which gain increase
					through something else by contact and organic unity (or adhesion, as
					in the case of embryos).<milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Organic unity differs from contact; for in the latter case there
					need be nothing except contact, but in both the things which form an
					organic unity there is some one and the same thing which produces,
					instead of mere contact, a unity which is organic, continuous and
					quantitative (but not qualitative).<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, "nature" means (d) the primary stuff,
					shapeless and unchangeable from its own potency, of which any natural
					object consists or from which it is produced; e.g., bronze is called
					the "nature" of a statue and of bronze articles, and wood that of
					wooden ones, and similarly in all other cases.<milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For each article consists of these
					"natures," the primary material persisting. It is in this sense that
					men call the elements of natural objects the "nature," some calling it
					fire, others earth or air or water, others something else similar,
					others some of these, and others all of them.<milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again in another sense "nature" means (e) the
					substance of natural objects; as in the case of those who say that the
					"nature" is the primary composition of a thing, or as Empedocles says:
					<milestone n="1015a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Of nothing that exists is there nature,
					but only mixture and separation of what has been mixed; nature is but
					a name given to these by men.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Emp. Fr. 8">Empedocles Fr. 8
						(Diels)</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence as regards those things
					which exist or are produced by nature, although that from which they
					naturally are produced or exist is already present, we say that they
					have not their nature yet unless they have their form and
					shape.<milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That which
					comprises both of these exists by nature; e.g. animals and their
					parts. And nature is both the primary matter (and this in two senses:
					either primary in relation to the thing, or primary in general; e.g.,
					in bronze articles the primary matter in relation to those articles is
					bronze, but in general it is perhaps water&mdash;that is if all
					things which can be melted are water) and the form or essence, i.e.
					the end of the process, of generation. Indeed from this sense of
					"nature," by an extension of meaning, every essence in general is
					called "nature," because the nature of anything is a kind of
					essence.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>From what has been said, then, the primary and
					proper sense of "nature" is the essence of those things which contain
					in themselves as such a source of motion; for the matter is called
					"nature" because it is capable of receiving the nature, and the
					processes of generation and growth are called "nature" because they
					are motions derived from it. And nature in this sense is the source of
					motion in natural objects, which is somehow inherent in them, either
					potentially or actually.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Necessary" means: (a) That without which, as
					a concomitant condition, life is impossible; e.g. respiration and food
					are necessary for an animal, because it cannot exist without them. (b)
					The conditions without which good cannot be or come to be, or without
					which one cannot get rid or keep free of evil&mdash;e.g., drinking
					medicine is necessary to escape from ill-health, and sailing to
					<placeName key="perseus,Aegina City">Aegina</placeName> is necessary to
					recover one's money.<milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c)
					The compulsory and compulsion; i.e. that which hinders and prevents,
					in opposition to impulse and purpose. For the compulsory is called
					necessary, and hence the necessary is disagreeable; as indeed
					Evenus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Of Poros; sophist
						and poet, contemporary with
						Socrates.</note> says: "For every necessary
					thing is by nature grievous."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Even. Fr. 8">Evenus Fr. 8
						(Hiller)</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And compulsion is a kind of
					necessity, as Sophocles says: "Compulsion makes me do this of
					necessity."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Soph. El. 256">Soph. El. 256</bibl> (the quotation is slightly
						inaccurate).</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And necessity
					is held, rightly, to be something inexorable; for it is opposed to
					motion which is in accordance with purpose and calculation. (d) Again,
					what cannot be otherwise we say is necessarily so.<milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is from this sense of "necessary"
					that all others are somehow derived; for the term "compulsory" is used
					of something which it is necessary for one to do or suffer <milestone n="1015b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>only when it is impossible to act according to
					impulse, because of the compulsion: which shows that necessity is that
					because of which a thing cannot be otherwise; and the same is true of
					the concomitant conditions of living and of the good. For when in the
					one case good, and in the other life or existence, is impossible
					without certain conditions, these conditions are necessary, and the
					cause is a kind of necessity.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(e) Again, demonstration is a
					"necessary" thing, because a thing cannot be otherwise if the
					demonstration has been absolute. And this is the result of the first
					premisses, when it is impossible for the assumptions upon which the
					syllogism depends to be otherwise.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus
					of necessary things, some have an external cause of their necessity,
					and others have not, but it is through them that other things are of
					necessity what they are.<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the "necessary" in the primary and proper sense is the
					<emph>simple</emph> , for it cannot be in more than one
					condition. Hence it cannot be in one state and in another; for if so
					it would ipso facto be in more than one condition. Therefore if there
					are certain things which are eternal and immutable, there is nothing
					in them which is compulsory or which violates their nature.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term "one" is used (1.) in an accidental, (2.) in an absolute
					sense. (1.) In the accidental sense it is used as in the case of
					"Coriscus"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Coriscus of
						Scepsis was a Platonist with whom Aristotle was probably
						acquainted; but the name is of course chosen quite
						arbitrarily.</note> and "cultured" and "cultured Coriscus" (for
					"Coriscus" and "cultured" and "cultured Coriscus" mean the
					same);<milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and "cultured"
					and "upright"<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and "cultured
					upright Coriscus." For all these terms refer accidentally to one
					thing; "upright" and "cultured" because they are accidental to one
					substance, and "cultured" and "Coriscus" because the one is accidental
					to the other.<milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And similarly
					in one sense "cultured Coriscus" is one with "Coriscus," because one
					part of the expression is accidental to the other, e.g. "cultured" to
					"Coriscus"; and "cultured Coriscus" is one with "upright Coriscus,"
					because<milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>one part of
					each expression is one accident of one and the same thing. It is the
					same even if the accident is applied to a genus or a general term;
					e.g., "man" and "cultured man" are the same, either because "cultured"
					is an accident of "man," which is one substance, or because both are
					accidents of some individual, e.g. Coriscus.<milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But they do not both belong to it in the same
					way; the one belongs presumably as <emph>genus</emph> in the
					substance, and the other as <emph>condition</emph> or
					<emph>affection</emph> of the substance. Thus all things which are
					said to be "one" in an accidental sense are said to be so in this
					way.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) Of those things which are said to be in
					themselves one, (a) some are said to be so in virtue of their
					continuity; e.g., a faggot is made continuous by its string, and
					pieces of wood by glue; <milestone n="1016a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and a continuous
					line, even if it is bent, is said to be one, just like each of the
					limbs; e.g. the leg or arm. And of these things themselves those which
					are naturally continuous are one in a truer sense than those which are
					artificially continuous.<milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Continuous" means that whose motion is essentially one, and cannot
					be otherwise; and motion is one when it is indivisible, i.e.
					indivisible in <emph>time</emph> . Things are essentially continuous
					which are one not by contact only; for if you put pieces of wood
					touching one another you will not say that they are <emph>one</emph>
					piece of wood, or body, or any other continuous thing.<milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And things which are completely
					continuous are said to be "one" even if they contain a joint, and
					still more those things which contain no joint; e.g., the shin or the
					thigh is more truly one than the leg, because the motion of the leg
					may not be one.<milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the
					straight line is more truly one than the bent. We call the line which
					is bent and contains an angle both one and not one, because it may or
					may not move all at once; but the straight line always moves all at
					once, and no part of it which has magnitude is at rest while another
					moves, as in the bent line.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>(b) Another
					sense of "one" is that the substrate is uniform in kind.<milestone n="6.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are uniform whose form
					is indistinguishable to sensation;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the substrate is either that which is primary,
					or that which is final in relation to the end. For wine is said to be
					one, and water one, as being something formally indistinguishable. And
					all liquids are said to be one (e.g. oil and wine), and melted things;
					because the ultimate substrate of all of them is the same, for all
					these things are water or vapor.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) Things are
					said to be "one" whose genus is one and differs in its opposite
					differentiae. All these things too are said to be "one" because the
					genus, which is the substrate of the differentiae, is one (e.g.,
					"horse," "man" and "dog" are in a sense one, because they are all
					animals); and that in a way very similar to that in which the matter
					is one.<milestone n="6.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Sometimes these
					things are said to be "one" in this sense, and sometimes their higher
					genus is said to be one and the same (if they are final species of
					their genus)&mdash;the genus, that is, which is above the genera
					of which their proximate genus is one; e.g., the isosceles and
					equilateral triangles are one and the same figure (because they are
					both triangles), but not the same triangles.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d)
					Again, things are said to be "one" when the definition stating the
					essence of one is indistinguishable from a definition explaining the
					other; for in itself every definition is distinguishable &lt;into
					genus and differentiae&gt;. In this way that which increases and
					decreases is one, because its definition is one; just as in the case
					of planes the definition of the form is one. <milestone n="1016b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="6.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general
					those things whose concept, which conceives the essence, is
					indistinguishable and cannot be separated either in time or in place
					or in definition, are in the truest sense one; and of these such as
					are substances are most truly one. For universally such things as do
					not admit of distinction are called "one" in so far as they do not
					admit of it; e.g., if "man" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> "man" does not
					admit of distinction, he is one man; and similarly if <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> animal, he is one animal; and if <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> magnitude, he is one magnitude.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Most things, then, are said to be "one" because they produce, or
					possess, or are affected by, or are related to, some other one thing;
					but some are called "one" in a primary sense, and one of these is
					substance. It is one either in continuity or in form or in definition;
					for we reckon as more than one things which are not continuous, or
					whose form is not one, or whose definition is not one.<milestone n="6.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, in one sense we call
					anything whatever "one" if it is quantitative and continuous; and in
					another sense we say that it is not "one" unless it is a
					<emph>whole</emph> of some kind, i.e. unless it is one in form (e.g.,
					if we saw the parts of a shoe put together anyhow, we should not say
					that they were one &mdash; except in virtue of their continuity;
					but only if they were so put together as to be a shoe, and to possess
					already some one form).<milestone n="6.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the circumference of a circle is of all lines the most truly
					one, because it is whole and complete.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The essence of "one" is to be a kind of starting point of number;
					for the first measure is a starting point, because that by which first
					we gain knowledge of a thing is the first measure of each class of
					objects.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>"The one,"
					then, is the starting-point of what is knowable in respect of each
					particular thing. But the unit is not the same in all
					classes,<milestone n="6.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for in one
					it is the quarter-tone, and in another the vowel or consonant; gravity
					has another unit, and motion another. But in all cases the unit is
					indivisible, either quantitatively or formally.<milestone n="6.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus that which is quantitatively and
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> quantitative wholly indivisible and
					has no position is called a unit; and that which is wholly indivisible
					and has position, a point; that which is divisible in one sense, a
					line; in two senses, a plane; and that which is quantitatively
					divisible in all three senses, a body.<milestone n="6.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And reversely that which is divisible in two
					senses is a plane, and in one sense a line; and that which is in no
					sense quantitatively divisible is a point or a unit; if it has no
					position, a unit, and if it has position, a point.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again,
					some things are one numerically, others formally, others generically,
					and others analogically; numerically, those whose matter is one;
					formally, those whose definition is one; generically, those which
					belong to the same category; and analogically, those which have the
					same relation as something else to some third object.<milestone n="6.22" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In every case the latter types
					of unity are implied in the former: e.g., all things which are one
					numerically are also one formally, but not all which are one formally
					are one numerically; <milestone n="1017a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and all are one generically which
					are one formally, but such as are one generically are not all one
					formally, although they are one analogically; and such as are one
					analogically are not all one generically.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is obvious
					also that "many" will have the opposite meanings to "one." Some things
					are called "many" because they are not continuous; others because
					their matter (either primary or ultimate) is formally divisible;
					others because the definitions of their essence are more than
					one.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Being" means (1.) accidental being, (2.)
					absolute being. (1.) E.g., we say that the upright person "is"
					cultured, and that the man "is" cultured, and that the cultured person
					"is" a man; very much as we say that the cultured person builds,
					because the builder happens to be cultured, or the cultured person a
					builder; for in this sense "X is Y" means that Y is an accident of
					X.<milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And so it is with
					the examples cited above; for when we say that "the man is cultured"
					and "the cultured person is a man" or "the white is cultured" or "the
					cultured is white," in the last two cases it is because both
					predicates are accidental to the same subject, and in the first case
					because the predicate is accidental to what <emph>is</emph> ; and we
					say that "the cultured is a man" because "the cultured" is accidental
					to a man.<milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(Similarly
					"not-white" is said to "be," because the subject of which "not-white"
					is an accident, <emph>is</emph> .)<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>These, then, are the senses in which things are
					said to "be" accidentally: either because both predicates belong to
					the same subject, which <emph>is</emph> ; or because the predicate
					belongs to the subject, which <emph>is</emph> ; or because the subject
					to which belongs that of which it is itself predicated itself
					<emph>is</emph> .<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) The senses of essential being are
					those which are indicated by the figures of predication<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The categories. For the full
						list of these see <bibl n="Aristot. Cat. 1b.25">Aristot. Categories 1b
							25-27</bibl>.</note>; for "being" has as many senses as there
					are ways of predication. Now since some predicates indicate (a) what a
					thing is, and others its (b) quality, (c) quantity, (d) relation, (e)
					activity or passivity, (f) place, (g) time, to each of these
					corresponds a sense of "being."<milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is no difference between "the man is
					recovering" and "the man recovers"; or between "the man is walking" or
					"cutting" and "the man walks" or "cuts"; and similarly in the other
					cases.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>(3.) Again, "to be" and
					"is" mean that a thing is true, and "not to be" that it is
					false.<milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly too
					in affirmation and negation; e.g., in "
					Socrates is cultured" "is" means that this is true;
					or in "Socrates is not-white"
					that this is true; but in "the diagonal is not commensurable"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        1.983a">Aristot. Met.
						1.2.15</bibl>.</note>"is not" means that the statement is
					false. <milestone n="1017b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(4.) Again, "to be" &lt;or
					"is"&gt; means that some of these statements can be made in virtue
					of a potentiality and others in virtue of an actuality.<milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For we say that both that which
					sees potentially and that which sees actually <emph>is</emph> "a
					seeing thing." And in the same way we call "understanding" both that
					which <emph>can</emph> use the understanding, and that which
					<emph>does</emph> ; and we call "tranquil" both that in which
					tranquillity is already present, and that which is potentially
					tranquil.<milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly
					too in the case of substances. For we say that Hermes is in the
					stone,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.1002a">Aristot. Met. 3.5.6</bibl>.</note>
					and the half of the line in the whole; and we call "corn" what is not
					yet ripe. But when a thing is potentially existent and when not, must
					be defined elsewhere.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 9.1051a">Aristot. Met.
						9.9</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Substance" means (a) simple
					bodies, e.g. earth, fire, water and the like; and in general bodies,
					and the things, animal or divine, including their parts, which are
					composed of bodies. All these are called substances because they are
					not predicated of any substrate, but other things are predicated of
					them.<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) In another
					sense, whatever, being immanent in such things as are not predicated
					of a substrate, is the cause of their being; as, e.g., the soul is the
					cause of being for the animal.<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) All parts immanent in things which define
					and indicate their individuality, and whose destruction causes the
					destruction of the whole; as, e.g., the plane is essential to the body
					(as some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans and
						Platonists.</note> hold) and the line to the plane.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And number in general is thought
					by some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans and
						Platonists.</note> to be of this nature, on the ground that if
					it is abolished nothing exists, and that it determines
					everything.<milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d)
					Again, the <emph>essence</emph> , whose formula is the definition, is
					also called the substance of each particular thing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus it follows that "substance" has two senses:
					the ultimate subject, which cannot be further predicated of something
					else; and whatever has an individual and separate existence. The shape
					and form of each particular thing is of this nature.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"The
					same" means (a) accidentally the same. E.g., "white" and "cultured"
					are the same because they are accidents of the same subject; and "man"
					is the same as "cultured," because one is an accident of the other;
					and "cultured" is the same as "man" because it is an accident of
					"man"; and "cultured man" is the same as each of the terms "cultured"
					and "man," and vice versa; for both "man" and "cultured" are used in
					the same way as "cultured man," and the latter in the same way as the
					former.<milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence none of
					these predications can be made universally. For it is not true to say
					that every man is the same as "the cultured"; because universal
					predications are essential to things, <milestone n="1018a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but
					accidental predications are not so, but are made of individuals and
					with a single application. "
					Socrates" and "cultured
					Socrates" seem to be the same; but "
					Socrates" is not a class-name, and
					hence we do not say "every
					Socrates" as we say "every man."<milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some things are said to be "the same" in this
					sense, but (b) others in an essential sense, in the same number of
					senses as "the one" is essentially one; for things whose matter is
					formally or numerically one, and things whose substance is one, are
					said to be the same. Thus "sameness" is clearly a kind of unity in the
					being, either of two or more things, or of one thing treated as more
					than one; as, e.g., when a thing is consistent with itself; for it is
					then treated as two.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are called "other" of which
					either the forms or the matter or the definition of essence is more
					than one; and in general "other" is used in the opposite senses to
					"same."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Things are called
					"different" which, while being in a sense the same, are "other" not
					only numerically, but formally or generically or analogically; also
					things whose genus is not the same; and contraries; and all things
					which contain "otherness" in their essence.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things
					are called "like" which have the same attributes in all respects; or
					more of those attributes the same than different; or whose quality is
					one. Also that which has a majority or the more important of those
					attributes of something else in respect of which change is possible
					(i.e. the contraries) is like that thing. And "unlike" is used in the
					opposite senses to "like."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term "opposite" is applied to (a)
					contradiction; (b) contraries; (c) relative terms; (d) privation; (e)
					state; (f) extremes; e.g. in the process of generation and
					destruction. And (g) all things which cannot be present at the same
					time in that which admits of them both are called opposites; either
					themselves or their constituents. "Grey" and "white" do not apply at
					the same time to the same thing, and hence their constituents are
					opposite.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Contrary" means: (a) attributes,
					generically different, which cannot apply at the same time to the same
					thing. (b) The most different attributes in the same genus; or (c) in
					the same subject; or (d) falling under the same faculty. (e) Things
					whose difference is greatest absolutely, or in genus, or in
					species.<milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Other
					things are called "contrary" either because they possess attributes of
					this kind, or because they are receptive of them, or because they are
					productive of or liable to them, or actually produce or incur them, or
					are rejections or acquisitions or possessions or privations of such
					attributes.<milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					since "one" and "being" have various meanings, all other terms which
					are used in relation to "one" and "being" must vary in meaning with
					them; and so "same," "other" and "contrary" must so vary, and so must
					have a separate meaning in accordance with each category.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Things are called "other in species" (a)
					which belong to the same genus and are not subordinate one to the
					other; <milestone n="1018b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or (b) which are in the same genus and
					contain a differentia; or (c) which contain a contrariety in their
					essence.<milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d)
					Contraries, too (either all of them or those which are called so in a
					primary sense), are "other in species" than one another; and (e) so
					are all things of which the formulae are different in the final
					species of the genus (e.g., "man" and "horse" are generically
					indivisible, but their formulae are different); and (f) attributes of
					the same substance which contain a difference. "The same in species"
					has the opposite meanings to these.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Prior" and
					"posterior" mean: (1.) (a) In one sense (assuming that there is in
					each genus some primary thing or starting-point) that which is nearer
					to some starting-point, determined either absolutely and naturally, or
					relatively, or locally, or by some agency; e.g., things are prior in
					space because they are nearer either to some place naturally
					determined, such as the middle or the extreme, or to some chance
					relation; and that which is further is posterior.<milestone n="11.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) In another sense, prior or
					posterior in <emph>time</emph> . Some things are prior as being
					further from the present, as in the case of past events (for the
					Trojan is prior to the Persian war, because it is further distant from
					the present); and others as being nearer the present, as in the case
					of future events (for the Nemean are prior to the Pythian games
					because they are nearer to the present, regarded as a starting-point
					and as primary).<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="11.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) In another sense, in
					respect of motion (for that which is nearer to the prime mover is
					prior; e.g., the boy is prior to the man). This too is a kind of
					starting point in an absolute sense. (d) In respect of potency; for
					that which is superior in potency, or more potent, is prior. Such is
					that in accordance with whose will the other, or posterior, thing must
					follow, so that according as the former moves or does not move, the
					latter is or is not moved. And the <emph>will</emph> is a
					"starting-point."<milestone n="11.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(e) In respect of order; such are all things which are
					systematically arranged in relation to some one determinate object.
					E.g., he who is next to the leader of the chorus is prior to him who

					prior in <emph>formula</emph> are different from the prior in
					<emph>perception</emph> . Universals are prior in formula, but
					particulars in perception. And in formula the attribute is prior to
					the concrete whole: e.g. "cultured" to "the cultured man"; for the
					formula will not be a whole without the part.<milestone n="11.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet "cultured" cannot exist apart from
					some cultured person.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, (3.)
					attributes of prior subjects are called prior; e.g., straightness is
					prior to smoothness, <milestone n="1019a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because the former is an
					attribute of the line in itself, and the latter of a
					surface.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some things, then, are called prior and
					posterior in this sense; but others (iv.) in virtue of their nature

					things, whereas other things cannot exist without them. This
					distinction was used by Plato.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Not, apparently, in his writings.</note>(And since "being" has
					various meanings, (a) the substrate, and therefore substance, is
					prior; (b) potential priority is different from actual
					priority.<milestone n="11.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some
					things are prior potentially, and some actually; e.g., potentially the
					half-line is prior to the whole, or the part to the whole, or the
					matter to the substance; but actually it is posterior, because it is
					only upon dissolution that it will actually exist.)<milestone n="11.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed, in a sense all things which are
					called "prior" or "posterior" are so called in this connection; for
					some things can exist apart from others in generation (e.g. the whole
					without the parts), and others in destruction (e.g. the parts without

						or "potentiality."</note> means: (a) the source of motion or
					change which is in something other than the thing changed, or in it
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other. E.g., the science of building
					is a potency which is not present in the thing built; but the science
					of medicine, which is a potency, may be present in the patient,
					although not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> patient.<milestone n="12.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus "potency" means the source in
					general of change or motion in another thing, or in the same thing <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or the source of a thing's being moved or changed
					by another thing, or by itself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other (for
					in virtue of that principle by which the passive thing is affected in
					any way we call it capable of being affected; sometimes if it is
					affected at all, and sometimes not in respect of every affection, but
					only if it is changed for the better).<milestone n="12.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) The power of performing this well or
					according to intention; because sometimes we say that those who can
					merely take a walk, or speak, without doing it as well as they
					intended, cannot speak or walk. And similarly in the case of
					passivity.<milestone n="12.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) All
					states in virtue of which things are unaffected generally, or are
					unchangeable, or cannot readily deteriorate, are called "potencies."
					For things are broken and worn out and bent and in general destroyed
					not through potency but through impotence and deficiency of some sort;
					and things are unaffected by such processes which are scarcely or
					slightly affected because they have a potency and are potent and are
					in a definite state.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since "potency" has all these meanings,
					"potent" (or "capable") will mean (a) that which contains a source of
					motion or change (for even what is static is "potent" in a sense)
					which takes place in another thing, or in itself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other. <milestone n="1019b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(b) That over which something else has
					a potency of this kind. (c) That which has the potency of changing
					things, either for the worse or for the better (for it seems that even
					that which perishes is "capable" of perishing; otherwise, if it had
					been incapable, it would not have perished. As it is, it has a kind of
					disposition or cause or principle which induces such an
					affection.<milestone n="12.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Sometimes
					it seems to be such as it is because it <emph>has</emph> something,
					and sometimes because it is <emph>deprived</emph> of something; but if
					privation is in a sense a state or "habit," everything will be
					"potent" through <emph>having</emph> something; and so a thing is
					"potent" in virtue of having a certain "habit" or principle, and also
					in virtue of having the privation of that "habit," if it can
					<emph>have</emph> privation; and if privation is not in a sense
					"habit," the term "potent" is equivocal).<milestone n="12.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) A thing is "potent" if neither any other
					thing nor itself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other contains a potency
					or principle destructive of it. (e) All these things are "potent"
					either because they merely might chance to happen or not to happen, or
					because they might do so <emph>well</emph> . Even in inanimate things
					this kind of potency is found; e.g. in instruments; for they say that
					one lyre "can" be played, and another not at all, if it has not a good
					tone.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Impotence" is a privation of
					potency&mdash;a kind of abolition of the principle which has been
					described&mdash;either in general or in something which would
					naturally possess that principle, or even at a time when it would
					naturally already possess it (for we should not use
					"impotence"&mdash;in respect of begetting&mdash;in the same
					sense of a boy, a man and a eunuch).<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Again, there is an "impotence" corresponding to
					each kind of potency; both to the kinetic and to the successfully
					kinetic.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some things are said to be "impotent"
					in accordance with this meaning of "impotence," but others in a
					different sense, namely "possible" and "impossible." "Impossible"
					means: (a) that whose contrary is necessarily true; e.g., it is
					impossible that the diagonal of a square should be commensurable with
					the sides, because such a thing is a lie, whose contrary is not only
					true but inevitable. Hence that it is commensurable is not only a lie
					but necessarily a lie.<milestone n="12.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the contrary of the impossible, i.e. the possible, is when the
					contrary is not necessarily a lie; e.g., it is possible that a man
					should be seated, for it is not necessarily a lie that he should not
					be seated. "Possible," then, means in one sense, as we have said, that
					which is not necessarily a lie; in another, that which is true; and in
					another, that which may be true.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(The "power" in
					geometry<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">A square was

					not correspond to "potency." Those which do correspond to it all refer
					to the first meaning, <milestone n="1020a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>i.e. "a source of change which
					exists in something other than that in which the change takes place,
					or in the same thing <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other."<milestone n="12.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Other things are said to be
					"potent"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. in a

						"potent" cannot bear.</note> because something else has such
					a<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>potency over them; others
					because it does not possess it; others because it possesses it in a
					particular way. The term "impotent" is similarly used. Thus the
					authoritative definition of "potency" in the primary sense will be "a
					principle producing change, which is in something other than that in
					which the change takes place, or in the same thing <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Quantity" means that which is
					divisible into constituent parts, each<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., if there are only two.</note> or every one
					of which is by nature some one individual thing. Thus plurality, if it
					is numerically calculable, is a kind of quantity; and so is magnitude,
					if it is measurable. "Plurality" means that which is potentially
					divisible into non-continuous parts; and "magnitude" that which is
					potentially divisible into continuous parts. Of kinds of magnitude,
					that which is continuous in one direction is length; in two
					directions, breadth; in three, depth.<milestone n="13.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of these, plurality, when limited, is a
					number; length, a line; breadth, a plane; depth, a body. Again, some
					things are essentially quantitative, but others only accidentally;
					e.g. the line is essentially, but "cultured" accidentally
					quantitative.<milestone n="13.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of
					the former class some are quantitative in virtue of their substance,
					e.g. the fine (because the definition which describes it is
					quantitative in some form);<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and others are attributes and conditions of a substance of this
					kind&mdash; e.g., "much" and "little," "long" and "short," "broad"
					and "narrow," "deep" and "shallow," "heavy" and "light,"
					etc.<milestone n="13.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover,
					"great" and "small," and "greater" and "smaller," whether used
					absolutely or relatively to one another, are essential attributes of
					quantity; by an extension of meaning, however, these terms are also
					applied to other things.<milestone n="13.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Of things called quantitative in an accidental sense, one kind is so
					called in the sense in which we said above that "cultured" or "white"
					is quantitative&mdash;because the subject to which they belong is
					quantitative; and others in the sense that motion and time are so
					called&mdash;for these too are said in a sense to be quantitative
					and continuous, since the subjects of which they are attributes are
					divisible. I mean, not the thing moved, but that through or along
					which the motion has taken place; for it is because the latter is
					quantitative that the motion is quantitative, and because the motion
					is quantitative that the time is also.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="14.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Quality" means
					(a) in one sense, the differentia of essence; e.g., a man is an animal
					of a certain quality because he is two-footed; and so is a horse,
					because it is four-footed. Also a circle is a geometrical figure of a
					certain quality, because it has no angles; <milestone n="1020b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>which
					shows that the essential differentia is quality.<milestone n="14.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In this one sense, then, "quality"
					means differentia of essence; but (b) in another it is used as of
					immovable and mathematical objects, in the sense that numbers are in a
					way qualitative&mdash;e.g. such as are composite and are
					represented geometrically not by a line but by a plane or solid (these
					are products respectively of two and of three factors)&mdash;and
					in general means that which is present besides quantity in the
					essence. For the essence of each number is that which goes into it
					once; e.g. that of 6 is not what goes twice or three times, but what
					goes once; for 6 is once 6.<milestone n="14.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) All affections of substance in motion in respect of which bodies
					become different when they (the affections) change&mdash;e.g. heat
					and cold, whiteness and blackness, heaviness and lightness, etc. (d)
					The term is used with reference to goodness and badness, and in
					general to good and bad.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="14.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus there are, roughly
					speaking, two meanings which the term "quality" can bear, and of these
					one is more fundamental than the other. Quality in the primary sense
					is the differentia of the essence; and quality in numbers falls under
					this sense, because it is a kind of differentia of essences, but of
					things either not in motion or not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> in
					motion. Secondly, there are the affections of things in motion <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> in motion, and the differentiae of
					motions.<milestone n="14.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Goodness
					and badness fall under these affections,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because they denote differentiae of the motion or
					functioning in respect of which things in motion act or are acted upon
					well or badly. For that which can function or be moved in
					such-and-such a way is good, and that which can function in
					such-and-such a way and in the contrary way is bad. Quality refers
					especially to "good" and "bad" in the case of living things, and of
					these especially in the case of such as possess choice.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are called "relative" (a) In the sense that "the double" is
					relative to the half, and "the triple" to the third; and in general
					the "many times greater" to the "many times smaller," and that which
					exceeds to the thing exceeded. (b) In the sense that the thing which
					heats or cuts is relative to the thing heated or cut; and in general
					the active to the passive. (c) In the sense that the measurable is
					relative to the measure, and the knowable to knowledge, and the
					sensible to sensation.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(a) In the first sense they
					are said to be numerically relative; either simply, or in a definite
					relation to numbers or to 1. E.g., "the double" in relation to 1 is a
					definite number; the "many times as great" is in a numerical relation
					to 1, but not in a definite relation such as <emph>this</emph> or
					<emph>that</emph> ; <milestone n="1021a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="15.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>the relation of that which is 1.5 times
					something else to that something is a definite numerical relation to a
					number; and that which is (n+1)/n times something else is in an
					indefinite relation to a number, just as "the many times as great" is
					in an indefinite relation to 1.<milestone n="15.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The relation of that which exceeds to that
					which is exceeded is numerically quite indefinite, for number is
					commensurate, and is not predicated of the incommensurate; whereas
					that which exceeds, in relation to that which is exceeded, is "so
					much" plus something more; and this something more is indefinite, for
					it is indifferently equal or not equal to the "so much."<milestone n="15.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus not only are all these
					things said to be relative in respect of number, but also the "equal"
					and "like" and "same," though in another way: for all these terms are
					used in respect of "one". Things are "the same" whose essence is one;
					"like" whose quality is one; "equal" whose quantity is one. Now "one"
					is the starting-point and standard of number; and so all these
					relations involve number, though not all in the same way.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) Active and passive things are called relative in virtue of an
					active or passive potentiality or actualization of the potentialities;
					e.g., that which can heat is called relative to that which can be
					heated, because it can heat; and again the thing heating is called
					relative to the thing heated, and the thing cutting to the thing cut,
					because their potentialities are actualized. Numerical relations, on
					the other hand, are not actualized<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(except as has been described elsewhere)<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The reference is quite
						uncertain, but cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 9.1051a">Aristot. Met. 9.9.4, 5</bibl>.
						The point is that the actualization of a numerical (or
						geometrical) relation does not imply an active functioning, as
						in the case of the potentialities just described.</note>; they
					have no actualizations in respect of motion.<milestone n="15.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Of things potentially relative, some are
					further relative in respect of particular times; as, e.g., that which
					has made or will make is relative to that which has been or will be
					made. It is in this way that a father is called father of a son; the
					one has acted, and the other has been acted upon, in a particular way.
					Again, some things are relative in virtue of a privation of their
					potentiality; such is "the impossible" and all similar terms, e.g.
					"the invisible."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus relative terms which involve
					number and potentiality are all relative because their very essence
					contains a reference to something else; but not because something else
					is related to their essence. But (c) that which is measurable or
					knowable or thinkable is called relative because something else is
					related to its essence.<milestone n="15.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For "thinkable" signifies that there is a thought which thinks it;
					but thought is not relative to that of which it is the thought (for
					then the same thing would have been said twice). And similarly sight
					is the sight of something; not of that of which it is the sight,
					although this is of course true&mdash;it is relative to some color
					or other similar thing.<milestone n="15.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To describe it in the other way&mdash;"the sight of the object
					of sight"&mdash;would be to say the same thing twice. <milestone n="1021b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Things, then, which are called relative of their
					own nature are so called, some in these senses, and others because the
					classes which contain them are of this kind. E.g., medicine is
					reckoned as relative because its genus, science, is thought to be a
					relative thing.<milestone n="15.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further,
					there are the properties in virtue of which the things which possess
					them are called relative; e.g., "equality" is relative because "the
					equal" is relative, and "similarity" because "the similar" is
					relative. Other things are accidentally relative; e.g., a man is
					relative because he happens to be "double" something else, and
					"double" is a relative term; or "white" is relative if the same thing
					happens to be white as well as double.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="16.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Perfect"
					&lt;or "complete"&gt; means: (a) That outside which it is
					impossible to find even a single one of its parts; e.g., the complete
					time of each thing is that outside which it is impossible to find any
					time which is a part of it. (b) That which, in respect of goodness or
					excellence, cannot be surpassed in its kind; e.g., a doctor and a
					musician are "perfect" when they have no deficiency in respect of the
					form of their peculiar excellence.<milestone n="16.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And thus by an extension of the meaning we use
					the term in a bad connection, and speak of a "perfect" humbug and a
					"perfect" thief; since indeed we call them "good"&mdash;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g. a "good" thief and a "good"
					humbug.<milestone n="16.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) And
					goodness is a kind of perfection. For each thing, and every substance,
					is perfect when, and only when, in respect of the form of its peculiar
					excellence, it lacks no particle of its natural magnitude. (d) Things
					which have attained their end, if their end is good, are called
					"perfect"; for they are perfect in virtue of having attained the
					end.<milestone n="16.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence, since
					the end is an ultimate thing, we extend the meaning of the term to bad
					senses, and speak of perishing "perfectly" or being "perfectly"
					destroyed, when the destruction or calamity falls short in no respect
					but reaches its extremity. Hence, by an extension of the meaning,
					death is called an "end," because they are both ultimate things. And
					the ultimate object of action is also an end.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="16.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things, then, which are called "perfect" in themselves are so called
					in all these senses; either because in respect of excellence they have
					no deficiency and cannot be surpassed, and because no part of them can
					be found outside them; or because, in general, they are unsurpassed in
					each particular class, and have no part outside. <milestone n="1022a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>All
					other things are so called in virtue of these, because they either
					produce or possess something of this kind, or conform to it, or are
					referred in some way or other to things which are perfect in the
					primary sense.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="17.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Limit" means: (a) The furthest part of
					each thing, and the first point outside which no part of a thing can
					be found, and the first point within which all parts are contained.
					(b) Any form of magnitude or of something possessing
					magnitude.<milestone n="17.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) The
					end of each thing. (This end is that <emph>to</emph> which motion and
					action proceed, and not the end <emph>from</emph> which. But sometimes
					it is both the end from which and the end to which, i.e. the final
					cause.) (d) The reality or essence of each thing; for this is the
					limit of our knowledge of it, and if it is a limit of the knowledge,
					it is also a limit of the thing. Thus it is obvious that "limit" has
					not only as many senses as "beginning" but even more; because the
					beginning is a kind of limit, but not every limit is a
					beginning.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="18.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"That in virtue of which" has various
					meanings. (a) The form or essence of each individual thing; e.g., that
					in virtue of which a man is good is "goodness itself." (b) The
					immediate substrate in which a thing is naturally produced; as, e.g.,
					color is produced in the surface of things. Thus "that in virtue of
					which" in the primary sense is the <emph>form</emph> , and in the
					secondary sense, as it were, the <emph>matter</emph> of each thing,
					and the immediate substrate.<milestone n="18.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general "that in virtue of which" will
					exist in the same number of senses as "cause."<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For we say indifferently "in virtue of
					what has he come?" or "for what reason has he come?" and "in virtue of
					what has he inferred or inferred falsely?" or "what is the cause of
					his inference or false inference?" (And further, there is the
					positional sense of <foreign lang="greek">kaq' o(/</foreign>, "in
					which he stands," or "in which he walks"; all these examples denote
					place or position.)<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="18.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence "in virtue of itself" must also
					have various meanings. It denotes (a) The essence of each particular;
					e.g., Callias is in virtue of himself Callias and the essence of
					Callias. (b) Everything contained in the definition; e.g., Callias is
					in virtue of himself an animal, because "animal" is present in the
					definition, since Callias is a kind of animal.<milestone n="18.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) Any attribute which a thing has
					received directly in itself or in any of its parts; e.g., the surface
					is white in virtue of itself; and man lives in virtue of himself,
					because the soul is a part of the man, and life is directly contained
					in it. (d) That which has no other cause. Man has many causes:
					"animal," "twofooted," etc.; but nevertheless man is in virtue of
					himself man. (e) All things which belong to a thing alone and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> alone; and hence that which is separate
					is "in virtue of itself."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This
						seems to be a slightly irrelevant reference to <foreign lang="greek">kaq' a(uto/</foreign> in the sense of
						"independent"; but corruption in the text has made the true
						reading uncertain.</note>
					<milestone n="1022b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="19.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Disposition" means arrangement of that
					which has parts, either in space or in potentiality or in form. It
					must be a kind of position, as indeed is clear from the word,
					"disposition."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Having"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">(/ecis</foreign> means not
						only "having" but "habit" or "state." Cf. Latin, habitus.</note>
					means (a) In one sense an activity, as it were, of the haver and the
					thing had, or as in the case of an action or motion; for when one
					thing makes and another is made, there is between them an act of
					making. In this way between the man who has a garment and the garment
					which is had, there is a "having." Clearly, then, it is impossible to
					<emph>have</emph> a "having" in this sense; for there will be an
					infinite series if we can have the having of what we have.<milestone n="20.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But (b) there is another sense
					of "having" which means a disposition, in virtue of which the thing
					which is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently
					or in relation to something else. E.g., health is a state, since it is
					a disposition of the kind described. Further, any part of such a
					disposition is called a state; and hence the excellence of the parts
					is a kind of state.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="21.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Affection" means (a) In one sense, a
					quality in virtue of which alteration is possible; e.g., whiteness and
					blackness, sweetness and bitterness, heaviness and lightness, etc. (b)
					The actualizations of these qualities; i.e. the alterations already
					realized. (c) More particularly, hurtful alterations and
					motions,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					especially hurts which cause suffering. (d) Extreme cases of
					misfortune and suffering are called "affections."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The English equivalent for
						<foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> in this sense would
						be "calamity" or "disaster."</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="22.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We speak of
					"privation": (a) In one sense, if a thing does not possess an
					attribute which is a natural possession, even if the thing itself
					would not naturally possess it<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is not a proper sense of privation, as Aristotle implies
						by choosing an example from everyday speech.</note>; e.g., we
					say that a vegetable is "deprived" of eyes. (b) If a thing does not
					possess an attribute which it or its genus would naturally possess.
					E.g., a blind man is not "deprived" of sight in the same sense that a
					mole is; the latter is "deprived" in virtue of its genus, but the
					former in virtue of himself.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., a mole is blind as being a member of a blind genus,
						whereas a man is blind only as an individual. Of course moles
						are not really blind, but we still speak as though they
						were.</note><milestone n="22.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) If
					a thing has not an attribute which it would naturally possess, and
					when it would naturally possess it (for blindness is a form of
					privation; but a man is not blind at <emph>any</emph> age, but only if
					he lacks sight at the age when he would naturally possess it<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The qualification refers, I
						suppose, to the fact that an embryo does not naturally possess
						sight.</note>), and similarly if it<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The subject seems to be indefinite, but no doubt
							Aristotle is thinking primarily of the particular example which
							he has just given. A man "is not called blind if he does not see
							in the dark, or if he does not see with his ears, or if he does
							not see sound, or if he does not see what is behind him or too
							far away" (
							Ross).</note> lacks an attribute in the medium and organ
					and relation and manner in which it would naturally possess
					it.<milestone n="22.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) The forcible
					removal of anything is called privation. (e) Privation has as many
					senses as there are senses of negation derived from the negative affix
					(<foreign lang="greek">a)</foreign>-). For we call a thing
					"unequal" because it does not possess equality (though it would
					naturally do so); and "invisible" either because it has no color at
					all or because it has only a faint one; and "footless" either because
					it has no feet at all or because it has rudimentary feet.<milestone n="22.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, a negative affix may
					mean "having something in a small degree"&mdash;e.g.
					"stoneless"&mdash; <milestone n="1023a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that is, having it in some
					rudimentary manner. Again, it may mean having it "not easily" or "not
					well"; e.g., "uncutable" means not only that which cannot be cut, but
					that which cannot be cut easily or well. And again, it may mean not
					having a thing at all; for it is not the one-eyed man, but the man who
					lacks sight in both eyes, who is called blind. Hence not every man is
					good or bad, moral or immoral; there is also the intermediate
					state.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="23.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"To have" &lt;or "possess"&gt; is used
					in various senses. (a) To direct in accordance with one's own nature
					or impulse; whence we say that fever "possesses" a man, and despots
					"possess" cities, and people who wear clothes "possess" them. (b) We
					speak of anything as "having" in which, as receptive material,
					something is present. E.g., the bronze "has" the shape of the statue,
					and the body "has" the disease.<milestone n="23.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) In the sense that the container holds the
					contained; for when A is contained in B, we say that A is held by B.
					E.g., we say that the vessel holds the liquid, and the city holds men,
					and the ship holds sailors, and so too that the whole "holds" the
					parts.<milestone n="23.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) The same
					term is applied to that which prevents anything from moving or acting
					in accordance with its own impulse; as pillars hold &lt;up&gt;
					the weights which are imposed upon them,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and as the poets make Atlas<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Hes. Th. 517">Hes. Th.

					is used similarly in senses corresponding to those of "to
					have."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="24.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"To come from something" means: (a) In one
					sense, to come from something as matter, and this in two ways: in
					respect either of the primary genus or of the ultimate species. E.g.,
					in the one sense everything liquefiable comes from water, and in the
					other the statue comes from bronze.<milestone n="24.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) To come from something as the first moving
					principle; e.g., "from what comes fighting?" From abuse; because this
					is the beginning of a fight. (c) To come from the combination of
					matter and form (as the parts come from the whole, and the verse from
					the <title>
						Iliad
					</title>, and the stones from the house); for the shape is an end, and
					that is a complete thing which has attained its end.<milestone n="24.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) In the sense that the form
					is made out of the part of its definition; as, e.g., "man" is made out
					of "two-footed " and the syllable out of its element<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In the sense that <foreign lang="greek">stoixei=on</foreign>("letter") forms part of
						the definition of "syllable."</note>(this is a different way
					from that in which the statue is made out of the bronze; <milestone n="1023b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the composite entity is made out of perceptible
					material, but the form is also made out of the material of the
					form).<milestone n="24.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These, then,
					are some of the meanings of "from" &lt;or "out of"&gt;, but
					(e) sometimes one of these senses only partially applies; e.g., the
					child comes from the father and mother, and plants from the earth,
					because they come from some part of those things. (f) It means "after"
					in time; e.g., we say that night comes from day, and storm from fine
					weather, because one comes after the other.<milestone n="24.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And we speak thus of some of these things in
					view of their alternation with each other, as in the examples just
					mentioned, and of others in view merely of their succession in time;
					e.g., "the voyage was made from the equinox," meaning that it was made
					after it; and "the Thargelia are from the Dionysia," meaning after the
					Dionysia.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The (city)

					divided; for that which is taken from a quantity <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> quantity is always called a part of that
					quantity&mdash;e.g., we call 2 part (in a sense) of 3. (b) In
					another sense the term is only applied to those "parts" in sense (a)
					which measure the whole; hence in one sense we call 2 part of 3, and
					in another not.<milestone n="25.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, (c)
					those divisions into which the form, apart from quantity, can be
					divided, are also called parts of the form. Hence species are called
					parts of their genus. (d) That into which the whole<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(either the form or that which contains
					the form) is divided, or of which it is composed. E.g., of a bronze
					sphere or cube not only is the bronze<milestone n="25.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(i.e. the material which contains the form) a
					part, but also the angle. (e) The elements in the definition of each
					thing are also called parts of the whole. Hence the genus is even
					called a part of the species, whereas in another sense the species is
					part of the genus.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="26.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Whole" means: (a) That from which no
					part is lacking of those things as composed of which it is called a
					natural whole. (b) That which so contains its contents that they form
					a unity; and this in two ways, either in the sense that each of them
					is a unity, or in the sense that the unity is composed of
					them.<milestone n="26.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For (i) the
					universal, or term generally applied as being some whole thing, is
					universal in the sense that it contains many particulars; because it
					is predicated of each of them, and each and all of them (e.g. man,
					horse, god) are one; because they are all living things. And (2) that
					which is continuous and limited is a whole when it is a unity composed
					of several parts (especially if the parts are only potentially present
					in it; but otherwise even if they are present actually).<milestone n="26.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of these things
					themselves, those which are so naturally are more truly wholes than
					those which are so artificially; just as we said of "the one," because
					"wholeness" is a kind of "oneness." <milestone n="1024a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Again,
					since a quantity has a beginning, middle and end, those to which
					position makes no difference we describe as "all," and those to which
					position makes a difference we describe as "whole," and those to which
					both descriptions can be applied, as both "all" and "whole."<milestone n="26.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These are all things whose
					nature remains the same in transposition, but whose shape does not;
					e.g. wax or a coat. They are described as both "whole" and "all"; for
					they have both characteristics. Water, however, and all liquids, and
					number, are described as "all"; we do not speak of a "whole number" or
					"whole water" except by an extension of meaning. Things are described
					as "all" in the plural <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> differentiated which
					are described as "all" in the singular <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> one;
					all this number, all these units.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="27.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We do not
					describe any chance quantity as "mutilated"; it must have parts, and
					must be a whole. The number 2 is not mutilated if one of its 1's is
					taken away&mdash;because the part lost by mutilation is never
					equal to the remainder&mdash;nor in general is any number
					mutilated; because the essence must persist. If a cup is mutilated, it
					must still be a cup; but the number is no longer the same.<milestone n="27.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, not even all things
					which have dissimilar parts are mutilated; for a number has in a sense
					dissimilar as well as similar parts&mdash;e.g. 2, 3. But in
					general of things whose position makes no difference, e.g. water or
					fire, none is mutilated;&mdash;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>to be mutilated, things must be such as have their
					position according to their essence.<milestone n="27.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, they must be continuous; for a
					musical scale is composed of dissimilar parts, and has position; but
					it does not become mutilated. Moreover, even things which are wholes
					are not mutilated by the removal of <emph>any</emph> of their parts;
					the parts removed must be neither proper to their essence nor in any
					chance location. E.g., a cup is not mutilated if a hole is made in it,
					but only if the handle or some projection is broken;<milestone n="27.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and a man is not mutilated if
					he loses flesh or his spleen, but if he loses some extremity; and not
					every extremity, but only such as cannot grow again when completely
					removed. Hence bald people are not mutilated.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="28.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					term "genus" &lt;or "race"&gt; is used: (a) When there is a
					continuous generation of things of the same type; e.g., "as long as
					the human <emph>race</emph> exists" means "as long as the generation
					of human beings is continuous." (b) Of anything from which things
					derive their being as the prime mover of them into being. Thus some
					are called Hellenes by race, and others Ionians, because some have
					Hellen and others Ion
					as their first ancestor.<milestone n="28.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(Races are called after the male ancestor rather than after the

					that the plane is the "genus" of plane figures, and the solid of
					solids (for each one of the figures is either a particular plane or a

					differentiae.<milestone n="28.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(d) In
					the sense that in formulae the first component, which is stated as
					part of the essence, is the genus, and the qualities are said to be
					its differentiae. The term "genus," then, is used in all these
					senses&mdash;(a) in respect of continuous generation of the same
					type; (b) in respect of the first mover of the same type as the things
					which it moves; (c) in the sense of material. For that to which the
					differentia or quality belongs is the substrate, which we call
					material.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="28.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Things are called "generically
					different" whose immediate substrates are different and cannot be
					resolved one into the other or both into the same thing. E.g., form
					and matter are generically different, and all things which belong to
					different categories of being; for some of the things of which being
					is predicated denote the essence, others a quality, and others the
					various other things which have already been distinguished. For these
					also cannot be resolved either into each other or into any one
					thing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="29.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"False" means: (i) false as a
					<emph>thing</emph> ; (a) because it is not or cannot be substantiated;
					such are the statements that the diagonal of a square is
					commensurable,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or that
					you are sitting. Of these one is false always, and the other
					sometimes; it is in these senses that these things are not
					facts.<milestone n="29.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(b) Such
					things as really exist, but whose nature it is to seem either such as
					they are not, or like things which are unreal; e.g. chiaroscuro and
					dreams. For these are really something, but not that of which they
					create the impression. Things, then, are called false in these senses:
					either because they themselves are unreal, or because the impression
					derived from them is that of something unreal.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="29.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) A
					false statement is the statement of <emph>what is not</emph>, in so
					far as the statement is false. Hence every definition is untrue of
					anything other than that of which it is true; e.g., the definition of
					a circle is untrue of a triangle. Now in one sense there is only one
					definition of each thing, namely that of its essence; but in another
					sense there are many definitions,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Here Aristotle is using the word <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign> not in the strict sense of
						"definition" but in the looser sense of "a statement about

					qualified (e.g. "Socrates"
					and "cultured Socrates") are
					in a sense the same.<milestone n="29.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					the false definition is not strictly a definition of anything. Hence
					it was foolish of Antisthenes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Cynic; contemporary and renegade "disciple" of
						Socrates. He taught that
						definition, and even predication, are strictly speaking

						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1043b">Aristot. Met. 8.3.7, 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 201d">Plat. Theaet. 201d-202c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Soph.         251b">Plat. Soph.

					so. But it is possible to describe everything not only by its own
					definition but by that of something else; quite falsely, and yet also

					meanings of "false" in these cases. (3.) A false man is one who
					readily and deliberately makes such statements, for the sake of doing
					so and for no other reason; and one who induces such statements in
					others&mdash;just as we call things false which induce a false
					impression. Hence the proof in the <title>Hippias</title><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Hipp. Min        365">Plat. Hipp. Min 365-375</bibl>.</note> that the same man is false and true
					is misleading;<milestone n="29.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it
					assumes (a) that the false man is he who is <emph>able</emph> to
					deceive, i.e. the man who knows and is intelligent; (b) that the man
					who is willingly bad is better. This false assumption is due to the
					induction; for when he says that the man who limps willingly is better
					than he who does so unwillingly, he means by limping
					<emph>pretending</emph> to limp. For if he is willingly lame, he is
					presumably worse in this case just as he is in the case of moral
					character.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="30.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"Accident" &lt;or
					"attribute"&gt; means that which applies to something and is truly
					stated, but neither necessarily nor usually; as if, for example, while
					digging a hole for a plant one found a treasure. Then the finding of
					treasure is an accident to the man who is digging the hole; for the
					one thing is not a necessary consequence or sequel of the other, nor
					does one usually find treasure while planting.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="30.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And a cultured man might be white; but since
					this does not happen necessarily or usually, we call it an accident.
					Thus since there are attributes and subjects, and some attributes
					apply to their subjects only at a certain place and time, any
					attribute which applies to a subject, but not because it was a
					particular subject or time or place, will be an accident.<milestone n="30.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor is there any definite
					cause for an accident, but only a chance, i.e. indefinite, cause. It
					was by accident that X went to <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City">Aegina</placeName> if he arrived there, not because he intended to go
					there but because he was carried out of his course by a storm, or
					captured by pirates.<milestone n="30.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					accident has happened or exists, but in virtue not of itself but of
					something else; for it was the storm which was the cause of his coming
					to a place for which he was not sailing&mdash;i.e. <placeName key="perseus,Aegina City">Aegina</placeName>.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>"Accident" has also another sense,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. "property."</note> namely,
					whatever belongs to each thing in virtue of itself, but is not in its
					essence; e.g. as having the sum of its angles equal to two right
					angles belongs to the triangle. Accidents of this kind may be eternal,
					but none of the former kind can be. There is an account of this
					elsewhere.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The reference

					<emph>things which are</emph> that we are seeking; and clearly
					of the things which are <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> being. There is a
					cause of health and physical fitness; and mathematics has principles
					and elements and causes; and in general every intellectual science or
					science which involves intellect deals with causes and principles,
					more or less exactly or simply considered.<milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But all these sciences single out some
					existent thing or class, and concern themselves with that; not with
					Being unqualified, nor <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being, nor do they
					give any account of the essence; but starting from it, some making it
					clear to perception, and others assuming it as a hypothesis, they
					demonstrate, more or less cogently, the essential attributes of the
					class with which they are dealing.<milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence obviously there is no demonstration of
					substance or essence from this method of approach, but some other
					means of exhibiting it. And similarly they say nothing as to whether
					the class of objects with which they are concerned exists or not;
					because the demonstration of its essence and that of its existence
					belong to the same intellectual process.<milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since physical science also happens to
					deal with a genus of Being<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(for it deals with the sort of substance which contains in itself
					the principle of motion and rest), obviously it is neither a practical
					nor a productive science.<milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in the case of things produced the principle of motion (either
					mind or art or some kind of potency) is in the producer; and in the
					case of things done the will is the agent&mdash;for the thing done
					and the thing willed are the same. Thus if every intellectual activity
					is either practical or productive or speculative, physics will be a
					speculative science; but speculative about that kind of Being which
					can be moved, and about formulated substance for the most part only
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> inseparable from matter.<milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But we must not fail to observe
					<emph>how</emph> the essence and the formula exist, since
					without this our inquiry is ineffectual.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now of things defined, i.e. of essences, some apply in the sense
					that "snub" does, and some in the sense that "concave" does. The
					difference is that "snub" is a combination of form with matter;
					because the "snub" is a concave <emph>nose</emph> , whereas concavity
					is independent of sensible matter. <milestone n="1026a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now if all physical terms are used in
					the same sense as "snub"&mdash;e.g. nose, eye, face, flesh, bone,
					and in general animal; leaf, root, bark, and in general vegetable (for
					not one of these has a definition without motion; the definition
					invariably includes matter)&mdash;it is clear how we should look
					for and define the essence in physical things, and why it is the
					province of the physicist to study even some aspects of the soul, so
					far as it is not independent of matter.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is obvious,
					then, from these considerations, that physics is a form of speculative
					science. And mathematics is also speculative; but it is not clear at
					present whether its objects are immutable and separable from matter;
					it is clear, however, that some branches of mathematics study their
					objects <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> immutable and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> separable from matter. Obviously it is the province of a
					speculative science to discover whether a thing is eternal and
					immutable and separable from matter;<milestone n="1.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>not, however, of physics (since physics deals
					with mutable objects) nor of mathematics, but of a science prior to
					both. For physics deals with things which exist separately but are not
					immutable; and some branches of mathematics deal with things which are
					immutable, but presumably not separable, but present in matter; but
					the primary science treats of things which are both separable and
					immutable.<milestone n="1.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now all
					causes must be eternal, but these especially; since they are the
					causes of what is visible of things divine. Hence there will be three
					speculative philosophies: mathematics, physics, and
					theology&mdash;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since it is obvious that if the divine is present anywhere, it is
					present in this kind of entity; and also the most honorable science
					must deal with the most honorable class of subject.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					speculative sciences, then, are to be preferred to the other sciences,
					and "theology" to the other speculative sciences. One might indeed
					raise the question whether the primary philosophy is universal or
					deals with some one genus or entity; because even the mathematical
					sciences differ in this respect&mdash;geometry and astronomy deal
					with a particular kind of entity, whereas universal mathematics
					applies to all kinds alike.<milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then if there is not some other substance besides those which are
					naturally composed, physics will be the primary science; but if there
					is a substance which is immutable, the science which studies this will
					be prior to physics, and will be primary philosophy, and universal in
					this sense, that it is primary. And it will be the province of this
					science to study Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being; what it is,
					and what the attributes are which belong to it <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But since the simple term "being" is
					used in various senses, of which we saw that one was
					<emph>accidental</emph> , and another <emph>true</emph> (not-being
					being used in the sense of "false"); and since besides these there are
					the categories, e.g. the "what," quality, quantity, place, time, and
					any other similar meanings; <milestone n="1026b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and further besides
					all these the <emph>potential</emph> and <emph>actual</emph> : since
					the term "being" has various senses, it must first be said of what
					"is" accidentally, that there can be no speculation about
					it.<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is shown by
					the fact that no science, whether practical, productive or
					speculative, concerns itself with it. The man who produces a house
					does not produce all the attributes which are accidental to the house
					in its construction; for they are infinite in number. There is no
					reason why the house so produced should not be agreeable to some,
					injurious to others, and beneficial to others, and different perhaps
					from every other existing thing; but the act of building is productive
					of none of these results.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In the same way the geometrician does not study the accidental
					attributes of his figures, nor whether a triangle is different from a
					triangle the sum of whose angles is equal to two right angles. And
					this accords with what we should reasonably expect, because "accident"
					is only, as it were, a sort of name. Hence in a way Plato<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 254a">Plat. Soph.
						254a</bibl>.</note> was not far wrong in making sophistry
					deal with what is nonexistent;<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>because the sophists discuss the accident

					latter always or usually comes at this time, but not the former. It is
					accidental for a man to be white (since this is neither always nor

					<milestone n="1027a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is by accident that a builder restores to
					health, because it is not a builder but a doctor who naturally does
					this; but the builder happened accidentally to be a doctor. A

					health-giving; but not in virtue of his confectioner's art. Hence, we
					say, it was accidental; and he produces it in a sense, but not in an
					unqualified sense.<milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					there are potencies which produce other things, but there is no art or
					determinate potency of accidents, since the cause of things which
					exist or come to be by accident is also accidental.<milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence, since not everything is or comes
					to be of necessity and always, but most things happen usually, the
					accidental must exist. E.g., the white man is neither always nor

					regarded as accidental. Otherwise, everything must be regarded as of
					necessity.<milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore
					the cause of the accidental is the matter, which admits of variation
					from the usual.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We must take this as our
					starting-point: Is everything either "always" or "usually"? This is
					surely impossible. Then besides these alternatives there is something
					else: the fortuitous and accidental. But again, are things
					<emph>usually</emph> so, but nothing <emph>always</emph> , or
					are there things which are eternal? These questions must be inquired
					into later<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1071b">Aristot. Met. 12.6-8</bibl>.</note>;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but it is clear that there is no
					science of the accidental&mdash;because all scientific knowledge
					is of that which is <emph>always</emph> or <emph>usually</emph> so.
					How else indeed can one learn it or teach it to another? For a fact
					must be defined by being so always or usually; e.g., honey-water is
					usually beneficial in case of fever.<milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But science will not be able to state the
					exception to the rule: when it is not beneficial&mdash;e.g. at the
					new moon; because that which happens at the new moon also happens
					either always or usually; but the accidental is contrary to this. We
					have now explained the nature and cause of the accidental, and that
					there is no science of it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is obvious that there are
					principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from
					the actual processes of generation and destruction<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">On the analogy of accidental
						events; see 2. 5.</note>; for if this is not true, everything
					will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some
					cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and
					destroyed. Will A be, or not? Yes, if B happens; otherwise not. And B
					will happen if C does.<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It
					is clear that in this way, as time is continually subtracted from a
					limited period, we shall come to the present. <milestone n="1027b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Accordingly So-and-so will die by disease or violence if he goes
					out; and this if he gets thirsty; and this if something else happens;
					and thus we shall come to what is the case now, or to something which
					has already happened. E.g. "if he is thirsty"; this will happen if he
					is eating pungent food, and this is either the case or not.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus of necessity he will
					either die or not die. And similarly if one jumps over to the past,
					the principle is the same; for this&mdash;I mean that which has
					just happened&mdash;is already present in something. Everything,
					then, which is to be, will be of necessity; e.g., he who is alive must
					die&mdash;for some stage of the process has been reached already;
					e.g., the contraries are present in the same body&mdash;but
					whether by disease or violence is not yet determined; it depends upon
					whether so-and-so happens.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Clearly, then, the series goes back to some starting-point, which
					does not go back to something else. This, therefore, will be the
					starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing else is the cause of its
					generation. But to what sort of starting-point and cause this process
					of tracing back leads, whether to a material or final or moving cause,
					is a question for careful consideration.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>So much, then, for
					the accidental sense of "being"; we have defined it sufficiently. As
					for "being" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> truth, and "not-being" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> falsity, since they depend upon
					combination and separation,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and taken together are concerned with the arrangement of the parts
					of a contradiction (since the true has affirmation when the subject
					and predicate are combined, and negation where they are divided; but
					the false has the contrary arrangement.<milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>How it happens that we combine or separate in
					thought is another question. By "combining or separating in thought" I
					mean thinking them not as a succession but as a unity<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc., "or not as a unity but as
						a succession" (this is <emph>separating</emph> in
						thought).</note>); for "falsity" and "truth" are not in
					<emph>things</emph> &mdash;the good, for example, being true, and
					the bad false&mdash;but in <emph>thought</emph> ; and with regard
					to simple concepts and essences there is no truth or falsity even in
					thought;<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&mdash;what points we must study in connection with being and
					not-being in this sense, we must consider later. But since the
					combination and separation exists in thought and not in things, and
					this sense of "being" is different from the proper senses (since
					thought attaches or detaches essence or quality or quantity or some
					other category), we may dismiss the accidental and real senses<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the senses in which the
						verb "to be" is used to express an accidental or a true
						relation.</note> of "being."<milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the cause of the one is indeterminate and
					of the other an affection of thought; <milestone n="1028a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and
					both are connected with the remaining genus of "being," and do not
					indicate any objective reality. Let us therefore dismiss them, and
					consider the causes and principles of Being itself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being. [We have made it clear in our distinction of
					the number of senses in which each term is used that "being" has

				<p><milestone n="1028a" unit="section"/><milestone n="10" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term "being" has several senses,
					which we have classified in our discussion<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1017a">Aristot. Met.
						5.7</bibl>.</note> of the number of senses in which terms are
					used. It denotes first the " <emph>what</emph> " of a thing, i.e. the
					individuality; and then the quality or quantity or any other such
					category. Now of all these senses which "being" has, the primary sense
					is clearly the "what," which denotes the <emph>substance</emph>
					<milestone n="1.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(because when we describe
					the quality of a particular thing we say that it is "good or bad," and
					not "five feet high" or "a man"; but when we describe
					<emph>what</emph> it is, we say not that it is "white" or "hot" or
					"five feet high," but that it is "a man" or "a god"), and all other
					things are said to "be" because they are either quantities or
					qualities or affections or some other such thing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="1.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence one might
					raise the question whether the terms "to walk" and "to be well" and
					"to sit" signify each of these things as "being," or not; and
					similarly in the case of any other such terms; for not one of them by
					nature has an independent existence or can be separated from its
					substance. Rather, if anything it is the <emph>thing</emph> which
					walks or sits or is well that is existent.<milestone n="1.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The reason why these things are more truly
					existent is because their subject is something definite; i.e. the
					substance and the individual, which is clearly implied in a
					designation of this kind, since apart from it we cannot speak of "the
					good" or "sitting." Clearly then it is by reason of the substance that
					each of the things referred to exists.<milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence that which <emph>is</emph> primarily,
					not in a qualified sense but absolutely, will be substance.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now "primary" has several meanings; but
					nevertheless substance is primary in all senses, both in definition
					and in knowledge and in time. For none of the other categories can
					exist separately, but substance alone;<milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and it is primary also in definition, because
					in the formula of each thing the formula of substance must be
					inherent; and we assume that we know each particular thing most truly
					when we know <emph>what</emph> "man" or "fire" is&mdash;
					<milestone n="1028b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>rather than its quality or quantity or
					position; because we know each of these points too when we know
					<emph>what</emph> the quantity or quality is.<milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed, the question which was raised
					long ago, is still and always will be, and which always baffles
					us&mdash;"What is Being?"&mdash;is in other words "What is
					substance?" Some say that it is one<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Milesians and Eleatics.</note>; others, more
					than one; some, finite<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						Pythagoreans and Empedocles.</note>; others, infinite.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Anaxagoras and the
							Atomists.</note> And so for us too our chief and primary and
					practically our only concern is to investigate the nature of "being"
					in the sense of substance.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Substance is thought to be
					present most obviously in bodies. Hence we call animals and plants and
					their parts substances, and also natural bodies, such as fire, water,
					earth, etc., and all things which are parts of these or composed of
					these, either of parts or them or of their totality; e.g. the visible
					universe and its parts, the stars and moon and sun.<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must consider whether (a) these are
					the only substances, or (b) these and some others, or (c) some of
					these, or (d) some of these and some others, or (e) none of these, but
					certain others. Some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The
						Pythagoreans.</note> hold that the bounds of body&mdash;i.e.
					the surface, line, point and unit&mdash;are substances, and in a
					truer sense than body or the solid.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The pre-Socratics.</note> believe that there is
					nothing of this kind besides sensible things, while others believe in
					eternal entities more numerous and more real than sensible
					things.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Thus Plato
					posited the Forms and the objects of mathematics as two kinds of
					substance, and as a third the substance of sensible bodies;<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and Speusippus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Plato's nephew and successor as
						the head of the Academy.</note> assumed still more kinds of
					substances, starting with "the One," and positing principles for each
					kind: one for numbers, another for magnitudes, and then another for
					the soul. In this way he multiplies the kinds of substance. Some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The followers of Xenocrates,
						successor to Speusippus.</note> again hold that the Forms and
					numbers have the same nature, and that other things&mdash;lines
					and planes&mdash;are dependent upon them; and soon back to the
					substance of the visible universe and sensible things.<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must consider, then, with
					regard to these matters, which of the views expressed is right and
					which wrong; and what things are substances; and whether there are any
					substances besides the sensible substances, or not; and how sensible
					substances exist; and whether there is any separable substance (and if
					so, why and how) or no substance besides the sensible ones. We must
					first give a rough sketch of what substance is.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					term "substance" is used, if not in more, at least in four principal
					cases; for both the essence and the universal and the genus are held
					to be the substance of the particular, and fourthly the substrate. The
					substrate is that of which the rest are predicated, while it is not
					itself predicated of anything else. Hence we must first determine its
					nature, <milestone n="1029a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the primary substrate is considered
					to be in the truest sense substance.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now in one sense
					we call the <emph>matter</emph> the substrate; in another, the
					<emph>shape</emph> ; and in a third, the combination of the two.
					By matter I mean, for instance, bronze; by shape, the arrangement of
					the form; and by the combination of the two, the concrete thing: the
					statue. Thus if the form is prior to the matter and more truly
					existent, by the same argument it will also be prior to the
					combination.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have now stated in outline the
					nature of substance&mdash;that it is not that which is predicated
					of a subject, but that of which the other things are predicated. But
					we must not merely define it so, for it is not enough. Not only is the
					statement itself obscure, but also it makes matter substance; for if
					matter is not substance, it is beyond our power to say what else
					is.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For when
					everything else is removed, clearly nothing but matter remains;
					because all the other things are affections, products and potencies of
					bodies, and length, breadth and depth are kinds of quantity, and not
					substances. For quantity is not a substance; rather the substance is
					that to which these affections primarily belong.<milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But when we take away length and
					breadth and depth we can see no thing remaining, unless it be the
					something bounded by them; so that on this view matter must appear to
					be the only substance.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>By
					matter I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor a
					quantity nor designated by any of the categories which define
					Being.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For there is
					something of which each of these is predicated, whose being is
					different from that of each one of the categories; because all other
					things are predicated of substance, but this is predicated of matter.
					Thus the ultimate substrate is in itself neither a particular thing
					nor a quantity nor anything else. Nor indeed is it the negations of
					these; for the negations too will only apply to it
					accidentally.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If we hold this view, it follows that
					matter is substance. But this is impossible; for it is accepted that
					separability and individuality belong especially to substance. Hence
					it would seem that the form and the combination of form and matter are
					more truly substance than matter is.<milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The substance, then, which consists of
					both&mdash;I mean of matter and form&mdash;may be dismissed,
					since it is posterior and obvious. Matter too is in a sense evident.
					We must consider the third type, for this is the most
					perplexing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now it is agreed that
					some sensible things are substances, and so we should begin our
					inquiry in connection with these. <milestone n="1029b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is convenient to advance to the more
					intelligible<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. by
						nature. All learning proceeds by induction from that which is
						intelligible to <emph>us</emph> (i.e., the complex facts and
						objects of our experience, which are bound up with sensation and
						therefore less intelligible in themselves), to that which is
						intelligible in itself (i.e., the simple universal principles of
						scientific knowledge).</note>; for learning is always acquired
					in this way, by advancing through what is less intelligible by nature
					to what is more so. And just as in actions it is our task to start
					from the good of the individual and make absolute good good for the
					individual,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1129b">Aristot. Ethics 1129b 5</bibl>.</note> so it is our
					task to start from what is more intelligible to oneself and make what
					is by nature intelligible intelligible to oneself.<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now that which is intelligible and
					primary to individuals is often but slightly intelligible, and
					contains but little reality; but nevertheless, starting from that
					which is imperfectly intelligible but intelligible to oneself, we must
					try to understand the absolutely intelligible; advancing, as we have
					said, by means of these very things which are intelligible to
					us.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Since we distinguished at the
					beginning<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1028b">Aristot. Met. 7.3.1</bibl>.</note> the number of ways in
					which substance is defined, and since one of these appeared to be
					essence, we must investigate this.<milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>First, let us make certain linguistic
					statements about it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The essence of each
					thing is that which it is said to be per se. "To be you" is not "to be
					cultured," because you are not of your own nature cultured. Your
					essence, then, is that which you are said to be<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>of your own nature. But not even all of this is the
					essence; for the essence is not that which is said to be per se in the
					sense that whiteness is said to belong to a surface,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        5.1024b">Aristot. Met.
						5.18.3, 4</bibl>.</note> because "being a surface" is not
					"being white."<milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor is the
					essence the combination of both, "being a white surface." Why? Because
					the word itself is repeated.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence the formula of the essence of each thing is that which defines
					the term but does not contain it. Thus if "being a white surface" is
					the same as "being a smooth surface," "white" and "smooth" are one and
					the same.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The statement that "to
						be a white surface" is the same as "to be a smooth surface"
						tells us nothing fresh about surface; it simply identifies
						"white" with "smooth." Aristotle has in mind Democritus's theory
						of color (that it is an impression conveyed to our eyes from the
						superficial texture of the object; <bibl n="Thphr. Sens. 73">Theophrastus, De
							Sensu 73-75</bibl>); cf.<bibl n="Aristot. Sens. 442b.11">Aristot. De Sensu 442b
								11</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. GC 316a.11">Aristot. De Gen. et Corr. 316a
									1</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But since in the other
					categories too there are compounds with substance (because there is a
					substrate for each category, e.g. quality, quantity, time, place and
					motion), we must inquire whether there is a formula of the essence of
					each one of them; whether these compounds, e.g. "white man," also have
					an essence. Let the compound be denoted by X.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Literally "cloak," but the word is chosen quite
						arbitrarily. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1045a">Aristot. Met. 8.6.4</bibl>.</note>
					What is the essence of X?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>"But this is
					not even a per se expression." We reply that there are two ways in
					which a definition can be not per se true of its subject: (a) by an
					addition, and (b) by an omission.<milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In one case the definition is not per se true
					because the term which is being defined is combined with something
					else; as if, e.g., in defining whiteness one were to state the
					definition of a white man. In the other, because something else (which
					is not in the definition) is combined with the subject; as if, e.g., X
					were to denote "white man," and X were defined as "white." "White man"
					is white, <milestone n="1030a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but its essence is not "to be white."
					But is "to be X" an essence at all?<milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Surely not. The essence is an individual type;
					but when a subject has something distinct from it predicated of it, it
					is not an individual type. E.g., "white man" is not an individual
					type; that is, assuming that individuality belongs only to substances.
					Hence essence belongs to all things the account of which is a
					definition.<milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have
					a definition, not if the name and the account signify the same (for
					then all accounts would be definitions; because any account can have a
					name, so that even "the <emph>Iliad</emph> " will be a definition),
					but if the account is of something primary. Such are all statements
					which do not involve the predication of one thing of
					another.<milestone n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence
					essence will belong to nothing except species of a genus, but to these
					only; for in these the predicate is not considered to be related to
					the subject by participation or affection, nor as an accident. But of
					everything else as well, if it has a name, there will be a formula of
					<emph>what it means</emph>&mdash;that X belongs to Y; or
					instead of a simple formula one more exact&mdash;but no
					definition, nor essence.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or perhaps "definition," like
					the "what," has more than one sense. For the "what" in one sense means
					the substance and the individual,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in another each one of the categories:
					quantity, quality, etc.<milestone n="4.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Just as "is" applies to everything, although not in the same way,
					but primarily to one thing and secondarily to others; so "what it is"
					applies in an unqualified sense to substance, and to other things in a
					qualified sense. For we might ask also what quality "is," so that
					quality also is a "what it is"; not however without qualification, but
					just as in the case of not-being some say by a verbal quibble that
					not-being "is"&mdash;not in an unqualified sense, but "is"
					not-being&mdash;so too with quality.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now although we
					must also consider how we should express ourselves in each particular
					case, it is still more important to consider what the facts are. Hence
					now, since the language which we are using is clear, similarly essence
					also will belong primarily and simply to substance, and secondarily to
					other things as well; just as the "what it is" is not essence simply,
					but the essence of a quality or quantity.<milestone n="4.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it must be either by equivocation that we
					say that these things <emph>are</emph> , or by adding and subtracting
					qualifications, as we say that the unknowable is known<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. to be unknowable.</note>;
					since the truth is that we use the terms neither equivocally nor in
					the same sense, but just as we use the term "medical" in
					<emph>relation</emph> to one and the same thing; <milestone n="1030b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but not <emph>of</emph> one and the same thing, nor
					yet equivocally. The term "medical" is applied to a body and a
					function and an instrument, neither equivocally nor in one sense, hut
					in relation to one thing.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1003a">Aristot. Met. 4.2.2</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>However, in whichever way one chooses to speak of these things, it
					matters nothing; but this point is clear: that the primary and
					unqualified definition, and the essence, belong to substances. It is
					true that they belong equally to other things too, but not
					<emph>primarily</emph> . For if we assume this, it does not
					necessarily follow that there is a definition of anything which means
					the same as any formula; it must mean the same as a particular kind of
					formula, i.e. the formula of one thing&mdash;<milestone n="4.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>one not by continuity like the
					<title>Iliad</title>, or things which are arbitrarily combined,
					but in one of the proper senses of "one." And "one" has the same
					variety of senses as "being." "Being" means sometimes the individual
					thing, sometimes the quantity, sometimes the quality. Hence even
					"white man" will have a formula and definition; but in a different
					sense from the definition of "whiteness" and "substance."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The question arises: If one denies that a formula involving an added
					determinant is a definition, how can there be a definition of terms
					which are not simple but coupled? Because they can only be explained
					by adding a determinant.<milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>I
					mean, e.g., there is "nose" and "concavity" and "snubness," the term
					compounded of the two, because the one is present in the other.
					Neither "concavity" nor "snubness" is an accidental, but a per se
					affection of the nose.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Snubness
						is a per se affection of the nose, because it applies only to
						the nose and cannot be explained apart from it, but the same can
						hardly be said of concavity. Aristotle himself uses the word
						(<foreign lang="greek">koilo/ths</foreign>) elsewhere in
						other connections.</note><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Nor are they attributes in the sense that "white"
					is of Callias or a man, because Callias is white and is by accident a
					man; but in the sense that "male" is an attribute of animal, and
					equality of quantity, and all other attributes which we say belong per
					se.<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That is, all
					things which involve the formula or name of the subject of the
					affection, and cannot be explained apart from it. Thus "white" can be
					explained apart from "man," but not "female" apart from "animal." Thus
					either these terms have no essence or definition, or else they have it
					in a different sense, as we have said.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is also
					another difficulty about them. If "snub nose" is the same as "concave
					nose," "snub" will be the same as "concave." But if not, since it is
					impossible to speak of "snub" apart from the thing of which it is a
					per se affection (because "snub" means a concavity in the nose),
					either it is impossible to call the nose snub, or it will be a
					tautology, "concave-nose nose" because "snub nose" will equal
					"concave-nose nose."<milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence
					it is absurd that such terms as these should have an essence.
					Otherwise there will be an infinite regression; for in "snub-nose
					nose" there will be yet another nose. <milestone n="1031a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Clearly, then, there is definition of substance alone. If there were
					definition of the other categories also, it would have to involve an
					added determinant, as in the case of the qualitative; and of the odd,
					for this cannot be defined apart from number; nor can "female" apart
					from "animal."<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By
					"involving an added determinant" I mean descriptions which involve a
					tautology, as in the above examples. Now if this is true, there will
					be no definition of compound expressions either; e.g., "odd number."
					We fail to realize this because our terms are not used accurately. If
					on the other hand there are definitions of these too, either they are
					defined in a different way, or, as we have said, "definition" and
					"essence" must be used in more than one sense;<milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>thus in one sense there will be no
					definition of anything, and nothing will have an essence, except
					substances; and in another those other things will have a definition
					and essence. It is obvious, then, that the definition is the formula
					of the essence, and that the essence belongs either <emph>only</emph>
					to substances, or especially and primarily and simply.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must inquire whether the essence is the same as the particular
					thing, or different. This is useful for our inquiry about substance;
					because a particular thing is considered to be nothing other than its
					own substance, and the essence is called the substance of the
					thing.<milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In accidental
					predications, indeed, the thing itself would seem to be different from

					one.<milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Either all
					essences exist alike, or none of them; and so if not even the essence

					arrives at what he himself finally can do; then the process from this
					point onwards, i.e. the process towards health, is called

					health and a house from a house; that which has matter from that which

					Each of the other intermediate measures is carried out in the same

					entail? So-and-so;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and this

					medical treatment the starting-point is, perhaps, the heating of the
					patient; and this the doctor produces by friction. Heat in the body,
					then, is either a part of health, or is followed (directly or through
					several intermediaries) by something similar which is a part of
					health. This is the ultimate thing, namely that produces, and in this
					sense is a part of, health&mdash;or of the house <milestone n="7.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(in the form of stones)<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">There is no real analogy

							7.9.1</bibl>.</note> or of other things. Therefore, as we say,
					generation would be impossible if nothing were already existent. It is
					clear, then, that some part must necessarily pre-exist; because the
					matter is a part, since it is matter which pre-exists in the product
					and becomes something. <milestone n="1033a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But then is matter part of the
					formula? Well, we define bronze circles in both ways; we describe the
					matter as bronze, and the form as such-and-such a shape; and this
					shape is the proximate genus in which the circle is placed.<milestone n="7.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The bronze circle, then, has
					its matter in its formula. Now as for that from which, as matter,
					things are generated, some things when they are generated are called
					not "so-and-so," but "made of so-and-so"; e.g., a statue is not called
					stone, but made of stone. But the man who becomes healthy is not
					called after that from which he becomes healthy. This is because the
					generation proceeds from the privation and the substrate, which we
					call matter (e.g., both "the man" and "the invalid" become
					healthy),<milestone n="7.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but it is
					more properly said to proceed from the privation; e.g., a man becomes
					healthy from being an invalid rather than from being a man. Hence a
					healthy person is not called an invalid, but a man, and a healthy man.
					But where the privation is obscure and has no name&mdash;e.g. in
					bronze the privation of any given shape, or in bricks and wood the
					privation of the shape of a house&mdash;the generation is
					considered to proceed from these materials, as in the former case from
					the invalid.<milestone n="7.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence just as
					in the former case the subject is not called that from which it is
					generated, so in this case the statue is not called wood, but is
					called by a verbal change not wood, but wooden; not bronze, but made
					of bronze; not stone, but made of stone; and the house is called not
					bricks, but made of bricks.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For if we consider the matter carefully, we should not even say
					without qualification that a statue is generated from wood, or a house
					from bricks; because that from which a thing is generated should not
					persist, but be changed. This, then, is why we speak in this
					way.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now since that which is generated is generated
					<emph>by</emph> something (by which I mean the starting-point of
					the process of generation), and <emph>from</emph> something (by which
					let us understand not the privation but the matter; for we have
					already distinguished the meanings of these), and <emph>becomes</emph>
					something (i.e. a sphere or circle or whatever else it may be); just
					as the craftsman does not produce the substrate, i.e. the bronze, so
					neither does he produce the sphere; except accidentally, inasmuch as
					the bronze sphere is a sphere, and he makes the former.<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For to make an individual thing
					is to make it out of the substrate in the fullest sense. I mean that
					to make the bronze round is not to make the round or the sphere, but
					something else; i.e. to produce this form in another medium. For if we
					make the form, we must make it out of something else; for this has
					been assumed. <milestone n="1033b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>E.g., we make a bronze sphere; we do
					this in the sense that from A, i.e. bronze, we make B, i.e. a
					sphere.<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, we
					make the spherical form itself, clearly we shall have to make it in
					the same way; and the processes of generation will continue to
					infinity.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is therefore obvious
					that the form (or whatever we should call the shape in the sensible
					thing) is not generated&mdash;generation does not apply to
					it&mdash; nor is the essence generated; for this is that which is
					induced in something else either by art or by nature or by
					potency.<milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But we do
					cause a bronze sphere to be, for we produce it from bronze and a
					sphere; we induce the form into this particular matter, and the result
					is a bronze sphere. But if the essence of sphere in general is
					generated, something must be generated from something; for that which
					is generated will always have to be divisible, and be partly one thing
					and partly another; I mean partly matter and partly form.<milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If then a sphere is the figure
					whose circumference is everywhere equidistant from the center, part of
					this will be the medium in which that which we produce will be
					contained, and part will be in that medium; and the whole will be the
					thing generated, as in the case of the bronze sphere. It is obvious,
					then, from what we have said, that the thing in the sense of form or
					essence is not generated, whereas the concrete whole which is called
					after it is generated; and that in everything that is generated matter
					is present, and one part is matter and the other form.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Is there then some
					sphere besides the particular spheres, or some house besides the
					bricks? Surely no individual thing would ever have been generated if
					form had existed thus independently.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">If forms are self-subsistent substances,
						individual substances cannot be generated from them; for the

					of the Forms (in the sense in which some speak of them, assuming that
					there are certain entities besides particulars), in respect at least
					of generation and destruction, is useless; nor, for this reason at any
					rate, should they be regarded as self-subsistent substances.<milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed in some cases it is even
					obvious that that which generates is of the same kind as that which is
					generated&mdash;not however identical with it, nor numerically one
					with it, but formally one&mdash;e.g. in natural productions (for
					man begets man), unless something happens contrary to nature, as when
					a horse sires a mule. And even these cases are similar; for that which
					would be common to both horse and ass, the genus immediately above
					them, has no name; but it would probably be both, just as the mule is
					both.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Normally the sire
						communicates his form to the offspring. In the case of a mule,
						the material element contributed by the dam, which is an ass,
						limits the effect of the formal element contributed bu the sire,

					<milestone n="1034a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus obviously there is no need to set
					up a form as a pattern (for we should have looked for Forms in these
					cases especially, since living things are in a special sense
					substances); the thing which generates is sufficient to produce, and
					to be the cause of the form in the matter. The completed whole,
					such-and-such a form induced in this flesh and these bones, is Callias
					or Socrates. And it is
					different from that which generated it, because the matter is
					different but identical in form, because the form is
					indivisible.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The question might be raised why some
					things are generated both artificially and
					spontaneously&mdash;e.g. health&mdash;and others not; e.g. a
					house. The reason is that in some cases the matter&mdash;which is
					the starting-point of the process in the production and generation of
					artificial things, and in which some part of the result is already
					existent&mdash;is such that it can initiate its own motion, and in
					other cases it is not; and of the former kind some can initiate motion
					in a particular way, and some cannot. For many things can move
					themselves, but not in a particular way, e.g. so as to
					dance.<milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is
					impossible, then, for any things whose matter is of this kind (e.g.
					stones) to be moved in <emph>this</emph> particular way except by
					something else; but in <emph>that</emph> particular way it is
					possible. And it is so with fire.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Stones can fall by themselves, but cannot by
						themselves build a house; fire can rise by itself, but cannot
						boil a kettle.</note> For this reason some things cannot exist
					apart from the possessor of the art, and others can;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because the motion can be initiated by
					those things which do not indeed possess the art, but can themselves
					be moved either by other things which do not possess the art, or by
					the motion from the part of the product which pre-exists in them.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">e.g., health can be produced as
						the result of the activity set up by heat in the
						body.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear also from what we have said
					that in a sense all artificial things are generated either from
					something which bears the same name (as is the case with natural
					objects) or from a part of themselves which bears the same name as
					themselves (e.g. a house from a house, inasmuch as it is generated by
					mind; for the art is the form), or from something which contains some
					part; that is if the generation is not accidental; for the direct and
					independent cause of the production is a part of the
					product.<milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Heat in the
					motion produces heat in the body; and either this is health or a part
					of health, or a part of health or health accompanies it. And this is
					why heat is said to produce health, because it produces that of which
					health is a concomitant and consequence. Therefore as essence is the
					starting-point of everything in syllogisms (because syllogisms start
					from the "what" of a thing), so too generation proceeds from
					it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And it is the same with natural formations as
					it is with the products of art. For the seed produces just as do those
					things which function by art. It contains the form potentially,
					<milestone n="1034b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and that from which the seed comes has
					in some sense the same name as the product (for we must not expect
					that all should have the same name in the sense that "man" is produced
					by "man"&mdash;since woman is also produced by man); unless the
					product is a freak. This is why a mule is not produced by a
					mule.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those natural objects which are produced, like
					artificial objects, spontaneously, are those whose matter can also
					initiate for itself that motion which the seed initiates. Those whose
					matter cannot do this cannot be generated otherwise than by their
					proper parents.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is not only with
					reference to substance that our argument shows that the form is not
					generated; the same argument is common in its application to all the
					primary divisions, i.e. quantity, quality and the other
					categories.<milestone n="9.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For just
					as the bronze sphere is generated, but not the sphere nor the bronze;
					and as in the case of bronze, if it is generated the form and matter
					are not (because they must always pre-exist), so it is too with the
					"what" and the quality and quantity and the other categories
					similarly; for it is not the quality that is generated, but the wood
					of that quality; nor is it the size, but the wood or animal of that
					size.<milestone n="9.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But a
					peculiarity of substance may be gathered from this: that some other
					substance must pre-exist in actuality which produces it; e.g. an
					animal, if an animal is being generated; but a quality or quantity
					need not pre-exist otherwise than potentially.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since a

						of the consideration of essence as definition.</note> now
					arises: Must the formula of the parts be contained in the formula of
					the whole, or not? It seems clear that it is so in some cases, but not
					in others.<milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The formula of
					the circle does not include that of the segments, but the formula of
					the syllable includes that of the letters. And yet the circle is
					divisible into its segments in just the same way as the syllable into
					its letters.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, if the parts are
					prior to the whole, and the acute angle is part of the right angle,
					and the finger part of the animal, the acute angle will be prior to
					the right angle, and the finger to the man.<milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is considered that the latter are
					prior; for in the formula the parts are explained from them; and the
					wholes are prior also in virtue of their ability to exist
					independently. The truth probably is that "part" has several meanings,
					one of which is "that which measures in respect of quantity." However,
					let us dismiss this question and consider of what, in the sense of
					parts, substance consists. <milestone n="1035a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If
					then matter, form, and the combination of the two are distinct, and if
					both matter and form and their combination are substance, there is one
					sense in which even matter may be called "part" of a thing; and
					another in which it is not, but the only parts are those elements of
					which the formula of the form consists. E.g., flesh is not a part of
					concavity, because flesh is the matter in which concavity is induced;
					but it is a part of snubness. And bronze is part of the statue as a
					concrete whole, but not of the statue in the sense of form.<milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We may speak of the form (or
					the thing as having a form) as an individual thing, but we may never
					so speak of that which is material by itself. This is why the formula
					of the circle does not contain that of the segments, whereas the
					formula of the syllable does contain that of the letters; for the
					letters are parts of the formula of the form; they are not matter; but
					the segments are parts in the sense of matter in which the form is
					induced. They approximate, however, more closely to the form than does
					the bronze when roundness is engendered in bronze.<milestone n="10.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is a sense in which not even
					all the letters will be contained in the formula of the syllable; e.g.
					particular letters on wax<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.

					resolved into bones and muscles and flesh,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it does not follow that they are
					composed of these as parts of their essence, but as their matter; and
					these are parts of the concrete whole, but not of the form, or that to
					which the formula refers. Hence they are not in the
					formulae.<milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Accordingly in some cases the formula will include the formula of
					such parts as the above, but in others it need not necessarily contain
					their formula, unless it is the formula of the concrete object. It is
					for this reason that some things are composed of parts in the sense of
					principles into which they can be resolved, while others are
					not.<milestone n="10.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All things
					which are concrete combinations of form and matter (e.g. "the snub" or
					the bronze circle) can be resolved into form and matter, and the
					matter is a part of them; but such as are not concrete combinations
					with matter, but are without matter&mdash;whose formulae refer to
					the form only&mdash;cannot be resolved; either not at all, or at
					least not in this way.<milestone n="10.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus these material components are principles and parts of the
					concrete objects, but they are neither parts nor principles of the
					form. For this reason the clay statue can be resolved into clay, and
					the sphere into bronze, and Callias into flesh and bones, and the
					circle too into segments, because it is something which is combined
					with matter. <milestone n="1035b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For we use the same name for the
					absolute circle and for the particular circle, since there is no
					special name for the particular circles.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have now
					stated the truth; nevertheless let us recapitulate and state it more
					clearly. All constituents which are parts of the formula, and into
					which the formula can be divided, are prior to their
					wholes&mdash;either all or some of them. But the formula of the
					right angle is not divisible into the formula of an acute angle, but
					vice versa; since in defining the acute angle we use the right angle,
					because "the acute angle is less than a right angle."<milestone n="10.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is the same with the
					circle and the semicircle; for the semicircle is defined by means of
					the circle. And the finger is defined by means of the whole body; for
					a finger is a particular kind of part of a man. Thus such parts as are
					material, and into which the whole is resolved as into matter, are
					posterior to the whole; but such as are parts in the sense of parts of
					the formula and of the essence as expressed in the formula, are prior;
					either all or some of them.<milestone n="10.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since the soul of animals (which is the
					substance of the living creature) is their substance in accordance
					with the formula, and the form and essence of that particular kind of
					body (at least each part, if it is to be properly defined, will not be
					defined apart from its function; and this will not belong to it apart
					from perception<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Which implies
						soul.</note>); therefore the parts of the soul are prior, either
					all or some of them, to the concrete animal; and similarly in other
					individual cases.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the body and its parts
					are posterior to this substance, and it is not the substance, but the
					concrete whole, which is resolved into these parts as into matter.
					Therefore in one sense these parts are prior to the concrete whole,
					and in another not; for they cannot exist in separation. A finger
					cannot in every state be a part of a living animal; for the dead
					finger has only the name in common with the living one.<milestone n="10.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Some parts are contemporary
					with the whole: such as are indispensable and in which the formula and
					the essence are primarily present; e.g. the heart or perhaps the
					brain,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1012b">Aristot. Met. 5.1.1</bibl>.</note> for it does not matter
					which of them is of this nature. But "man" and "horse" and terms which
					are applied in this way to individuals, but universally, are not
					substance, but a kind of concrete whole composed of <emph>this</emph>
					particular formula and <emph>this</emph> particular matter regarded as
					universal. But individually
					Socrates is already composed of ultimate matter; and
					similarly in all other cases.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A part, then, may be part of
					the form (by form I mean essence), or of the concrete whole composed
					of form and matter, or of the matter itself. But only the parts of the
					form are parts of the formula, and the formula refers to the
					universal; <milestone n="1036a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for "circle" is the same as "essence of
					circle," and "soul" the same as "essence of soul."<milestone n="10.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But when we come to the concrete thing,
					e.g. this circle&mdash;which is a particular individual, either
					sensible or intelligible (by intelligible circles I mean those of
					mathematics,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.,
						something very similar to the Platonic "intermediates." Cf.
						Introduction.</note> and by sensible those which are of bronze
					or wood)&mdash;of these individuals there is no
					definition;<milestone n="10.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>we
					apprehend them by intelligence or perception; and when they have
					passed from the sphere of actuality it is uncertain whether they exist
					or not, but they are always spoken of and apprehended by the universal
					formula. But the matter is in itself unknowable. Some matter is
					sensible and some intelligible; sensible, such as bronze and wood and
					all movable matter; intelligible, that which is present in sensible
					things not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> sensible, e.g. the objects of
					mathematics.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 13.1076a">Aristot. Met. 13.2, 3</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We have now discussed the case of the whole and part, and of prior
					and posterior. But we must answer the question, when we are asked
					which is prior&mdash;the right angle and circle and animal, or
					that into which they are resolved and of which they are composed, i.e.
					their parts&mdash;by saying that neither is
					<emph>absolutely</emph> prior.<milestone n="10.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if the soul also <emph>is</emph> the
					animal or living thing, or the soul of the individual <emph>is</emph>
					the individual, and "being a circle" <emph>is</emph> the circle, and
					"being a right angle" or the essence of the right angle
					<emph>is</emph> the right angle, then we must admit that the whole in
					one sense is posterior to the part in one sense:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g. to the parts in the formula and
					the parts of a particular right angle<milestone n="10.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(since both the material right angle of bronze
					and the right angle included by individual lines are posterior to
					their parts), but the immaterial angle is posterior to the parts in
					the formula, but prior to the parts in the individual. We must not
					give an unqualified answer. And if the soul is not the animal but
					something else, even so we must say that some wholes are prior and
					some are not, as has been stated.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The question
					naturally presents itself, what sort of parts belong to the form and
					what sort belong not to it but to the concrete object. Yet if this is
					not plain it is impossible to define the particular; because the
					definition refers to the universal and the form. Therefore if it is
					not clear what kind of parts are material and what kind are not, the
					formula of the thing will not be clear either.<milestone n="11.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In the case of things which can be seen
					to be induced in specifically different materials, as, e.g., a circle
					is in bronze and stone and wood, it seems clear that these things, the
					bronze and the stone, are in no sense part of the essential substance
					of the circle, because it is separable from them.<milestone n="11.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>As for things which are not visibly
					separable, there is no reason why the same should not apply to them;
					e.g., if all the circles that had ever been seen were bronze;
					<milestone n="1036b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for the bronze would be none the less
					no part of the form, but it is difficult to separate it in
					thought.<milestone n="11.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					example, the form of "man" is always manifested in flesh and bones and
					elements of this kind; then are these actually parts of the form and
					formula, or are they not so, but matter, though since the form is not
					induced in other materials, we cannot separate it?<milestone n="11.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now since this seems to be possible,
					but it is not clear <emph>when</emph>, some thinkers<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Pythagoreans.</note> are
					doubtful even in the case of the circle and the triangle, considering
					that it is not proper to define them by lines and continuous space,
					but that all these are to the circle or triangle as flesh or bone is
					to man, and bronze or stone to the statue; and they reduce everything
					to numbers, and say that the formula of "line" is the formula of
					2.<milestone n="11.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And of the
					exponents of the Forms, some make 2 the Ideal line, and some the form
					of the line<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The distinction
						seems to be that given in <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        8.1043a">Aristot. Met.

						simply "twoness"; others that it is "twoness in length."</note>;
					for they say that in some cases the form and that of which it is the
					form, e.g. 2 and the form of 2, are the same; but in the case of
					"line" this is no longer so.<milestone n="11.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It follows, then, that there is one form of
					many things whose form is clearly different (a consequence which
					confronted the Pythagoreans too<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 1.987a">Aristot. Met. 1.5.17</bibl>.</note>), and that
					it is possible to make one supreme Form of everything, and not to

					this way, however, all things would be one.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now we
					have stated that the question of definitions involves some difficulty,
					and have shown why this is so. Hence to reduce everything in this way
					and to dispose of the matter is going too far; for some things are
					presumably a particular form in particular matter, or particular
					things in a particular state.<milestone n="11.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the analogy in the case of the living
					thing which the younger
					Socrates<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">A
						"disciple" of the great
						Socrates; one of the speakers in the Politicus<bibl n="Plat. Stat. 1">Plat. Stat.</bibl> and referred to in <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 147c">Plat. Theaet. 147c</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 218b">Plat. Soph.

					leads one away from the truth, and makes one suppose that it is
					possible for a man to exist without his parts, as a circle does
					without the bronze. But the case is not similar; for the animal is
					sensible and cannot be defined without motion, and hence not unless
					its parts are in some definite condition;<milestone n="11.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is not the hand in <emph>any</emph>
					condition that is a part of a man, but only when it can perform its
					function, and so has life in it. Without life in it it is not a
					part.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And with respect to
					mathematical objects, why are the formulae of the parts not parts of
					the formulae of the whole; e.g., why are the formulae of the
					semicircles not parts of the formula of the circle? for they are not
					sensible.<milestone n="11.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Probably
					this makes no difference; because there will be matter even of some
					things which are not sensible. <milestone n="1037a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Indeed there will be
					matter in some sense in everything which is not essence or form
					considered independently, but a particular thing. Thus the semicircles

					some matter is sensible, and some intelligible.<milestone n="11.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear also that the soul is the
					primary substance, and the body matter; and "man" or "animal" is the
					combination of both taken universally. And "
					Socrates" or "Coriscus" has a
					double sense, that is if the soul too can be called
					Socrates (for by
					Socrates some mean the soul and
					some the concrete person); but if
					Socrates means simply <emph>this</emph> soul and
					<emph>this</emph> body, the individual is composed similarly to
					the universal.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Whether there is some other material
					component of these substances besides their matter, and whether we
					should look for some further substance in them, such as numbers or
					something of that kind, must be considered later.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In Books 13 and 14.</note> It
					is with a view to this that we are trying to determine the nature of
					sensible substances, since in a sense the study of sensible substances
					belongs to physics or secondary philosophy; for the physicist must
					know not only about the matter, but also about the substance according
					to the formula; this is even more essential.<milestone n="11.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in the case of definitions, in what
					sense the elements in the formula are parts of the definition, and why
					the definition is one formula (for the thing is clearly one,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but in virtue of what is it one,
					seeing that it has parts?); this must be considered later.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1045a">Aristot. Met. 8.6</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="11.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We
					have stated, then, in a general account which covers all cases, what
					essence is, and how it is independent; and why the formula of the
					essence of some things contains the parts of the thing defined, while
					that of others does not; and we have shown that the material parts of
					a thing cannot be present in the formula of the substance (since they
					are not even parts of the substance in that sense, but of the concrete
					substance; and of this in one sense there is a formula, and in another
					sense there is not.<milestone n="11.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There
					is no formula involving the matter, for this is indeterminate; but
					there is a formula in accordance with the primary substance, e.g., in
					the case of a man, the formula of the soul; because the substance is
					the indwelling form, of which and of the matter the so called concrete
					substance is composed. E.g., concavity is such a form, since from this
					and "nose" is derived "snub nose" and "snubness"&mdash;for "nose"
					will be present twice over in these expressions);<milestone n="11.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in the concrete substance, e.g.

					primary.<milestone n="11.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By primary
					I mean that which does not imply the presence of something in
					something else as a material substrate. But such things as are

					Socrates and "cultured"; for these
					are only accidentally the same.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now let us first
					deal with definition, in so far as it has not been dealt with in the
					<title>Analytics</title>; for the problem stated there<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. APo. 92a.29">Aristot. An.
						Post. 92a 29</bibl>.</note> has a bearing upon our
					discussion of substance. The problem I mean is this: what constitutes
					the unity of the thing of which we say that the formula is a
					definition? E.g., in the case of man, "two-footed animal"; for let us
					take this as the formula of "man."<milestone n="12.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Why, then, is this a unity and not a
					plurality, "animal" and "two-footed"? For in the case of "man" and
					"white" we have a plurality when the latter does not refer to the
					former, but a unity when it does refer to it, and the subject, "man,"
					has an attribute; for then they become a unity and we have "the white
					man."<milestone n="12.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But in the
					case before us one term does not partake of the other; the genus is
					not considered to partake of its differentiae, for then the same thing
					would be partaking simultaneously of contraries,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>since the differentiae by which the
					genus is distinguished are contrary. And even if it does partake of
					them, the same argument applies, since the differentiae are many; e.g.
					terrestrial, two-footed, wingless.<milestone n="12.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Why is it that these are a unity and not a
					plurality? Not because they are present in one genus, for in that case
					all the differentiae of the genus will form a unity. But all the
					elements in the definition must form a unity, because the definition
					is a kind of formula which is one and defines substance, so that it
					must be a formula of one particular thing; because the substance
					denotes one thing and an individual, as we say.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We must first<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The other type of definition, that which states the constituent
						parts of a thing, is not discussed here.</note> examine
					definitions which are reached by the process of division.<milestone n="12.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For there is nothing else in
					the definition but the primary genus and the differentiae; the other
					genera consist of the primary genus together with the differentiae
					which are taken with it. E.g., the primary genus is "animal"; the next
					below it, "two-footed animal"; and again, "two-footed wingless
					animal"; and similarly also if the expression contains more terms
					still. <milestone n="1038a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="12.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In general it does not matter whether it
					contains many or few terms, nor, therefore, whether it contains few or
					two. Of the two one is differentia and the other genus; e.g., in
					"two-footed animal" "animal" is genus, and the other term
					differentia.<milestone n="12.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If,
					then, the genus absolutely does not exist apart from the species which
					it includes, or if it exists, but only as matter (for speech is genus
					and matter, and the differentiae make the species, i.e. the letters,
					out of it), obviously the definition is the formula composed of the
					differentiae.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But further we must also divide by the
					differentia of the differentia. E.g., "having feet" is a differentia
					of "animal"; then in turn we must discover the differentia of "animal
					having feet" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> "having feet." Accordingly we
					should not say that of "that which has feet" one kind is winged and
					another wingless, (that is if we are to speak correctly; if we say
					this it will be through incapability), but only that one kind is
					cloven-footed and another not; because these are differentiae of
					"foot," since cloven-footedness is a kind of footedness.<milestone n="12.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And thus we tend always to
					progress until we come to the species which contain no differentiae.
					At this point there will be just as many species of foot as there are
					differentiae, and the kinds of animals having feet will be equal in
					number to the differentiae. Then, if this is so, <milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>obviously the ultimate differentia will
					be the substance and definition of the thing, since we need not state
					the same things more than once in definitions, because this is
					superfluous.<milestone n="12.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>However, it does happen; for when we say "footed two-footed animal"
					we have simply said "animal having feet, having two feet." And if we
					divide this by its proper division, we shall be stating the same thing
					several times, as many times as there are differentiae.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, we keep on taking a differentia of a differentia, one of
					them, the last, will be the form and the substance. But if we proceed
					with reference to accidental qualities&mdash;e.g. if we divide
					"that which has feet" into white and black&mdash;there will be as
					many differentiae as there are divisions. It is therefore obvious that
					the definition is the formula derived from the differentiae, and
					strictly speaking from the last of them.<milestone n="12.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This will be clear if we change the order of
					such definitions, e.g. that of man, saying "two-footed footed animal";
					for "footed" is superfluous when we have already said "two-footed."
					But there is no question of order in the substance; for how are we to
					think of one part as posterior and the other prior?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>With regard, then, to definitions by division, let
					this suffice as a preliminary statement of their nature. <milestone n="1038b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since the subject of our inquiry is
					substance, let us return to it. Just as the substrate and the essence
					and the combination of these are called substance, so too is the
					universal. With two of these we have already dealt, i.e. with the
					essence<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Chs.
						4-5.,10-12.</note> and the substrate<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Ch. 3.</note>; of the latter we have said that it
					underlies in two senses&mdash;either being an individual thing (as
					the animal underlies its attributes), or as matter underlies the
					actuality.<milestone n="13.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					universal also is thought by some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The Platonists.</note> to be in the truest sense
					a cause and a principle. Let us therefore proceed to discuss this
					question too; for it seems impossible that any universal term can be
					substance.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>First, the substance of
					an individual is the substance which is peculiar to it and belongs to
					nothing else; whereas the universal is common; for by universal we
					mean that which by nature appertains to several things.<milestone n="13.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Of what particular, then, will
					the universal be the substance? Either of all or of none. But it
					cannot be the substance of all; while, if it is to be the substance of
					one, the rest also will be that one; because things whose substance is
					one have also one essence and are themselves one.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, substance means that which is not predicated
					of a subject, whereas the universal is always predicated of some
					subject.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But perhaps although the
					universal cannot be substance in the sense that essence is, it can be
					present in the essence, as "animal" can be present in "man" and
					"horse."<milestone n="13.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Then
					clearly there is in some sense a formula of the universal. It makes no
					difference<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>even if
					there is not a formula of everything that is in the substance; for the
					universal will be none the less the substance of something; e.g.,
					"man" will be the substance of the man in whom it is present. Thus the
					same thing will happen again<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the argument in ch. 3 will apply to this case
						also.</note>; e.g. "animal" will be the substance of that in which it
					is present as peculiar to it.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, it is impossible and
					absurd that the individual or substance, if it is composed of
					anything, should be composed not of substances nor of the individual,
					but of a quality; for then non-substance or quality will be prior to
					substance or the individual. Which is impossible; for neither in
					formula nor in time nor in generation can the affections of substance
					be prior to the substance, since then they would be
					separable.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, a substance will be present in
					"Socrates," who is a
					substance; so that it will be the substance of two things. And in
					general it follows that if "man" and all terms used in this way are
					substance, none of the elements in the formula is the substance of
					anything, nor can it exist apart from the species or in anything else;
					I mean, e.g., that neither "animal" nor any other element of the
					formula can exist apart from the particular species.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If we
					look at the question from this standpoint it is obvious that no
					universal attribute is substance; and it is also clear from the fact
					that none of the common predicates means "so-and-so," <milestone n="1039a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but "such and-such." Otherwise amongst many other
					awkward consequences we have the "third man."<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See note on <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        1.990b">Aristot. Met.
						1.9.3</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="13.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, it is clear in this way
					too. Substance can not consist of substances actually present in it;
					for that which is actually two can never be actually one, whereas if
					it is potentially two it can be one. E.g., the double consists of two
					halves&mdash;that is, potentially; for the actualization separates
					the halves.<milestone n="13.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus if
					substance is one, it cannot consist of substances present in it even
					in this sense, as Democritus rightly observes; he says that it is
					impossible for two to come from one, or one from two, because he

					If, then, there is in some sense an Absolute Man, who is an individual

					belong to it although it is one and individual.<milestone n="14.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if it does not, in what sense is it

					Absolute Animal will be a plurality. For (a) the "animal" in each
					species will be the substance of that species, since the species is
					called after it and no other thing. Otherwise "man" would be derived
					from that other thing, which would be the genus of "man." (b) Further,

					be upset; because it is impossible to define these things.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="15.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor, indeed, can any Idea be defined; for the Idea is an individual,
					as they say, and separable; and the formula must consist of words, and
					the man who is defining must not coin a word, because it would not be
					comprehensible. But the words which are in use are common to all the
					things which they denote; and so they must necessarily apply to
					something else as well. E.g., if a man were to define you, he would
					say that you are an animal which is lean or white or has some other
					attribute, which will apply to something else as well.<milestone n="15.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if it should be said that
					there is no reason why all the attributes separately should not belong
					to several things, and yet in combination belong to this alone, we
					must reply, (1.) that they also belong to both the elements; e.g.,
					"two-footed animal" belongs both to "animal" and to "two-footed" (and
					in the case of eternal elements this is even necessarily so; since
					they are prior to the compound, and parts of it.<milestone n="15.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed they are also separable, if the
					term "man" is separable&mdash;for either neither can be separable,
					or both are so.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>If neither,
					the genus will not exist apart from the species, or if it is so to

					if the Ideas are composed of Ideas (for constituents are less
					composite than that which they compose), still the elements of which
					the Idea is composed (e.g. "animal" and "two-footed") will have to be
					predicated of many particulars. Otherwise, how can they be known? For
					there would be an Idea which cannot be predicated of more than one

					earth, fire and air; for none of these is one <emph>thing</emph>
					&mdash;they are a mere aggregate before they are digested and some
					one thing is generated from them.<milestone n="16.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It might be supposed very reasonably that the
					parts of living things and the corresponding parts of their vital
					principle are both, i.e. exist both actually and potentially, because

					divided. Nevertheless it is only potentially that all of them will
					exist when they are one and continuous by nature and not by force or
					concretion; for this sort of thing is malformation.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., it is only when they do
						not properly constitute a unity that parts can be said to exist

					variety of senses as "being," and the substance of Unity is one, and

					evidently neither Unity nor Being can be the substance of things, just
					as neither "being an element" or "principle" can be the
					substance;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but we ask
					what the principle is so that we may refer to something more
					intelligible.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., a

					and Unity are more nearly substance than are principle, element and

					substance.<milestone n="16.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again,
					Unity cannot exist in many places at the same time, but that which is
					common is present in many things at the same time. Hence it is clear
					that no universal exists in separation apart from its particulars. The
					exponents of the Forms are partly right in their account when they
					make the Forms separate; that is, if the Forms are substances, but
					they are also partly wrong, since by "Form" they mean the

					we had better pursue our inquiry from this point.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now when we ask why a thing is, it is always in the

					is to ask either, as we have said, why the man is cultured, or

					because when we ask the reason of a thing the fact must first be
					evident; e.g., that the moon suffers eclipse;<milestone n="17.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and "because it is itself" is the one
					explanation and reason which applies to all questions such as "why is
					man man?" or "why is the cultured person cultured?" (unless one were
					to say that each thing is indivisible from itself, and that this is
					what "being one" really means);<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but this, besides being a general answer, is a
					summary one.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The argument is:
						The question "Why is the cultured man a cultured man?" if it

						itself, "because it is itself" (or "because each thing is

					an animal of such-and-such a kind.<milestone n="17.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is clear, then, that we are not asking why
					he who is a man is a man; therefore we are asking why A, which is

					be evident, for if this is not so, the question is pointless.) E.g.,
					"Why does it thunder?" means "why is a noise produced in the clouds?"
					for the true form of the question is one thing predicated in this way
					of another.<milestone n="17.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or again, "why
					are these things, e.g. bricks and stones, a house?" Clearly then we
					are inquiring for the cause (i.e., to speak abstractly, the essence);
					which is in the case of some things, e.g. house or bed, the
					<emph>end</emph> , and in others the prime mover&mdash;for this

					expression is a simple one not analyzed into subject and attributes.
					We must make the question articulate before we ask it; otherwise we
					get something which shares the nature of a pointless and of a definite
					question.<milestone n="17.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now since
					we must know that the fact actually exists, it is surely clear that
					the question is "why is the <emph>matter</emph> so-and-so?" e.g. "why
					are these materials a house?" Because the essence of house is present
					in them. And this matter, or the body containing this particular form,

					an element or composed of elements,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(a) if it is an element, the same argument applies
					again; for flesh will be composed of <emph>this</emph> and fire and

					the actual substance of sensible things. Now Democritus<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        1.985b">Aristot. Met.
						1.4.11</bibl>.</note> apparently assumes three differences
					in substance; for he says that the underlying body is one and the same
					in material, but differs in figure, i.e. shape; or inclination, i.e.
					position; or intercontact, i.e. arrangement.<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But evidently there are many differences; e.g.
					some things are defined by the way in which their materials are
					combined, as, for example, things which are unified by mixture, as
					honey-water; or by ligature, as a faggot; or by glue, as a book; or by
					clamping, as a chest; or by more than one of these methods. Other
					things are defined by their position, e.g. threshold and lintel (for
					these differ in being situated in a particular way);<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and others by place &lt;or
					direction&gt;, e.g. the winds; others by time, e.g. dinner and
					breakfast; and others by the attributes peculiar to sensible things,
					e.g. hardness and softness, density and rarity, dryness and humidity.
					Some are distinguished by some of these differences, and others by all
					of them; and in general some by excess and some by defect.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence it is clear that "is" has the same number of senses; for a
					thing "is" a threshold because it is situated in a particular way, and
					"to be a threshold" means to be situated in this particular way, and
					"to be ice" means to be condensed in this particular way. Some things
					have their being defined in all these ways: by being partly mixed,
					partly blended, partly bound, partly condensed, and partly subjected
					to all the other different processes; as, for example, a hand or a
					foot.<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must
					therefore comprehend the various kinds of differences&mdash;for
					these will be principles of being&mdash;i.e. the differences in
					degree, or in density and rarity, and in other such modifications, for
					they are all instances of excess and defect.<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And if anything differs in shape or in
					smoothness or roughness, all these are differences in straightness and
					curvature. For some things mixture will constitute being, <milestone n="1043a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the opposite state not-being.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From this it is evident that if substance is the
					cause of the existence of each thing, we must look among these
					"differences" for the cause of the being of each thing.<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>No one of them, nor the
					combination of any two of them, is substance, but nevertheless each
					one of them contains something analogous to substance. And just as in
					the case of substances that which is predicated of the matter is the
					actuality itself, so in the other kinds of definition it is the
					nearest approximation to actuality. E.g., if we have to define a
					threshold, we shall call it "a piece of wood or stone placed in
					such-and-such a way"; and we should define a house as "bricks and
					timber arranged in such-and-such a way";<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>or again in some cases there is the final
					cause as well. And if we are defining ice, we shall describe it as
					"water congealed or condensed in such-and-such a way"; and a harmony
					is "such-and-such a combination of high and low"; and similarly in the
					other cases.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From this it is evident
					that the actuality or formula is different in the case of different
					matter; for in some cases it is a combination, in others a mixture,
					and in others some other of the modes which we have
					described.<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence in
					defining the nature of a house, those who describe it as stones,
					bricks and wood, describe the potential house, since these things are
					its matter; those who describe it as "a receptacle for containing
					goods and bodies," or something else to the same effect, describe its
					actuality; but those who combine these two definitions describe the
					third kind of substance, that which is composed of matter and
					form.<milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it would
					seem that the formula which involves the differentiae is that of the
					form and the actuality,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>while that which involves the constituent parts is rather that of
					the matter. The same is true of the kind of definitions which
					Archytas<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">A celebrated
						Pythagorean, contemporary with Plato.</note> used to accept; for
					they are definitions of the combined matter and form. E.g., what is
					"windlessness?" Stillness in a large extent of air; for the air is the
					matter, and the stillness is the actuality and substance.<milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What is a calm? Levelness of
					sea. The sea is the material substrate, and the levelness is the
					actuality or form.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From the foregoing
					account it is clear what sensible substance is, and in what sense it
					exists; either as matter, or as form and actuality, or thirdly as the
					combination of the two.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>We must not fail to realize
					that sometimes it is doubtful whether a name denotes the composite
					substance or the actuality and the form&mdash;e.g. whether "house"
					denotes the composite thing, "a covering made of bricks and stones
					arranged in such-and-such a way," or the actuality and form, "a
					covering"; and whether "line" means "duality in length" or
					"duality"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1036b">Aristot. Met. 7.11.6</bibl>.</note>; and whether "animal"
					means "a soul in a body" or "a soul"; for the soul is the substance
					and actuality of some body.<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The term "animal" would be applicable to both cases; not as being
					defined by one formula, but as relating to one concept. These
					distinctions are of importance from another point of view, but
					unimportant for the investigation of sensible substance; <milestone n="1043b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because the essence belongs to the form and the
					actualization.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Soul
					and essence of soul are the same, but man and essence of man are not,
					unless the soul is also to be called man; and although this is so in
					one sense, it is not so in another.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It
					appears, then, upon inquiry into the matter,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 204a">Plat. Theaet.
						204aff.</bibl></note> that a syllable is not derived from the phonetic
					elements plus combination, nor is a house bricks plus combination. And
					this is true; for the combination or mixture is not derived from the
					things of which it is a combination or mixture,<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>nor, similarly, is any other of the
					"differences." E.g., if the threshold is defined by its position, the
					position is not derived from the threshold, but rather vice versa.
					Nor, indeed, is man "animal" <emph>plus</emph> "two-footed"; there
					must be something which exists besides these, if they are matter; but
					it is neither an element nor derived from an element, but the
					substance; and those who offer the definition given above are omitting
					this and describing the matter.<milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, this something else is the cause of
					a man's being, and this is his substance, they will not be stating his
					actual substance.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now the substance must
					be either eternal or perishable without ever being in process of
					perishing, and generated without ever being in process of generation.
					It has been clearly demonstrated elsewhere<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1033a">Aristot. Met.
						7.8</bibl>.</note> that no one generates or creates the form; it
					is the individual thing that is created, and the compound that is
					generated.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					whether the substances of perishable things are separable or not is
					not yet at all clear<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1042a">Aristot. Met. 8.1.6. n.</bibl>.</note>; only
					it is clear that this is impossible in some cases,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>i.e. in the case of all things which
					cannot exist apart from the particular instances; e.g. house or
					implement.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1033b">Aristot. Met. 7.8.6</bibl>.</note> Probably, then,
					neither these things themselves, nor anything else which is not
					naturally composed, are substances; for their nature is the only
					substance which one can assume in the case of perishable
					things.<milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the
					difficulty which perplexed the followers of Antisthenes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        5.1024b">Aristot. Met.
						5.29.4</bibl>.</note> and others similarly unlearned has a
					certain application; I mean the difficulty that it is impossible to
					define <emph>what</emph> a thing is (for the definition, they say, is
					a lengthy formula), but it <emph>is</emph> possible actually to teach
					others what a thing <emph>is like</emph>; e.g., we cannot say
					<emph>what</emph> silver is, but we can say that it is like
					tin.<milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence there can
					be definition and formula of one kind of substance, i.e. the
					composite, whether it is sensible or intelligible; but not of its
					primary constituents, since the defining formula denotes something
					predicated of something, and this must be partly of the nature of
					matter and partly of the nature of form.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is also obvious
					that, if numbers are in any sense substances, they are such in this
					sense, and not, as some<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle is referring to the Pythagoreans and Platonists, but
						seems as usual to misrepresent their views. His object in this
						section is to show that the relation of number to substance is
						only one of analogy. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 13.1080a">Aristot. Met. 13.6,
							7</bibl>, and see Introduction.</note> describe them, aggregates
					of units. For (a) the definition is a kind of number, since it is
					divisible, and divisible into indivisible parts (for formulae are not
					infinite); and number is of this nature.<milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And (b) just as when any element which
					composes the number is subtracted or added, it is no longer the same
					number but a different one, however small the subtraction or addition
					is; <milestone n="1044a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so neither the definition nor the essence will
					continue to exist if something is subtracted from or added to it. And
					(c) a number must be something in virtue of which it is a unity
					(whereas our opponents cannot say what makes it one); that is, if it
					is a unity.<milestone n="3.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For either it
					is not a unity but a kind of aggregate, or if it is a unity, we must
					explain what makes a unity out of a plurality. And the definition is a
					unity; but similarly they cannot explain the definition either. This
					is a natural consequence, for the same reason applies to both, and
					substance is a unity in the way which we have explained, and not as
					some thinkers say: e.g. because it is a kind of unit or point; but
					each substance is a kind of actuality and nature.<milestone n="3.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also (d) just as a number does not
					admit of variation in degree, so neither does substance in the sense
					of form; if any substance does admit of this, it is substance in
					combination with matter.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In
						<bibl n="Aristot. Cat. 3b.33">Aristot. Categories 3b 33-4a 9</bibl>

					not fail to realize that even if all things are derived from the same
					primary cause, or from the same things as primary causes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e. from prime matter or the
						four elements.</note>; i.e. even if all things that are
					generated have the same matter for their first principle, nevertheless
					each thing has some matter peculiar to it; e.g., "the sweet" or "the
					viscous" is the proximate matter of mucus, and "the bitter" or some
					such thing is that of bile&mdash;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>although probably mucus and bile are derived from
					the same ultimate matter.<milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The result is that there is more than one matter of the same thing,
					when one thing is the matter of the other; e.g., mucus is derived from
					"the viscous"; and from "the sweet," if "the viscous" is derived from
					"the sweet"; and from bile, by the analysis of bile into its ultimate
					matter. For there are two senses in which X comes from Y; either
					because X will be found further on than Y in the process of
					development, or because X is produced when Y is analyzed into its
					original constituents.<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					different things can be generated by the moving cause when the matter
					is one and the same, e.g. a chest and a bed from wood. But some
					different things must necessarily have different matter; e.g., a saw
					cannot be generated from wood, nor does this lie in the power of the
					moving cause, for it cannot make a saw of wool or wood.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then, it is possible to make the same thing from different
					matter, clearly the art, i.e. the moving principle, is the same; for
					if both the matter and the mover are different, so too is the
					product.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So whenever we inquire
					what the cause is, since there are causes in several senses, we must
					state all the possible causes.<milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., what is the material cause of a man? The
					menses. What is the moving cause? The semen. What is the formal cause?
					The essence. What is the final cause? The end. <milestone n="1044b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(But
					perhaps both the latter are the same.) We must, however, state the
					most proximate causes. What is the matter? Not fire or earth, but the
					matter proper to man.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus as regards generable natural
					substances we must proceed in this manner, if we are to proceed
					correctly; that is, if the causes are these and of this number, and it
					is necessary to know the causes. But in the case of substances which
					though natural are eternal the principle is different. For presumably
					some of them have no matter; or no matter of this kind, but only such
					as is spatially mobile.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1042b">Aristot. Met. 8.1.8 n</bibl>.</note><milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Moreover, things which exist by
					nature but are not substances have no matter; their substrate is their
					substance. E.g., what is the cause of an eclipse; what is its matter?
					It has none; it is the moon which is affected. What is the moving
					cause which destroys the light? The earth. There is probably no final
					cause. The formal cause is the formula; but this is obscure unless it
					includes the efficient cause.<milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., what is an eclipse? A privation of
					light; and if we add "caused by the earth's intervention," this is the
					definition which includes the &lt;efficient&gt; cause. In the
					case of sleep it is not clear what it is that is proximately affected.
					Is it the animal? Yes; but in respect of what, and of what
					proximately? The heart, or some other part. Again, by what is it
					affected? Again, what is the affection which affects that part, and
					not the whole animal? A particular kind of immobility?<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Yes; but in virtue of what
					affection of the proximate subject is it this?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since

					things as, without undergoing a process of change, both are and are
					not, have no matter.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>There is a
					difficulty in the question how the matter of the individual is related
					to the contraries. E.g., if the body is potentially healthy, and the
					contrary of health is disease, is the body potentially both healthy
					and diseased? And is water potentially wine and vinegar? Probably in
					the one case it is the matter in respect of the positive state and
					form, and in the other case in respect of privation and degeneration
					which is contrary to its proper nature.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is also a
					difficulty as to why wine is not the matter of vinegar, nor
					potentially vinegar (though vinegar comes from it), and why the living

					degeneration is accidental, <milestone n="1045a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and the actual
					matter of the living body becomes by degeneration the potentiality and

					thing; and vinegar must first become water, and then wine.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>With regard to the difficulty which we have described<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1037b">Aristot. Met. 7.12</bibl>,
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 8.1043b">Aristot. Met. 8.3.10, 11</bibl>.</note> in
					connection with definitions and numbers, what is the cause of the

					parts, there is some <emph>cause</emph> ; inasmuch as even in bodies
					sometimes contact is the cause of their unity, and sometimes viscosity
					or some other such quality.<milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But a definition is <emph>one</emph> account, not by connection,
					like the <title>
						Iliad
					</title>, but because it is a definition of one thing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>What is it, then, that makes "man" one
					thing, and why does it make him one thing and not many, e.g. "animal"
					and "two-footed," especially if, as some say, there is an Idea of
					"animal" and an Idea of "two-footed"?<milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Why are not these Ideas "man," and why should
					not man exist by participation, not in any "man," but in two Ideas,
					those of "animal" and "two-footed"?<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And in general "man" will be not one, but two

					this way, as it is usual to define and explain, it will be impossible
					to answer and solve the difficulty.<milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But if, as we maintain, man is part matter and
					part form&mdash;the matter being potentially, and the form
					actually man&mdash;, the point which we are investigating will no
					longer seem to be a difficulty. For this difficulty is just the same
					as we should have if the definition of X<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Literally "cloak"; cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        7.1029b">Aristot. Met.

					apparent, because the one is matter and the other form. What then is
					it (apart from the active cause) which causes that which exists

					There <emph>is</emph> no other cause of the potential sphere's being

					matter is intelligible and some sensible, and part of the formula is

					neither "existent" nor "one" is present in their definitions. And
					their essence is ipso facto something one, just as it is something
					existent.<milestone n="6.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence also
					there is no other cause of the unity of any of these things, or of
					their existence; for each one of them is one and "existent" not

					these genera exist separately apart from their particulars, but ipso
					facto.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is because of this difficulty that some
					thinkers<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The

					what is the cause of participation, and what participation means; and
					others speak of "communion"; e.g., Lycophron<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">A sophist, disciple of Gorgias.</note> says that
					knowledge is a communion of the soul with "knowing"; and others call
					life a combination or connection of soul with body.<milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The same argument, however, applies in
					every case; for "being healthy" will be the "communion" or
					"connection" or "combination" of soul and health; and "being a bronze
					triangle" a "combination" of bronze and triangle; and "being white" a
					"combination" of surface and whiteness. The reason for this is that
					people look for a unifying formula, and a difference, between
					potentiality and actuality.<milestone n="6.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But, as we have said,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
						sects. 4, 5.</note> the proximate matter and the shape are one
					and the same; the one existing potentially, and the other
					actually.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Therefore to
					ask the cause of their unity is like asking the cause of unity in
					general; for each individual thing is one, and the potential and the
					actual are in a sense one. Thus there is no cause other than whatever
					initiates the development from potentiality to actuality. And such
					things as have no matter are all, without qualification, essential

					in one sense the potentiality for acting and being acted upon is
					one<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(for a thing is

					sense it is not; for it is partly in the patient (for it is because it
					contains a certain principle, and because even the matter is a kind of

					upon by another: oily stuff is inflammable, and stuff which yields in

					cases)&mdash;<milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and
					partly in the agent; e.g. heat and the art of building: the former in

					in so far as it is a natural unity, nothing is acted upon by itself;
					because it is one, and not a separate thing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>"Incapacity" and "the incapable" is the privation

					which would naturally possess some attribute lack it as the result of
					constraint, we say that they are "deprived."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since

					in animate things and in the soul and in the rational part of the
					soul, <milestone n="1046b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it is clear that some of the potencies
					also will be irrational and some rational. Hence all arts, i.e. the

					change in another thing, or in the artist himself <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> other.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Every rational potency admits
					equally of contrary results, but irrational potencies admit of one
					result only. E.g., heat can only produce heat, but medical science can
					produce disease and health. The reason of this is that science is a
					rational account, and the same account explains both the thing and its
					privation, though not in the same way; and in one sense it applies to
					both, and in another sense rather to the actual fact.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore such sciences must
					treat of contraries&mdash;essentially of the one, and
					non-essentially of the other; for the rational account also applies
					essentially to the one, but to the other in a kind of accidental way,
					since it is by negation and removal that it throws light on the
					contrary. For the contrary is the primary privation,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        10.1055a">Aristot. Met.
						10.4.7</bibl>.</note> and this is the removal of that to
					which it is contrary.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Literally
						"of the other," i.e. the positive term.</note><milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since contrary attributes cannot be
					induced in the same subject, and science is a potency which depends
					upon the possession of a rational formula, and the soul contains a
					principle of motion, it follows that whereas "the salutary" can only
					produce health, and "the calefactory" only heat, and "the frigorific"
					only cold,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>the scientific
					man can produce both contrary results.<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the rational account includes both, though
					not in the same way; and it is in the soul, which contains a principle
					of motion, and will therefore, by means of the same principle, set
					both processes in motion, by linking them with the same rational
					account. Hence things which have a rational potency produce results
					contrary to those of things whose potency is irrational<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The meaning of this awkward
						sentence is clearly shown in the latter part of 4.</note>; for
					the results of the former are included under one principle, the
					rational account.<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is
					evident also that whereas the power of merely producing (or suffering)
					a given effect is implied in the power of producing that effect
					<emph>well</emph> , the contrary is not always true; for that
					which produces an effect well must also produce it, but that which
					merely produces a given effect does not necessarily produce it
					well.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There are some, e.g. the Megaric school,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Founded by Euclides of

					thing only has potency when it functions, and that when it is not
					functioning it has no potency. E.g., they say that a man who is not
					building cannot build, but only the man who is building, and at the
					moment when he is building; and similarly in the other
					cases.<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is not
					difficult to see the absurd consequences of this theory. Obviously a
					man will not be a builder unless he is building, because "to be a

					the other arts.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If,

					is impossible that anything which is incapable of getting up should
					get up.<milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Since, then, we

					not walk, and that which is capable of not walking may walk.<milestone n="3.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A thing is capable of doing
					something if there is nothing impossible in its having the actuality
					of that of which it is said to have the potentiality. I mean, e.g.,
					that if a thing is capable of sitting and is not prevented from
					sitting, there is nothing impossible in its actually sitting; and
					similarly if it is capable of being moved or moving or standing or

					which it properly belongs, to other things; for it is agreed that
					actuality is properly motion.<milestone n="3.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence people do not invest non-existent things
					with motion, although they do invest them with certain other
					predicates. E.g., they say that non-existent things are conceivable
					and desirable, but not that they are in motion. This is because,
					although these things do not exist actually, they will exist actually;
					<milestone n="1047b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for some non-existent things exist
					potentially; yet they do not exist, because they do not exist in

					must be real if A is, then if it is possible for A to be real, it must
					also be possible for B to be real; for even if B is not necessarily
					possible, there is nothing to prevent its being possible. Let A, then,

					inanimate things: it follows that as for potencies of the latter kind,
					when the agent and the patient meet in accordance with the potency in
					question, the one must act and the other be acted upon; but in the
					former kind of potency this is not necessary, for whereas each single
					potency of the latter kind is productive of a single effect, those of

					even if it wishes or desires to do two things or contrary things

					clear with regard to the potential that we apply the name not only to
					that whose nature it is to move or be moved by something else, either

					induction; we need not seek a definition for every term, but must
					comprehend the analogy: that as that which is actually building is to
					that which is capable of building, <milestone n="1048b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so is that which is
					awake to that which is asleep; and that which is seeing to that which

					sometimes be truly made without qualification, since "that which is
					seen" is so called sometimes because it is seen and sometimes because
					it is capable of being seen; but the Infinite does not exist
					potentially in the sense that it will ever exist separately in

					potentially, but not separately.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For Aristotle's views about infinity and void see <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 3.4">Aristot. Physics 3.4-8, 4.6-9</bibl>

					an individual thing.<milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					the subject or substrate is distinguishable into two kinds by either
					being or not being an individual thing. Take for example as the

					too, so that the formula and knowledge of the actual must precede the
					knowledge of the potential.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In time it
					is prior in this sense: the actual is prior to the potential with
					which it is formally identical, but not to that with which it is
					identical numerically.<milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>What
					I mean is this:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>that the
					matter and the seed and the thing which is capable of seeing, which

					actually, are prior in time to the individual man and corn and seeing
					subject which already exist in actuality.<milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But prior in time to these potential entities
					are other actual entities from which the former are generated; for the
					actually existent is always generated from the potentially existent by
					something which is actually existent&mdash;e.g., man by man,
					cultured by cultured&mdash;there is always some prime mover; and
					that which initiates motion exists already in actuality.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>We have said<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1032a">Aristot. Met. 7.7, 8</bibl>.</note>
					in our discussion of substance that everything which is generated is

					identical with itself.<milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence it seems impossible that a man can be a builder if he has
					never built, or a harpist if he has never played a harp; because he
					who learns to play the harp learns by playing it, and similarly in all
					other cases.<milestone n="8.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This was the
					origin of the sophists' quibble that a man who does not know a given
					science will be doing that which is the object of that science,
					because the learner does not know the science. But since something of
					that which is being generated is already generated, and something of
					that which is being moved as a whole is already moved (this is
					demonstrated in our discussion on Motion<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 6.6">Aristot. Physics,

					possess something of the science.<milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>At any rate from this argument it is clear
					that actuality is prior to potentiality in this sense too, i.e. in
					respect of generation and time.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But it
					is also prior in substantiality; (a) because things which are
					posterior in generation are prior in form and substantiality; e.g.,
					adult is prior to child, and man to semen, because the one already
					possesses the form, but the other does not;<milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and (b) because everything which is generated
					moves towards a principle, i.e. its <emph>end</emph> . For the object
					of a thing is its principle; and generation has as its object the
					<emph>end</emph> . And the actuality is the end, and it is for
					the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired; for animals do not
					see in order that they may have sight, but have sight in order that
					they may see.<milestone n="8.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Similarly
					men possess the art of building in order that they may build, and the
					power of speculation that they may speculate; they do not speculate in
					order that they may have the power of speculation&mdash;except
					those who are learning by practice; and they do not really speculate,
					but only in a limited sense, or about a subject about which they have
					no desire to speculate.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, matter
					exists potentially, because it may attain to the form; but when it
					exists actually, it is then <emph>in</emph> the form. The same applies
					in all other cases, including those where the end is motion.<milestone n="8.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence, just as teachers think
					that they have achieved their end when they have exhibited their pupil
					performing, so it is with nature. For if this is not so,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>it will be another case of
					"Pauson's Hermes"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Probably a
						"trick" picture of some kind. So Pauson is said to have painted

					say whether the knowledge is <emph>in</emph> the pupil or outside him,
					as in the case of the Hermes. For the activity is the end, and the
					actuality is the activity; hence the term "actuality" is derived from
					"activity," and tends to have the meaning of "complete
					reality."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now whereas in some cases the ultimate
					thing is the use of the faculty, as, e.g., in the case of sight seeing
					is the ultimate thing, and sight produces nothing else besides this;
					but in other cases something is produced, e.g. the art of building
					produces not only the act of building but a house; nevertheless in the
					one case the use of the faculty is the end, and in the other it is
					more truly the end than is the potentiality. For the act of building
					resides in the thing built; i.e., it comes to be and exists
					simultaneously with the house.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus in all cases
					where the result is something other than the exercise of the faculty,
					the actuality resides in the thing produced; e.g. the act of building
					in the thing built, the act of weaving in the thing woven, and so on;
					and in general the motion resides in the thing moved. But where there
					is no other result besides the actualization, the actualization
					resides in the subject; e.g. seeing in the seer, and speculation in
					the speculator, and life in the soul <milestone n="1050b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="8.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and hence also
					happiness, since happiness is a particular kind of life). Evidently,
					therefore, substance or form is actuality. Thus it is obvious by this
					argument that actuality is prior in substantiality to potentiality;
					and that in point of time, as we have said, one actuality presupposes
					another right back to that of the prime mover in each case.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is also prior in a deeper sense; because that which is eternal is
					prior in substantiality to that which is perishable, and nothing
					eternal is potential. The argument is as follows. Every potentiality
					is at the same time a potentiality for the opposite.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. 19.</note> For whereas that
					which is incapable of happening cannot happen to anything, everything
					which is capable may fail to be actualized.<milestone n="8.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore that which is capable of being may
					both be and not be. Therefore the same thing is capable both of being
					and of not being. But that which is capable of not being may possibly
					not be; and that which may possibly not be is perishable; either
					absolutely, or in the particular sense in which it is said that it may
					possibly not be; that is, in respect either of place or of quantity or
					of quality. "Absolutely" means in respect of substance.<milestone n="8.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence nothing which is
					absolutely imperishable is absolutely potential (although there is no
					reason why it should not be potential in some particular respect; e.g.
					of quality or place); therefore all imperishable things are actual.
					Nor can anything which is of necessity be potential; and yet these
					things are primary, for if they did not exist, nothing would
					exist.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Nor can motion
					be potential, if there is any eternal motion. Nor, if there is
					anything eternally in motion, is it potentially in motion (except in
					respect of some starting-point or destination), and there is no reason
					why the matter of such a thing should not exist.<milestone n="8.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the sun and stars and the whole

						5.23.3 n</bibl>.</note> on physics entertain. Nor do the
					heavenly bodies tire in their activity; for motion does not imply for

					being ill, and has both potentialities at once; for the same
					potentiality admits of health and disease, or of rest and motion, or
					of building and of pulling down, or of being built and of falling
					down.<milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus the
					capacity for two contraries can belong to a thing at the same time,
					but the contraries cannot belong at the same time; i.e., the
					actualities, e.g. health and disease, cannot belong to a thing at the

					actuality is better.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Also in the case of evils the end or

					denote truth and falsity. This depends, in the case of the objects,
					upon their being united or divided; so that he who thinks that what is
					divided is divided, or that what is united is united, is right; while
					he whose thought is contrary to the real condition of the objects is

					to be united, i.e. a unity; and "not to be" is to be not united, but a

					it does not exist at all. <milestone n="1052a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Truth means to think these objects, and
					there is no falsity or deception, but only ignorance&mdash;not,

					to immovable things also, if one assumes that there are immovable
					things, there is no deception in respect of time.<milestone n="10.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., if we suppose that the triangle

					another has not; e.g., that no even number is a prime, or that some
					are primes and others are not. But about a single number we cannot be
					mistaken even in this way, for we can no longer suppose that one

					degree is that which is a whole and has a definite shape or form,
					particularly that which is such by nature and not by constraint (like
					things which are joined by glue or nails or by being tied together),
					but which contains in itself the cause of its continuity.<milestone n="I.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>A thing is of this kind if its
					motion is one and indivisible in respect of place and time; so that
					clearly if a thing has as its principle of motion the primary kind of
					motion (i.e. locomotion) in its primary form (i.e. circular
					locomotion), it is in the primary sense <emph>one</emph> spatial
					magnitude.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This
						description applies to the celestial spheres.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Some things, then, are one in this sense,
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> continuous or whole; the other things
					which are one are those whose formula is one.<milestone n="I.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such are the things of which the concept is
					one, i.e. of which the concept is indivisible; and this is indivisible
					when the object is indivisible (3.) in form or (4.) in number. Now in
					number the individual is indivisible, and in form that which is
					indivisible in comprehension and knowledge; so that that which causes
					the unity of substances must be one in the primary sense.<milestone n="I.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Such, then, in number are the
					meanings of "one": the naturally continuous, the whole, the
					individual, and the universal. All these are one because they are
					indivisible; some in motion, and others in concept or formula.
					<milestone n="1052b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>But we must recognize that the
					questions, "What sort of things are called one?" and "What is
					essential unity, and what is the formula?" must not be taken to be the
					same. <milestone n="I.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>"One" has these
					several meanings, and each thing to which some one of these senses
					applies will be one; but essential unity will have now one of these
					senses and now something else, which is still nearer to the
					<emph>term</emph> one, whereas they are nearer to its
					<emph>denotation</emph> . This is also true of "element" and "cause,"
					supposing that one had to explain them both by exhibiting concrete
					examples and by giving a definition of the term. <milestone n="I.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is a sense in which fire is an
					element (and no doubt so too is "the indeterminate"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The reference is undoubtedly to
						Anaximander. </note> or some other similar thing, of its own
					nature), and there is a sense in which it is not; because "to be fire"
					and "to be an element" are not the same. It is as a concrete thing and
					as a stuff that fire is an element; but the term "element" denotes
					that it has this attribute: that something is made of it as a primary
					constituent. <milestone n="I.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The same is
					true of "cause" or "one" and all other such terms.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Hence "to be one" means "to be indivisible" (being
					essentially a particular thing, distinct and separate in place or form
					or thought), or "to be whole and indivisible"; but especially "to be
					the first measure of each kind," and above all of quantity; for it is
					from this that it has been extended to the other categories.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="I.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Measure is that by which quantity is known,
					and quantity <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> quantity is known either by

					quantity <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> quantity is known by unity, and
					that by which quantities are primarily known is absolute
					unity.<milestone n="I.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus unity is
					the starting point of number <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> number. Hence
					in other cases too "measure" means that by which each thing is
					primarily known, and the measure of each thing is a unit&mdash;in
					length, breadth, depth, weight and speed.<milestone n="I.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(The terms "weight" and "speed" are common to
					both contraries, for each of them has a double meaning; e.g., "weight"
					applies to that which has the least amount of gravity and also to that
					which has excess of it, and speed to that which has the least amount
					of motion and also to that which has excess of it; for even the slow
					has some speed, and the light some weight.)<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> In
					all these cases, then, the measure and starting-point is some
					indivisible unit (since even in the case of lines we treat the
					"one-foot line" as indivisible). For everywhere we require as our
					measure an indivisible unit; i.e., that which is simple either in
					quality or in quantity.<milestone n="I.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now where it seems impossible to take away or add, there the measure
					is exact. <milestone n="1053a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Hence the measure of number is most
					exact, for we posit the unit as in every way indivisible; and in all
					other cases we follow this example, for with the furlong or talent or
					in general with the greater measure an addition or subtraction would
					be less obvious than with a smaller one.<milestone n="I.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore the first thing from which,
					according to our perception, nothing can be subtracted is used by all
					men as their measure of wet and dry, weight and magnitude; and they
					think that they know the quantity only when they know it in terms of
					this measure. And they know motion too by simple motion and the most
					rapid, for this takes least time.<milestone n="I.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence in astronomy a unit of this kind is the
					starting point and measure; for they assume that the motion of the
					heavens is uniform and the most rapid, and by it they judge the
					others. In music the measure is the quarter tone, because it is the
					smallest interval; and in language the letter. All these are examples
					of units in this sense&mdash;not in the sense that unity is
					something common to them all, but in the sense which we have
					described.<milestone n="I.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					measure is not always numerically one, but sometimes more than one;
					e.g., there are two quarter tones, distinguished not by our hearing
					but by their theoretical ratios<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the enharmonic (or quarter-tone proper) and the

					form.<milestone n="I.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence unity is
					indivisible, because that which is primary in each class of things is
					indivisible. But not every unit is indivisible in the same

					latter is absolutely indivisible, and the former must be classed as
					indivisible with respect to our power of perception, as we have
					already stated; since presumably everything which is continuous is
					divisible.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> The measure is always akin to the
					thing measured. The measure of magnitude is magnitude, and in
					particular the measure of length is a length; of breadth, a breadth;
					of sounds, a sound; of weight, a weight; of units, a unit; for this is
					the view that we must take, and not that the measure of numbers is a
					number. The latter, indeed, would necessarily be true, if the analogy
					held good; but the supposition is not analogous&mdash;it is as
					though one were to suppose that the measure of units is units, and not
					a unit; for number is a plurality of units.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> We
					also speak of knowledge or sense perception as a measure of things for
					the same reason, because through them we come to know something;
					whereas really they are measured themselves rather than measure other
					things. But our experience is as though someone else measured us, and
					we learned our height by noticing to what extent he applied his
					foot-rule to us.<milestone n="I.20" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Protagoras says that "man is the measure of all things," meaning, as

					these because they possess, the one knowledge, and the other

					which is one is indivisible, either absolutely or <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> one.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> We must inquire, with regard to the

					itself is a kind of substance&mdash;as first the Pythagoreans, and
					later Plato, both maintain&mdash;or whether rather some nature
					underlies it, and we should give a more intelligible account of it,
					and more after the manner of the physicists; for of them one<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Empedocles.</note> holds that

					Now if no universal can be a substance (as we have stated in our
					discussion<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 7.1038b">Aristot. Met. 7.13</bibl>.</note>
					of substance and being), and being itself cannot be a substance in the
					sense of one thing existing alongside the many (since it is common to
					them), but only as a predicate,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>then clearly neither can unity be a substance;
					because being and unity are the most universal of all
					predicates.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore
					(a) genera are not certain entities and substances separate from other
					things; and (b) unity cannot be a genus, for the same reasons that
					being and substance cannot.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.998b">Aristot. Met. 3.3.7</bibl>.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, the nature of unity must be the
					same for all categories.<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now being and unity have the same number of meanings; so that since
					in the category of qualities unity is something definite, i.e. some
					definite entity, and similarly in the category of quantity, clearly we
					must also inquire in general what unity is, just as in the case of
					being; since it is not enough to say that its nature is simply unity
					or being.<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But in the sphere
					of colors unity is a color, e.g. white; that is if all the other
					colors are apparently derived from white and black, and black is a
					privation of white, as darkness is of light. Thus if all existing
					things were colors, all existing things would be a number; but of
					what?<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Clearly of
					colors. And unity would be some one color, e.g. white. Similarly if
					all existing things were tunes, there would be a number&mdash;of
					quarter-tones; but their substance would not be a number; and unity
					would be something whose substance is not unity but a quarter-tone.
					<milestone n="1054a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Similarly in the case of sounds,
					existing things would be a number of letters, and unity would be a
					vowel;<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and if
					existing things were right-lined figures, they would be a number of
					figures, and unity would be a triangle. And the same principle holds
					for all other genera. Therefore if in the categories of passivity and
					quality and quantity and motion there is in every category a number
					and a unity, and if the number is of particular things and the unity
					is a particular unity, and its substance is not unity, then the same
					must be true in the case of substances, because the same is true in
					all cases.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> It is obvious, then, that in every genus one

					in a sense unity means the same as being is clear (a) from the fact

					substance nor in quality, but is related to them exactly as being is;
					(b) from the fact that in "one man" nothing more is predicated than in
					"man"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.1003b">Aristot. Met. 4.2.6-8</bibl>.</note>(just as Being too

					are opposed in several ways. Unity and Plurality are opposed as being

					are different, and contrariety is a kind of difference. That this is
					rightly premissed is made clear by induction; for the contraries are
					obviously all different, since they are not merely "other," but some
					are other in genus, and others are in the same line of predication,
					<milestone n="1055a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and so are in the same genus and the

						5.28.4</bibl>.</note> what sort of things are the same or other
					in genus.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Since things which differ can differ from one
					another in a greater or less degree, there is a certain maximum
					difference, and this I call contrariety. That it is the maximum
					difference is shown by induction. For whereas things which differ in
					genus have no means of passing into each other, and are more widely
					distant, and are not comparable, in the case of things which differ in
					species the contraries are the extremes from which generation takes
					place;<milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and the
					greatest distance is that which is between the extremes, and therefore
					also between the contraries. But in every class the greatest thing is
					complete. For (a) that is greatest which cannot be exceeded, and (b)
					that is complete outside which nothing proper to it can be found. For
					complete difference implies an end, just as all other things are
					called complete because they imply an end.<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And there is nothing beyond the end; for in
					everything the end is the last thing, and forms the boundary. Thus
					there is nothing beyond the end, and that which is complete lacks
					nothing.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>From this argument, then,
					it is clear that contrariety is maximum difference; and since we speak
					of contraries in various senses, the sense of completeness will vary
					in accordance with the sense of contrariety which applies to the
					contraries.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> This being so, evidently one thing cannot
					have more than one contrary (since there can be nothing more extreme
					than the extreme, nor can there be more than two extremes of one
					interval); and in general this is evident, if contrariety is
					difference, and difference (and therefore complete difference) is
					between two things.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> The other definitions of contraries
					must also be true, for (1.) complete difference is the maximum
					difference; since (a) we can find nothing beyond it, whether things
					differ in genus or in species (for we have shown that difference in
					relation to things outside the genus is impossible; this is the
					maximum difference between them); and (b) the things which differ most
					in the same genus are contraries; for complete difference is the
					maximum difference between these.<milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2.) The things which differ most in the same
					receptive material are contraries; for contraries have the same
					matter. (3.) The most different things which come under the same
					faculty are contraries; for one science treats of one class of things,
					in which complete difference is the greatest.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					"Positive state" and "Privation" constitute primary
					contrariety&mdash;not every form of privation (for it has several
					senses), but any form which is complete. All other contraries must be
					so called with respect to these; some because they possess these,
					others because they produce them or are productive of them, and others
					because they are acquisitions or losses of these or other
					contraries.<milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now if
					the types of opposition are contradiction, privation, contrariety and
					relation, <milestone n="1055b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and of these the primary type is
					contradiction, and an intermediate is impossible in contradiction but
					possible between contraries, obviously contradiction is not the same
					as contrariety; and privation is a form of contradiction;<milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for it is either that which is
					totally incapable of possessing some attribute,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is not a proper example of privation. Cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1022b">Aristot. Met.
							5.22</bibl>.</note> or that which would naturally possess some
					attribute but does not, that suffers privation&mdash;either
					absolutely or in some specified way. Here we already have several
					meanings, which we have distinguished elsewhere. Thus privation is a
					kind of contradiction or incapacity which is determinate or associated
					with the receptive material.<milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is why though there is no intermediate in
					contradiction there is one in some kinds of privation. For everything
					is either equal or not equal, but not everything is either equal or
					unequal; if it is, it is only so in the case of a material which
					admits of equality. If, then, processes of material generation start
					from the contraries, and proceed either from the form and the
					possession of the form, or from some privation of the form or shape,
					clearly all contrariety must be a form of privation, although
					presumably not all privation is contrariety.<milestone n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is because that which suffers privation
					may suffer it in several senses; for it is only the extremes from
					which changes proceed that are contraries.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>This can also be shown by induction. Every
					contrariety involves privation as one of its contraries, but not
					always in the same way:<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>inequality involves the privation of equality, dissimilarity that of
					similarity, evil that of goodness.<milestone n="4.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And the differences are as we have stated: one
					case is, if a thing is merely deprived; another, if it is deprived at
					a certain time or in a certain part&mdash;e.g. at a certain age or
					in the important part&mdash;or entirely. Hence in some cases there
					is an intermediate (there are men who are neither good nor bad), and
					in others there is not&mdash;a thing must be either odd or
					even.<milestone n="4.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, some
					have a determinate subject, and others have not. Thus it is evident
					that one of a pair of contraries always has a privative sense; but it
					is enough if this is true of the primary or generic contraries, e.g.
					unity and plurality; for the others can be reduced to them.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					Since one thing has one contrary, it might be asked in what sense
					unity is opposed to plurality, and the equal to the great and to the
					small. For if we always use the word "whether" in an
					antithesis&mdash;e.g., "whether it is white or black," or "whether
					it is white or not" (but we do not ask "whether it is a man or white,"
					unless we are proceeding upon some assumption, and asking, for
					instance, whether it was Cleon who came or
					Socrates.<milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This is not a necessary disjunction in any
					class of things, but is derived from the use in the case of
					opposites&mdash;for it is only opposites that cannot be true at
					the same time&mdash;and we have this same use here in the question
					"which of the two came?" <milestone n="1056a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for if both
					alternatives were possible, the question would be absurd; but even so
					the question falls into an antithesis: that of "one" or
					"many"&mdash;i.e., "whether both came, or
					one")&mdash;<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> if,
					then, the question "whether" is always concerned with opposites, and
					we can ask "whether it is greater or smaller, or equal," what is the
					nature of the antithesis between "equal" and "greater or smaller"? It
					is contrary neither to one only, nor to both: for (a) it is no more
					contrary to the greater than to the smaller; (b) "equal" is contrary
					to "unequal," and thus it will be contrary to more than one
					thing;<milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(c) if
					"unequal" means the same as both "greater" and "smaller" at the same
					time, "equal" must still be opposed to them both: This difficulty
					supports the theory<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Held by the
						Platonists. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 14.1087b">Aristot. Met. 14.1.4,
							5</bibl>.</note> that "the unequal" is a duality. But the result is
					that one thing is contrary to two; which is impossible.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					Further, it is apparent that "equal" is intermediate between "great"
					and "small," but it is not apparent that any contrariety is
					intermediate, nor can it be, by definition; for it could not be
					complete if it were the intermediate of something, but rather it
					always has something intermediate between itself and the other
					extreme.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It remains, then, that it
					is opposed either as negation or as privation. Now it cannot be so
					opposed to one of the two, for it is no more opposed to the great than
					to the small.<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore it
					is a privative negation of both. For this reason we say "whether" with
					reference to both, and not to one of the two&mdash;e.g., "whether
					it is greater or equal," or "whether it is equal or
					smaller";<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>there are
					always three alternatives. But it is not a necessary privation; for
					not everything is equal which is not greater or smaller, but only
					things which would naturally have these attributes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> The
					equal, then, is that which is neither great nor small, but would
					naturally be either great or small; and it is opposed to both as a
					privative negation, and therefore is intermediate between them. And
					that which is neither good nor bad is opposed to both, but it has no
					name (for each of these terms has several meanings, and there is no
					one material which is receptive of both); that which is neither white
					nor black is better entitled to a name,<milestone n="5.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>although even this has no single name, but the
					colors of which this negation is privatively predicated are to a
					certain extent limited; for it must be either grey or buff or
					something similar.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Therefore those persons are wrong in
					their criticism who imagine that all terms are used analogously, so
					that that which is neither a shoe nor a hand will be intermediate
					between "shoe" and "hand," because that which is neither good nor bad
					is intermediate between good and bad&mdash;as though there must be
					an intermediate in all cases; but this does not necessarily
					follow.<milestone n="5.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the one
					is a joint negation of opposites where there is an intermediate and a
					natural interval; <milestone n="1056b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but in the other case there is no
					question of difference, since the joint negation applies to things
					which are in different genera, and therefore the substrate is not
					one.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 10.1054b">Aristot. Met. 10.3.8</bibl></note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> A
					similar question might be raised about "one" and "many." For if "many"
					is absolutely opposed to "one," certain impossibilities result. (1)
					One will be few; for "many" is also opposed to "few."<milestone n="6.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(2) Two will be many; since
					"twofold" is "manifold," and "twofold" is derived from two. Therefore
					one will be few; for in what relation can two be many if not in
					relation to one, which must therefore be few? for there can be nothing
					less. (3) If "much" and "little" are in plurality what "long" and
					"short" are in length, and if whatever is "much" is also
					"many,"<milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and "many" is
					"much" (unless indeed there is a difference in the case of a plastic
					continuum<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., a fluid,
						which cannot be described as "many."</note>), "few" will be a
					plurality. Therefore one will be a plurality, if it is few; and this
					necessarily follows if two is many. Presumably, however, although
					"many" in a sense means "much," there is a distinction; e.g., water is
					called "much" but not "many."<milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To all things, however, which are divisible
					the term "many" is applicable: in one sense, if there is a plurality
					which involves excess either absolutely or relatively (and similarly
					"few" is a plurality involving defect); and in another in the sense of
					number, in which case it is opposed to "one" only.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For we say "one or many" just as if we
					were to say "one and ones," or "white thing and white things," or were
					to compare the things measured with the measure.<milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Multiples, too, are spoken of in this
					way; for every number is "many," because it consists of "ones," and

					be fewer than something, e.g. two; for if it is fewer it is not
					therefore few. Plurality is, as it were, a genus of number, since
					number is a plurality measurable by one. And in a sense one and number

					relative terms to be; for it is <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> measure and
					measurable that they are opposed.<milestone n="6.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(Hence not everything which is one is a
					number&mdash;e.g., a thing which is indivisible.) But although the
					relation between knowledge and the knowable is said to be similar to
					this, it turns out not to be similar. For it would seem that knowledge
					is a measure, and the knowable that which is measurable by it; but it
					happens that whereas all knowledge is knowable, the knowable is not

					Plurality is contrary neither to the few (whose real contrary is the

					sense (as has been said) as being the one divisible and the other
					indivisible; and in another as being relative (just as knowledge is
					relative to the knowable) if plurality is a number and one is the
					measure.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Since there can be, and in some cases is, an
					intermediate between contraries, intermediates must be composed of
					contraries;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for all
					intermediates are in the same genus as the things between which they
					are intermediate.<milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By
					intermediates we mean those things into which that which changes must
					first change. E.g., if we change from the highest string to the lowest
					by the smallest gradations we shall first come to the intermediate
					notes; and in the case of colors if we change from white to black we
					shall come to red and grey before we come to black; and similarly in
					other cases.<milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But change
					from one genus into another is impossible except accidentally; e.g.,
					from color to shape. Therefore intermediates must be in the same genus
					as one another and as the things between which they are
					intermediate.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But all
					intermediates are between certain opposites, for it is only from these
					per se that change is possible.<milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence there can be no intermediate between
					things which are not opposites; for then there would be change also
					between things which are not opposites. Of things which are opposites,
					contradiction has no intermediate term (for contradiction means this:
					an antithesis one term of which must apply to any given thing, and
					which contains no intermediate term); of the remaining types of
					opposites some are relative, others privative, and others
					contrary.<milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Those
					relative opposites which are not contrary have no intermediate. The
					reason for this is that they are not in the same genus&mdash;
					<milestone n="1057b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for what is intermediate between
					knowledge and the knowable?&mdash;but between great and small
					there is an intermediate. Now since intermediates are in the same
					genus, as has been shown, and are between contraries, they must be
					composed of those contraries. For the contraries must either belong to
					a genus or not. And if there is a genus in such a way<milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>that it is something prior to
					the contraries, then the differentiae which constitute the contrary
					species (for species consist of genus and differentiae) will be
					contraries in a prior sense.<milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>E.g., if white and black are contraries, and the one is a
					penetrative<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is
						Plato's definition. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 67d">Plat. Tim. 67d,
							e</bibl>.</note> and the other a compressive color, these
					differentiae, "penetrative" and "compressive," are prior, and so are
					opposed to each other in a prior sense.<milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But it is the species which have contrary
					differentiae that are more truly contraries; the other, i.e.
					intermediate, species will consist of genus and differentiae. E.g.,
					all colors which are intermediate between white and black should be
					described by their genus (i.e. color) and by certain
					differentiae.<milestone n="7.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But
					these differentiae will not be the primary contraries; otherwise every
					thing will be either white or black. Therefore they will be different
					from the primary contraries. Therefore they will be intermediate
					between them, and the primary differentiae will be "the penetrative"
					and "the compressive."<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Thus
					we must first investigate the contraries which are not contained in a
					genus, and discover of what their intermediates are
					composed.<milestone n="7.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For things
					which are in the same genus must either be composed of differentiae
					which are not compounded with the genus, or be incomposite. Contraries
					are not compounded with one another, and are therefore first
					principles; but intermediates are either all incomposite or none of
					them. Now from the contraries something is generated in such a way
					that change will reach it before reaching the contraries themselves
					(for there must be something which is less in degree than one contrary
					and greater than the other). Therefore this also will be intermediate
					between the contraries.<milestone n="7.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence all the other intermediates must be composite; for that which
					is greater in degree than one contrary and less than the other is in
					some sense a compound of the contraries of which it is said to be
					greater in degree than one and less than the other. And since there is
					nothing else homogeneous which is prior to the contraries, all
					intermediates must be composed of contraries.<milestone n="7.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore all the lower terms, both
					contraries and intermediates, must be composed of the primary
					contraries. Thus it is clear that intermediates are all in the same
					genus, and are between contraries, and are all composed of
					contraries.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> That which is "other in species" than
					something else is "other" in respect of something and that something
					must apply to both. E.g., if an animal is other in species than
					something else, they must both be animals. Hence things which are
					other in species must be in the same genus. The sort of thing I mean
					by "genus" is that in virtue of which two things are both called the
					same one thing; <milestone n="1058a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and which is not accidentally
					differentiated, whether regarded as matter or otherwise.<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For not only must the common
					quality belong to both, e.g., that they are both animals, but the very
					animality of each must be different; e.g., in one case it must be
					equinity and in the other humanity. Hence the common quality must for
					one be other in species than that which it is for the other. They must
					be, then, of their very nature, the one <emph>this</emph> kind of
					animal, and the other <emph>that</emph> ; e.g., the one a horse and
					the other a man.<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore
					this difference must be "otherness of genus" (I say "otherness of
					genus" because by "difference of genus" I mean an otherness which
					makes the genus itself other); this, then, will be a form of
					contrariety. This is obvious by induction.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle does not use induction to prove his
						point; indeed he does not prove it at all.</note> For all
					differentiation is by opposites, and we have shown<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In ch. 4.</note> that
					contraries are in the same genus, because contrariety was shown to be
					complete difference. But difference in species is always difference
					from something in respect of something; therefore this is the same
					thing, i.e. the genus, for both.<milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(Hence too all contraries which differ in
					species but not in genus are in the same line of predication,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Or "category."</note> and are
					other than each other in the highest degree; for their difference is
					complete, and they cannot come into existence simultaneously.) Hence
					the difference is a form of contrariety.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>To be "other in species," then, means this: to be in the same genus
					and involve contrariety, while being indivisible<milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(and "the same in species" applies to
					all things which do not involve contrariety, while being
					indivisible);<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for it
					is in the course of differentiation and in the intermediate terms that
					contrariety appears, before we come to the indivisibles.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., indivisible species and
						individuals.</note><milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					Thus it is evident that in relation to what is called genus no species
					is either the same or other in species (and this is as it should be,
					for the matter is disclosed by negation, and the genus is the matter
					of that of which it is predicated as genus; not in the sense in which
					we speak of the genus or clan of the Heraclidae,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        5.1024a">Aristot. Met.
						5.28.1</bibl>.</note> but as we speak of a genus in
					nature); nor yet in relation to things which are not in the same
					genus. From the latter it will differ in genus, but in species from
					things which are in the same genus. For the difference of things which
					differ in species must be a contrariety; and this belongs only to
					things which are in the same genus.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> The question
					might be raised as to why woman does not differ in species from man,
					seeing that female is contrary to male, and difference is contrariety;

					this difference belongs to "animal" per se, and not as whiteness or
					blackness does; "male" and "female" belong to it <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> animal.<milestone n="9.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>This
					problem is practically the same as "why does one kind of contrariety
					(e.g. "footed" and "winged") make things other in species, while
					another (e.g. whiteness and blackness) does not?" The answer may be
					that in the one case the attributes are peculiar to the genus, and in
					the other they are less so; <milestone n="1058b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and since one
					element is formula and the other matter, contrarieties in the formula
					produce difference in species, but contrarieties in the concrete whole
					do not.<milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence the whiteness
					or blackness of a man does not produce this, nor is there any specific
					difference between a white man and a black man; not even if one term
					is assigned to each. For we are now regarding "man" as matter, and
					matter does not produce difference; and for this reason, too,
					individual men are not species of "man," although the flesh and bones
					of which this and that man consist are different. The concrete whole
					is "other," but not "other in species," because there is no
					contrariety in the formula, and this is the ultimate indivisible
					species.<milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But Callias
					is definition <emph>and</emph> matter. Then so too is "white man,"
					because it is the individual, Callias, who is white. Hence "man" is
					only white accidentally. Again, a bronze circle and a wooden one do
					not differ in species; and a bronze triangle and a wooden circle
					differ in species not because of their matter, but because there is
					contrariety in their formulae.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> But does not
					matter, when it is "other" in a particular way, make things "other in
					species"? Probably there is a sense in which it does. Otherwise why is
					this particular horse "other in species" than this particular man,
					although the definitions involve matter? Surely it is because there is
					contrariety in the definition, for so there also is in "white man" and
					"black horse";<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and it is a

					</note> why this is impossible.<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Indeed, in general it is a difficult question
					whether we should suppose that there is some substance which exists
					separately besides sensible substances (i.e. the substances of our
					world), or that the latter constitute reality, and that it is with
					them that Wisdom is concerned. It <emph>seems</emph> that we are
					looking for some other kind of substance, and that this is the object
					of our undertaking: I mean, to see whether there is anything which
					exists separately and independently, and does not appertain to any
					sensible thing.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But again,
					if there is another kind of substance besides sensible substances, to
					what kind of sensible things are we to suppose that it corresponds?
					Why should we suppose that it corresponds to men or horses rather than
					to other animals, or even to inanimate objects in general? And yet to
					manufacture a set of eternal substances equal in number to those which
					are sensible and perishable would seem to fall outside the bounds of
					plausibility.<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Yet if
					the principle which we are now seeking does not exist in separation
					from bodies,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>what can we
					suppose it to be if not matter? Yes, but matter does not exist
					actually, but only potentially. It might seem rather that a more
					appropriate principle would be form or shape; but this is
					perishable<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Forms which are
						induced in matter are perishable, although not subject to the
						process of destruction; they <emph>are</emph> at one time and
						are not at another (cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        7.1039b">Aristot. Met.
							7.15.1</bibl>). The only pure form (i.e., the only form which is
						independent of matter in any and every sense) is the prime mover
						(<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1072a">Aristot. Met.
							12.7</bibl>).</note>; and so in general there is no eternal substance
					which exists separately and independently.<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But this is absurd, because it seems natural
					that there should be a substance and principle of this kind, and it is
					sought for as existing by nearly all the most enlightened thinkers.
					For how can there be any order in the universe if there is not
					something eternal and separate and permanent?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again,
					if there is a substance and principle of such a nature as that which
					we are now seeking, and if it is one for all things, i.e. the same for
					both eternal and perishable things, it is a difficult question as to
					why, when the principle is the same, some of the things which come
					under that principle are eternal, and others not; for this is
					paradoxical.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.996a">Aristot. Met. 3.1.12</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot.        Met. 3.1000a">Aristot.

					science and the other is useful to it.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The same is true of "healthy"; one thing is so
					called because it is indicative, and another because it is productive,
					of health; and the same applies to all other cases. Now it is in this

					to some one common concept, each of the contrarieties too can be
					referred to the primary differentiae and contrarieties of
					Being&mdash;whether the primary differentiae of Being are
					plurality and unity, or similarity and dissimilarity, or something

					virtue of privation (although indeed one might wonder in what sense
					they can be called contraries in virtue of privation when they admit
					of a middle term&mdash;e.g. "unjust" and "just"), in all such
					cases we must regard the privation as being not of the whole
					definition but of the ultimate species. E.g., if the just man is "one
					who is obedient to the laws in virtue of some volitional state," the
					unjust man will not be entirely deprived of the whole definition, but
					will be "one who is in some respect deficient in obedience to the
					laws"; and it is in this respect that the privation of justice will
					apply to him (and the same holds good in all other cases).<milestone n="3.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And just as the mathematician
					makes a study of abstractions (for in his investigations he first
					abstracts everything that is sensible, such as weight and lightness,

					continuity&mdash;sometimes in one, sometimes in two and sometimes

					relative positions of things and the properties of these, <milestone n="1061b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and in others their commensurability or
					incommensurability, and in others their ratios; yet nevertheless we
					hold that there is one and the same science of all these things, viz.

					far as it is Being, and of its contrarieties<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., identity, otherness, etc.</note>
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being, belongs to no other science than
					Philosophy; for to physics one would assign the study of things not
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>

					than the axiom itself on which to base an argument, whereas there must
					be such a principle if there is to be absolute proof.<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> But he who wants to convince
					an opponent who makes opposite statements that he is wrong must obtain

					says that A is and is not denies what he asserts, and therefore denies

					<milestone n="1064a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g., the sciences of medicine and
					physical culture do this, and so does each of the other productive and
					mathematical sciences. Each one of these marks out for itself some
					class of objects, and concerns itself with this as with something
					existent and real, but not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> real; it is
					another science distinct from these which does this.<milestone n="7.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Each of the said sciences arrives in
					some way at the essence in a particular class of things, and then
					tries to prove the rest more or less exactly. Some arrive at the
					essence through sense-perception, and some by hypothesis; hence it is
					obvious from such a process of induction that there is no
					demonstration of the reality or essence.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Now since there
					is a science of nature, clearly it must be different from both
					practical and productive science. In a productive science the source
					of motion is in the producer and not in the thing produced, and is
					either an art or some other kind of potency; and similarly in a
					practical science the motion is not in the thing acted upon but rather
					in the agent.<milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the
					science of the natural philosopher is concerned with things which
					contain in themselves a source of motion. From this it is clear that
					natural science must be neither practical nor productive, but
					speculative; since it must fall under one of these classes.<milestone n="7.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since every science must
					have some knowledge of the essence<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and must use it as a starting-point, we must be
					careful to observe how the natural philosopher should define, and how
					he should regard the formula of essence&mdash;whether in the same
					way as the term "snub," or rather as the term "concave."<milestone n="7.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For of these the formula of
					"snub" is stated in conjunction with the matter of the object, whereas
					that of "concave" is stated apart from the matter; since snubness is
					only found in the nose, which is therefore included in the formula,
					for "the snub" is a concave <emph>nose</emph> . Thus it is obvious
					that the formula of "flesh" and "eye" and the other parts of the body
					must always be stated in conjunction with their matter.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					Since there is a science of Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being and
					separately existent, we must inquire whether this should be regarded
					as identical with natural science or rather as a distinct branch of
					knowledge. Physics deals with things which contain a source of motion
					in themselves, and mathematics is speculative and is a science which
					deals with permanent things, but not with things which can exist
					separately.<milestone n="7.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence
					there is a science distinct from both of these, which deals with that
					which exists separately and is immovable; that is, if there really is
					a substance of this kind&mdash;I mean separately existent and
					immovable&mdash;as we shall endeavor to prove.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1071b">Aristot. Met. 12.6,
						7</bibl>.</note> And if there is an entity of this kind in
					the world of reality, here surely must be the Divine, and this must be
					the first and most fundamental principle. <milestone n="1064b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="7.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Evidently, then,
					there are three kinds of speculative science: physics, mathematics,
					and theology. The highest class of science is the speculative, and of
					the speculative sciences themselves the highest is the last named,
					because it deals with the most important side of reality; and each
					science is reckoned higher or lower in accordance with the object of
					its study.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The question might be raised
					as to whether the science of Being <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> Being
					should be regarded as universal or not.<milestone n="7.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Each of the mathematical sciences deals with
					some one class of things which is determinate, but universal
					mathematics is common to all alike. If, then, natural substances are
					the first of existing things, physics will be the first of the
					sciences; but if there is some other nature and substance which exists
					separately and is immovable, then the science which treats of it must
					be different from and prior to physics, and universal because of its
					priority.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Since the term Being in its
					unqualified sense is used with several meanings, of which one is
					accidental Being, we must first consider Being in this sense.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Sections 1-9 of this chapter

					Clearly none of the traditional sciences concerns itself with the
					accidental; the science of building does not consider what will happen
					to the occupants of the house,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g. whether they will find it unpleasant or the
					contrary to live in; nor does the science of weaving or of shoemaking
					or of confectionery.<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Each
					of these sciences considers only what is proper to it, i.e. its
					particular end. As for the question whether "the cultured" is also
					"the lettered," or the quibble<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is a different form of the "quibble" in <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 6.1026b">Aristot. Met. 6.2.4</bibl>. Here the fallacy obviously
						consists in the wrong application of the word <foreign lang="greek">A(/MA</foreign>("at once" or "at the same
						time").</note> that "the man who is cultured, when he has become

					which is but was not always so must have come to be; therefore he must
					have become at the same time cultured and lettered"<milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>&mdash;none of the recognized
					sciences considers this, except sophistry. This is the only science
					which concerns itself with the accidental, and hence Plato was not far
					wrong in saying<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Soph. 254a">Plat. Sop. 254a</bibl>.</note> that the sophist spends
					his time in the study of unreality. But that it is not even possible
					for there to be a science of the accidental will be apparent if we try
					to see what the accidental really is.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Of some things we
					say that they are so always and of necessity (necessity having the
					sense not of compulsion, but that which we use in logical
					demonstration<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 6.1026b">Aristot. Met. 6.2.6</bibl>.</note>), and of others
					that they are so usually, but of others that they are so neither
					usually nor always and of necessity, but fortuitously. E.g., there
					might be a frost at midsummer, although this comes about neither
					always and of necessity nor usually; <milestone n="1065a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but it
					might happen sometimes.<milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					The accidental, then, is that which comes about, but not always nor of
					necessity nor usually. Thus we have now stated what the accidental is;
					and it is obvious why there can be no science of such a thing, because
					every science has as its object that which is so always or usually,
					and the accidental falls under neither of these
					descriptions.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Clearly there can be no causes and
					principles of the accidental such as there are of that which is per
					se; otherwise everything would be of necessity. For if A is when B is,
					and B is when C is, and C is not fortuitously but of necessity, then
					that of which C was the cause will also be of necessity, and so on
					down to the last <emph>causatum</emph> , as it is called.<milestone n="8.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(But this was assumed to be
					accidental.) Therefore everything will be of necessity, and the
					element of chance, i.e. the possibility of a thing's either happening
					or not, is entirely banished from the world of events. Even if we
					suppose the cause not to exist already but to be coming to be, the
					result will be the same; for everything will come to be of
					necessity.<milestone n="8.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					eclipse tomorrow will come about if A does, and A will if B does, and
					B if C does; and in this way if we keep on subtracting time from the
					finite time between now and to-morrow, we shall at some point arrive
					at the present existing condition.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Therefore since this exists, everything subsequent
					to it will happen of necessity, and so everything happens of
					necessity.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> As for "what is" in the sense of what
					is <emph>true</emph> or what is <emph>accidental</emph> , the former
					depends upon a combination in thought, and is an affection of thought
					(hence we do not look for the principles of Being in this sense, but
					only for those of objective and separable Being) the latter is not
					necessary but indeterminate (I mean the accidental); and of such a
					thing the causes are indefinite and cannot be reduced to a
					system.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Teleology is found in events which come about
					in the course of nature or as a result of thought.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This section is taken from
						<bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 2.5">Aristot. Physics 2.5, 6</bibl>.</note> It is
					"chance" &lt;or "luck"&gt; when one of these comes about by
					accident; for a thing may be a cause, just as it may exist, either per
					se or accidentally. Chance is an accidental cause of normally
					purposive teleological events.<milestone n="8.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence chance and thought have the same sphere
					of action, for there is no purpose without thought. Causes from which
					chance results may come about are indeterminate; hence chance is
					inscrutable to human calculation, and is a cause only accidentally,
					but in the strictest sense is a cause of nothing.<milestone n="8.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is "good" or "bad luck" when the

						which may be summarized thus. The material substrate, e.g.
						bricks, etc., which is potentially a house, may be regarded (a)
						as potential material; in this sense it is actualized as bricks
						before building begins; (b) as potentially a house; in this
						sense when it is actualized it is no longer buildable but built,
						i.e., it is no longer potential; (c) as potentially buildable
						into a house. In this sense its actualization is conterminous
						with the process of building, and is incomplete (sect.11), and
						should not be described as <foreign lang="greek">E)NTELE/XEIA</foreign> or "complete reality." But Aristotle
						often uses this term as synonymous with the vaguer <foreign lang="greek">E)NE/RGEIA</foreign>.</note>
					motion.<milestone n="9.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>That this is
					a true statement will be clear from what follows. When the "buildable"
					in the sense in which we call it such exists actually, it is being
					built; and this is the process of building. The same is true of the
					processes of learning, healing, walking,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>jumping, ageing, maturing. Motion results when the
					complete reality itself exists, and neither sooner nor
					later.<milestone n="9.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The complete
					reality, then, of that which exists potentially, when it is completely
					real and actual, not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> itself but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> movable, is motion. By <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> I mean this. The bronze is potentially a statue; but
					nevertheless the complete reality of the bronze <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> bronze is not motion. To be bronze is not the same as to be
					a particular potentiality; since if it were absolutely the same by
					definition the complete reality of the bronze would be a kind of
					motion; but it is not the same.<milestone n="9.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(This is obvious in the case of contraries;
					for the potentiality for health and the potentiality for illness are
					not the same&mdash;for if they were, health and illness would be
					the same too&mdash;but the substrate which becomes healthy or ill,
					whether it is moisture or blood, is one and the same.) And since it is
					not the same, just as "color" and "visible" are not the same, it is
					the complete reality of the potential <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					potential that is motion.<milestone n="9.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is evident that it is this, and that motion results when the
					complete reality itself exists, and neither sooner nor later.
					<milestone n="1066a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For everything may sometimes be actual,
					and sometimes not; e.g. the "buildable" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					"buildable"; and the actualization of the "buildable" <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> "buildable" is the act of
					building.<milestone n="9.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For the
					actualization is either this&mdash;the act of
					building&mdash;or a house. But when the house exists, it will no
					longer be buildable; the buildable is that which is <emph>being</emph>
					built. Hence the actualization must be the act of building, and the
					act of building is a kind of motion. The same argument applies to the
					other kinds of motion.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="9.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> That this account is correct
					is clear from what the other authorities say about motion, and from

					that some people<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Pythagoreans

						same must be true of their contraries, since motion is between
						contraries.</note> The reason for placing motion in this class
					is that it is considered to be indeterminate, and the principles in
					one of the columns of contraries are indeterminate, being privative;
					for none of them is a determinate thing or quality or any of the other
					categories.<milestone n="9.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The
					reason for considering motion to be indeterminate is that it cannot be
					associated either with the potentiality or with the actuality of
					things; for neither that which is potentially<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>nor that which is actually of a certain
					size is necessarily moved.<milestone n="9.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And motion is considered to be a kind of actualization, but

						sect. 2 (end) above, and <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        9.1048b">Aristot. Met.

					potential, of which it is the actualization, is incomplete.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus it is difficult to comprehend what
					motion is; for we must associate it either with privation or with
					potentiality or with absolute actuality; and apparently none of these

					remains, then, the account which we have given; that it is an

					the complete realization of the movable by that which is capable of
					causing motion, and the actualization of that which is capable of
					causing motion is identical with that of the movable.<milestone n="9.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For it must be a complete
					realization of them both; since a thing is capable of moving because
					it has the potentiality, but it moves only when it is active; but it
					is upon the movable that it is capable of acting. Thus the actuality
					of both alike is one; just as there is the same interval from one to

					which has extension in all directions, and the infinite is that which

					is apart from the elements and from which they suppose the elements to

					that it is one nature whether it applies to magnitude or to motion or

					moved or changed or increased, and time is so called on account of

					does.<milestone n="11.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But there is
					something which is moved directly per se, i.e. the essentially
					movable. The same applies to that which moves, for it moves sometimes
					accidentally, sometimes partially, and sometimes per se. There is
					something that moves directly, and something that is moved; and also a
					time in which, and something from which, and something into which it
					is moved. But the forms and modifications and place into which moving

					Non-accidental change is not found in all things, but only between
					contraries and intermediates and contradictories. We can convince
					ourselves of this by means of induction. That which changes changes
					either from positive into positive, or from negative into negative, or
					from positive into negative, or from negative into positive.<milestone n="11.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>By "positive" I mean that
					which is denoted by an affirmation. Thus there must be three forms of
					change;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for that which
					is from negative into negative is not change, because they are neither
					contraries nor contradictories, since they entail no opposition. The
					change from the negative into its contradictory positive is
					generation&mdash;absolute change absolute generation, and

					positive to the negative is destruction&mdash;absolute change
					absolute destruction, and qualified change qualified destruction.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The change from positive to
						positive is omitted here (but cf. sect. 7). Aristotle no doubt
						intended to use it as an example of non-substantial change, e.g.
						from "poor man" to "rich man"; but since this can be regarded as
						change from "poor man " to "not-poor man," or "not-rich man" to
						"rich man," he includes it as a qualified type of substantial
						change.</note><milestone n="11.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Now
					if "what is not" has several meanings, and neither that which implies

					potentiality and is opposed to unqualified Being, admits of motion
					("not-white" or "not-good," however, admits of motion accidentally,
					because "not-white" may be a man; but that which is "not so-and-so" in
					an absolute sense does not admit of it at all), then "what is not"
					cannot be moved. If this is so, generation cannot be motion; for it is
					"what is not" that is generated.<milestone n="11.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For even if the generation is in the highest
					degree accidental, still it is true to say that not-being is
					predicable of that which is generated absolutely. And the argument
					applies similarly to rest. Thus not only do these difficult
					conclusions follow, but also that everything which is moved is in a
					place, whereas "what is not" is not in a place; for then it would
					<emph>be</emph> somewhere. Nor is destruction motion; for the
					contrary of motion is motion or rest, but the contrary of destruction
					is generation. <milestone n="1068a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="11.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> And since every motion is a kind of change,

					these are the changes between contradictories, the change from

					quality, quantity and place. There is no motion<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">There is, however, change in respect of substance
						(generation and destruction), but this is between
						contradictories and is not motion in the strict sense. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 11.1067b">Aristot. Met. 11.11.6</bibl>, and sect. 4 below. The
						distinction between motion and change is not always
						maintained.</note> in respect of substance, because substance has no
					contrary; nor of the relative, because it is possible that when one of
					two related things changes the relation to it of the other thing, even
					though the thing itself does not change, may become untrue; therefore
					the motion of these related things is accidental.<milestone n="12.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Nor is there motion of the agent or
					patient, or of the mover and the thing moved, because there is no
					motion of motion nor no generation of generation, nor in general is
					there change of change. There are two ways in which there might be
					motion of motion: (1) Motion might be the subject of motion, as, e.g.,
					a man is moved because he changes from white to black; in this way
					motion might be heated or cooled or might change its place or
					increase.<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="12.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> But this is impossible,
					because the change is not a subject. Or (2) some other subject might
					change from change to some other form of existence, as, e.g., a man
					changes from sickness to health. But this is also impossible except
					accidentally.<milestone n="12.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Every
					motion is a change from one thing into something else; and the same is
					true of generation and destruction, except that these are changes into
					opposites in one sense,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc.
						contradictories.</note> while the other, i.e. motion, is a
					change into opposites in another sense.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. contraries.</note> Hence a thing changes at
					the same time from health to sickness, and from this change itself
					into another.<milestone n="12.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now clearly
					if it has fallen ill it will be already changed (for it cannot remain
					at rest) into that other change, whatever it may be; and further this
					cannot be, in any given case, any chance change; and it also must be
					from something into something else. Therefore it will be the opposite
					change, viz. becoming healthy. But this is so accidentally; just as
					there is change from recollecting to forgetting because the
					<emph>subject</emph> changes, now in the direction of knowledge
					and now in that of ignorance.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="12.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Further, we shall have an
					infinite series if there is to be change of change and becoming of
					becoming, because if the latter of two becomings comes to be from the
					former, the former must come to be too. <milestone n="1068b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>E.g.,
					if simple becoming was once coming to be, that which comes to be
					something was also once coming to be. Therefore that which simply
					comes to be was not yet, but there was already something coming to be
					coming to be something.<milestone n="12.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But this too was at one time coming to be, and therefore it was not
					at that time coming to be something. But in infinite series there is
					no first term, and therefore in this series the first term cannot
					exist, nor can any subsequent term. Therefore nothing can be either
					generated or moved or changed.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further,
					the same thing which admits of motion admits also of the contrary
					motion and of rest, and that which admits of generation admits also of
					destruction.<milestone n="12.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore that which comes to be, when it has come to be coming to
					be, is then in course of perishing<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sc. which is absurd.</note>; for it does not
					perish as soon as it is coming to be coming to be, nor afterwards,
					because that which is perishing must <emph>exist</emph> .<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">That which comes to be must
						cease to be, and it can cease to be only when it exists.
						Therefore if that which comes to be comes to be coming to be, it

						this it does not exist, but is only coming to be coming to be,
						and after this it is not "that which comes to be" but "that

					to be or changing. What then will it be? What is it that becomes
					motion or generation in the same way as it is body or soul that
					undergoes change? And moreover what is that which is the terminus of
					the motion? For that which we are considering must be a motion or
					generation <emph>of</emph> A <emph>from</emph> B <emph>into</emph>

					("substances" including not only natural but all other products).
					Things are generated either by art or by nature or by chance or
					spontaneously. Art is a generative principle in something else; nature
					is a generative principle in the subject itself<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">In natural reproduction the generative principle

					are three kinds of substance: (1.) matter, which exists individually
					in virtue of being apparent<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle is contrasting proximate with primary matter. Fire,
						the primary matter of a man, is a simple undifferentiated
						element which cannot be perceived as such, and has no
						individuality. The head, and the other parts of the body,
						considered merely as in contact and not as forming an organic
						unity, are the proximate matter of a man; they are perceptible
						and individual. Flesh (in general) represents the matter in an
						intermediate stage.</note>(for everything which is characterized
					by contact and so not by coalescence is matter and substrate; e.g.
					fire, flesh and head;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>these
					are all matter, and the last is the matter of a substance in the
					strictest sense); (2.) the "nature"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., form.</note>(existing
					individually)&mdash;i.e. a kind of positive state which is the
					terminus of motion; and (3.) the particular combination of these, e.g.
					Socrates or Callias. In
					some cases the individuality does not exist apart from the composite
					substance (e.g., the form of a house does not exist separately, except
					as the art of building;<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>nor
					are these forms liable to generation and destruction; there is a
					distinct sense in which "house" and "health" and every artificial
					product, considered in the abstract, do or do not exist<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., in the mind of the
						architect or doctor.</note>); if it does so at all, it does so
					in the case of natural objects. Hence Plato was not far wrong in
					saying<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See
						Introduction.</note> that there are as many Forms as there are kinds
					of natural objects; that is if there are Forms distinct from the
					things of our world.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Moving causes are causes in the sense
					of pre-existent things, but formal causes coexist with their effects.
					For it is when the man becomes healthy that health exists, and the
					shape of the bronze sphere comes into being simultaneously with the
					bronze sphere.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Whether any
					form remains also afterwards is another question. In some cases there
					is nothing to prevent this, e.g. the soul may be of this nature (not
					all of it, but the intelligent part; for presumably all of it cannot
					be). Clearly then there is no need on these grounds for the Ideas to
					exist; for man begets man, the individual begetting the particular
					person. And the same is true of the arts, for the art of medicine is
					the formula of health.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> In one sense the causes and
					principles are different for different things; but in another, if one
					speaks generally and analogically, they are the same for all. For the
					question might be raised whether the principles and elements of
					substances and of relations are the same or different; and similarly
					with respect to each of the other categories. But it is absurd that
					they should be the same for all; for then relations and substance
					would have the same constituents. <milestone n="1070b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="4.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> What then can their common constituent
					be? For there is nothing common to and yet distinct from substance and
					the other predicable categories, yet the element is prior to that of
					which it is an element. Moreover substance is not an element of
					relations, nor is any of the latter an element of substance. Further,
					how can all the categories have the same elements?<milestone n="4.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For no element can be the same as that
					which is composed of elements; e.g., neither B nor A can be the same
					as BA (nor indeed can any of the "intelligibles,"<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Unity and Being are called
						intelligibles as being the most universal predicates and as
						contrasted with particulars, which are sensible.</note> e.g.
					Unity or Being, be an element; for these apply in every case, even to
					composite things); hence no element can be either substance or
					relation. But it must be one or the other. Therefore the categories
					have not all the same elements.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> The truth is
					that, as we say, in one sense all things have the same elements and in
					another they have not. E.g., the elements of sensible bodies are, let
					us say, (1) as form, the hot, and in another sense the cold, which is
					the corresponding privation; as matter, that which directly and of its
					own nature is potentially hot or cold. And not only these are
					substances, but so are (2) the compounds<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This apparently refers to the elements; fire and
						air are hot matter, water and earth cold matter.</note> of which
					they are principles, and (3) any unity which is generated from hot and
					cold, e.g. flesh or bone; for the product of hot and cold must be
					distinct from them.<milestone n="4.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These
					things, then, have the same elements and principles, although
					specifically different things have specifically different elements; we
					cannot, however, say that all things have the same elements in this
					sense, but only by analogy: i.e., one might say that there are three
					principles, form, privation and matter.<milestone n="4.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But each of these is different in respect of
					each class of things,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g.,
					in the case of color they are white, black, surface; or again there is
					light, darkness and air, of which day and night are composed. And
					since not only things which are inherent in an object are its causes,
					but also certain external things, e.g. the moving cause, clearly
					"principle" and "element" are not the same; but both are causes.
					Principles are divided into these two kinds, and that which moves a
					thing or brings it to rest is a kind of principle and
					substance.<milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus
					analogically there are three elements and four causes or principles;
					but they are different in different cases, and the proximate moving
					cause is different in different cases. Health, disease, body; and the
					moving cause is the art of medicine. Form, a particular kind of
					disorder, bricks; and the moving cause is the art of
					building.<milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since
					in the sphere of natural objects the moving cause of man is man, while
					in the sphere of objects of thought the moving cause is the form or
					its contrary, in one sense there are three causes and in another four.
					For in a sense the art of medicine is health, and the art of building
					is the form of a house, and man begets man; but besides these there is
					that which as first of all things moves all things.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">For the first time the ultimate
						efficient cause is distinguished from the proximate. Aristotle
						is leading up to the description of the Prime Mover which
						occupies the latter half of the book.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Now
					since some things can exist in separation and others cannot, it is the
					former that are substances. <milestone n="1071a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>And therefore all
					things have the same causes, because without substance there can be no
					affections and motions. Next we shall see<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See Introduction.</note> that these causes are
					probably soul and body, or mind, appetite and body.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle is thinking of
						animals and human beings, which are substances in the truest
						sense.</note> Again, there is another sense in which by analogy
					the principles are the same viz. actuality and potentiality; but these
					are different for different things, and apply to them in different
					ways.<milestone n="5.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For in some
					cases the same thing exists now actually and now potentially; e.g.
					wine or flesh or man (actuality and potentiality also fall under the
					causes as already described; for the form exists actually if it is
					separable, and so does the compound of form and matter, and the
					privation, e.g. darkness or disease; and the matter exists
					potentially, for it is this which has the potentiality of becoming
					both<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., of acquiring
						either of the contrary qualities distinguished by the form and
						the privation</note>;<milestone n="5.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but the distinction in virtue of actuality and potentiality applies
					in a different sense to cases where the matter of cause and effect is
					not the same, in some of which the form is not the same but different.
					E.g., the cause of a man is (i) his elements: fire and earth as
					matter, and the particular form; (2) some external formal cause, viz.
					his father; and besides these (3) the sun and the ecliptic,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The sun, moving in the
						ecliptic, approaches nearer to the earth in summer, causing
						generation, and recedes farther from the earth in winter,
						causing destruction. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1072a">Aristot. Met. 12.6.10
							n.</bibl>, <bibl n="Aristot. GC 336a.32">Aristot. De Gen. et Corr. 336a
								32</bibl>.</note> which are neither matter nor form nor privation nor
					identical in form with him, but cause motion.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Further, we must observe that some causes can be
					stated universally, but others cannot.<milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The proximate principles of all things are the
					proximate actual individual and another individual which exists
					potentially.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the
						proximate efficient cause and proximate matter.</note><milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Therefore the proximate
					principles are not universal. For it is the particular that is the
					principle of particulars; "man" in general is the principle of "man"
					in general, but there is no such person as "man," whereas Peleus is
					the principle of Achilles and your father of you, and this particular
					B of this particular BA; but B in general is the principle of BA
					regarded absolutely.<milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again,
					even if the causes of substances are universal, still, as has been
					said,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot.       Met. 12.1070b">Aristot.
						Met. 12.4.6</bibl>.</note> different things, i.e.
					things which are not in the same genus, as colors, sounds, substances
					and quantity, have different causes and elements, except in an
					analogical sense; and the causes of things which are in the same
					species are different, not in species, but because the causes of
					individuals are different: your matter and form and moving cause being
					different from mine, although in their universal formula they are the
					same.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> As for the question what are the principles
					or elements of substances and relations and qualities, whether they
					are the same or different, it is evident that when the terms
					"principle" and "element" are used with several meanings they are the
					same for everything; but when the meanings are distinguished, they are
					not the same but different; except that in a certain sense they are
					the same for all. In a certain sense they are the same or analogous,
					because (a) everything has matter, form, privation and a moving cause;
					(b) the causes of substances may be regarded as the causes of all
					things, since if substances are destroyed everything is destroyed; and
					further (c) that which is first in complete reality<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., the prime mover.</note>
					is the cause of all things.<milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>In another sense, however, proximate causes are different; there are
					as many proximate causes as there are contraries which are predicated
					neither as genera nor with a variety of meanings<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., individual forms and
						privations of individual things.</note>; and further the
					particular material causes are different. <milestone n="1071b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Thus

						12.1.3, 4</bibl>.</note> that there are three kinds of
					substance, two of which are natural and one immutable, we must now
					discuss the last named and show that there must be some substance
					which is eternal and immutable. Substances are the primary reality,
					and if they are all perishable, everything is perishable. But motion
					cannot be either generated or destroyed, for it always existed<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 8.1">Aristot.

					can be no priority or posteriority if there is no time.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">The argument seems to be: If we
						assume that time was generated, it follows that before that
						there was no time; but the very term "before" implies time. The

					so too is motion; for time is either identical with motion or an
					affection of it.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 11.1068a">Aristot. Met. 11.12.1 n</bibl>.</note> But there is no

					are to suppose that there is something which is kinetic and productive
					although it does not actually move or produce, there will not
					necessarily be motion; for that which has a potentiality may not
					actualize it.<milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus it will
					not help matters if we posit eternal substances, as do the exponents
					of the Forms, unless there is in them some principle which can cause
					change.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">As there is not,
						according to Aristotle; cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        1.988a">Aristot. Met.

					does function, if its essence is potentiality; for there will not be
					eternal motion, since that which exists potentially may not

					must be a principle of this kind whose essence is actuality.
					Furthermore these substances<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle is now thinking not only of the prime mover (God or

					that particular way, what the cause is. For nothing is moved at
					haphazard, but in every case there must be some reason present; as in
					point of fact things are moved in one way by nature, and in another by

					primary? For this is an extremely important point. <milestone n="1072a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone n="6.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again,

					it is reasonable to suppose that the continuity of its thinking is

					mathematical objects, without imputing to them any other
					characteristic&mdash;e.g. by asking whether they are really Ideas
					or not, or whether they are principles and substances of existing
					things or not&mdash;and merely inquire whether as mathematical
					objects they exist or not, and if they do, in what sense; then after
					this we must separately consider the Ideas themselves, simply and in
					so far as the accepted procedure requires; for most of the arguments
					have been made familiar already by the criticisms of other
					thinkers.<milestone n="1.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					further, the greater part of our discussion must bear directly upon
					this second question&mdash;viz. when we are considering whether
					the substances and first principles of existing things are numbers and
					Ideas; for after we have dealt with the Ideas there remains this third
					question.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Now if the objects of mathematics
					exist, they must be either in sensible things, as some hold; or
					separate from them (there are some also who hold this view); or if
					they are neither the one nor the other, either they do not exist at
					all, or they exist in some other way. Thus the point which we shall
					have to discuss is concerned not with their existence, but with the
					mode of their existence.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> That the objects of
					mathematics cannot be in sensible things, and that moreover the theory
					that they are is a fabrication, has been observed already in our
					discussion of difficulties<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf.
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.997b">Aristot. Met. 3.2.23-30</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone n="1076b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>&mdash;the reasons being (a) that two solids
					cannot occupy the same space, and (b) that on this same theory all
					other potentialities and characteristics would exist in sensible
					things, and none of them would exist separately. This, then, has been
					already stated;<milestone n="2.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but in
					addition to this it is clearly impossible on this theory for any body
					to be divided. For it must be divided in a plane, and the plane in a
					line, and the line at a point; and therefore if the point is
					indivisible, so is the line, and so on.<milestone n="2.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For what difference does it make whether
					entities of this kind are sensible objects, or while not being the
					objects themselves, are yet present in them? the consequence will be
					the same, for either they must be divided when the sensible objects
					are divided, or else not even the sensible objects can be
					divided.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nor again can entities of
					this kind exist separately.<milestone n="2.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if besides sensible solids there are to be other solids which
					are separate from them and prior to sensible solids, clearly besides
					sensible planes there must be other separate planes, and so too with
					points and lines; for the same argument applies. And if these exist,
					again besides the planes, lines and points of the mathematical solid,
					there must be others which are separate;<milestone n="2.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for the incomposite is prior to the composite,
					and if prior to sensible bodies there are other non-sensible
					bodies,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>then by the
					same argument the planes which exist independently must be prior to
					those which are present in the immovable solids. Therefore there will
					be planes and lines distinct from those which coexist with the
					separately-existent solids; for the latter coexist with the
					mathematical solids, but the former are prior to the mathematical
					solids.<milestone n="2.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, in
					these planes there will be lines, and by the same argument there must
					be other lines prior to these; and prior to the points which are in
					the prior lines there must be other points, although there will be no
					other points prior to these.<milestone n="2.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now the accumulation becomes absurd; because whereas we get only one
					class of solids besides sensible solids, we get three classes of
					planes besides sensible planes&mdash;those which exist separately
					from sensible planes, those which exist in the mathematical solids,
					and those which exist separately from those in the mathematical
					solids&mdash;four classes of lines, and five of points;<milestone n="2.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>with which of these, then, will
					the mathematical sciences deal? Not, surely, with the planes, lines
					and points in the immovable solid; for knowledge is always concerned
					with that which is prior. And the same argument applies to numbers;
					for there will be other units besides each class of points, and
					besides each class of existing things, first the sensible and then the
					intelligible; so that there will be an infinite number of kinds of
					mathematical numbers.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again, there are the problems which we
					enumerated in our discussion of difficulties<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met.        3.997b">Aristot. Met.
						3.2.23-27</bibl>.</note>: how can they be solved? <milestone n="1077a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>For
					the objects of astronomy will similarly be distinct from sensible
					things, and so will those of geometry; but how can a heaven and its
					parts (or anything else which has motion) exist apart from the
					sensible heaven? And similarly the objects of optics and of harmonics
					will be distinct, for there will be sound and sight apart from the
					sensible and particular objects.<milestone n="2.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Hence clearly the other senses and objects of
					sense will exist separately; for why should one class of objects do so
					rather than another? And if this is so, animals too will exist
					separately, inasmuch as the senses will.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, there are certain general mathematical theorems which are not
					restricted to these substances.<milestone n="2.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Here, then, we shall have yet another kind of
					substance intermediate between and distinct from the Ideas and the
					intermediates, which is neither number nor points nor spatial
					magnitude nor time. And if this is impossible, clearly it is also
					impossible that the aforesaid substances should exist separately from
					sensible objects.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> In general, consequences result which
					are contrary both to the truth and to received opinion if we thus
					posit the objects of mathematics as definite separately-existent
					entities. For if they exist in this way, they must be prior to
					sensible spatial magnitudes, whereas in truth they must be posterior
					to them; for the incomplete spatial magnitude is in point of
					generation prior, but in point of substantiality posterior,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>as the inanimate is to the
					animate.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again, in virtue of what can we
					possibly regard mathematical magnitudes as one? Things in this world
					of ours may be reasonably supposed to be one in virtue of soul or part

					plurality and are disintegrated. But inasmuch as the former are
					divisible and quantitative, what is the cause of their unity and
					cohesion?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, the ways in which
					the objects of mathematics are generated prove our point;<milestone n="2.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for they are generated first
					in the dimension of length, then in that of breadth, and finally in
					that of depth, whereupon the process is complete. Thus if that which
					is posterior in generation<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e.,
						in the natural order of development. Thus "generation" (<foreign lang="greek">GE/NESIS</foreign>) is used in two different
						senses in this argument, which therefore becomes invalid
						(Bonitz).</note> is prior in substantiality, body will be prior
					to plane and line, and in this sense it will also be more truly
					complete and whole, because it can become animate; whereas how could a
					line or plane be animate? The supposition is beyond our powers of
					apprehension.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="2.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Further, body is a kind of substance,
					since it already in some sense possesses completeness; but in what
					sense are lines substances? Neither as being a kind of form or shape,
					as perhaps the soul is, nor as being matter, like the body; for it
					does not appear that anything can be composed either of lines or of
					planes or of points,<milestone n="2.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>whereas if they were a kind of material substance it would be
					apparent that things can be so composed. <milestone n="1077b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>Let it
					be granted that they are prior in formula; yet not everything which is
					prior in formula is also prior in substantiality. Things are prior in
					substantiality which when separated have a superior power of
					existence; things are prior in formula from whose formulae the
					formulae of other things are compounded. And these characteristics are
					not indissociable.<milestone n="2.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For if
					attributes, such as "moving" or "white," do not exist apart from their
					substances, "white" will be prior in formula to "white man," but not
					in substantiality; for it cannot exist in separation, but always
					exists conjointly with the concrete whole&mdash;by which I mean
					"white man."<milestone n="2.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus it is
					obvious that neither is the result of abstraction prior, nor the
					result of adding a determinant posterior&mdash;for the expression
					"white man" is the result of adding a determinant to
					"white."<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thus we have sufficiently
					shown (a) that the objects of mathematics are not more substantial
					than corporeal objects; (b) that they are not prior in point of
					existence to sensible things, but only in formula; and (c) that they
					cannot in any way exist in separation.<milestone n="2.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And since we have seen<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">sect. 1-3 above.</note> that they cannot exist in
					sensible things, it is clear that either they do not exist at all, or
					they exist only in a certain way, and therefore not absolutely; for
					"exist" has several senses.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> The general propositions in
					mathematics are not concerned with objects which exist separately
					apart from magnitudes and numbers; they are concerned with magnitudes
					and numbers,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>but not with
					them as possessing magnitude or being divisible. It is clearly
					possible that in the same way propositions and logical proofs may
					apply to sensible magnitudes; not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> sensible,
					but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> having certain
					characteristics.<milestone n="3.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For
					just as there can be many propositions about things merely <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> movable, without any reference to the
					essential nature of each one or to their attributes, and it does not
					necessarily follow from this either that there is something movable
					which exists in separation from sensible things or that there is a
					distinct movable nature in sensible things; so too there will be
					propositions and sciences which apply to movable things, not <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> movable but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					corporeal only; and again <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> planes only and
					<hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> lines only, and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> divisible, and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> indivisible but
					having position, and <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> indivisible
					only.<milestone n="3.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore since
					it is true to say in a general sense not only that things which are
					separable but that things which are inseparable exist, e.g., that
					movable things exist, it is also true to say in a general sense that
					mathematical objects exist, and in such a form as mathematicians
					describe them.<milestone n="3.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And just as
					it is true to say generally of the other sciences that they deal with
					a particular subject&mdash;not with that which is accidental to it
					(e.g. not with "white" if "the healthy" is white, and the subject of
					the science is "the healthy"), but with that which is the subject of
					the particular science; <milestone n="1078a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>with the healthy if
					it treats of things <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> healthy, and with man
					if <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> man&mdash;so this is also true of
					geometry. If the things of which it treats are accidentally sensible
					although it does not treat of them <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					sensible, it does not follow that the mathematical sciences treat of
					sensible things&mdash;nor, on the other hand, that they treat of
					other things which exist independently apart from these.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="3.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					Many attributes are essential properties of things as possessing a
					particular characteristic; e.g., there are attributes peculiar to an
					animal <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> female or <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi>
					male, although there is no such thing as female or male in separation
					from animals. Hence there are also attributes which are peculiar to
					things merely <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> lines or planes.<milestone n="3.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in proportion as the things
					which we are considering are prior in formula and simpler, they admit
					of greater exactness; for simplicity implies exactness. Hence we find
					greater exactness where there is no magnitude, and the greatest
					exactness where there is no motion; or if motion is involved, where it
					is primary, because this is the simplest kind; and the simplest kind
					of primary motion is uniform motion.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met.        12.1072b">Aristot. Met.

					sound, but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> lines and numbers<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Optics studies lines and

					considers man neither <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> man nor <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> indivisible, but <hi rend="Italic">qua</hi> something solid. For clearly the attributes which would have

					Hence on their view it followed by virtually the same argument that

					nearly the same as if a man who wishes to count a number of things
					were to suppose that he could not do so when they are few, and yet
					were to try to count them when he has added to them. For it is hardly
					an exaggeration to say that there are more Forms than there are
					particular sensible things <milestone n="1079a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>(in seeking for
					whose causes these thinkers were led on from particulars to Ideas);

					realm of eternal entities.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again, not one of the ways in

					that there are no Forms.<milestone n="4.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>For according to the arguments from the sciences, there will be
					Forms of all things of which there are sciences; and according to the

					will be Forms of perishable things, because we have a mental picture
					of these things. Further, of the most exact arguments some establish
					Ideas of relations, of which the Idealists deny that there is a
					separate genus, and others state the "Third Man."<milestone n="4.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And in general the arguments for the
					Forms do away with things which are more important to the exponents of
					the Forms than the existence of the Ideas; for they imply that it is
					not the Dyad that is primary, but Number; and that the relative is
					prior to number, and therefore to the absolute; and all the other
					conclusions in respect of which certain persons by following up the
					views held about the Forms have gone against the principles of the
					theory.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="4.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again, according to the assumption by which
					they hold that the Ideas exist,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>there will be Forms not only of substances but of
					many other things (since the concept is one not only in the case of
					substances but in the case of non-substantial things as well; and
					there can be sciences not only of substances but also of other things;
					and there are a thousand other similar consequences);<milestone n="4.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>but it follows necessarily
					from the views generally held about them that if the Forms are
					participated in, there can only be Ideas of substances, because they
					are not participated in accidentally; things can only participate in a
					Form in so far as it is not predicated of a subject.<milestone n="4.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>I mean, e.g., that if a thing
					participates in absolute doubleness, it participates also in something
					eternal, but only accidentally; because it is an accident of
					"doubleness" to be eternal. Thus the Ideas will be substance. But the
					same terms denote substance in the sensible as in the Ideal world;
					otherwise what meaning will there be in saying that something exists
					besides the particulars, i.e. the unity comprising their
					multiplicity?<milestone n="4.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If the

					are many but eternal, <milestone n="1079b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>and not in the case of absolute

					Forms.<milestone n="5.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>To say that
					the Forms are patterns, and that other things participate in them, is
					to use empty phrases and poetical metaphors; for what is it that
					fashions things on the model of the Ideas? Besides, anything may both
					be and come to be without being imitated from something else; thus a
					man may become like Socrates
					whether Socrates exists or
					not,<milestone n="5.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and even if
					Socrates were eternal,
					clearly the case would be the same. Also there will be several

					"two-footed" will be patterns of "man," and so too will the Idea of
					man.<milestone n="5.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further, the
					Forms will be patterns not only of sensible things but of Ideas; e.g.
					the genus will be the pattern of its species; hence the same thing
					will be pattern and copy. Further, it would seem impossible for the
					substance and that of which it is the substance to exist in
					separation; <milestone n="1080a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>then how can the Ideas, if they are the
					substances of things, exist in separation from them?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In the<title>Phaedo</title><note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 100d">Plat. Phaedo 100d</bibl>.</note> this
					statement is made: that the Forms are causes both of being and of

					generation unless there is something to impart motion; and many other
					things are generated (e.g. house and ring) of which the Idealists say
					that there are no Forms.<milestone n="5.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Thus it is clearly possible that those things of which they say that
					there are Ideas may also exist and be generated through the same kind
					of causes as those of the things which we have just mentioned, and not
					because of the Forms. Indeed, as regards the Ideas, we can collect

					the problems concerning the Ideas, we had better re-investigate the

					Now if number is a kind of entity, and has nothing else as its

						suggested by the fact that Aristotle offers no alternative

					is held of mathematical number; for in mathematical number no one unit
					differs in any way from another.<milestone n="6.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or (c) some units must be addible and others
					not. E.g., 2 is first after 1, and then 3, and so on with the other

					but the units in the Ideal 2 are inaddible to those in the Ideal
					3;<milestone n="6.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>and similarly in
					the case of the other successive numbers. Hence whereas mathematical
					number is counted thus: after 1, 2 (which consists of another 1 added
					to the former) and 3 (which consists of another 1 added to these two)
					and the other numbers in the same way, Ideal number is counted like
					this: after 1, a distinct 2 not including the original 1; and a 3 not
					including the 2, and the rest of the numbers similarly.<milestone n="6.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Or (d) one kind of number must
					be such as we first described, and another or such as the
					mathematicians maintain, and that which we have last described must be
					a third kind.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Again, these numbers must
					exist either in separation from things, <milestone n="1080b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>or not
					in separation, but in sensible things (not, however, in the way which

					if the Ideas are not numbers, they cannot exist at all;<milestone n="7.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>for from what principles can

					This being so, numbers cannot be generated as these thinkers try to

					Otherwise 4 will consist of the Ideal 2 and another 2 added to it, and

					3 and 2, and in what way can they be composed of prior and posterior
					units? All these theories are absurd and fictitious, and there can be
					no primary 2 and Ideal 3. Yet there must be, if we are to regard Unity

					things are one by contact, others by mixture, and others by position;

					distinct from both of them, so it must be with the units.<milestone n="7.21" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The fact that the units are
					indivisible will make no difference; because points are indivisible

					the 4's in 8. Hence if the original 2 is an Idea, these 2's will also
					be Ideas of a sort.<milestone n="7.23" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>And
					the same argument applies to the units, because the units in the
					original 2 produce the four units in 4; and so all the units become
					Ideas, and an Idea will be composed of Ideas. Hence clearly those
					things also of which these things are Ideas will be composite;
					<milestone n="1082b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>e.g., one might say that animals are
					composed of animals, if there are Ideas of animals.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="7.24" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> In
					general, to regard units as different in any way whatsoever is absurd
					and fictitious (by "fictitious" I mean "dragged in to support a

					neither in quantity nor in quality; and a number must be either equal

					It rather seems that it must be prior, because one of the units is

					2.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>If the number of the Ideal 3 is

					addition or by enumerating distinct portions.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is Apelt's interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">KATA\ MERI/DAS</foreign>. For this sense of

					would be well to define the differentia of a number; and of a unit, if
					it has a differentia. Now units must differ either in quantity or in
					quality; and clearly neither of these alternatives can be true. "But
					units may differ, as number does, in quantity." But if units also
					differed in quantity, number would differ from number, although equal
					in number of units.<milestone n="8.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again,
					are the first units greater or smaller, and do the later units
					increase in size, or the opposite? All these suggestions are absurd.
					Nor can units differ in quality; for no modification can ever be
					applicable to them, because these thinkers hold that even in numbers
					quality is a later attribute than quantity.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Numbers have quality as being prime or composite,
						"plane" or "solid" (i.e., products of two or three factors); but
						these qualities are clearly incidental to quantity. Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 5.1020b">Aristot. Met. 5.14.2</bibl>.</note><milestone n="8.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Further, the units cannot
					derive quality either from unity or from the dyad; because unity has
					no quality, and the dyad produces quantity, because its nature causes
					things to be many. If, then, the units differ in some other way, they
					should most certainly state this at the outset, and explain, if
					possible, with regard to the differentia of the unit, why it must
					exist; or failing this, what differentia they mean.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					Clearly, then, if the Ideas are numbers, the units cannot all be

					certain other thinkers<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 13.1076a">Aristot. Met. 13.1.4</bibl>.</note> hold concerning
					numbers.<milestone n="8.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>These are
					they who do not believe in Ideas, either absolutely or as being a kind
					of numbers, but believe that the objects of mathematics exist, and
					that the numbers are the first of existing things, and that their
					principle is Unity itself. For it is absurd that if, as they say,
					there is a 1 which is first of the 1's,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">i.e., Speusippus recognized unity or "the One" as
						a formal principle, but admitted no other ideal numbers.
						Aristotle argues that this is inconsistent.</note> there should
					not be a 2 first of the 2's, nor a 3 of the 3's; for the same
					principle applies to all cases.<milestone n="8.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now if this is the truth with regard to
					number, and we posit only mathematical number as existing, Unity is
					not a principle. For the Unity which is of this nature must differ

					Unity is a principle, then the truth about numbers must rather be as

					making peculiar assumptions; (2.) his theory must admit all the
					difficulties which confront those who speak of Ideal number.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="8.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>
					The Pythagorean view in one way contains fewer difficulties than the
					view described above, but in another way it contains further
					difficulties peculiar to itself. By not regarding number as separable,
					it disposes of many of the impossibilities; but that bodies should be
					composed of numbers, and that these numbers should be mathematical, is
					impossible.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">See
						Introduction.</note><milestone n="8.10" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> For (a) it is not true to speak of indivisible magnitudes<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is proved in <bibl n="Aristot. GC 315b.24">Aristot. De Gen. et. Corr. 315b
							24-317a 17</bibl>.</note>; (b) assuming that this view is
					perfectly true, still units at any rate have no magnitude; and how can
					a magnitude be composed of indivisible parts? Moreover arithmetical
					number consists of abstract units. But the Pythagoreans identify

					Great.<milestone n="8.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Again, what
					of the units in the Ideal 3? because there is one over. But no doubt
					it is for this reason that in an odd number they make the Ideal One
					the middle unit.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. DieIs,
						<title>Vorsokratiker</title> 270. 18.</note> If on the
					other hand each of the units comes from both Great and Small, when
					they are equalized, how can the Ideal 2 be a single entity composed of
					the Great and Small? How will it differ from one of its units? Again,
					the unit is prior to the 2; because when the unit disappears the 2
					disappears.<milestone n="8.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Therefore the unit must be the Idea of an Idea, since it is prior to
					an Idea, and must have been generated before it. From what, then? for
					the indeterminate dyad, as we have seen,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Met. 13.1082a">Aristot. Met. 13.7.18</bibl>.</note>

					it is obvious that it cannot be infinite, because infinite number is

					hold,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 12.1073a">Aristot. Met. 12.8.2</bibl>. The Platonists derived this

					this series, for they are substances or Ideas.<milestone n="8.18" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But the fact remains that they will run
					short, because the different types of animals will outnumber them. At
					the same time it is clear that if in this way the Ideal 3 is the Idea
					of Man, so will the other 3's be also (for the 3's in the same
					numbers<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Robin is probably
						right in taking this to mean that the 3 which is in the ideal 4

					was that they were pursuing their inquiry from two points of

						Introduction.</note><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.1" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Let us now mention a point
					which presents some difficulty both to those who hold the Ideal theory
					and to those who do not. It has been stated already, at the beginning
					of our treatise, among the problems.<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.999b">Aristot. Met. 3.4.8-10</bibl>,
						<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 3.1003a">Aristot. Met. 3.6.7-9</bibl>.</note> If we do
					not suppose substances to be separate, that is in the way in which
					particular things are said to be separate, we shall do away with
					substance in the sense in which we wish to maintain it; but if we
					suppose substances to be separable,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>how are we to regard their elements and
					principles?<milestone n="10.2" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If they
					are particular and not universal, there will be as many real things as
					there are elements, and the elements will not be knowable. For let us
					suppose that the syllables in speech are substances, and that their
					letters are the elements of substances. Then there must be only one
					BA, and only one of each of the other syllables; that is, if they are
					not universal and identical in form, but each is numerically one and
					an individual, and not a member of a class bearing a common
					name.<milestone n="10.3" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(Moreover, the
					Platonists assume that each Ideal entity is unique.) Now if this is
					true of the syllables, it is also true of their letters. Hence there
					will not be more than one A, nor more than one of any of the other
					letters,<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">This is, as a
						matter of fact, the assumption upon which the whole argument
						rests; Aristotle is arguing in a circle.</note> on the same
					argument by which in the case of the syllable there cannot be more
					than one instance of the same syllable. But if this is so, there will
					be no other things besides the letters, but only the
					letters.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.4" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Nor again will the elements be
					knowable; for they will not be universal, and knowledge is of the
					universal. This can be seen by reference to proofs and definitions;
					for there is no logical conclusion that a given triangle has its
					angles equal to two right angles unless every triangle has its angles
					equal to two right angles, or that a given man is an animal unless
					every man is an animal. <milestone n="1087a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.5" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> On
					the other hand, if the first principles are universal, either the
					substances composed of them will be universal too, or there will be a
					non-substance prior to substance; because the universal is not
					substance, and the element or first principle is universal; and the
					element or first principle is prior to that of which it is an element
					or first principle.<milestone n="10.6" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>All
					this naturally follows when they compose the Ideas of elements and
					assert that besides the substances which have the same form there are
					also Ideas each of which is a separate entity.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But if, as in the case of the phonetic elements,
					there is no reason why there should not be many A's and B's, and no "A
					itself" or "B itself" apart from these many, then on this basis there
					may be any number of similar syllables.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="10.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> The doctrine
					that all knowledge is of the universal, and hence that the principles
					of existing things must also be universal and not separate substances,
					presents the greatest difficulty of all that we have discussed; there
					is, however, a sense in which this statement is true, although there
					is another in which it is not true.<milestone n="10.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Knowledge, like the verb "to know," has two
					senses, of which one is potential and the other actual. The
					potentiality being, as matter, universal and indefinite, has a
					universal and indefinite object; but the actuality is definite and has
					a definite object, because it is particular and deals with the
					particular.<milestone n="10.9" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>It is
					only accidentally that sight sees universal color,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>because the particular color which it
					sees is color; and the particular A which the grammarian studies is an
					A. For if the first principles must be universal, that which is
					derived from them must also be universal, as in the case of logical
					proofs<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">"Because <foreign lang="greek">A)PO/DEICIS</foreign>" (logical or
						syllogistic proof) "must be in the first figure (<bibl n="Aristot. APo. 1.14">Aristot. An. Post. 1.14</bibl>), and in that figure
						universal premises always give a universal conclusion."
						(Ross.)</note>;
					and if this is so there will be nothing which has a separate
					existence; i.e. no substance. But it is clear that although in one
					sense knowledge is universal, in another it is not.</p>

					Again, they state the first principles, which they call elements,
					badly; some say that the Great and the Small, together with Unity

					matter, and Unity as form. Others speak of the Many and Few, because
					the Great and the Small are in their nature more suited to be the

					covers these&mdash;"the exceeding" and "the exceeded."<milestone n="1.7" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>But none of these variations
					makes any appreciable difference with respect to some of the
					consequences of the theory;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>they only affect the abstract difficulties, which these thinkers
					escape because the proofs which they themselves employ are
					abstract.<milestone n="1.8" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is,
					however, this exception: if "the exceeding" and "the exceeded" are the
					first principles, and not the Great and the Small, on the same
					principle number should be derived from the elements before 2 is
					derived; for as "the exceeding and the exceeded" is more universal

					there is something else which underlies it; e.g., in the scale there
					is the quarter-tone; in spatial magnitude the inch or foot or some
					similar thing; and in rhythms the foot or syllable. Similarly in the
					case of gravity there is some definite weight. Unity is predicated of
					all things in the same way; <milestone n="1088a" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>of qualities as a
					quality, and of quantities as a quantity.<milestone n="1.11" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>(The measure is indivisible, in the former
					case in kind, and in the latter to our senses.) This shows that unity
					is not any independent substance. And this is reasonable; because
					unity denotes a measure of some plurality, and number denotes a
					measured plurality and a plurality of measures. (Hence too it stands
					to reason that unity is not a number; for the measure is not measures,
					but the measure and unity are starting-points.)<milestone n="1.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>The measure must always be something
					which applies to all alike; e.g., if the things are horses, the
					measure is a horse; if they are men, the measure is a man; and if they
					are man, horse and god, the measure will presumably be an animate
					being, and the number of them animate beings.<milestone n="1.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If the things are "man," "white" and
					"walking," there will scarcely be a number of them, because they all
					belong to a subject which is one and the same in number; however,
					their number will be a number of genera, or some other such
					appellation.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="1.14" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Those<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. sect. 5.</note> who regard the unequal as a
					unity, and the dyad as an indeterminate compound of great and small,
					hold theories which are very far from being probable or possible. For
					these terms represent affections and attributes, rather than
					substrates, of numbers and magnitudes&mdash;"many" and "few"
					applying to number, and "great" and "small" to
					magnitude&mdash;<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>just as odd and even, smooth and rough, straight and crooked, are
					attributes.<milestone n="1.15" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Further,
					in addition to this error, "great" and "small" and all other such
					terms must be relative. And the relative is of all the categories in
					the least degree a definite entity or substance; it is posterior to
					quality and quantity. The relative is an affection of quantity, as we
					have said, and not its matter; since there is something else distinct
					which is the matter both of the relative in general and of its parts
					and kinds.<milestone n="1.16" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is
					nothing great or small, many or few, or in general relative, which is
					many or few, great or small, or relative to something else without

					of substance, absolute generation and destruction.<milestone n="1.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>There is no real change in respect of

					impossible, to represent non-substance as an element of substance and

					And further, the elements are not predicated of those things of which
					they are elements; yet "many" and "few" are predicated, both
					separately and together, of number; and "long" and "short" are
					predicated of the line, and the Plane is both broad and
					narrow.<milestone n="1.19" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>If, then,
					there is a plurality of which one term, viz. "few," is always
					predicable, e.g. 2 (for if 2 is many, 1 will be few<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        10.1056b">Aristot. Met.
						10.6.1-3</bibl>.</note>), then there will be an absolute
					"many"; e.g., 10 will be many (if there is nothing more than 10<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Aristot. Met.        13.1084a">Aristot. Met.
						13.8.17</bibl>.</note>), or 10,000. How, then, in this

						figure.</note>), and (b) existing things are not generated from
					or resolved into not-being in this sense. But not only has "not-being"
					in its various cases as many meanings as there are categories, but
					moreover the false and the potential are called "not-being"; and it is

					why there should be two whites or many colors or flavors or shapes;
					<milestone n="1089b" unit="section"/><milestone n="1" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>for then these too would be numbers and

					some affections, and some relations.<milestone n="2.17" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/>Now in the case of the other categories there
					is an additional difficulty in discovering how they are many. For it
					may be said that since they are not separable, it is because the

					length,<milestone n="20" ed="Bekker" unit="line"/>so is "level"
					in breadth, perhaps "odd" in number, and "white" in color.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.12" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Again, it is not the Ideal numbers that are the causes of harmonic
					relations, etc. (for Ideal numbers, even when they are equal, differ
					in kind, since their units also differ in kind)<note resp="Tredennick" anchored="yes">Aristotle has argued (<bibl n="Aristot. Met.        13.1080a">Aristot. Met.
						13.6-8</bibl>.) that if the Ideal numbers differ in kind,
						their units must differ in kind. Hence even equal numbers, being
						composed of different units, must be different in kind. In point
						of fact, since each ideal number is unique, no two of them could
						be equal.</note>; so on this ground at least we need not posit
					Forms.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/><milestone n="6.13" ed="P" unit="Loeb chap"/> Such, then, are the consequences of the
					theory, and even more might be adduced. But the mere fact that the
					Platonists find so much trouble with regard to the generation of Ideal
					numbers, and can in no way build up a system, would seem to be a proof
					that the objects of mathematics are not separable from sensible
					things, as some maintain, and that the first principles are not those
					which these thinkers assume.</p>
