                        <p>The Mood of a verb shows the <emph>manner</emph> in which the assertion of the verb is made.</p>
                        <p>The Greek verb has four moods, properly so called,&mdash;the
                            indicative, the subjunctive, the optative, and the imperative. The
                            infinitive, which is a verbal noun, and the participle and the verbal in
                                <foreign lang="greek">-te/os</foreign>, which are
                            verbal adjectives, are so closely connected with the moods in many
                            constructions, that they are discussed with them in Syntax.</p>
                        <p>The four proper moods, as opposed to the infinitive, are
                            sometimes called the <emph>finite</emph> moods. The
                            subjunctive, optative, imperative, and infinitive, as opposed to the
                            indicative, are sometimes called the <emph>dependent</emph> moods.</p>

                        <p>The indicative, in its most primitive use, makes a simple,
                            absolute assertion, or asks a question which includes or concerns such
                            an assertion. e.g. <foreign lang="greek">*gra/fei</foreign>,

                            perfect, pluperfect, aorist, future, and future perfect. The imperfect
                            and pluperfect occur only in the indicative; the futures are wanting in
                            the subjunctive and imperative.</p>

                        <p>These tenses may express two relations. They may designate
                            the time of an action as <emph>present, past</emph>, or
                                <emph>future;</emph> and also its character as <emph>going on, finished</emph>, or simply <emph>taking place.</emph> The latter relation is expressed
                            by the tenses in all the moods and in the infinitive and the participle;
                            the former is always expressed in the indicative, and to a certain
                            extent (to be explained below) in the dependent moods and the
                            participle.</p>

                        <p>The tenses are divided into <emph>primary</emph> tenses, which denote present or future time, and <emph>secondary</emph> or <emph>historical</emph> tenses, which denote past time. This distinction
                            applies properly only to the tenses of the indicative; but it may be
                            extended to any forms of the dependent moods which have the same
                            distinction of time as the tenses of the indicative.</p>
                        <p>The primary tenses of the indicative are the present (in its

                            tenses are the imperfect, pluperfect, and aorist (in its ordinary uses).</p>
                        <p>This distinction will be more fully explained at the end of
                            this chapter (<ref target="s165">165</ref>-191). It must be noted that the historic present <ref

                            tense, and the gnomic aorist <ref target="s154">(154)</ref> is a primary tense. </p>

                        <p>In speaking of the time denoted by any verb, we must
                            distinguish between time which is present, past, or future with
                            reference to the time of speaking or writing (that is, time <emph>absolutely</emph> present, etc.), and time which is
                            present, past, or future with reference to the time of some verb with
                            which the verbal form in question is connected (that is, time <emph>relatively</emph> present, etc.) Thus, when we say
                                <foreign lang="greek">tou=to a)lhqe/s e)stin</foreign>,
                                <gloss>this is true</gloss>, <foreign lang="greek">e)sti/n</foreign> is present with reference to the
                            time of speaking; but when we say <foreign lang="greek">e)/fh tou=to a)lhqe\s ei)=nai</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ei)=pen o(/ti tou=to a)lhqe/s e)stin</foreign> (or
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)/h</foreign>), <emph>he said that this was true</emph>, (i.e. <gloss>he said &ldquo;this is true&rdquo;</gloss>), the
                            present tense which we use denotes time present to the time of the
                            leading verb, i.e. time <emph>absolutely</emph> past and
                            only <emph>relatively</emph> present. The same
                            distinction is seen between the future in <foreign lang="greek">tou=to genh/setai</foreign>, <gloss>this will happen</gloss>, and that in <foreign lang="greek">e)/fh tou=to genh/sesqai</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)=pen o(/ti genh/setai</foreign>
                                (<foreign lang="greek">genh/soito</foreign>), <gloss>he said that this would happen</gloss>; where the
                            future in the first case is <emph>absolutely</emph>
                            future, but in the other cases is only <emph>relatively</emph> future and may be even <emph>absolutely</emph> past. Again, in <foreign lang="greek">tou=to e)ge/neto</foreign>, <gloss>this happened</gloss>, the aorist is absolutely past; but in <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/fh tou=to gene/sqai</foreign>, or
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)=pen o(/ti tou=to
                            e)ge/neto</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">ge/noito</foreign>), <gloss>he said that this had
                                happened</gloss>, it denotes time past to the time of the past
                            leading verb, and so is <emph>doubly</emph> past. But in
                            connection with a future expression an aorist, though relatively past,
                            may be absolutely future; as in <cit>

                        <p>It is a special distinction between the Greek and the English
                            idioms, that the Greek uses its verbal forms much more freely to denote

                            especially in the indicative, optative, and infinitive of indirect
                            discourse; in future forms after past tenses in final and object clauses

                            the change. Thus it may denote a customary or repeated action, or a
                            series of actions; or, if it refers to a single action (as it very
                            frequently does), it represents it in its progress rather than as a
                            simple past occurrence (like the aorist). In narration it dwells on the
                            course of an event instead of merely stating its occurrence. E.g. <list

                        <p>The perfect represents an action as already finished at the
                                <emph>present</emph> time; as <foreign lang="greek">ge/grafa</foreign>, <gloss>I have

                        <p>The pluperfect represents an action as already finished at a
                            given <emph>past</emph> time; as <foreign lang="greek">e)gegra/fein</foreign>, <gloss>I had
                                written</gloss> (that is, <emph>my writing was
                                finished at some specified past time</emph>).</p>

                        <p>The perfect, although it implies the performance of the
                            action in past time, yet states only that it <emph>stands
                                completed</emph> at the <emph>present</emph> time.
                            This explains why the perfect is classed with the present as a primary
                            tense, that is, as a tense of <emph>present</emph>
                        time.</p>

                        <p>The perfect and the pluperfect may be expressed by the
                            perfect participle with the present and imperfect of <foreign lang="greek">ei)mi/</foreign>. Here, however, each part of the
                            compound generally retains its own signification, so that this form
                            expresses more fully the continuance of the <emph>result</emph> of the action of the perfect to the <emph>present</emph> time, and of that of the pluperfect to the <emph>past</emph> time referred to. E.g. <list

                        <p>This fundamental idea of <emph>simple
                                occurrence</emph> remains the essential characteristic of the aorist
                            through all the dependent moods, however indefinite they may be in
                            regard to time. The <emph>aorist</emph> takes its name
                                (<foreign lang="greek">a)o/ristos</foreign>, <gloss>unlimited, unqualified</gloss>) from its thus
                            denoting merely the occurrence of an action, without any of the
                            limitations (<foreign lang="greek">o(/roi</foreign>) as to
                                <emph>completion, continuance, repetition</emph>,
                            etc., which belong to other tenses. It corresponds to the ordinary
                            preterite (e.g. <gloss>did, went, said</gloss>) in
                            English, whereas the Greek imperfect corresponds generally to the forms
                                <gloss>I was doing</gloss>, etc. Thus, <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)poi/ei tou=to</foreign> is <gloss>he was doing this</gloss> or <gloss>he did this habitually</gloss>; <foreign lang="greek">pepoi/hke tou=to</foreign> is <gloss>he has already

                            kind.</p>

                        <p>The aorist is distinguished from the imperfect by expressing
                            only the occurrence of an action or the entrance into a state or
                            condition, while the imperfect properly represents an action or state as
                            going on or as repeated. See the examples of the imperfect and aorist in
                                <ref target="s35">35</ref>, and compare
                                <foreign lang="greek">sunw/|kei</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">sunw/|khse</foreign> in <bibl

                                (<ref target="s55">in 55</ref>). The
                            aorist is therefore more common in rapid narration, the imperfect in
                            detailed description. It must be remembered that the same event may be
                            looked upon from different points of view by the same person; thus in
                                <bibl n="Dem. 18.71">DEM. xviii.
                            71</bibl> and <bibl n="Dem. 18.73">73</bibl>
                            (quoted in 35) <foreign lang="greek">e)/lue th\n

                                e)/luse</foreign> refer to the same thing, once as an act in progress,
                            and once as a fact accomplished. No amount of duration in an act,
                            therefore, can make the aorist an improper form to express it, provided
                            it is stated as a single past event viewed as a whole. Thus <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)basi/leuse de/ka e)/th</foreign> (see
                                <bibl n="Hdt. 2. 157">HDT. ii.
                            157</bibl>) means <gloss>he had a reign of ten
                            years</gloss>, (which is viewed as a single past event), while <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)basi/leue de/ka e)/th</foreign> might
                            refer to the same reign in the sense <gloss>he was
                                reigning during ten years.</gloss> The aorist may refer even to a
                            series of repetitions; but it takes them collectively as a whole, while
                            the imperfect would take them separately as individuals. See <cit>

                        <p>Since the same event may thus be stated by the aorist or the
                            imperfect according to the writer's point of view, it is natural that it
                            should occasionally be a matter of indifference which form is used,
                            especially when the action is of such a nature that it is not important
                            to distinguish its duration from its occurrence. For example, this
                            distinction can seldom be important in such expressions as <emph>he said, he commanded;</emph> and we find <foreign

                            fundamental distinction of the tenses, which was inherent in the form,
                            remained; only it happened that either of the two distinct forms
                            expressed the meaning which was here needed equally well. It must not be
                            thought, from these occasional examples, that the Greeks of any period
                            were not fully alive to the distinction of the two tenses and could not
                            use it with skill and nicety. But the Greeks, like other workmen, did
                            not care to use their finest tools on every occasion; and it is often
                            necessary to remember this if we would avoid hair-splitting.</p>

                            used where we should expect a perfect or pluperfect, the action being
                            merely referred to the past without the more exact specification which
                            these tenses would give. E.g. <list type="simple">

                        <p>This is a distinction entirely unknown to the Latin, which

                        <p>It is sometimes difficult here, as in the corresponding case
                            of the imperfect and the aorist indicative (<ref
                                target="s56">56</ref>; <ref target="s57">57</ref>), to see any decisive reason for preferring
                            one tense to the other; and it can hardly be doubted that the Greeks
                            occasionally failed to make use of this, as well as of other fine
                            distinctions, when either form would express the required sense equally
                            well, although they always had the distinction ready for use when it was
                            needed. Compare the present and the aorist subjunctive and optative in

                            </list> In the last example, it is obvious that the change from <foreign

                                lang="greek">komi/zointo</foreign> is connected with
                            the change from <foreign lang="greek">ei) h)=san</foreign>
                            to <foreign lang="greek">ei) eu)ergethko/tes
                            ei)=en</foreign>; but it is questionable whether the latter change is the
                            cause or the effect, and it is also quite as hard to see the reason for
                            this change in the protasis, when both conditions are equally general,
                            as for that in the final clause. Probably no two scholars would agree in
                            the reasons which they might assign for the use of the tenses in these
                            examples. It is certain, however, that either present or aorist would
                            express the meaning equally well in all these cases.</p>

                        <p>When the aorist subjunctive depends on <foreign lang="greek">e)peida/n</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">e)pa/n, e)ph/n</foreign>), <gloss>after that</gloss>, it is referred by this meaning of the particle

                            In such cases it may be translated by our future perfect when the

                            here can never depend upon a verb of simply <emph>present</emph> time, it can never refer to time absolutely <emph>past;</emph> and we use the perfect indicative in
                            translating such an aorist after a verb expressing a general truth,
                            merely because we use the present in translating the leading verb,
                            although this is properly not present but general in its time.</p>

                            the aorist subjunctive may be translated by our future perfect or

                        <p>This use of the aorist subjunctive <ref
                                target="s90">(90)</ref> sometimes seems to approach
                            very near to that of the perfect subjunctive <ref
                                target="s103">(103)</ref>; and we often translate both
                            by the same tense. But in the perfect, the idea of an action <emph>completed</emph> at the time referred to is expressed
                            by the <emph>tense</emph> of the verb, without aid from
                            any particle or from the context; in the aorist, the idea of relative
                            past time can come <emph>only</emph> from the particle or
                            the context. (<ref target="s103">See
                            103</ref> with examples, and <ref target="s104">104</ref>.) The Greek often uses the less precise
                            aorist subjunctive and optative (see <ref target="s95">95</ref>) where the perfect would be preferred but for
                            its cumbrous forms; and we sometimes give the aorist more precision than
                            really belongs to it in itself by translating it as a perfect or future
                            perfect. (See the last six examples under <ref
                                target="s90">90</ref>.) The following example
                            illustrates the distinction between the perfect and aorist

                        <p>A present or aorist infinitive (without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>) not in indirect discourse is still a
                            verbal noun so far that it expresses no time except such as is implied
                            in the context. Thus, when it depends on a verb of <emph>wishing</emph> or <emph>commanding</emph> or any
                            other verb whose natural object is a future action, or when it expresses
                            purpose, it is future without regard to its tense; as, in <foreign
                                lang="greek">bou/lomai nika=n</foreign> (or <foreign
                                lang="greek">nikh=sai</foreign>), <gloss>I wish to be victorious</gloss> (or <gloss>to gain victory</gloss>), the infinitive expresses
                            time only so far as the noun <foreign lang="greek">ni/khn</foreign> would in <foreign lang="greek">bou/lomai
                                ni/khn</foreign>. Likewise, when the present or aorist infinitive
                            (without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>) has the
                            article, except in the rare cases in which it stands in indirect
                            discourse <ref target="s794">(794)</ref>, it
                            has no reference to time in itself; as in <foreign lang="greek">to\ gnw=nai e)pisth/mhn labei=n e)stin</foreign>,
                                <gloss>to learn is to obtain knowledge</gloss>,

                        <p>The perfect subjunctive in protasis corresponds exactly to
                            the Latin future perfect indicative; but the Greek seldom uses this
                            cumbrous perfect, preferring the less precise aorist <ref
                                target="s91">(91)</ref>. The perfect optative, in both
                            protasis and apodosis, corresponds to the Latin perfect subjunctive; but
                            it is seldom used, for a similar reason <ref target="s95">(95)</ref>.</p>
                        <p>The perfect optative can hardly be accurately expressed in
                            English. For when we use the English forms <emph>would
                                have suffered</emph> and <emph>should have
                            suffered</emph> to translate the perfect optative, these are merely
                            vaguer expressions for <emph>will</emph> and <emph>shall have suffered.</emph> (See the examples above.)
                                <emph>I should have suffered</emph> is commonly past
                            in English, being equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">e)/paqon a)/n</foreign>; but here it is future, and is therefore
                            liable to be misunderstood. There is no more reference to past time,
                            however, in the perfect optative with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, than there is in the future perfect
                            indicative <ref target="s77">(77)</ref> in

                        <p>The perfect imperative is most common in the third person
                            singular of the passive, where it expresses a command that something

                        <p>The perfect infinitive sometimes signifies that the action is

                        <p>In constructions out of indirect discourse the present and
                            aorist infinitive can always refer to future time if the context
                            requires it <ref target="s96">(96)</ref>, so
                            that the future infinitive is here rarely needed. Therefore, after verbs
                            which naturally have a future action as their object but yet do not
                            introduce indirect discourse,&mdash;as those of <emph>commanding, wishing</emph>, etc. <ref target="s684">(684)</ref>,&mdash;the present or aorist infinitive
                            (not the future) is regularly used. Thus the Greek expresses <emph>they wish to do this</emph> not by <foreign
                                lang="greek">bou/lontai tou=to poih/sein</foreign>,
                            but by <foreign lang="greek">bou/lontai tou=to
                            poiei=n</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">poih=sai</foreign>). So the infinitive in other future expressions, as
                            after <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> and in its
                            final sense, is generally present or aorist. (For the single exception
                            after <foreign lang="greek">me/llw</foreign>, <ref
                                target="s73">see 73</ref>.)</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, when it was desired to make the reference
                            to the future especially prominent, the future infinitive could be used
                            exceptionally in all these cases. Thus we sometimes find the future
                            after verbs signifying <gloss>to be able, to wish, to be
                                unwilling</gloss>, and the like; sometimes also in a final sense or
                            with <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)f' w(=|te</foreign>; and sometimes when
                            the infinitive with the article refers to future time. This use of the
                            future is a partial adoption of the form of indirect discourse in other
                            constructions. It was a particularly favourite usage with Thucydides.

                        <p>This use of the present infinitive as an imperfect must be
                            carefully distinguished from its ordinary use after past tenses, where
                            we translate it by the imperfect, as in <foreign lang="greek">e)/fh to\ stra/teuma ma/xesqai</foreign>, <gloss>he said that the army was fighting.</gloss> This has
                            sometimes been called an imperfect infinitive; but here <foreign
                                lang="greek">ma/xesqai</foreign> refers to time <emph>present</emph> relatively to <foreign lang="greek">e)/fh;</foreign> whereas, if it had been used as an
                            imperfect, it would have referred to time <emph>past</emph> relatively to <foreign lang="greek">e)/fh</foreign>, as in <foreign lang="greek">e)/fh to\
                                stra/teuma th=| proterai/a| ma/xesqai</foreign>, <gloss>he said that the army had been fighting on the day
                                before.</gloss> In the former case the direct discourse was <foreign
                                lang="greek">ma/xetai</foreign>, in the latter it was
                                <foreign lang="greek">e)ma/xeto</foreign>. Such an <emph>imperfect</emph> infinitive differs from the aorist
                            in the same construction only by expressing the duration or repetition
                            of an action (as in the indicative); it gives, in fact, the only means
                            of representing in the infinitive what is usually expressed by <foreign
                                lang="greek">le/gei o(/ti e)poi/ei</foreign>, <gloss>he says that he was doing</gloss>, as opposed to
                                <foreign lang="greek">le/gei o(/ti e)poi/hsen</foreign>,
                                <gloss>he says that he did.</gloss> (For the similar
                            use of the present optative to represent the imperfect, <ref
                                target="s116">see 116</ref>, 4.) This
                            construction is never used unless the context makes it certain that the
                            infinitive represents an imperfect and not a present, so that no
                            ambiguity can arise. See the examples.</p>

                            is here paraphrasing Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.25">Il. i. 25-28</bibl>), but by no means literally. The

                            When these refer to a future object, they regularly take the future
                            infinitive in indirect discourse; but they also allow the aorist and
                            even the present infinitive (not in indirect discourse), like verbs of

                                xii. 27</bibl> we have the aorist and perfect participles together
                            with <foreign lang="greek">e)tu/gxane</foreign>, each
                            expressing its own time: <foreign lang="greek">o(/stis

                        <p>It appears from these examples that the aorist participle can
                            coincide in its time only with forms which have a similar aoristic or
                            complexive meaning, while in other cases the verb and participle are
                            distinct in time.</p>

                        <p>1. The perfect participle can always be used with the verbs
                            of 144 to denote an action which is completed at the time of the leading
                            verb. This is the most common way of expressing past time in the

                        <p>General truths are more commonly expressed in Greek, as in
                            English, by the present. The present and aorist appear together above,
                            in nearly the same sense; the gnomic aorist is, however, commonly
                            distinguished from the present by referring to a single or a sudden
                            occurrence, while the present (as usual) implies duration. Thus in <bibl

                        <p>As the optative refers sometimes to the future and sometimes
                            to the past, it exerts upon a dependent verb sometimes the force of a

                            from a past verb (as in a final clause), it has the force of a secondary
                            tense.</p>
                        <p><emph/> When B. it refers to the future, as in
                            future conditions, in its use with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, and in wishes, it is properly to be considered
                            primary. In many cases, however, a double construction is here allowed.
                            On the principle of assimilation the Greeks preferred the optative to
                            the subjunctive in certain clauses depending on an optative, the
                            dependent verb referring to the future like the leading verb, and
                            differing little from a subjunctive in such a position. A dependent
                            indicative is, however, very seldom assimilated to a leading optative.
                            Such assimilation of a dependent verb to an optative takes place <ref

                        <p>No theory of the origin of either <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> has yet helped to explain their meaning, however
                            valuable the discussion of the question may have been to comparative
                            philology. It seems to be clear that <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> is the older particle; it occurs 621 times in Homer
                            while <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> occurs 155 times;
                            in Pindar the two are nearly balanced; <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> has a preference for negative
                            sentences, being very often attached to the negative; <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is more emphatic, as
                            appears indeed from its fixed accent, while <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> is enclitic; <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> is much more frequent than <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in relative clauses in
                                Homer.<note n="1" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See Monro, <title>Homeric Grammar</title>, pp.

                            particles are used in substantially the same sense in all epic and lyric
                            poetry. In Herodotus and Attic Greek only <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is used.</p>

                            conditional relative sentences, and sometimes in final clauses with
                                <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign>, being always closely
                            joined with the particle or the relative; but never in independent
                            sentences. <ref target="s325">See 325</ref>,

                        <p>1. In epic poetry, when the independent subjunctive has
                            nearly the sense of the future indicative <ref
                                target="s284">(284)</ref>, it sometimes takes <foreign
                                lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>. This forms a future potential
                            expression, nearly equivalent to the future indicative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, and sometimes approaching the optative
                            with <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>. E.g. <cit>

                            only to the Homeric construction of the future indicative with <foreign

                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is not found in Homer with
                            the future infinitive, this construction rests chiefly on the authority
                            of passages in Attic writers, and is subject to the same doubts and
                            suspicions as the future indicative with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in those writers. (<ref

                        <p>We find fully established in the Homeric language a use of
                            the optative and the past tenses of the indicative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign>, which expresses the action of the verb
                            as dependent on circumstances or conditions; as <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoi a)/n</foreign>, <gloss>he

                        <p>It has already been seen <ref target="s13">(13)</ref> that Homer sometimes uses the optative in a
                            weak future sense, without <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, to
                            express a concession or permission. Such neutral forms seem to form a
                            connecting link between the simple optative in wishes and the optative
                            with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, partaking to a
                            certain extent of the nature of both. (For a full discussion of these
                            forms and their relations, see Appendix I.) Such expressions seem to
                            show that the early language used forms like <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoimi</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">i)/doimi</foreign> in two senses, <emph>I may go</emph> and <emph>I may see</emph>, or <emph>may I go</emph> and <emph>may I
                            see</emph>, corresponding to <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">i)/dw</foreign> in
                            their two Homeric senses <emph>I shall go</emph> and
                                <emph>I shall see</emph>
                            <ref target="s284">(284)</ref>, or <emph>let me go</emph> and <emph>let me see</emph>

                        <p>The neutral optatives like <bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.18">Il. iv. 18</bibl> are rare even in
                            Homer, the language having already distinguished the two meanings in
                            sense, and marked them in most cases by external signs. The optative
                            expressing what may happen in the future took the particle <foreign
                                lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, and was negatived by <foreign

                            which may be more or less distinctly implied. The freedom of the earlier
                            language extended the use of the potential optative to present and
                            sometimes even to past time. <ref target="s438">See 438</ref> and 440.</p>

                        <p>In most cases the limiting condition involved in the
                            potential optative is not present to the mind in any definite form, and
                            can be expressed in English only by such words as <emph>perchance, possibly</emph>, or <emph>probably</emph>, or by the auxiliaries <emph>could,
                                would, should, might</emph>, etc. with the vague conditions which
                            these imply (like <emph>if he should try, if he pleased,
                                if he could, if what is natural should happen</emph>, etc.)
                            Sometimes a more general condition is implied, like <emph>in any possible case;</emph> as <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n dexoi/mhn tou=to</foreign>, <gloss>I would
                                not accept this</gloss> (<emph>on any terms</emph>);
                            here the expression becomes nearly absolute, and may often be translated
                            by our future, as <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n
                                meqei/mhn tou= qro/nou</foreign>, <gloss>I will not
                                give up the throne</gloss> (<bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 830">AR. Ran. 830</bibl>), or (in positive
                            sentences) by <emph>must</emph>, as <foreign lang="greek">pa/ntes qauma/zoien a)\n tou=to</foreign>, <gloss>all must admire this.</gloss></p>
                        <p>The optative thus used with no conscious feeling of any <emph>definite</emph> condition, but still implying that
                            the statement is conditioned and not absolute, is the simplest and most
                            primitive potential optative. It is equivalent to the Latin potential
                            subjunctive, as <foreign lang="la">credas</foreign>,
                                <foreign lang="la">dicas</foreign>, <foreign
                                lang="la">cernas</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">putes</foreign>, etc., <emph>you
                                may believe, say, perceive, think</emph>, etc. The Homeric language
                            has six forms, all expressing futurity with different degrees of
                            absoluteness and distinctness; as <foreign lang="greek">o)/yomai, o)/yomai/ ke, i)/dwmai, i)/dwmai/ ke, i)doi/mhn,
                                i)doi/mhn ke</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>), containing every step from <emph>I shall
                                see</emph> to <emph>I should see.</emph> Of these
                            only the first and the last (with a tradition of the second) survived
                            the Homeric period, and the others (especially the fifth) were already
                            disappearing during that period <ref target="s240">(240)</ref>, being found unnecessary as the language
                            became settled, and as the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> became more fixed as a future potential form.</p>

                            preceding words. A final step in the same direction is taken when the
                            condition is actually stated as part of the sentence. As <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/lqoi a)/n</foreign> means <emph>he would go</emph> (under some future circumstances),
                            if these limiting circumstances are to be definitely expressed it is
                            natural to use the corresponding form of condition, <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the optative, as <foreign

                                <gloss>if you should command he would go.</gloss>
                            The protasis is thus assimilated to the apodosis in form, as it conforms
                            to it in sense and general character. So when a conclusion is to follow
                            such a condition as <foreign lang="greek">ei)
                            keleu/seias</foreign>, the corresponding optative with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, <gloss>i.e.</gloss>
                            the potential optative, is naturally chosen, although nothing but regard
                            to harmony and symmetry makes either <emph>if you should
                                command he will go</emph> or <emph>if you command he
                                would go</emph>, or the equivalent Greek forms, objectionable. In
                            fact, these very forms are far more common in the more fluid Homeric
                            language than in the fixed and regular style of Attic prose. There is,
                            therefore, no necessary or logical bond of union between two forms like
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei) keleu/seias</foreign> and
                                <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoi a)/n</foreign>. This
                            connexion is, indeed, far more the effect of assimilation in form, as
                            appears especially when the apodosis contains an optative in a wish; as

                        <p>As the potential optative represents a future act as
                            dependent on future circumstances <ref target="s234">(234)</ref>, so the potential indicative originally
                            represents a past act as dependent on past circumstances. Therefore,
                            while <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqen</foreign> means <emph>he went</emph>, <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqen a)/n</foreign> means <emph>he would have
                            gone</emph> (<emph>under some past circumstances</emph>).
                            It is probable that no definite limiting circumstances were present to
                            the mind when this form first came into use, so that <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqen a)/n</foreign> naturally signified merely that
                                <emph>it was likely, possible</emph>, or <emph>probable that he went</emph> or (as we express it)
                            that <emph>he might have gone</emph> or <emph>would have been likely to go</emph>, sometimes that
                                <emph>he must have gone.</emph></p>
                        <p>In this sense it appears as a past form of the potential
                            optative, e.g. of <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoi
                            a)/n</foreign> in the sense <emph>he might perchance
                            go</emph> or <emph>he would be likely to go</emph> (in
                            the future). The same relation appears in Latin, where <foreign

                                diceres</foreign>, <emph>you would have believed,
                                thought</emph>, etc.<note n="1" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">We are probably justified in assuming that the past
                                meaning which here appears in <foreign lang="la">crederes</foreign>, etc. is the original meaning of the Latin
                                imperfect subjunctive in this use, as it certainly is that of the

                            being thus made part of an unreal conditional expression, and it is not
                            necessarily implied that its action did not take place (see 412).

                            third persons. In affirmative exhortations the second and third persons
                            of the subjunctive are not regularly used, the imperative being the only

                        <p>(a) By prefixing <foreign lang="greek">dei/dw</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">fobou=mai</foreign>
                            to any of the subjunctives with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> in 261, we get the full construction with verbs of fearing;
                            as <foreign lang="greek">dei/dw mh\ nh=as e(/lwsi</foreign>,
                                <gloss>I fear they may seize the ships</gloss>, in
                            which <foreign lang="greek">mh\ e(/lwsi</foreign> represents
                            an original construction which at first followed <foreign lang="greek">dei/dw</foreign> paratactically&mdash;<emph>I fear: may they not seize the ships</emph>&mdash;
                            and afterwards became welded with it as a dependent clause. So if
                                <foreign lang="greek">dei/dw</foreign> were removed from
                            a sentence like <foreign lang="greek">dei/dw mh/ ti
                                pa/qh|sin</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.470">Il. xi. 470</bibl>, we should have an independent
                            clause like those quoted above. See <foreign lang="greek">mh\ dama/ssh|</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">dei/dw mh\ ge/nwmai</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 5.467">Od. v. 467</bibl> and <bibl n="Hom. Od. 5.473">473.</bibl></p>
                        <p>(b) In like manner, by prefixing other verbs than those of
                            fearing to such clauses, the original negative final clause with <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh/</foreign> is developed; as <foreign
                                lang="greek">maxou/meqa mh\ nh=as e(/lwsi</foreign>,
                                <gloss>we will fight that they</gloss>
                            <emph>may not seize the ships.</emph> Again, if the
                            leading clause were removed from a sentence like <foreign lang="greek">au)tou= mi/mn' e)pi\ pu/rgw|, mh\ pai=d' o)rfaniko\n
                                qh/h|s xh/rhn te gunai=ka</foreign>, <gloss>remain

                                n="Hom. Il. 6.431">Il. vi. 431</bibl>,
                            there would remain <foreign lang="greek">mh/ . . .
                            qh/h|s</foreign>, <gloss>do not make</gloss>, or <emph>may you not make</emph>, in the originally
                            independent form, like the clauses with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> in 261. (<ref
                                target="s307">See 307</ref>.)</p>

                        <p>(<foreign lang="greek">*mh\ ou)</foreign>, <gloss>with the Subjunctive.</gloss>) The clause with
                                <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> expressing desire to
                            avert an object of fear, in its original simple form as well as in the
                            developed final construction, may refer to a negative object, and
                            express fear that something <emph>may not</emph> happen.
                            Here <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)</foreign> is used with
                            the subjunctive, like <foreign lang="la">ne
                            non</foreign> in Latin.</p>
                        <p>Thus <foreign lang="greek">mh\ nh=as
                            e(/lwsi</foreign> being <emph>may they not seize the
                            ships</emph>, <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou) nh=as
                            e(/lwsi</foreign> would be <emph>may they not fail to seize
                                the ships</emph>, implying fear that they <emph>may
                                not</emph> seize them. Homer has one case of <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)</foreign> after a verb of fearing: <foreign
                                lang="greek">dei/dw mh\ ou)/ ti/s toi u(po/sxhtai
                                to/de e)/rgon</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.39">Il. x. 39.</bibl>He has several cases of <foreign

                            one in an object clause <ref target="s354">(354)</ref>. <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.28">Il. i. 28</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">mh/ nu/ toi
                                ou) xrai/smh| skh=ptron kai\ ste/mma qeoi=o</foreign>, is often cited
                            as a case of independent <foreign lang="greek">mh\

                            (an object clause, see 354), and xxiv. 569 (final), the dependence of
                            the clause with <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)</foreign> is
                            even more obvious; and in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.584">Il. xxiv. 584</bibl> we have in <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)k e)ru/saito</foreign> the decisive proof that
                            this clause is felt to be dependent in the change from the subjunctive
                            to the optative after a past tense. It is therefore more than doubtful
                            whether <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou) xrai/smh|</foreign> in
                                <bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.28">Il. i.

                            takes the clause as final and dependent (see 132). But, whether we have
                            a case of independent <foreign lang="greek">mh\
                            ou)</foreign> with the subjunctive in Homer or not, there can be no doubt
                            that this is the original form from which came the dependent final
                            clause with <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)</foreign>.</p>

                            sentences implying fear or the averting of danger, where the subjunctive
                            is the regular form. The other five express warning, and are quoted

                        <p>Four of these subjunctives are of the <foreign lang="greek">s-</foreign> class, easily confounded with the future
                            indicative, and the judgment of scholars on these has depended to a
                            great extent upon their opinion about the admissibility of the
                            subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign> and
                                <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh/</foreign> in dependent
                            object clauses <ref target="s339">(339)</ref>. This question will be discussed in 364. But it may fairly
                            be claimed, independently of the main question, that these cases of
                                <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh/</foreign> with the
                            subjunctive in <emph>prohibitions</emph> are supported by
                            the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> with the
                            subjunctive in the same sense. Thus <foreign lang="greek">mh\ dida/ch|s</foreign>, <gloss>do not teach</gloss>,
                            makes <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh\ dida/ch|s</foreign>
                            in the same sense much more natural than the positive <foreign
                                lang="greek">o(/pws dida/ch|s</foreign> would be, for
                            which there is no such analogy and little or no MS. authority. On this
                            ground the examples are given above as they stand in the MSS.</p>

                        <p>All the examples under 297 and 298 are usually printed as
                            interrogative, in accordance with Elmsley's doctrine, stated in his note
                            to <bibl n="Eur. Med. 1120">EUR. Med.
                            1120</bibl> (1151) and in the <emph>Quarterly
                            Review</emph> for June 1812. He explains <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ lalh/seis;</foreign> as meaning <emph>will you not stop prating?</emph> (lit. <emph>will you not not prate?</emph>); and when a second
                            clause in the future with <foreign lang="greek">mhde/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)lla/</foreign>
                            follows, he extends the interrogative force of <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> also to this. But this explanation
                            requires an entirely different theory to account for <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> in clauses of denial <ref
                                target="s295">(295)</ref>, where no
                            question is possible. Moreover, the five examples of the second person
                            of the subjunctive quoted under 295, taken in connection with those in
                            297 and 298, are sufficient to show the impossibility of separating the
                            two constructions in explanation. One of the examples in 298 (<bibl
                                n="Aristoph. Cl. 296">AR. Nub.
                            296</bibl>), where the imperative <foreign lang="greek">eu)fh/mei</foreign> follows in the clause with <foreign lang="greek">a)lla/</foreign>, seems decisive against the
                            interrogative theory. The examples under 299 are really interrogative;
                            but they consist practically of an exhortation followed by a prohibition
                            (both being interrogative), and contain no construction with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> at all.</p>

                        <p>In most modern editions of the classics the subjunctive is
                            not found in the construction of 297; and in many cases the first aorist
                            subjunctive in <foreign lang="greek">-sh|s</foreign> has
                            been emended to the future, against the authority of the MSS., in
                            conformity to Dawes's rule. (<ref target="s364">See 364</ref>.) Thus, in <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 296">AR. Nub. 296</bibl> and <bibl
                                n="Aristoph. Cl. 367">367</bibl> the
                            MSS. have the subjunctive; and in <cit>

                            </cit> could not be changed to <foreign lang="greek">ou)
                                mh\ skw/yeis</foreign>, as the future of <foreign lang="greek">skw/ptw</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">skw/yomai</foreign>. Elmsley's emendation <foreign
                                lang="greek">skw/yei</foreign>, which is adopted by
                            most editors, requires a greater change than should be made merely to
                            sustain an arbitrary rule, which rests on no apparent principle. If both
                            constructions (295 and 297) are explained on the same principle, there
                            is no longer any reason for objecting to the subjunctive with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> in prohibitions; and it
                            seems most probable that both future indicative and subjunctive were
                            allowed <emph>in both constructions</emph>, but that the
                            subjunctive was more common in clauses of denial, and the future in
                            clauses of prohibition.</p>

                            construction (the subjunctive for the future indicative), still the
                            distinction between classes A and B is very strongly marked. An object
                            clause, as we have seen, can stand in apposition to a preceding <foreign
                                lang="greek">tou=to</foreign>; whereas a final clause
                            would stand in apposition to <foreign lang="greek">tou/tou
                                e(/neka</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">e)/rxetai
                                tou/tou e(/neka, i(/na h(mi=n bohqh/sh|</foreign>, <gloss>he comes for this purpose</gloss>, <emph>viz., that he may assist us.</emph> The two can be
                            combined in one sentence; as <foreign lang="greek">spouda/zei o(/pws plouth/sei, i(/na tou\s fi/lous eu)=
                            poih=|</foreign>, <gloss>he is eager to be rich</gloss>,
                                <emph>that he may benefit his friends.</emph></p>
                        <p>Care must be taken not to mistake the nature of an object
                            clause with <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign> when its
                            subject is attracted by the leading verb; as <foreign lang="greek">sko/pei th\n po/lin o(/pws swqh/setai</foreign> for
                                <foreign lang="greek">sko/pei o(/pws h( po/lis

                            construction becomes a subject clause in the equivalent passive form; as
                                <foreign lang="greek">e)pra/tteto o(/pws summaxi/an

                            clauses with the simple <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>.
                            Thus <foreign lang="greek">a)po/stixe, mh/ ti noh/sh|

                            presents the form of an original paratactic expression, which would mean
                                <emph>withdraw:&mdash;may not</emph> (or <emph>let not</emph>) <emph>Hera notice
                                anything</emph>, the latter clause being like <foreign lang="greek">mh\ dh\ nh=as e(/lwsi</foreign>, <gloss>may they not take the ships</gloss> ( <bibl

                            sentences as these last imply fear or anxiety lest the event may happen
                            which <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> with the
                            subjunctive expresses a desire to avert; and in a primitive stage of the
                            language they might naturally be preceded by a verb of fearing, to which
                            the (still independent) subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> would stand in the relation of an
                            explanatory clause defining the substance of the fear. Thus <foreign
                                lang="greek">dei/dw:&mdash;mh\ nh=as
                            e(/lwsi</foreign> would originally be two independent sentences, <emph>I fear:&mdash;may they not take the ships;</emph>
                            but would in time come to be felt as a single sentence, equivalent to
                            our <emph>I fear that</emph> (<emph>lest</emph>) <emph>they may take the ships.</emph> After
                                <foreign lang="greek">fobou=mai mh\ tou=to
                            pa/qwsin</foreign> (for example) was domesticated in the sense <emph>I fear lest they may suffer this</emph>, the second
                            clause followed the ordinary course, and began to be felt as a
                            thoroughly dependent clause; and when the leading verb became past, the
                            subjunctive became optative, as <foreign lang="greek">e)fobh/qhn mh\ tou=to pa/qoien</foreign>, <gloss>I
                                feared lest they might suffer this.</gloss> When this stage is
                            reached, all feeling of the original independence may be said to have
                            vanished and a dependent clause is fully established. As this decisive
                            evidence of complete dependence is constantly found in the Homeric
                            language, we cannot suppose that such an expression as <foreign
                                lang="greek">dei/doika mh/ ti pa/qwsin</foreign> (
                                <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10.538">Il. x.
                            538</bibl>) was still felt to be composed of two independent sentences,
                            although the original paratactic form is precisely preserved. Indeed, we
                            have no evidence that the step from parataxis to hypotaxis was taken
                            after the Greek language had an independent existence.<note n="1"

                            serving as a connective, so that the want of a final conjunction was not
                            felt. Here also the feeling of dependence is shown by the subjunctive
                            becoming optative when the leading verb is past; as in <foreign

                            derivation is uncertain. It appears in Homer as a fully developed final

                            manner, derived from the stem <foreign lang="greek">o(-</foreign> of the relative <foreign lang="greek">o(/s</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tws</foreign>

                            the subjunctive, like other final relatives, which in Homer hardly ever

                            the Homeric usage was established, the final element had so far
                            obliterated the relative, that the conditional force of <foreign

                            weakened. The expression in Homer ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.84">Il. xvi. 84</bibl>) may have meant <emph>obey that</emph> (<emph>if so

                            examples under 326.) The same is true of the less common use of <foreign

                            prose, is a question which at this distant day we have hardly the power
                            to answer, and each scholar will be guided by his own feeling as he
                            reads the expressions. (See 326; 328; 348.) It certainly can be seen in
                            some of Xenophon's uses of <foreign lang="greek">w(s
                            a)/n</foreign> with the subjunctive; see <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 2. 4. 28">Cyr. ii. 4</bibl> and <bibl

                            in either construction. It first becomes frequent in the Attic poets. In
                            Thucydides and Xenophon it is the most common final particle; and in
                            these writers, as in tragedy, its final use greatly exceeds its use in
                            object clauses. The latter, however, far exceeds the final use in
                            Herodotus, Plato, and the orators; but here <foreign lang="greek">i(/na</foreign> has gained almost undisputed
                            possession of the field as a final particle.</p>

                            afterwards maintains itself vigorously by the side of the simple <foreign

                            most common final particle in Homer is <foreign lang="greek">o)/fra</foreign>, which is originally a temporal
                            particle, meaning <emph>while</emph> (<emph>so long as</emph>) and then <emph>until.</emph> From the last meaning the final force was naturally
                            developed, as the idea of <emph>until</emph>, when it
                            looks forward to the future, may involve that of aiming at an object to
                            be attained, as in English <emph>we shall fight until we

                                <foreign lang="greek">e(/ws</foreign>, is used in a
                            final sense in a few passages of the Odyssey (614, 2). Both of the

                            appear in full vigour in Homer; but its final character must have been
                            more distinctly marked at an earlier period than that of either <foreign

                            need of these final particles was first felt, as has been shown <ref

                            clauses of purpose, as a negative purpose could always be expressed by
                            the simple <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, which thus
                            became in use a conjunction. Still the final particles were as well
                            suited to negative as to positive final clauses, and they could always
                            be prefixed to <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, which
                            thus was restored to its natural place as a negative adverb. Thus <foreign

                                Aristophanes it is 8 : 55; in Herodotus, 8 : 53. In Attic prose
                                (except in Plato and Xenophon) the simple <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> in final clauses almost vanishes.
                                Thucydides has only 4 or 5 cases; the ten orators only 4

                            the fact that, while clauses introduced by the final particles are

                        <p>For the relative frequency of the final particles, see
                            Appendix III.</p>
                    
                    <milestone unit="smythp" id="s318" n="318"/>
                        <p>As final clauses after past tenses express some person's
                            previous purpose or motive, they allow the double construction of
                            indirect discourse (667, 1); so that, instead of the optative, they can
                            have the <emph>mood</emph> and <emph>tense</emph> which the person himself would have used in conceiving the
                            purpose. Thus we can say either <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqen i(/na i)/doi</foreign>, <gloss>he came that
                                he might see</gloss>, or <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqen
                                i(/na i)/dh|</foreign>, because the person himself would have said
                                <foreign lang="greek">e)/rxomai i(/na i)/dw</foreign>,
                                <gloss>I come that I may see.</gloss></p>
                        <p>Hence the subjunctive in final clauses after past tenses is
                            very common, in some writers even more common than the regular optative.

                                It may perhaps be thought that the subjunctive after <foreign

                                view seems, on the whole, much the more natural; but the potential

                        <p>When an aorist subjunctive active or middle was to be used

                                lang="greek">o(/pws mh/</foreign> in any construction,
                            the second aorist was preferred to a first aorist in <foreign lang="greek">-sw</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">-swmai</foreign>, if both forms were in use. This preference arose
                            from the great similarity in form between these sigmatic aorists and the
                            future indicative (as between <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/sh|</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/sei, bouleu/shtai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/setai</foreign>). This made it natural also for
                            a writer to avoid those forms of the subjunctive which were nearly
                            identical with the future indicative where the latter could be used as
                            well. This of course does not apply to the first aorist subjunctive
                            passive, which has no resemblance to the future; and there is no reason
                            for applying it to liquid aorists like <foreign lang="greek">mei/nw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">sfh/lw</foreign>.</p>

                        <p>The general rule laid down by Dawes more than a century ago
                                (<emph>Misc. Crit.</emph> pp. 222 and 228), the
                            so-called <emph>Canon Davesianus</emph>, which declared
                            the first aorist subjunctive active and middle a solecism after <foreign
                                lang="greek">o(/pws mh/</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign>, was extended by others
                            so as to include <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign>
                            (without <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>), and the Greek
                            authors were thoroughly emended to conform to it. As this rule has no
                            other foundation than the accidental circumstance just mentioned <ref
                                target="s363">(363)</ref>, it naturally
                            fails in many cases, in some of which even emendation is impossible. In
                            the first place, there is no reason for applying the rule to pure final
                            clauses, in which the future indicative is exceptional <ref

                            which the best Mss. have the subjunctive. Indeed, where the reading is
                            doubtful, the subjunctive should be preferred in these cases. Secondly,
                            in independent prohibitions with <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh/</foreign>, although the future is the regular form, there
                            is less objection to the subjunctive (even the first aorist) than in
                            positive commands with simple <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign>, since the analogy of the common <foreign lang="greek">mh\ poih/sh|s tou=to</foreign>, <gloss>do not do this</gloss>, supports <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh\ poih/sh|s tou=to</foreign> in the same
                            sense <ref target="s283">(283)</ref>. There
                            is no such analogy, however, to justify such a positive command as
                                <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws poih/sh|s tou=to</foreign>,
                                <gloss>do this</gloss>, and this form has much less
                            manuscript authority to rest on. Thirdly, in the case of <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign>, if both constructions
                            (denials and prohibitions) are explained on the same principle, no
                            reason exists for excluding the subjunctive from either; and it cannot
                            be denied that both the first and the second aorist subjunctive are
                            amply supported by the manuscripts. (<ref target="s301">See 301</ref>.) Fourthly, in object clauses with
                                <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign> there is so great
                            a preponderance of futures over subjunctives, that the presumption in
                            all doubtful cases is here in favour of the future, as it is in favour
                            of the subjunctive in pure final clauses. A much stronger case,
                            therefore, is made out by those who (like Weber and most modern editors)
                            change all sigmatic aorist subjunctives in <emph>this</emph> construction to futures. Some cases, however, resist
                            emendation; as <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 5.6.21">XEN. An. v. 6, 21</bibl> , <foreign lang="greek">keleu/ousi prostateu=sai o(/pws e)kpleu/sh| h( stratia/</foreign>,
                            where we cannot read <foreign lang="greek">e)kpleu/sei</foreign>, as the future is <foreign lang="greek">e)kpleu/somai</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">e)kpleusou=mai</foreign>. In <bibl n="Dem. 1.2">DEM. i. 2</bibl>, all Mss. except one
                            read <foreign lang="greek">paraskeua/sasqai th\n taxi/sthn
                                o(/pws e)nqe/nde bohqh/shte kai\ mh\ pa/qhte tau)to/n</foreign>, and
                            it seems very arbitrary to change <foreign lang="greek">bohqh/shte</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">bohqh/sete</foreign> and leave <foreign lang="greek">pa/qhte</foreign>. But a few cases like these weigh little against
                            the established usage of the language, and we must perhaps leave the
                            venerable <emph>Canon Davesianus</emph> undisturbed in
                            the single department of object clauses with <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign>, although we may admit an occasional
                            exception even there.</p>

                        <p>It is impossible to discuss intelligently the origin of the

                            particles <foreign lang="greek">ei), ai), a)/n</foreign>,
                            and <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> are determined. On
                            these questions we have as yet little or no real knowledge. The theory
                            of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">ai)</foreign> which identifies it with
                            the pronominal stem <emph>sva</emph> (<foreign lang="greek">sve</foreign>), Oscan <emph>svai</emph>, and Latin <foreign lang="la">si</foreign>, is perhaps the most common. By this the original meaning
                            of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, or rather of one of
                            its remote ancestors in some primitive language, would be <emph>at a certain time</emph> (or <emph>place</emph>), <emph>in a certain way.</emph><note

                            But, even on this theory, we can hardly imagine any form of <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> as existing in the <emph>Greek</emph> language until the word had passed at
                            least into the relative stage, with the force of <emph>at
                                which time</emph> (or <emph>place</emph>), <emph>in which way, under which circumstances.</emph> It
                            cannot be denied that the strong analogy between conditional and
                            relative sentences and the identity of most of their forms give great
                            support to any theory by which the conditional sentence is explained as
                            an outgrowth of the relative, so that the conditional relative sentence
                            is made the original conditional construction. Thus <foreign lang="greek">ei) h)=lqen</foreign> might at some time have meant
                                <emph>in the case in which he went</emph>, and <foreign

                            purely theoretical ground; and we must content ourselves practically
                            with the fact, that in the earliest Greek known to us <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> was fully established in
                            its conditional sense, like our <emph>if</emph> and Latin
                                <foreign lang="la">si.</foreign></p>

                        <p>The regular types of the conditional sentence, which are
                            given above (390-395) as they appear in Attic prose, have been mainly
                            sifted from a rich variety of forms which are found in earlier Greek. In
                            Homer we have all tenses of the indicative used as in Attic Greek,
                            except that the imperfect has not yet come to express an unreal <emph>present</emph> condition, but is still confined to
                            the past. The future indicative sometimes has <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> in protasis, and the future with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> can stand in apodosis. The subjunctive
                            in protasis can have <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ ke</foreign>
                            (even <foreign lang="greek">ei) a)/n</foreign>), <foreign
                                lang="greek">h)/n</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> alone; and it can stand in a future
                            apodosis either alone or with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> (like
                            the optative). The optative sometimes has <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ ke</foreign> in protasis, and occasionally stands
                            in apodosis without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or
                                <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign>. Once we find <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)/ ke</foreign> with the aorist
                            indicative ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.526">Il.

                        <p>Thus, while we have in Attic prose two stereotyped forms of

                            variety of combination of these. (For the details and examples, see

                        <p>There is a tendency in Homer to restrict the subjunctive with
                            simple <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> (without <foreign
                                lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>) to general conditions <ref
                                target="s468">(468)</ref>, and a similar
                            but less decided tendency to restrict the subjunctive with conditional
                            relatives without <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or
                                <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> to the generic
                            relative construction <ref target="s538">(538)</ref>. But the general condition with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> appears in Homer in a primitive stage,
                            compared with the corresponding relative construction, which is fully
                            developed. Both subjunctive and optative are freely used in general
                            relative conditions in Homer, as in Attic Greek; while in general
                            conditions with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> the
                            subjunctive occurs only nineteen times and the optative only once <ref
                                target="s468">(468)</ref>. On the
                            supposition that the clause with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> is derived from the relative clause, this would appear as
                            the ordinary process of development.</p>

                        <p>It is perhaps the most natural view of the various

                            two subjunctives, and one with two optatives, e.g. <foreign lang="greek">ei) dw=| tou=to, e(/lwmai</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) doi/h tou=to, e(loi/mhn</foreign>.
                            The particle <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> would then
                            begin to be allowed in both of these conditions and conclusions, giving
                            to each more distinctly its force as a protasis or an apodosis.<note

                                attempted to define their force, except so far as they emphasise
                                what we see by usage may be implied by the sentence without their
                                aid.</note> It would thus be allowed to say <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ ke dw=| tou=to, e(/lwmai/ ke</foreign> and <foreign

                            ke</foreign>, both of which forms actually occur in Homer. Gradually the
                            tendencies of the language restricted the use of <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> more and more to the subjunctive in
                            protasis and the optative in apodosis, although for a time the usage was
                            not strict. This state of transition appears in Homer, who preserves
                            even a case of an otherwise extinct use of <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ ke</foreign> with the aorist indicative. Shortly
                            before this stage, however, a new tendency was making itself felt, to
                            distinguish the present general condition from the particular in form,
                            the way being already marked out by the conditional relative sentence.
                            As this new expression was to be distinguished from both the really
                            present condition <foreign lang="greek">ei)
                            bou/letai</foreign> and the future <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ ke bou/lhtai</foreign>, the half-way form <foreign lang="greek">ei) bou/lhtai</foreign> (which had nearly given place
                            to <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ ke bou/lhtai</foreign> in
                            future conditions) came into use in the sense <emph>if he

                                conditions would first take the simple <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, as is here supposed.</note> This
                            would soon develop a corresponding form for use after past tenses,

                                target="s468">See 468</ref>.) It would hardly be
                            possible to keep the two uses of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the subjunctive distinct in form, and in time the form
                            with <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> (or <foreign

                            see this process too in transition in Homer, where <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ ke</foreign> or some form of <foreign lang="greek">ei) a)/n</foreign> is used in all future conditions
                            except nine, and has intruded itself into five of the nineteen general
                            conditions. We must suppose a corresponding process in regard to <foreign
                                lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in conditional relative clauses to have
                            gone on before the Homeric period, with more complete results.<note

                        <p>It is important to notice that a future indicative of this
                            kind could not be changed to a subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">e)a/n</foreign> without an entire change of sense and
                            time. It must therefore be distinguished from the future in <emph>future</emph> conditions, where it is generally
                            interchangeable with the subjunctive <ref target="s447">(447)</ref>. Here it is nearly equivalent to the
                            periphrastic future expressed by <foreign lang="greek">me/llw</foreign> and the infinitive <ref target="s73">(73)</ref>, in which the tense of <foreign lang="greek">me/llw</foreign> (as in <foreign lang="greek">ei) me/llousi tou=to poiei=n</foreign> = <foreign

                            that the condition is really present and not future. So with the Latin

                        <p>When the protasis states a present or past supposition,

                        <p>The imperfect here, in either protasis or apodosis, refers to

                        <p>These examples show the fully developed construction, as it
                            appears in the Attic writers and in Herodotus. For the more primitive
                            Homeric usage, <ref target="s435">see
                            435</ref> and 438.</p>
                    
                    <milestone unit="smythp" id="s411" n="411"/>
                        <p>This construction is equivalent to that of the Latin
                            imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive in protasis and apodosis. With
                            regard to the tenses, the Latin imperfect subjunctive represents the
                            Greek imperfect indicative referring to present time, and rarely that
                            referring to past time; while the Latin pluperfect subjunctive
                            represents the Greek aorist and pluperfect indicative, and also most
                            cases of the Greek imperfect referring to past time.</p>
                    
                    <milestone unit="smythp" id="s412" n="412"/>
                        <p>1. It will be seen that, when this construction is used, it
                            is usually implied not merely that the condition of the protasis is not
                            (or was not) fulfilled but <emph>also</emph> that the
                            action of the apodosis does not (or did not) take place; thus <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) tou=to ei)=pon, e)pei/sqh
                            a)/n</foreign>, <gloss>if I had said this</gloss>, <emph>he would have been persuaded</emph>, generally
                            implies not merely that <emph>I did not say this</emph>
                            but also that <emph>he was not persuaded.</emph> But this
                            denial of the apodosis is not an essential character of the
                            construction, as we can see if we change the apodosis to <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou)k a)\n e)pei/sqh</foreign>, <gloss>he would not have been persuaded</gloss>, when it is
                            not implied that <emph>he really was persuaded.</emph> We
                            have seen that there is nothing in the nature of the potential
                            indicative which makes a denial of its action necessary <ref
                                target="s244">(244)</ref>; and when this
                            form is made the apodosis of an unreal condition, it simply states that
                            something would happen (or would have happened) in a case which did not
                            arise. Denial of the apodosis can follow as a logical inference from
                            denial of the protasis only in the rare cases in which the unreal
                            condition is the only one under which the action of the apodosis could
                            have taken place, as when we say <emph>if the moon had
                                entered the earth's shadow, she would have been eclipsed</emph>,
                            where the denial of either clause carries with it by necessity the
                            denial of the other. But if we say <emph>if it had
                                rained, the ground would be wet</emph>, the denial of the protasis
                            cuts off only one of many conditions under which the ground might be
                            wet. Such sentences as this are, however, very common, though they are
                            not used to prove the opposite of the apodosis (that <emph>the ground is not wet</emph>); but they are arguments
                            in which the apodosis is assumed to be false (on the ground of
                            observation or experience), and from this it is argued that the
                            assumption of the protasis is false; that is, <emph>since
                                the ground is not wet</emph> (as we can see), <emph>it cannot have rained</emph>, which is a good argument. This is the
                            case in <bibl n="Thuc. 1. 9">THUC. i.
                            9</bibl>, and <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 516E">PLAT. Gorg. 516 E</bibl> (quoted in 410, above); where it is argued
                            that Agamemnon <emph>had a navy</emph> because this was a
                            necessary condition of his ruling islands, and that certain persons were
                                <emph>not good men</emph> because they suffered what
                            they did, the facts of ruling islands and of suffering being assumed in
                            the argument as established on independent evidence. In other cases,
                            where it is stated that the apodosis would follow as a consequence from
                            the fulfilment of the condition, as in <cit>
                                <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 45">SOPH. Aj. 45,</bibl>
                                <quote lang="greek">ka)\n e)cepra/cat' ei)

                            </cit>, <gloss>he would even have accomplished it, if I
                                had been careless</gloss>, whatever negation of the apodosis is
                            implied (here <foreign lang="greek">ou)k
                            e)cepra/cato</foreign>) comes from a feeling that when the only condition
                            under which it is stated that an action would have taken place fails,
                            there is no reason for believing it to have taken place at all. We may
                            doubt whether any negation of the apodosis is implied in the <emph>form of expression</emph> in such cases. Certainly,
                            in many cases in which the apodosis states a consequence which would
                            follow from the action of an unreal protasis, this negation is assumed
                            as already known apart from the construction; thus in <bibl
                                n="Soph. El. 556">SOPH. El. 556</bibl>
                            (quoted in 410) the apodosis means <emph>you would not
                                then be offensive to listen to</emph>, and the only ground on which
                            we mentally add <emph>as you now are</emph> is our
                            knowledge of Clytaemnestra's feeling towards Electra. If the sentence
                            were <emph>if all men began their speeches politely, they
                                would not be offensive</emph>, we should not think of supplying
                                <emph>as they now are</emph> without some knowledge
                            of the facts.</p>
                        <p>2. When the sentence merely affirms or denies that one act,
                            if it had occurred, would be accompanied by another act, and there is no
                                <emph>necessary</emph> relation between the two acts
                            as cause and effect, and there is no argument drawn from the admitted
                            unreality of the conclusion to prove the opposite of the condition, no
                            denial of the apodosis is implied in the expression, although we may
                            know from the context or in some other way that the action of the
                            apodosis does not (or did not) occur. Thus in <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 17D">PLAT. Ap. 17 D</bibl>, <foreign

                        <p>In the unreal conditional sentence, therefore, the unreality
                            of the supposition is always implied, and that of the apodosis is
                            generally either assumed or implied. The implied opposite of an
                            imperfect is always a present or imperfect, that of an aorist is an

                        <p>Sometimes an aorist not referring to past time is found in
                            the apodosis, after a protasis in the imperfect referring to the

                            the imperfect would express, and for the same reason it cannot be
                            strictly present; in effect it does not differ much from an aorist
                            optative with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, the

                        <p>A peculiar form of potential indicative without <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> consists of an infinitive
                            depending on the imperfect of a verb of <emph>obligation,
                                propriety</emph>, or <emph>possibility</emph>, like
                                <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei, xrh=n</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)xrh=n, ei)ko\s h)=n</foreign>, or
                                <foreign lang="greek">prosh=ken</foreign>. This
                            expression refers to past or present time, and generally implies a
                            denial of the action of the infinitive. Thus <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei tou=ton a)poqanei=n</foreign> in this idiomatic
                            use means <emph>he ought to have perished</emph> (<emph>but did not</emph>); <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei h(ma=s tou=to poiei=n</foreign> means <emph>we ought to be doing this</emph> (<emph>but we are not</emph>) or <emph>we
                                ought to have done this</emph> (<emph>but we did not
                                do it</emph>). This combination contains in other words what might
                            have been expressed substantially by a past indicative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> of the verb of the
                            infinitive, qualified by an adverb or other expression denoting
                            obligation, propriety, or possibility: thus <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei tou=ton a)poqanei=n</foreign> is (as a
                            construction) equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ou(=tos
                                dikai/ws</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">a)ci/ws</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">a)\n
                            a)pe/qanen</foreign>, <gloss>he would justly have
                            perished</gloss>, and <foreign lang="greek">ei)ko\s h)=n
                                se tou=to paqei=n</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">tou=to ei)ko/tws a)\n e)/paqes</foreign>, <gloss>you would properly have suffered this</gloss>
                            (implying <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)/paqes</foreign>).
                            Strictly, the expression involves also an unreal protasis, as (in the
                            last case) <foreign lang="greek">ei) to\ ei)ko\s
                            e)/paqes</foreign>, which with the apodosis <foreign lang="greek">tou=to e)/paqes a)/n</foreign> appears substantially
                            in <foreign lang="greek">ei)ko\s h)=n se tou=to

                        <p>When the present infinitive is used, the expression is

                        <p>II. When this form is made the apodosis of an unreal
                            condition (expressed or distinctly implied), it states that what the
                            infinitive denotes would necessarily, properly, or possibly be done (or
                            have been done) if the case supposed were a real one. The chief force of
                            the apodosis here always lies in the infinitive, while the leading verb
                            acts as an auxiliary (which we can generally express by <emph>ought, might</emph>, or <emph>could</emph>, or by an adverb), modifying the idea of the infinitive
                            more or less in different cases. But when the chief stress is laid on
                            the necessity, propriety, or possibility of the act, and not on the act
                            itself, so that the real apodosis is in the leading verb, this takes

                                <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is added, the force
                            of the infinitive is so modified by the idea of the leading verb that

                            with the infinitive (without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>) from <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei

                            the chief force of the apodosis falls on the infinitive, the leading
                            verb being an auxiliary (see 420); but the leading verb takes <foreign

                            cases expresses merely what <emph>could happen</emph>,

                            optatives (with more exactness than they really possess) either as past
                            or as future. In one case the feeling of past time is seen in the

                        <p>(<emph>a</emph>) Herodotus has a few cases of
                            the potential optative with the same vague reference to time which has
                            been noticed in Homer <ref target="s442">(442)</ref>, and we may sometimes translate these, like those in
                            Homer, by past expressions. E.g. <foreign lang="greek">*ta/xa de\ a)\n kai\ oi( a)podo/menoi le/goien a)piko/menoi e)s

                            Stein's note). All that the optative itself seems to express is that
                            this would be a natural story for them to tell. In vii. 214, <foreign

                        <p>The English, especially the colloquial language, seldom
                            expresses the distinction between this form of the future condition and
                            the present condition <ref target="s402">(402)</ref>. Thus modern custom allows us to use the inexact
                            expression <emph>if he wishes</emph>, not merely for
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei) bou/letai</foreign>, <gloss>if he now wishes</gloss>, but also for <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)a\n bou/lhtai</foreign>, <gloss>if he shall wish.</gloss> The sense, however,
                            generally makes the distinction in time clear.</p>
                        <p>It is worth noting that the Authorised Version of the English
                            New Testament never uses forms like <emph>if he does, if
                                he is</emph>, in either future or present conditions, even when the
                            Greek has the present indicative with <foreign lang="greek">ei);</foreign> but it has either the subjunctive or
                            the future indicative in future conditions, and the subjunctive in
                            present conditions. The Revised Version, on the other hand, admits the
                            present indicative (as <emph>if he is</emph>) in present
                            conditions, but not consistently. See <bibl n="Luke 23. 35">LUC. xxiii. 35</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ei) ou(=to/s e)stin o( *xristo/s</foreign>, V. <emph>A. if he be Christ</emph>, R. V. <emph>if this is the Christ;</emph> but in MATTH. vi. 23, <foreign

                            The future indicative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> is often used in the protasis to express a future
                            condition. This is a still stronger form of expression than the
                            subjunctive, though it sometimes alternates with it in the same
                            sentence. Both, however, correspond to the English <emph>if I shall do this, if I do this</emph>, etc. The future, as an
                            emphatic form, is especially common when the condition contains a strong
                            appeal to the feelings or a threat or warning.<note n="1"

                                This article contains an enumeration of all the cases of <foreign
                                    lang="greek">e)a/n</foreign> with the subjunctive
                                in future conditions and of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the future indicative in the three tragedians. It
                                appears that in Aeschylus there are 22 cases of the future and only
                                8 of the subjunctive; in Sophocles 67 futures and 55 subjunctives;
                                in Euripides 131 futures and 177 subjunctives. If we omit the
                                futures which are equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">me/llw</foreign> with an infinitive, for which the subjunctive
                                could not be substituted (see 407), we have in Aeschylus 15 futures
                                in future conditions and 8 subjunctives; in Sophocles 46 and 55; in
                                Euripides 98 and 177. In Attic prose Thucydides and Lysias have the
                                largest proportion of futures; but in prose, as in Aristophanes, the
                                subjunctives always preponderate.</note> It is thus a favourite
                            construction with the tragedians. E.g. <foreign lang="greek">*ei) ga\r *)axilleu\s oi)=os e)pi\ *trw/essi

                        <p>This form of the conditional sentence in its fully developed
                            use, as it appears in Attic Greek, must be carefully distinguished from
                            that of 410; the more so, as we often translate both <foreign lang="greek">ei)/h a)/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">h)=n a)/n</foreign> by the same English expression,
                                <emph>it would be;</emph> although the latter implies
                            that the supposition of the protasis is a false one, while the former
                            implies no opinion of the speaker as to the truth of the supposition. We
                            have seen (438-440) that the more primitive Homeric language had not yet
                            fully separated these two constructions, and still used the optative in
                            the apodosis of present, and sometimes of past, unreal conditions.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the distinction between this form and that
                            of 444 is less marked, and it is sometimes of slight importance which of
                            the two is used. As it is often nearly indifferent in English whether we
                            say <emph>if we shall go</emph> (or <emph>if we go</emph>) <emph>it will be well</emph>, or
                                <emph>if we should go it would be well</emph>, so may
                            it be in Greek whether we say <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n
                                e)/lqwmen</foreign>
                            <foreign lang="greek">kalw=s e(/cei</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) e)/lqoimen kalw=s a)\n
                            e)/xoi</foreign>. In writing Greek, this distinction can generally be made
                            by first observing the form of the apodosis in English; if that is
                            expressed by <emph>should</emph> or <emph>would</emph>, it is to be translated by the Greek optative with
                                <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>; if it is expressed
                            by <emph>shall</emph> or <emph>will</emph>, by the future indicative. Other forms of the apodosis, as
                            the imperative, will present no difficulty. The form to be used in the
                            protasis will then appear from the principles of the dependence of moods
                            (170-178); the optative will require another optative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in the dependent protasis,
                            while the future indicative or any other primary form will require a
                            subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">e)a/n</foreign> or a
                            future indicative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>.</p>

                        <p>In indirect discourse after past tenses we often find an
                            optative in protasis, which merely represents the same tense of the

                            of a given class. Here the protasis has the subjunctive with <foreign

                            even by the protasis itself, without implying that the protasis

                            (486-490). The cases in 490 make it plain that the final force often
                            ascribed to <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> or <foreign

                            of an apodosis containing the idea of purpose or desire, since the same
                            form of protasis which is sometimes called final has no final force when

                        <p>It will be noticed that when the leading condition is unreal
                            (as in <bibl n="Eur. Supp. 1084">EUR. Supp.
                                1084</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 17D">PLAT. Ap. 17 D</bibl>, and <bibl n="Dem. 4.1">DEM. iv. 1</bibl>, above), this makes all subordinate
                            past or present conditions also unreal, so far as the supposed case is
                            concerned, without regard to their own nature. Thus, in <bibl
                                n="Dem. 4.1">DEM. iv. 1</bibl> and
                            xxxiii. 25 we have two directly opposite suppositions both stated as
                            contrary to fact, which could not be unless the leading supposition had
                            made the whole state of things supposed in the sentence unreal like
                            itself. It is obvious, therefore, that such a subordinate condition may
                            refer to a case which is not <emph>in itself</emph>
                            unreal, although it is part of a supposition which <emph>as a whole</emph> is unreal. This can be seen more easily in
                            English. We can say, <emph>if he had been an Athenian, he
                                would have been laughed at if he had talked as he did;</emph> but we
                            are far from implying that the latter supposition (the subordinate one)
                            is contrary to fact, although it would be expressed in Greek by <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) e)/legen</foreign>. Still it is part
                            of a supposed unreal state of things. This explains an apparent
                            inconsistency in respect to sentences like <foreign lang="greek">ei)ko\s h)=n se tou=to paqei=n</foreign>, <gloss>you ought properly to have suffered this</gloss>,
                            when the opposite of the infinitive is implied <ref

                            practically equivalent (as a conditional form) to <foreign lang="greek">tou=to e)/paqes a)\n ei) to\ ei)ko\s

                            and <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)ko/s</foreign> are here
                            identical, the apodosis is denied in the denial of the protasis. But if
                            a new unreal protasis is added, the opposite of the infinitive is not
                            necessarily implied (<ref target="s422">see

                            chief protasis has come in and changed the whole relation of the
                            apodosis to the sentence. This offers a satisfactory explanation of the
                            apparent anomaly in <bibl n="Soph. OT 221">SOPH. OT 221</bibl> , <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r

                            Thus <emph>without a clue</emph> becomes part of the

                            denotes a simple fact, and its object <foreign lang="greek">a(/</foreign> has a definite antecedent; but when

                        <p>It will be seen that this principle of assimilation accounts
                            for the unreal indicative and the optative in conditional relative

                            528</ref> and 531.) In fact, wherever this assimilation occurs, the
                            relative clause stands as a protasis to its antecedent clause.
                            Occasionally this principle is disregarded, so that a subjunctive

                        <p>A consecutive clause expresses a consequence, that is, the
                            effect or result (actual or potential) of something that is stated in
                            the leading clause. Such a clause is introduced by some relative word,
                            generally by <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>, <gloss>so as</gloss>, <emph>so that.</emph>
                                (<ref target="s575">See 575</ref>.) The
                            consequence may be either one which the action of the leading verb aims
                            at and <emph>tends</emph> to produce, or one which that
                            action actually <emph>does</emph> produce. This is the
                            fundamental distinction between <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> with the infinitive (with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> for its negative) and <foreign
                                lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> with the indicative
                            (with <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> for its negative).
                            E.g. <foreign lang="greek">*pa=n poiou=sin w(/ste di/khn
                                mh\ dido/nai</foreign>, <gloss>they do everything in

                        <p>Though this illustrates the fundamental distinction in
                            thought on which the distinction in form is based, there are many
                            examples in which <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>
                            with the infinitive and <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> with the indicative seem to amount to essentially the
                            same thing, although the processes by which the meaning is expressed in
                            the two constructions are essentially different. Thus we can say <foreign

                            and though we should receive the same impression from both statements,
                            so that both might be made of the same man under the same circumstances,
                            yet the two constructions (one stating a <emph>tendency</emph> and the other a <emph>fact</emph>) are
                            very different, and they seemed far more so to a Greek than they do to

                            words. When the Greek wishes to express these facts definitely and not
                            to leave them to inference, it uses the indicative with <foreign

                            finite verb compels the writer to make his expression more definite than

                                <emph>as to persuade</emph> and (<emph>so</emph>) <emph>as to be able</emph>, without
                            limiting the expressions to past, present, or future time, he cannot use
                            a tense of the indicative without fixing its time, that is, without

                            and can be translated by our simple infinitive (as above), we can
                            generally express its force without putting into our translation more
                            than we find in the Greek; the formal distinction between <emph>so skilful as to persuade</emph> and <emph>so skilful that he persuades</emph> being apparent
                            even when we mean substantially the same by both. When the clause with
                                <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> is negative, a
                            marked distinction appears in Greek to show the different point of view
                            taken in the two expressions, and we have <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste mh\ pei=sai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste ou) pei/qei</foreign>. This is of course lost
                            in English with our single negative. But when the infinitive has a
                            subject, it must be translated by a finite verb in some definite tense,
                            number, and person, that is, by a statement and not by a mere expression
                            of tendency, although the force of the infinitive in Greek is the same
                            as before. Thus we generally translate <foreign lang="greek">sxola/zeis, w(/ste qauma/zein e)me/</foreign> ( <bibl
                                n="Eur. Hec. 730">EUR. Hec. 730</bibl>),
                                <emph>you delay, so that I am astonished</emph>, as
                            if it were <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste qauma/zw
                            e)gw/</foreign>, simply because we cannot use our infinitive with a
                            subject expressed. If, however, we substitute an equivalent form which
                            avoids this difficulty, like <emph>so as to astonish
                            me</emph>, we see that there is really no such definite character in
                                <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste qauma/zein e)me/</foreign>
                            as we impose upon it, and that it no more expresses a statement than
                                <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste se pei=sai</foreign>
                            (above) does. The same difficulty of translating the Greek infinitive
                            with its subject has done much to obscure the force of the tenses of the
                            articular infinitive and of the infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>. (See also 603.)</p>
                        <p>In many uses of the infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> it is not even inferred that the
                            result towards which the infinitive expresses a tendency is actually
                            reached. Thus, in clauses with <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> expressing a purpose or a condition, and where the
                            infinitive is generally used without <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>, we cannot substitute the indicative for the
                            infinitive (see the examples under 587, 2 and 3, and 588).<note n="1"

                        <p>The examples in 598 have one common character: in all of them
                            the thought could be expressed equally well by <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> with the infinitive or <foreign

                                Shilleto's faith in his own explanation was somewhat shaken by
                                finding that four of the passages quoted in 598 could not be brought
                                under his canon. Under the influence of Shilleto's essay, I
                                originally suggested the mixture of two equivalent constructions

                            here, it would denote no definite period, but only one limited or <emph>conditioned</emph> by the future capture of the city.
                            The actual apodosis to the condition is not <foreign lang="greek">maxou=mai</foreign> alone, but rather the whole
                            implied idea, <emph>I shall go on fighting</emph> to the
                            future time, the limit of which is set by <foreign lang="greek">e(/ws a)\n e(/lw</foreign>. It has been seen (<ref

                            conditional clauses may condition not their expressed leading clause,
                            but one which the context implies; as <foreign lang="greek">cummaxi/an poiou=men, h)/n tis e)f' h(ma=s

                            us.</emph> Again, a conditional clause may refer to an object which is
                            aimed at in the action of the leading verb; as <foreign lang="greek">*pa/troklon e)/fepe i(/ppous, ei)/ ke/n min

                            1). In like manner a conditional relative clause with <emph>until</emph> is very apt to refer to an object aimed
                            at, and thus to become at once final, relative, and conditional: thus in

                                lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> always expresses a <emph>limit</emph> of time and means <emph>until</emph>, like <foreign lang="greek">e(/ws</foreign>, having become a conjunction, not losing, however, its
                            original meaning of <emph>before.</emph> From this
                            original comparative meaning, <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> has a negative force, implying that something does or
                            does not happen <emph>before</emph> (i.e. <emph>in the absence of</emph>) another event; so that
                                <foreign lang="greek">ou)/pw</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh/pw</foreign> with a temporal
                            participle may generally be substituted for <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> and the infinitive. Thus, in <foreign
                                lang="greek">nai=e de\ *ph/daion pri\n e)lqei=n
                                ui(=as *)axaiw=n</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.172">Il. xiii. 172</bibl>, for <foreign lang="greek">pri\n e)lqei=n</foreign>, <gloss>before they came</gloss>, we could substitute <foreign lang="greek">ou)/pw e)lqo/ntwn</foreign>, etc. So <foreign
                                lang="greek">pri\n a)/n</foreign> with the subjunctive
                            is often interchangeable with <foreign lang="greek">h)\n
                                mh/</foreign>, and always implies it; thus <foreign lang="greek">mh\ a)pe/lqh|s pri\n a)\n a)kou/sh|s</foreign>, <gloss>do not depart until you hear</gloss>, implies <foreign
                                lang="greek">h)\n mh\ a)kou/sh|s</foreign>, <gloss>without hearing.</gloss> One result of this negative
                            character of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> is its
                            strong affinity for the aorist, the tense which denotes simple <emph>occurrence.</emph> (See <title>Jour.

                        <p>In Homeric Greek <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> generally takes the primitive construction with the
                            infinitive without regard to the nature of the leading verb. In lyric
                            poetry, Herodotus, and Attic Greek, <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> takes the infinitive chiefly when the leading clause
                            is affirmative; otherwise, it takes one of the finite moods, like <foreign
                                lang="greek">e(/ws</foreign>, having the sense of
                                <emph>until.</emph> But, while the indicative may

                            meaning <emph>until</emph>, when the leading clause is
                            affirmative, the subjunctive and optative are never used unless the

                        <p>The Attic uses of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> with the indicative, subjunctive, and optative, are seen
                            in a primitive stage of development in Homer. The construction of <foreign
                                lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> itself with the
                            indicative was yet unknown; but four cases of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n g' o(/te</foreign> with the indicative show a
                            tendency in this direction. Six cases of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> (without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign>) with the subjunctive and one with the optative (in
                            indirect discourse) mark the beginning of the later usage with these
                            moods. On the other hand, 81 cases of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> with the infinitive show the
                            prevailing Homeric construction. Here, as in all periods of the
                            language, when <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> takes
                            the infinitive, we have simply a statement of fact, that one thing
                            precedes another; in <foreign lang="greek">nai=e de\
                                *ph/daion pri\n e)lqei=n ui(=as *)axaiw=n</foreign>, <gloss>and he dwelt in Pedaeum before the coming of the
                                sons of the Greeks</gloss>, <foreign lang="greek">pri\n e)lqei=n</foreign> implies no more than <foreign lang="greek">pro\ a)fi/cews</foreign> or the later <foreign
                                lang="greek">pro\ tou= e)lqei=n</foreign>. Any further
                            idea that may be implied comes from the context, and is not found in the
                            words. This use of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> has
                            little analogy in Greek syntax, its nearest parallel being the later use
                            of <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">w(s</foreign> with the infinitive. The
                            simplest theory, which best suits the Homeric usage, seems to be that
                                <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> has a 
                            <quote>quasi-prepositional</quote> relation to the infinitive, which is a
                            verbal noun, a relation the same in effect as that of <foreign
                                lang="greek">pro/</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">pro\ tou= e)lqei=n</foreign> in the later Attic
                            construction. (See <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 2.6.6">XEN. Mem. ii. 6, 6</bibl> , and <bibl n="Dem. 19.73">DEM. xix. 73.</bibl>) A similar use of <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)nti/</foreign> with the infinitive in a
                            few cases in Herodotus (see 803) shows a tendency to go further in the
                            same direction.</p>

                        <p>The Homeric language was generally contented with the simple
                                <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> and the
                            infinitive, even when it was implied that the clause with <foreign
                                lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> set a limit to the action
                            (or negation) of the leading clause, i.e. when <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> could be expressed by <emph>until.</emph> So in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 21.100">Il. xxi. 100</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">pri\n *pa/troklon e)pispei=n ai)/simon h)=mar,
                                to/fra ti/ moi pefide/sqai fi/lteron h)=en *trw/wn</foreign>, i.e.
                                <emph>until the death of Patroclus I preferred to
                                spare the Trojans</emph> (which he will no longer do); and xix. 312,

                                pole/mou sto/ma du/menai</foreign>, i.e. <emph>he felt
                                no pleasure until he entered the battle;</emph> in both cases the
                            Attic Greek might have used <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> with the indicative. So also when the clause with <foreign
                                lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> is future and
                            conditional; as in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 19.423">Il. xix. 423</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">ou) lh/cw pri\n *trw=as a)/dhn e)la/sai
                            pole/moio</foreign>, <gloss>I will not stop until I have
                                given the Trojans enough of war.</gloss> It was in cases like the
                            last, where the mere temporal <foreign lang="greek">pri\n
                                e)la/sai</foreign> expresses the future condition very imperfectly,
                            that the need of a more exact form was first felt. The need existed only
                            after negative sentences, as here only could such a future condition be
                            expressed by <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign>
                            consistently with its original meaning <emph>before. I
                                shall not cease fighting until</emph> (<emph>before</emph>) <emph>I see the end of the war</emph>
                            contains a future condition (= <foreign lang="greek">h)\n
                                mh/</foreign>) which <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign>
                            can properly express; but the equivalent affirmative, <emph>I shall go on fighting until I see the end of the
                            war</emph>, could not be expressed by <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign>, as we cannot substitute <emph>before</emph> for <emph>until</emph>,
                            but it would require <foreign lang="greek">e(/ws</foreign>,
                            which is <emph>until</emph> with no sense of <emph>before.</emph> The forms of parataxis suggested a
                            simple and natural way of meeting this want, through the adverbial use
                            of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign>. In a sentence like
                                <foreign lang="greek">ou)de/ min a)nsth/seis: pri\n
                                kai\ kako\n a)/llo pa/qh|sqa</foreign>, <gloss>nor

                            colon and make <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> a
                            conjunction to obtain the regular construction of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> with the subjunctive, <emph>nor will you recall him to life before</emph> (<emph>until</emph>) <emph>you suffer some
                                new affliction.</emph> This result could not have been attained with
                            an affirmative leading clause; for while <foreign lang="greek">ou) tou=to poih/sw: pri/n me keleu/sh|s</foreign>,
                                <gloss>I shall not do this:&mdash;you shall command
                                me first</gloss>, gives the meaning <emph>I shall not
                                do this before you command me</emph>, the paratactic affirmative,
                                <foreign lang="greek">tou=to poih/sw: pri/n me
                                keleu/sh|s</foreign>, would give only <emph>you will
                                command me before I do this. I shall do this before you command
                            me</emph> would be <foreign lang="greek">tou=to poih/sw
                                pri/n se keleu=sai</foreign>, which is not the result of any form of
                            parataxis. The six cases of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> with the subjunctive in Homer are all without <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign>, and all follow negatives. The primitive
                            character and the rarity of this construction seem to show that we are
                            nearer the original parataxis here than in any other form; while the
                            change of the subjunctive to the optative after a past tense in <bibl
                                n="Hom. Il. 21.580">Il. xxi. 580</bibl>
                            (see 639) shows that the dependence of the clause with <foreign
                                lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> is thoroughly established
                            (cf. 307). An attempt to arrive at the same result in a more awkward way
                            appears in two cases of <foreign lang="greek">pri/n g'
                                o(/t' a)/n</foreign> with the subjunctive in the Odyssey <ref

                            very much as it introduces the infinitive.</p>

                            construction is not the result of parataxis, and there is no such
                            obstacle to combining the ideas of <emph>until</emph> and

                            thus appears that <foreign lang="greek">pri/n</foreign> was

                            words of the original speaker or writer. An indirect quotation is one in
                            which the original words conform to the construction of the sentence in

                        <p>Indirect quotations may be introduced by <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> and occasionally by other particles (negatively <foreign
                                lang="greek">o(/ti ou), w(s ou)</foreign>, etc.) with
                            a finite verb; sometimes by the infinitive without a particle; sometimes
                            also by the participle.</p>
                        <p>1. <foreign lang="greek">*(/oti</foreign>, <gloss>that</gloss>, was originally the neuter relative
                                <foreign lang="greek">o(/ ti</foreign>, used as a
                            limiting accusative, <emph>in respect to which</emph> (or

                                how far</emph>, etc. In Homer <foreign lang="greek">o(/</foreign>, neuter of the relative <foreign lang="greek">o(/s</foreign>, is used like <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> (709, 1). Thus <foreign lang="greek">oi)=da o(/ ti</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">o(\</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">kaka\ mh/detai</foreign> at first meant <emph>I know
                                as to what he plans evil</emph>, or <emph>I know
                                about his planning evil</emph>, and afterwards came to mean <emph>I know that he plans evil.</emph></p>
                        <p>2. <foreign lang="greek">*(ws</foreign>, the
                            relative adverb of manner (312, 1), in this construction originally
                            meant <emph>in what manner, how;</emph> and afterwards
                            became established in the same sense as <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign>, <gloss>that.</gloss>
                            Compare the German use of <emph>wie</emph> (<emph>how</emph>) in narration. <emph>How</emph> for <emph>that</emph> is heard in vulgar
                            English (as <emph>I told him how I saw this</emph>), and
                                <emph>how that</emph> was once in good use in this
                            sense for <emph>that.</emph>
                            <foreign lang="greek">*(/opws</foreign> is sometimes used
                            like <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> in indirect

                            weakened from their meaning <emph>for which purpose,
                                wherefore</emph>, to the same sense as <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign>, <gloss>that</gloss>
                            (710, 1). These words are also used in a causal sense, <emph>because</emph>, like <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti, o(/</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign>
                            <ref target="s712">(712)</ref>.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, <foreign lang="greek">dio/ti</foreign>, <gloss>because</gloss>, sometimes has
                            the sense of <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign>, <gloss>that</gloss> (710, 2).</p>
                        <p>4. <foreign lang="greek">*(/ote</foreign>, <gloss>when</gloss>, in Homer sometimes loses its temporal
                            force, and approaches <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign>
                            in meaning (709, 3).</p>

                        <p>1. Indirect quotations with <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti, w(s</foreign>, etc., form the chief part of the
                            class of <emph>substantive</emph> sentences, in which an

                            object of a verb. But these sentences have no peculiar construction,
                            except after verbs implying thought or the expression of thought

                        <p>2. The infinitive of indirect discourse belongs to the large
                            class of subject and object infinitives (745; 746; 751), being
                            distinguished from the others of this class by preserving the time of
                            its tense from the finite verb which it represents (85; 667, 3).<note

                        <p>1. Indirect questions may be introduced by <foreign

                        <p>2. In Homer single indirect questions (when they are not

                        <p>3. Indirect questions follow the same principles as indirect

                        <p>The following are the general principles of indirect
                            discourse, the particular applications of which are shown in 669710.</p>
                        <p>1. In indirect quotations after <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> and in indirect questions,</p>
                        <p>(<emph>a</emph>) after primary tenses, each
                            verb retains both the mood and the tense of the direct discourse, no
                            change being made except (when necessary) in the person of the verb;</p>
                        <p>(<emph>b</emph>) after secondary tenses, each
                            primary tense of the indicative and each subjunctive of the direct
                            discourse may be either changed to the same tense of the optative or
                            retained in its original mood and tense. The imperfect and pluperfect,
                            having no tenses in the optative, are generally retained in the
                            indicative (but see 673). An aorist indicative belonging to a <emph>dependent</emph> clause of the direct discourse
                            remains unchanged, but one belonging to the leading clause may be
                            changed to the optative like a primary tense.</p>
                        <p>2. Secondary tenses of the indicative expressing an unreal
                            condition, indicatives with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, and all optatives (with or without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>), are retained, with no change in
                            either mood or tense, after both primary and secondary tenses.</p>
                        <p>3. When the quotation depends on a verb which takes the
                            infinitive or participle, the leading verb of the quotation is changed
                            to the <emph>corresponding tense</emph> of the infinitive
                            or participle, after both primary and secondary tenses, <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> being retained if it is in
                            the direct form; and the dependent verbs follow the preceding rules.</p>
                        <p>4. The adverb <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is never joined with a verb in indirect discourse unless
                            it stood also in the direct form. On the other hand, <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is never omitted in indirect discourse
                            if it was used in the direct form; except that, when it is joined to a
                            relative word or a particle before a subjunctive in direct discourse, it
                            is regularly dropped when the subjunctive is changed to the optative
                            after a past tense in indirect discourse.</p>
                        <p>5. The indirect discourse regularly retains the same negative
                            particle which would be used in the direct form. But the infinitive and
                            participle sometimes take <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> in indirect discourse where <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> would be used in the direct form. (See
                            examples under 685 and 688.) In indirect questions introduced by <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, <gloss>whether</gloss>, and in the second part of alternative indirect
                            questions <ref target="s665">(665)</ref>,
                                <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> can be used as well
                            as <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>.</p>

                        <p>As an indirect quotation or question is generally the object
                            or subject of its leading verb, it may stand in apposition with a

                        <p>When the direct form is an indicative (without <foreign

                        <p>It is to be noticed that indirect <emph>questions</emph> after primary tenses retain an indicative of the
                            direct question in Greek, where the subjunctive is used in Latin. Thus,
                                <foreign lang="la">nescio quis sit</foreign>,
                                <emph>I know not who he is</emph>, in Greek is simply
                                <foreign lang="greek">a)gnow= ti/s e)stin</foreign>.
                            This does not apply to indirect questions which would require the
                            subjunctive in the direct form <ref target="s677">(677)</ref>.</p>
                        <p>2. After <emph>secondary</emph> tenses the
                            verb may be either changed to the optative or retained in the

                            discourse being retained in either case. The optative is the more common
                            form. E.g. <foreign lang="greek">*)/elecen o(/ti

                        <p>(<emph>a</emph>) After past tenses the
                            indicative and optative are in equally good use; the optative being used
                            when the writer incorporates the quotation entirely into his own
                            sentence, and the indicative when he quotes it in the original words as
                            far as his own construction allows. The indicative here, like the
                            subjunctive in final clauses after past tenses <ref
                                target="s318">(318)</ref>, is merely a more vivid form
                            of expression than the optative, with no difference in meaning. We even
                            find both moods in the same sentence. E.g. <foreign lang="greek">*ou(=toi e)/legon o(/ti *ku=ros me\n te/qnhken,

                            less familiar than the other tenses of the optative, so that these
                            tenses were sometimes retained in the indicative even when the present
                            or the aorist was changed to the optative. See the last two examples
                            under (<emph>a</emph>). In indirect <emph>questions</emph> the aorist indicative was generally retained (see

                        <p>It thus appears that the peculiar constructions with <foreign

                            later language, were not yet developed in Homer; but clauses with <foreign
                                lang="greek">o(/ti, w(s</foreign>, etc., were still
                            connected with the leading verb by the same looser construction which we
                            use in English (as <emph>I knew that he was planning
                            evil</emph>), the dependent verb expressing its own absolute time (see
                            22), as it did in the relative clauses in which these clauses
                            originated, or in the more primitive parataxis. Thus <foreign lang="greek">gi/gnwskon o(\ kaka\ mh/deto</foreign> (above) meant
                            originally <emph>I knew as to what he was planning
                            evil;</emph> and without <foreign lang="greek">o(/</foreign>, in a still earlier stage, <emph>I knew: he
                                was planning evil</emph> (which we can say in English). Even after
                            the more thorough incorporation of the dependent clause was established,
                            by which either <foreign lang="greek">mh/detai</foreign> or
                                <foreign lang="greek">mh/doito</foreign> became the

                        <p>The most common Homeric construction in indirect discourse is

                            cases, the present optative is used after past tenses to represent the
                            imperfect indicative. The present optative thus supplies the want of an
                            imperfect, like the present infinitive and participle (119 and 140).
                            This can be done only when the context makes it perfectly clear that the
                            optative represents an imperfect, and not a present. E.g. <foreign

                        <p>1. In Homer, where clauses with <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti, w(s</foreign>, etc. are not yet constructed on
                            the principles of indirect discourse (see 671), a present or perfect of
                            the direct form appears as an imperfect or pluperfect in these clauses
                            after past tenses. E.g. <foreign lang="greek">*ou)de/ ti

                        <p>The infinitive is said <emph>to stand in
                                indirect discourse</emph> and its tenses correspond to those of the
                            indicative or optative, when it depends on a verb implying thought or
                            the expression of thought (one of the class of <emph>verba sentiendi et declarandi</emph>), and when <emph>also</emph> the thought, as originally conceived,
                            would have been expressed by some tense of the indicative (with or
                            without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>) or optative
                            (with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>), so that it can
                            be transferred without change of tense to the infinitive. Thus in <foreign
                                lang="greek">bou/letai e)lqei=n</foreign>, <gloss>he wishes to go</gloss>, <foreign lang="greek">e)lqei=n</foreign> represents no form of either aorist
                            indicative or aorist optative, and is therefore said to be not in
                            indirect discourse. But in <foreign lang="greek">fhsi\n
                                e)lqei=n</foreign>, <gloss>he says that he
                            went</gloss>, <foreign lang="greek">e)lqei=n</foreign>
                            represents <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqon</foreign> of the
                            direct discourse. The distinction in the time of the infinitive
                            (especially of the aorist infinitive) in these two uses is obvious.</p>
                        <p>It may be asked why the infinitive after certain other verbs
                            should not be said to stand in indirect discourse; for example, why in
                                <foreign lang="greek">keleu/ei se e)lqei=n</foreign> or
                                <foreign lang="greek">mh\ e)lqei=n</foreign> we should
                            not say that <foreign lang="greek">e)lqei=n</foreign>
                            represents <foreign lang="greek">e)lqe/</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh\ e)/lqh|s</foreign> of direct
                            discourse. This might perhaps be done; and we might possibly make <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)lqei=n</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">bou/lomai e)lqei=n</foreign> represent <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/lqoimi</foreign>, <gloss>may I go.</gloss> But with other verbs of the same
                            class, as those of <emph>advising, teaching, striving,
                                choosing</emph>, no form of direct discourse can even be imagined.
                            It is much harder to draw a line between these last verbs and verbs like
                                <foreign lang="greek">keleu/w</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">bou/lomai</foreign>, or even between
                            these two, than where it is drawn above. It is impossible to say where a
                            Greek would have drawn the line, or to be sure that he would have drawn
                            any line at all; for our own use, the usual definition of the infinitive
                            in oratio obliqua (as given above) is certainly the most convenient.</p>

                            (667, 5). But, after certain verbs which belong to the intermediate

                            those which do not (see 136), the infinitive regularly takes <foreign

                            always seemed natural, even after <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> had become the regular form after verbs of <emph>saying, thinking</emph>, etc. We sometimes find

                            although neither <foreign lang="greek">tou=</foreign> nor
                            the negative has anything to do with the infinitive. So some people say

                        <p>When a complex sentence is indirectly quoted, its leading
                            verb follows the principles already stated for simple sentences
                            (669-688).</p>
                        <p>1. If the quotation depends on a primary tense, all the
                            dependent verbs of the original sentence retain the mood and tense of
                            the direct discourse.</p>
                        <p>2. After a secondary tense, all dependent verbs of the
                            original sentence which there stood in the present, perfect, or future
                            indicative, or in any tense of the subjunctive, may either be changed to
                            the same tense of the optative or retain both the mood and tense of the
                            direct discourse, the optative being the more common form. When the
                            subjunctive is changed to the optative, <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is dropped, <foreign lang="greek">e)a/n, o(/tan</foreign>, etc., becoming <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei), o(/te</foreign>, etc.</p>
                        <p>3. But dependent secondary tenses of the indicative and all
                            dependent optatives remain unchanged after all tenses (see, however,
                            693). E.g.</p>

                        <p>1. The principles which govern dependent clauses of indirect
                            discourse <ref target="s689">(689)</ref>
                            apply also to all dependent clauses in sentences of every kind (even
                            when what precedes is not in indirect discourse), if such clauses
                            express <emph>indirectly</emph> the past thought of any
                            person, even that of the speaker himself. This affects the construction
                            only when the leading verb is past; then the dependent clause may either
                            take the optative, in the <emph>tense</emph> in which the
                            thought was originally conceived, or retain both the mood and the tense
                            of the direct discourse. When a subjunctive is changed to an optative,
                                <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is dropped.</p>
                        <p>2. Secondary tenses of the indicative here (as in 689, 3)
                            regularly remain unchanged. But an aorist indicative sometimes becomes
                            optative when no ambiguity can result from the change (see 693): this
                            may occur in causal sentences (699 and 714) and in the relative
                            sentences of 700.</p>
                        <p>The principle of 694 applies to the following

                        <p>1. A causal sentence may give the cause of something that is
                            implied, but not expressed, in the leading sentence. Especially it may
                            give the reason for making a statement, rather than for the fact stated.
                            In dialogues, a causal sentence may refer to an implied <emph>yes</emph> or <emph>no. E.g.</emph></p>

                                apodosis (see Lange, p. 6, note 15); but if he explained this

                            punctuation, <emph>O that this word may be accomplished:
                                then would you quickly be made aware of kindness and many gifts from

                            the wish is on the verge of independent existence, being almost ready to
                            dispense with the apodosis. The half-independent half-dependent nature
                            of such clauses is best seen in a case like the following, where <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) e)qe/loi</foreign> is first stated as
                            an independent wish, and is afterwards repeated as the protasis of a

                            leaving a simple apodosis like the <foreign lang="greek">kalw=s a)\n e)/xoi</foreign> of Aristarchus to be mentally supplied,
                            or to be felt without being actually supplied, the protasis is repeated
                            (as if by afterthought) and a more precise form of conclusion is then
                            actually expressed.</p>
                        <p>Such examples as the first two are sometimes adduced as

                        <p>It has been seen that the use of the moods and tenses in both

                        <p>It must be remembered that it is the <emph>futurity</emph> of the object of a wish, and not its probability or
                            possibility, that requires the optative. No amount of absurdity or
                            extravagance in a future wish can make anything but the optative proper
                            in expressing it. As Aristotle says ( <bibl n="Lib. Eth. 3.2"> Eth. iii. 2</bibl>, <bibl
                                n="Lib. Eth. 7"> Eth. 7</bibl>), <foreign

                            no amount of reasonableness in a present or past wish can make the
                            imperfect or aorist indicative improper; for we may wish that the most
                            reasonable thing were or had been ours, only such wishing implies that
                            we do not or did not have it. </p>

                        <p>The infinitive is originally a verbal noun, expressing the
                            simple idea of the verb. As a verb, it has voices and tenses; it has a
                            subject (expressed or understood), which may define its number and
                            person; it may have an object and other adjuncts, and, further, it is
                            qualified by adverbs, and not by adjectives. It may have <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in a potential sense. It
                            thus expresses the verbal idea with much greater definiteness than the
                            corresponding substantives; compare, for example, <foreign lang="greek">pra/ttein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pra=cai</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">pra=cis</foreign>, as expressions of the idea of <emph>doing.</emph></p>

                        <p>The origin of the infinitive in a verbal noun is beyond
                            question. In the oldest Sanskrit certain verbal nouns in the dative
                            express purpose, that is, the object <emph>to</emph> or
                                <emph>for</emph> which something is done, and are
                            almost identical in form with the equivalent infinitives in the older
                            Greek. Thus <foreign lang="sanskrit">vidma/ne</foreign>, dative of <foreign lang="sanskrit">vidman</foreign>, <gloss>knowledge</gloss> (from root <foreign lang="sanskrit">vid</foreign>), may mean <emph>for knowing</emph> or
                                <emph>in order to know</emph> (old English <emph>for to know</emph>); and in Homer we have <foreign
                                lang="greek">vi/dmenai</foreign> (= Attic <foreign
                                lang="greek">i)dei=n</foreign>) from the same root
                                <foreign lang="greek">vid</foreign>. So Sanskrit
                                <foreign lang="sanskrit">dAva/ne</foreign>, dative
                            of <foreign lang="sanskrit">dAvan</foreign>, <gloss>giving</gloss> (from root <foreign lang="sanskrit">da</foreign>), is represented in Greek by the
                            Cyprian <foreign lang="greek">do/venai</foreign> (= Attic
                                <foreign lang="greek">dou=nai</foreign>) from root

                            163.</note> It is safe to assume, therefore, that the Greek infinitive
                            was originally developed in a similar way, chiefly from the dative of a
                            primitive verbal noun; that in the growth of the language this case-form
                            became obscured, its origin as a dative was forgotten, and it came to be
                            used for other cases of the verbal noun, especially the accusative; that
                            it was allowed to take an object, like the corresponding verb, and
                            afterwards a subject (in the accusative) to make the agent more
                            distinct; that in course of time, as its relation to the verb became
                            closer, it developed tenses like those of the verb, so as to appear as a
                            regular mood of the verb. The final step, taken when the use of the
                            definite article was established, was to allow the half-noun and
                            half-verb to have the article and so be declined like a noun in four
                            cases, while it still retained its character as a verb. This last step
                            was taken after Homer; but the earlier stages were already passed, more
                            or less decidedly, before the Homeric period, so that they cannot be
                            traced historically. Thus, although the infinitive in Homer retained
                            some of its uses as a dative more distinctly than the later infinitive,
                            it is hardly possible that those who used the Homeric language retained
                            any consciousness of the original dative; for the infinitive was already
                            established as an accusative and a nominative, it had formed its various
                            tenses to express present, past, and future time, and it could even be
                            used with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>
                            <ref target="s683">(683)</ref>. Indeed, the
                            condition in which the infinitive appears in indirect discourse in Homer
                            seems utterly inconsistent with any conscious survival of its force as a
                            dative (see examples in 683).</p>

                        <p>The later addition of the article enlarged the uses of the
                            infinitive and extended it to new constructions, especially to the use
                            with prepositions. It thus gained a new power of taking adjuncts, not
                            merely single words, but whole dependent clauses. (See examples in 806.)
                            In all the constructions which were developed before the article came
                            into use with the infinitive, as when it is the subject or the object of
                            a verb, or follows adjectives or nouns, the infinitive continued to be
                            used regularly without the article, although even in these constructions
                            the article might be added to emphasise the infinitive more especially
                            as a noun, or to enable it to carry adjuncts which would otherwise be
                            cumbrous; in other words, all constructions in which the original force
                            of the noun had become obscured or forgotten before the article began to
                            be used generally remained in their original form. On the other hand,
                            newer expressions, in which the infinitive was distinctly felt as a noun
                            in the structure of the sentence, generally added the article to
                            designate the case.</p>

                        <p>The subject of the infinitive, if expressed, is in the
                            accusative. The most indefinite infinitive, so far as it is a verb, must
                            at least have a subject implied; but as the infinitive has no person or
                            number in itself, its subject can remain more obscure than that of a
                            finite verb. Thus <foreign lang="greek">kalo/n e)stin
                                a)poqanei=n</foreign>, <gloss>it is</gloss>
                            <emph>glorious to die</emph>, may imply a subject in any
                            number or person, according to the context, while <foreign lang="greek">a)poqnh/|skeis</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)pe/qane</foreign> is restricted to <emph>thou</emph> or <emph>he</emph> as its
                            subject. Still, in the former case, <foreign lang="greek">a)poqanei=n</foreign> must have an implied subject in the accusative;
                            and if this is not pointed out by the context, we can supply <foreign
                                lang="greek">tina/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">tina/s</foreign>, as sometimes appears when a
                            predicate word agrees with the omitted subject, as in <foreign

                            been developed originally by the Greek language, must always refer to a
                            definite subject, as it represents a finite verb in a definite mood,
                            tense, number, and person. Other infinitives, both with and without the
                            article, may have a subject whenever the sense demands it, although
                            sometimes the meaning of the leading verb makes it impossible to express
                            an independent subject, as in <foreign lang="greek">peira=tai manqa/nein</foreign>, <gloss>he tries to
                                learn.</gloss> In general, when the subject of the infinitive is the
                            same as the subject or object of the leading verb, or when it has been
                            clearly expressed elsewhere in the sentence, it is not repeated with the
                                infinitive.<note n="1" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">A few exceptional cases are quoted by Birklein (p.
                                93) in which the infinitive with the article appears to have a
                                subjective genitive, like an ordinary verbal noun, instead of a
                                subject accusative. These are <foreign lang="greek">gignw/skw ta\s tou/twn a)peila\s ou)x h(=tton swfroni/zousas

                            in prose chiefly after verbs signifying <emph>to

                            anything is given or taken; and also after those signifying <emph>to send</emph> or <emph>bring.</emph>
                            (See examples in 770.) With the last class the future participle is
                            still more common <ref target="s840">(840)</ref>. A final clause after <foreign lang="greek">i(/na</foreign> etc. may also be used in the same sense.</p>

                            construction occurs after verbs of <emph>motion</emph>,
                            like <foreign lang="greek">ei)=mi, h(/kw</foreign>, and

                        <p>It has been seen that the infinitive without the article was
                            already established in the Homeric language, in nearly all the
                            constructions in which it was most frequently used in later times. In
                            this simple form it developed its various tenses, and their uses became
                            fixed, especially in indirect discourse; so that the infinitive
                            gradually came to be more of a verb and less of a noun.</p>
                        <p>When the definite article had become common with nouns, it
                            was soon prefixed to the infinitive, which thus, with all its attributes
                            as a verb unimpaired, was restored to new life as a neuter verbal
                                noun.<note n="1" place="unspecified" anchored="yes"><quote>By the substantial loss of its dative force the infinitive
                                became verbalized; by the assumption of the article it was

                            As a nominative and accusative, it could be used with <foreign
                                lang="greek">to/</foreign> in all the constructions in
                            which the simple infinitive was already familiar as subject or object,
                            although here the older form was preferred except when it was desired to
                            emphasise the infinitive especially as a nominative or accusative. But
                            in other constructions (especially in the genitive, dative, and
                            accusative with prepositions), and in its wonderful capacity for
                            carrying dependent clauses and adjuncts of every kind, the articular
                            infinitive appears as a new power in the language, of which the older
                            simple infinitive gave hardly an intimation.</p>
                        <p>As might be expected, the articular infinitive found its
                            chief use in the rhetorical language, as in Demosthenes and in the
                            speeches of Thucydides. It appears first in Pindar (for <foreign
                                lang="greek">to/</foreign> in <bibl
                                n="Hom. Od. 20.52">Od. xx. 52</bibl>
                            and Frag. HES. clxxi. can hardly be the article), but always as a
                            subject nominative, with one doubtful exception. In the dramatists and
                            Herodotus it is not uncommon, being generally a nominative or accusative
                            with <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign>, although it occurs
                            also as a genitive or dative with <foreign lang="greek">tou=</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">tw=|</foreign>;
                            and it is found even with prepositions. In Thucydides (especially in the
                            speeches), we find the nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative all
                            used with the greatest freedom (in 135 cases), besides the accusative,
                            genitive, and dative with prepositions (in 163 cases). Its fully
                            developed power of taking dependent clauses must be seen in the Orators,
                            especially in Demosthenes.<note n="2" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See the statistics given by Gildersleeve in the
                                    <title>Jour. Phil.</title> viii. p. 332. It
                                appears that the average number of articular infinitives in a
                                Teubner page of Demosthenes is 1.25; of the <emph>speeches</emph> of Thucydides, 1.00; of Xenophon (whole), 1.02;

                        <p>The infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign> can stand as an accusative of the direct object, sometimes
                            as an accusative of kindred meaning. The relation of such an infinitive

                            previous negation without otherwise affecting the sense (815, 1), we
                            have a third and a fourth form, still with the same meaning: (<emph>c</emph>) <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rgei se mh\ tou=to poiei=n</foreign>, and (<emph>d</emph>) <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rgei se tou= mh\

                        <p>If the leading verb is itself <emph>negatived</emph> (or is interrogative with a negative implied), the

                                mh/</foreign> is used after many verbs and expressions which denote or

                            or <emph>denial</emph>, the <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> merely strengthening the negative idea
                            of the leading verb. If the leading verb is itself negatived, or is
                            interrogative with a negative implied, <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ ou)</foreign> is generally used with the

                        <p>This infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">to\

                            the simple infinitive (see 791), and it sometimes denotes merely the
                                <emph>result</emph> of a prevention or omission. It
                            is sometimes an object accusative, as after expressions of denial; but
                            it oftener resembles the accusative of respect or limitation. It adds a

                        <p>Although the infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh/</foreign> is most frequently used (as in 811)
                            after verbs containing a negative idea, it can also have a negative
                            sense as the object of other verbs or with adjectives. See <foreign
                                lang="greek">to\ mh\ sfa/llesqai
                            e)pimelei=sqai</foreign> (quoted in 791), and <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ ble/pein e(toi/ma</foreign> (quoted in 795),
                            in both of which the infinitive is really negatived by <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh/</foreign>. We must distinguish also
                            the use of <foreign lang="greek">tou= mh/</foreign> with the
                            infinitive as an ordinary negative expression (see examples in 798) from
                            that which is explained in 807. Compare, likewise, <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ ou)</foreign> with the infinitive in 814 and
                            in 811. The nature of the leading verb will always make the force of the
                            negative plain. We have the same distinction, with the simple
                            infinitive, between <foreign lang="greek">a)nagka/zei se

                            reason</emph> would take <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>
                            (either affecting the infinitive itself, as an ordinary negative, or
                            strengthening a preceding negation, as in the case just mentioned)
                            generally takes the double negative <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)</foreign>, if the verb on which it depends is <emph>itself negatived</emph> or is interrogative with a
                            negation implied. Thus the example given above, <foreign lang="greek">a)rnei=tai mh\ a)lhqe\s ei)=nai tou=to</foreign>, if
                            we negative the leading verb, generally becomes <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)rnei=tai mh\ ou)k a)lhqe\s ei)=nai
                            tou=to</foreign>, <gloss>he does not deny that this is
                                true.</gloss> So, when the original <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> really negatives the infinitive, as in
                                <foreign lang="greek">di/kaio/n e)sti mh\ tou=ton
                                a)fie/nai</foreign>, <gloss>it is just not to acquit

                                tou=ton a)fie/nai</foreign>, <gloss>it is not just not

                        <p>As the infinitive is a verbal noun, so the participle is a
                            verbal adjective; both retaining all the attributes of a verb which are
                            consistent with their nature.</p>

                        <p>The participle has three uses:&mdash;first, it may express
                            an <emph>attribute</emph>, qualifying a noun like an
                            ordinary adjective (<ref target="s824">824-831</ref>); secondly, it may define the <emph>circumstances</emph> under which the action of the sentence takes
                            place (<ref target="s832">832-876</ref>);
                            thirdly, it may be joined to a verb to <emph>supplement</emph> its meaning, often having a force resembling that of
                            the infinitive (<ref target="s877">877-919</ref>).</p>

                        <p>The distinction between the second and third of these classes
                            is less clearly marked than that between the first and the two others:
                            thus in <foreign lang="greek">h(/detai timw/menos</foreign>,
                                <gloss>he delights in being honoured</gloss>, the
                            participle is generally classed as supplementary <ref
                                target="s881">(881)</ref>, although it expresses cause
                                <ref target="s838">(838)</ref>. Even an
                            attributive participle may also be circumstantial; as <foreign

                            condition. The three classes are, nevertheless, sufficiently distinct
                            for convenience, though the lines (like many others in syntax) must not
                            be drawn so strictly as to defeat their object.</p>

                            becomes so completely a substantive, that it takes an adnominal genitive
                            rather than the case which its verbal force would require. A few

                            occurs chiefly in Thucydides and in the poets. E.g. <foreign lang="greek">*)en tw=| mh\ meletw=nti a)cunetw/teroi e)/sontai,</foreign>

                        <p>The supplementary participle completes the idea expressed by
                            a verb, by stating that to which its action relates. It often approaches
                            very near the use of the object infinitive. It may belong to either the
                            subject or the object of the verb and agree with it in case. E.g. <foreign

                            corresponds to the infinitive in indirect discourse, with its tenses
                            representing the same tenses of the direct form; and in the other it
                            corresponds to the object infinitive in other constructions, so far as
                            it approaches the infinitive at all in meaning. (<ref

                        <p>The verbs of perception included in 884 may take the
                            participle also in indirect discourse, with the natural force of each
                            tense preserved (see 904). With some of these verbs, the construction of
                            the participle is generally shown by its case: thus <foreign lang="greek">a)kou/w</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">punqa/nomai</foreign> in Attic Greek regularly take
                            the genitive in the construction of 884, and the accusative in indirect

                            the infinitive in indirect discourse. Here each tense of the participle
                            represents the corresponding tense of the indicative or optative. (<ref

                            the thought of the participle is expressed as that of the leading
                            subject, or as that of some person prominent in the sentence. (<ref

                        <p>The substantive denoting the agent is here in the dative.
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)mi/</foreign> is often
                            omitted.</p>

                        <p>In the impersonal construction (which is the more common),
                            the verbal is in the neuter of the nominative singular (sometimes
                            plural), with <foreign lang="greek">e)sti/</foreign>
                            expressed or understood. The expression is equivalent to <foreign
                                lang="greek">dei=</foreign>, <gloss>(one) must</gloss>, with the infinitive active or
                            middle of the verb to which the verbal belongs.</p>
                        <p>This contruction is practically active in sense, and allows
                            transitive verbals to have an object in the same case which would follow
                            their verbs. The agent is generally expressed by the dative, sometimes
                            by the accusative. E.g. <list type="simple">
                                <item><foreign lang="greek">*Tau=ta

                        <p>In the chapter on the general view of the moods, no attempt
                            was made to assign to either the subjunctive or the optative a single
                            <quote>fundamental idea</quote> from which all the uses of the mood
                            could be derived, except so far as the idea of futurity was shown to
                            belong essentially to the subjunctive in all its most primitive uses. It
                            would be impossible to include under one fundamental idea all the actual
                            uses of any mood in Greek, except the imperative; for even the
                            indicative is used to express unfulfilled conditions, unaccomplished
                            wishes, and unattained purposes, none of which can be brought under the
                            ideas of <quote>declaration</quote> or <quote>absolute assertion</quote> commonly attributed to this mood. Again, it is not to be expected that
                            the true fundamental idea of any mood should include all its uses in a
                            developed language; for the fortunes of language often depend on causes
                            which are quite independent of the original essence of the forms
                            employed, and which seldom can be referred to invariable laws of
                            thought. The same idea can be expressed in two cognate languages by
                            different moods: as <emph>he would have seen</emph> is
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)=den a)/n</foreign> in Greek
                            and <foreign lang="la">vidisset</foreign> in Latin,
                            while in Sanskrit it would be expressed by a past augmented future
                            equivalent to the Greek <foreign lang="greek">e)/mellen
                                o)/yesqai</foreign> (see <ref target="s428">&sect; 428</ref>). Even within the Greek itself, we
                            have <emph>if he were wise</emph> expressed by <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) sofo\s ei)/h</foreign> in Homer and
                            by <foreign lang="greek">ei) sofo\s h)=n</foreign> in Attic;
                            and in Homer, both <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n
                            e)/gnws</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n
                                gnoi/hs</foreign> can mean <emph>you would not have
                                discerned</emph>, while the latter can mean also <emph>you would not discern</emph> (in the same future
                            sense as in Attic).</p>
                        <p>One doctrine of the original meaning of the Greek subjunctive
                            and optative has gained such general approval of late, that it is
                            entitled to special consideration. This teaches that the fundamental
                            idea of the subjunctive is <emph>will</emph>, and that of
                            the optative is <emph>wish.</emph> In the subjunctive,
                            the idea of will appears especially in exhortations and prohibitions and
                            in expressions of purpose. It can also be used to explain the
                            subjunctive in protasis, by understanding <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqh|</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">h)\n e)/lqh|</foreign> to mean originally <emph>let him go, suppose him to go</emph> (in some case).
                            But before we can decide that will is the fundamental idea of the
                            subjunctive, or even that it is a necessary and essential part of the
                            idea of this mood, we must ask, first, whether it is essential to those
                            uses of the subjunctive which we have a right on other grounds to call
                            the most primitive; and, secondly, whether there is any other idea
                            equally essential and equally primitive, from which the idea of will
                            could have been evolved more simply and naturally than this could have
                            been evolved from the idea of will.</p>
                        <p>The subjunctive nowhere bears more distinct marks of
                            primitive simplicity than when it appears in Homer as a simple future;
                            as in <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga/r pw toi/ous i)/don
                                a)ne/ras ou)de\ i)/dwmai</foreign>, <gloss>for never

                                n="Hom. Il. 6.459">Il. vi. 459</bibl>,
                            followed by <foreign lang="greek">w(/s pote/ tis

                            examples in &sect; 284. In this sense it is negatived by <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, like an indicative; and it
                            may be modified by <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or
                                <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, like the future
                            indicative in Homer, and thus acquire a potential sense (see &sect;
                            &sect; 285 and 286). It is seldom that any modal form (except a plain
                            indicative) is found so free from associations which might affect its
                            meaning and conceal its original character. It has, moreover, its exact
                            counterpart in Sanskrit in the Vedic subjunctive, which is negatived by
                                <foreign lang="sanskrit">na/</foreign>, the
                            equivalent of <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>.<note

                                    und Optativ</emph>), pp. 23-25.</note> This simple subjunctive
                            has no element of will. It expresses what the speaker regrets as readily
                            as what he is resolved to do. Thus in both the examples above quoted,
                            the subjunctive expresses an act which is decidedly contrary to the
                            speaker's will and wish. This subjunctive and the future indicative run
                            parallel in all their constructions, and the former expresses will only
                            so far as the latter does. The only character that is beyond question in
                            this subjunctive is its reference to future time, and if we were left to
                            this use alone, we should have no hesitation in designating the
                            subjunctive as a form expressing futurity like a future tense. As this
                            use cannot be deduced from the subjunctive as an expression of will, let
                            us see whether the opposite process, the evolution from the simple
                            future meaning of the uses in which will appears, is any easier and does
                            any less violence to the principles of the language.</p>
                        <p>The use of the subjunctive which strikes every one as coming
                            next in simplicity to the Homeric construction just described is seen in
                            exhortations, like <foreign lang="greek">i)/wmen</foreign>,
                                <gloss>let us go</gloss>, and (in its negative form)
                            in prohibitions, like <foreign lang="greek">mh\
                            i)/wmen</foreign>, <gloss>let us not go</gloss>, <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh\ ei)/phte tou=to</foreign>, <gloss>do not say this.</gloss> This use of the subjunctive
                            is found also in Sanskrit, and its negative is there generally (though
                            not always) <foreign lang="sanskrit">mA</foreign>, the
                            equivalent of <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>. It thus
                            appears that the marked distinction which is seen in the early Greek
                            between <foreign lang="greek">i)/wmen</foreign>, <gloss>we shall go</gloss>, and <foreign lang="greek">i)/wmen</foreign>, <gloss>let us
                            go</gloss>, in both positive and negative forms, was probably inherited
                            from an ancestral language, so that we need not seek for the development
                            of this distinction within the Greek itself. It is obvious that the
                            future element is equally strong in both expressions, while the
                            hortatory subjunctive also expresses will. Now it is much more natural
                            to suppose that a future form expressing exhortation or prohibition
                            originated in a form expressing mere futurity, than that the merely
                            future form originated in the exhortation or prohibition. We cannot
                            derive <foreign lang="greek">ou)k i)/dwmai</foreign>, <gloss>I shall not see</gloss>, from <foreign lang="greek">mh\ i)/dwmai</foreign>, <gloss>let me
                                not see.</gloss> But it is by no means impossible that, in some
                            language which was a common ancestor of Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit,
                            subjunctive (i.e. originally future) forms came to be used to express
                            both commands and prohibitions; that, when these imperative expressions
                            became distinguished from the subjunctive in its ordinary future sense,
                            they adopted the negative (the ancestor of <emph>m&acirc;
                                '</emph> and <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>) which
                            was used with similar imperative forms, though this use of the negative
                            might not at first be very rigid; and that thus <foreign lang="greek">mh/ i)/wmen</foreign>, in the sense <emph>let us not go</emph>, became established in early
                            Greek as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ou)k
                            i)/wmen</foreign>, <gloss>we shall not go.</gloss> In
                            Sanskrit, however, the use of <foreign lang="sanskrit">mA/</foreign> in such cases was less fixed, and here <foreign

                            are too few to be of much weight in the discussion; but they seem to
                            show an abortive tendency to establish the future indicative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh/</foreign> by the side of the
                            subjunctive in prohibitions. What the future could do in an imperative
                            sense is shown by examples like <cit>
                                <quote lang="greek">pa/ntws de\ tou=to dra/seis,</quote>
                                <quote>but by all means do this,</quote>

                                    1352</bibl>
                            </cit>, and others quoted in &sect; 69; but the natural negative here
                            was <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, not <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, as in <foreign lang="greek">ou) yau/seis</foreign> above.</p>
                        <p>If the origin of the interrogative subjunctive in appeals
                            (&sect; 287) and of its negative <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> has been correctly explained in &sect;&sect; 288 and
                            291, this is merely an interrogative form of the subjunctive in
                            exhortations and prohibitions, and calls for no special discussion here.
                            The origin of the use of the subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> is still to uncertain to give this
                            construction much weight in determining the essential character of the
                            subjunctive. If the view of this construction which is advocated in this
                            work (see Appendix II.) is accepted, the form is an offshoot of the
                            prohibitory subjunctive. If it is thought to be an original
                            construction, expressing a strong denial or prohibition by its own
                            force, the subjunctive appears in its original future force. Whatever
                            theory we may have of the origin of this subjunctive, the form is
                            interchangeable in use with the future indicative.</p>
                        <p>In dependent sentences, the subjunctive is used in two
                            constructions, &mdash;in so-called final clauses, and in conditional
                            sentences. In negative final constructions with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, the subjunctive was originally
                            prohibitive (&sect;&sect; 262, 307); in positive clauses with the
                            final particles, it expresses something aimed at, that is, an object of
                            will. But here, as in independent sentences, to derive the more complex
                            from the more simple is far more natural than the reverse. Further, in
                            all final constructions the future indicative may be used in the same
                            sense as the subjunctive; this could hardly be done if the subjunctive
                            contained an essential element of will which is wanting in the future.
                            Again, the subjunctive is very common in final constructions after past
                            tenses, where the optative is the regular form <ref
                                target="s318">(318)</ref>; it cannot be supposed that
                            the idea of will is present in such final clauses when they have the
                            subjunctive (as they generally do in Thucydides) and is absent when they
                            have the optative (as is more common in Xenophon). In conditional
                            sentences, although we may explain the subjunctive as originally
                            hortatory, <foreign lang="greek">h)\n e)/lqh|</foreign>
                            meaning <emph>let him come</emph> (<emph>we will suppose</emph>), it is more natural to refer this use to
                            the primitive use of the subjunctive as a simple future, <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)/ ken e)/lqh|</foreign> (or <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) e)/lqh|</foreign>), <emph>in case he shall come</emph>, making a supposition of
                            a future event of which the Homeric <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqh|</foreign>, <gloss>he will come</gloss>, might
                            make a statement (see &sect;&sect; 11 and 398). We thus avoid the
                            necessity of explaining the indicative and the subjunctive in protasis
                            on different principles. As each of the various tenses of the indicative
                            with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> expresses a
                            supposition in the time which it naturally denotes (&sect; 3, <emph>c</emph>), so the subjunctive is a natural form to
                            express a future supposition. Thus, as <foreign lang="greek">ei) genh/setai tou=to</foreign> supposes what <foreign
                                lang="greek">genh/setai tou=to</foreign> states,
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei) ge/nhtai tou=to</foreign>
                            naturally supposes what (in the older language) <foreign lang="greek">ge/nhtai tou=to</foreign>, <gloss>this
                                will happen</gloss>, states. As the former cannot be explained by
                            the idea of will, it seems unnecessary and illogical to introduce this
                            idea to account for the latter. What has been said of ordinary
                            conditional sentences applies also to relative conditions.</p>
                        <p>The only use of the subjunctive in conditions which cannot be
                            derived from the simple future meaning is that in general suppositions;
                            but the undeveloped state of this construction in Homer and other
                            considerations make it highly probable, if not certain, that this is a
                            use of the subjunctive which grew up within the Greek language itself at
                            a comparatively late period, and that it is not one of the primitive
                            uses of the mood. (See &sect;&sect; 11, <emph>b</emph>,
                            400, 401.)</p>
                        <p>It is certain that no trace of the subjunctive as a mood of
                            will can be seen in its actual use in conditional sentences. Thus <foreign
                                lang="greek">h)\n th\n po/lin e(/lwsi</foreign> could
                            always be said as properly by the friends as by the enemies of a city,
                            by the besieged as well as by the besiegers. In <bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.71">Il. iii. 71</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">o(ppo/tero/s ke nikh/sh|</foreign>, spoken by Priam,
                            is, as an expression, perfectly neutral as regards the hope or desire of
                            victory. It may be said with truth, that the primitive meaning of a
                            verbal form is apt to be weakened, or even to disappear, in actual use.
                            But is it logical to assume a lost meaning to account for an expression,
                            when the meaning which remains accounts for it satisfactorily without
                            external help? When we find <foreign lang="greek">h)\n
                                e(/lwsi th\n po/lin</foreign> actually expressing a mere future
                            supposition, with no idea of will, in all periods of the language, and
                            when we find <foreign lang="greek">e(/lwsi</foreign> meaning
                                <emph>they will capture</emph> in the earliest period
                            that we know, why should we assume an original idea of will (which was
                            afterwards lost) in <foreign lang="greek">h)\n
                            e(/lwsi</foreign> to account for its actual meaning? The view of the
                            conditional sentence here adopted is confirmed by paratactic conditions
                            like the following: <foreign lang="greek">qu/seis de\ th\n
                                pai=d' : e)/nqa ti/nas eu)xa\s e)rei=s;</foreign> <bibl

                                <foreign lang="greek">qu/seis</foreign> makes a
                            supposition, <emph>supposing you shall sacrifice the
                            girl</emph>, which would generally be expressed by <foreign lang="greek">ei) qu/seis</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">h)\n qu/sh|s</foreign>: so <foreign lang="greek">a)dikei= tis e(kw/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)ch/marte/ tis a)/kwn</foreign>, both expressing
                            suppositions, <bibl n="Dem. 18.274">DEM.

                        <p>On these grounds we may feel justified in regarding the
                            subjunctive as originally and essentially a form for expressing future
                            time, which the Greek inherited, with its subdivision into an absolute
                            future negatived by <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> and
                            a hortatory future negatived by <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, and used in independent sentences.</p>
                        <p>The name <emph>optative</emph> mood (<foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/gklisis eu)ktikh/</foreign>), which
                            was invented by grammarians long after the usages of the language were
                            settled, designated the mood by the only use which it then had in
                            independent sentences without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, that of <emph>wishing.</emph> It is
                            evident that this name in itself is no ground for assuming that wishing
                            was the primitive function, or even an essential function, of the
                            optative, any more than the name of the subjunctive (<foreign lang="greek">e)/gklisis u(potaktikh/</foreign>) would lead us to
                            assume dependence as an original or necessary characteristic of that
                            mood. We have already mentioned the theory that the optative is the mood
                            of <emph>wish</emph>, as the complement of that which
                            makes the subjunctive the mood of <emph>will.</emph> This
                            theory finds no support in the potential use of the optative with or
                            without <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, which is the only
                            independent use of the optative except in wishes and exhortations.
                            Surely <foreign lang="greek">a)po/loito a)/n</foreign>,
                                <gloss>he would perish</gloss>, can never have been
                            developed from <foreign lang="greek">a)po/loito</foreign>,
                                <gloss>may be perish</gloss>, for the former is no
                            more likely to be said by one who wishes the death of a person than by
                            one who fears it, and there is nothing in the addition of <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> which can reasonably be supposed to
                            change a form, which in itself expresses wish, to a neutral form or even
                            to one expressing what is feared. The fundamental distinction in
                            negative sentences between <foreign lang="greek">mh\
                                a)po/loito</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n
                                a)po/loito</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">ou)k
                                a)po/loito</foreign>) is still more significant. Nor can any support
                            for the theory be found in dependent final constructions or in indirect
                            discourse. No one would see a distinction of will and wish in <foreign
                                lang="greek">i)/dh|</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">i)/doi</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">e)/rxetai i(/na i)/dh| tou=to</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">h)=lqen i(/na i)/doi tou=to</foreign>, or
                            in <foreign lang="greek">fobou=mai mh\ e)/lqh|</foreign> and
                                <foreign lang="greek">e)fobh/qhn mh\
                            e)/lqoi</foreign>,&mdash;not to speak of <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqen i(/na i)/doi tou=to</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">h)=lqen i(/na i)/dh| tou=to</foreign>.
                            Still less would any one dream of looking for wish in the optative in
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)=pen o(/ti e)/lqoi</foreign>,
                                <gloss>he said that he had come</gloss>, or in
                                <foreign lang="greek">h)/reto ei)/ tis ei)/h
                                sofw/teros</foreign>. In all these dependent constructions, the
                            optative is only the representative of the subjunctive or indicative
                            when these are, as it were, transferred to the past by depending on a
                            verb of past time; but, if wish were the fundamental idea of the
                            optative, we should hardly expect this to vanish so utterly, since the
                            essential character of the optative would naturally be especially marked
                            where it is used by a fixed principle of the language as a substitute
                            for an indicative or a subjunctive.</p>
                        <p>The only strong argument for the theory that the optative is
                            primarily the mood of wish is found in the optative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in protasis. It is
                            maintained that a gradual development of this conditional form from the
                            simple optative in a wish can be actually seen in Homer. The strongest
                            and most attractive statement of this argument is given by Lange in his
                            elaborate, but unfortunately unfinished, treatise on the particle <foreign

                                believes the optative to be originally the mood of

                            states (p. 485) that, of 200 examples of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the optative in Homer, 136 are
                            expressions of wish, the majority seems decisive; although we may even
                            here withhold our judgment until we examine the majority and also see
                            what the minority of 64 have to say. The majority of 136 is made up as

                            would follow the fulfilment of the wish. Thus the last example in 1
                            appears in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 7.157">Il.

                            between the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> expressing a wish (i.e. supposing something that is

                        <p>Such examples are variously explained, but the protasis
                            generally refers to something that is desired. (Of these there are 43
                            cases.)</p>
                        <p>5. Ordinary conditional sentences in which <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the optative
                            expressing a wish follows an apodosis; as in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22. 20">Il. xxii. 20</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">h)= s' a)\n tisai/mhn, ei)/ moi du/nami/s ge
                            parei/h</foreign>. These differ from those in 3 only in the position of
                            the protasis. (Of these there are 8 cases of wishes, against 33 in which
                            no wish is implied, of which last 17 are concessive.)</p>
                        <p>The minority of 64 examples, in which <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the optative does not express a
                            wish, is made up of the 18 dissenting cases under 3, the 33 under 5
                            which contain no wishes, 5 exceptional cases (as Lange views them) under
                            4 (2 with doubtful readings), and 8 cases of <foreign lang="greek">w(s ei)</foreign> with the optative in similes, like
                                <foreign lang="greek">i)/san w(s ei)/ te puri\ xqw\n
                                pa=sa ne/moito</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.780">Il. ii. 780.</bibl></p>
                        <p>It will be seen that the strength of the argument lies in the
                            gradual development of the optative conditional sentence which is
                            supposed to appear in 1, 2, and 3. This is further enforced by reference
                            to cases in which the simple optative in a wish (without any form of
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>) is followed by an
                            apodosis, like the equivalent optatives with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in 2, thus showing the absence of a
                            conditional force in the latter. See <bibl n="Hom. Od. 15.180">Od. xv. 180</bibl>:&mdash;</p>
                        <p/>
                        <p><foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw nu=n *zeu\s qei/h,

                        <p>Since the two clauses are grammatically independent here, it
                            is argued that they must be equally so in the examples in 2.</p>
                        <p>The whole argument is based on the important assumption that
                            the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ei), ei)
                            ga/r</foreign>, etc. in a wish is the same in origin with the simple
                            optative in a wish, so that <foreign lang="greek">ei)
                                ge/noito tou=to</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ge/noito tou=to</foreign> both come to mean <emph>may
                                this be done</emph> in the same way, by a wishing power inherent in
                            the optative itself; and from this it is argued that <foreign lang="greek">ei) ge/noito tou=to</foreign> as a protasis is used in
                            a more primitive and natural sense when what is supposed is desired by
                            the speaker than when it is not. Unless we assume this as proved, and
                            reject the opposite alternative which makes the optative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in a wish a protasis with a
                            suppressed apodosis, we have no right to count the examples in 1 and 2
                            as evidence that the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> denotes a wish by its own nature; for it would be
                            reasoning in a circle to quote these as proof that the optative itself
                            denotes wish, in a discussion which aims at establishing the nature and
                            meaning of the optative in these very expressions. Again, the real
                            nature of the 43 conditions with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> and the optative in 4 is in question in this discussion;
                            and it is inadmissible here to assume at the outset that they express
                            wish in themselves and then to use them as evidence that wishing is the
                            original function of the optative. Proof is needed, therefore, that the
                            optatives in 1, 2, and 4 (that is, in 109 of the 136 wishing optatives
                            in Homer) actually express wish by their own force, so that they can
                            properly be used as independent testimony here. Until at least a
                            reasonable presumption in favour of this view is established, we are
                            without evidence that there is any such gradual development of the
                            optative condition as is claimed. We must therefore depend at present on
                            the only cases about which no doubts exist, the complete conditional
                            sentences in 3 and 5, to determine whether the optative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> involves the idea of wish
                            without regard to the nature of its apodosis. If it should be found that
                            the idea of wish preponderates in these optatives, we should have a
                            convincing proof that the same is true of the optatives in 1, 2, and 4,
                            whether these are viewed as protases or as original wishes. A slight
                            inspection of Lange's statistics will show that the question is not to
                            be settled in this simple way. Of the 37 optatives in 3, 19 suppose
                            something that is wished for, while 18 do the opposite. Of the 41 in 5,
                            only 8 suppose desirable things, while 33 do not. Therefore, in the 78
                            plain cases of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the
                            optative in conditions in Homer, we find only 27 expressing wishes. If
                            we confine ourselves to the cases in 3, where the protasis precedes, we
                            find as equal a division as is possible (19 : 18), showing very plainly
                            that even here wish has nothing whatever to do with the form of
                            expression. Indeed, if we take <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the optative in protasis by itself, what is there to
                            indicate that it involves a wish? It cannot be doubted that this form is
                            the equivalent of the English <emph>if he should
                            go</emph> and <emph>if we should see him;</emph> and who
                            would attempt to find any such idea as wish in these expressions? Unless
                            we are prepared to maintain that <emph>if we should be
                                saved</emph> expresses the original idea of the English construction
                            better than <emph>if we should perish</emph>, we must be
                            slow to assert that <foreign lang="greek">ei)
                            swqei=men</foreign> gives the spirit of the Greek optative better than
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei) a)poqa/noimen</foreign>. We
                            must remember also the large class of conditional relative sentences
                            which have the optative. This optative cannot be explained on any
                            different principle from the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, and yet who would profess to find
                            anything like the idea of wish in <foreign lang="greek">o(/ tis r(e/zoi</foreign>, <bibl n="Hom.

                            and 2, and see whether these establish any such strong presumption as
                            will justify us in making wish the fundamental idea of the optative with
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, <gloss>notwithstanding</gloss> the fact that a large

                            probable that the optative here is merely the wishing optative, preceded
                            by a sort of exclamatory particle <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>,<note n="2" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Lange, p. 484, calls <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> <quote>eine zur Einleitung von

                            different forms of an exclamation, <emph>O may it be

                                ge/noito</foreign> in a wish is the same as <foreign lang="greek">ei) ge/noito</foreign> in protasis, meaning <emph>if it should only be done</emph>, deriving its force
                            as a wish from the unconscious suppression of an apodosis like <emph>how happy I should be</emph> or <emph>it would be well?</emph> The difficulty of explaining <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in an ordinary protasis
                            like <foreign lang="greek">ei) h)=lqen</foreign>, <gloss>if he came</gloss>, as in any sense exclamatory is a
                            great obstacle in the way of Lange's view; but his alternative is
                            equally hard, to make <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in
                            a wish radically different from <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in a protasis. In the incomplete state of Lange's work, it
                            is impossible to see how successfully he would have surmounted this
                            difficulty. But, apart from this, we are compelled on his theory to
                            believe that the parallel construction of <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga/r</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ei)/qe</foreign> with the past tenses of the
                            indicative in wishes is radically different in principle from that of
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> etc. with the
                            optative. The former is a later construction; but is it possible that
                            the traditions of so fixed an expression as <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the optative in wishes could have
                            so utterly vanished that, while <foreign lang="greek">ei)
                                ga\r ge/noito</foreign>, <gloss>may it be
                            done</gloss>, had no conditional force, <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga\r e)ge/neto tou=to</foreign>, <gloss>O that this had been done</gloss>, was felt as
                            conditional? It is impossible to explain <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga\r e)ge/neto</foreign> except as an elliptical
                            protasis, since there is no form of wish like <foreign lang="greek">e)ge/neto</foreign> (alone) corresponding to <foreign
                                lang="greek">ge/noito</foreign>, <gloss>may it be done.</gloss> Even if we could suppose
                            that <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga\r e)ge/neto</foreign> was
                            formed ignorantly on the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga\r ge/noito</foreign>, it would be incredible that <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh\ ge/noito</foreign> should not have
                            engendered a corresponding <foreign lang="greek">mh\
                                e)ge/neto</foreign>.</p>
                        <p>But why is it thought necessary or probable that <foreign
                                lang="greek">ge/noito</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei) ga\r ge/noito</foreign> should have
                            had the same origin? If we can trust our feelings in the use of our own
                            language, it is beyond doubt that our expressions of wish, like <emph>may help come</emph> and <emph>O if
                                help should</emph> (or <emph>would</emph>) <emph>come!</emph> are entirely independent constructions,
                            and also that the latter is a condition with its conclusion suppressed.
                            Why should we not accept the same simple distinction in the Greek forms,
                            and admit that the Greek had two ways of expressing a future wish, one
                            by the simple optative, the other by a protasis with its apodosis
                            suppressed? Absolute proof is, of course, impossible in such a case; but
                            it is surely safe to maintain that no such strong presumption is
                            established in favour of identity of construction in <foreign lang="greek">ge/noito</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ei) ge/noito</foreign> in wishes, as to make it
                            probable that <foreign lang="greek">ei) ge/noito</foreign>
                            in protasis was originally a form of wish, in face of the fact that only
                            a small proportion of Homer's undoubted protases with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> and the optative express
                            wishes.</p>
                        <p>But it may be said that the peculiar examples of half-formed
                            conditional sentences in 2 (p. 376) establish the theory of the
                            development of the conditional optative out of a wish. But this
                            connecting link loses its value, when it is seen that it connects merely
                            one construction, in which the wishing force of the optative is at least
                            questionable, with another in which there is no positive evidence of any
                            wishing force at all. If the ordinary theory of the suppression of an
                            apodosis with <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga\r
                            ge/noito</foreign> in a wish is correct, we must suppose that the
                            suppressed apodosis was seldom felt in a definite form of words any more
                            than it is with our <emph>O if he would come.</emph> But
                            it might sometimes happen that an actual expression of a definite result
                            of the fulfilment of a wish would suit the case better than the
                            uncertain reference to a fulfilment, which the mere clause with <emph>if</emph> suggests. We have an excellent illustration
                            of this when a wish is repeated as a protasis in almost the same words,
                            and is then followed by an apodosis. See <bibl n="Hom. Od. 3.217">Od. iii. 217</bibl>-223 (quoted in &sect;
                             730), where <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga/r s' w(\s
                                e)qe/loi</foreign> is first a simple wish, and then is repeated as
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ s' ou(/tws
                            e)qe/loi</foreign>, with the apodosis <foreign lang="greek">tw=| ke/n tis</foreign>, etc. naturally following. The oft-recurring
                            verse <foreign lang="greek">ei)/q' w(\s h(bw/oimi, bi/h
                                de/ moi e)/mpedos ei)/h</foreign> appears in <bibl

                            vss. 503-506) as a simple wish with no addition; but in <bibl
                                n="Hom. Il. 7.157">Il. vii. 157</bibl>
                            it stands as a repetition of the wish contained in vss. 132, <bibl

                            other examples, we have simply the wish <emph>O if I were
                                young again</emph>, with its vague unexpressed apodosis; but in
                                <bibl n="Hom. Il. 7.157">Il. vii.
                            157</bibl> the result is expressed in the definite form, <emph>then would Hector meet his match.</emph> See <bibl
                                n="Hom. Od. 17.496">Od. xvii.
                            496</bibl> and xv. 536 (quoted in &sect; 730), in both of which a
                            definite apodosis expressing a result takes the place of the usual
                            suppressed conclusion. A distinction of optatives with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> into wishes and
                            suppositions, based on the wishing or non-wishing nature of the verb, is
                            often arbitrary. Thus Lange quotes, among his <quote>paratactic</quote>
                            wishes followed by an apodosis in a distinct sentence (that is,
                            half-developed conditional sentences), <bibl n="Hom. Il. 17.102">Il. xvii. 102</bibl>:&mdash;</p>

                        <p>His ground for distinction is merely that the former
                            expresses a wish, while the latter does not. Even if both sentences were
                            held to be simply conditional (as they probably are), it would still be
                            claimed that the optative is used in a more legitimate and primitive
                            sense in the former than in the latter. But is not the patent fact that
                            there is really no essential distinction between these two optatives
                            with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> (taken as
                            conditions) a strong argument against the whole doctrine which derives
                            the optative in protasis from the optative in wishes?</p>
                        <p>As to the 43 examples in 4, in which the optative with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> obviously stands without
                            any expressed apodosis, I must refer to the discussion of these in &sect;
                            &sect; 486-493, where they are explained as protases which contain
                            within themselves an implied clause of purpose as the apodosis. Whoever
                            will compare the examples of the optative in &sect; 488 with those of
                            the subjunctive in &sect; 487, or those of the optative in Delbr&uuml;
                            ck's <emph>Conjunctiv und Optativ</emph>, pp. 236-238,
                            with those of the subjunctive in pp. 171-175, will probably be satisfied
                            that the greater part of these optatives represent original
                            subjunctives, which are regularly used in this sense after primary
                            tenses, while the original optatives that occur after primary tenses in
                            this construction are not more frequent than they are in ordinary
                            protasis in Homer (see &sect;&sect; 499-501). Thus <foreign lang="greek">bh= *pa/ndaron dizh/menos ei)/ pou
                            e)feu/roi</foreign>, <gloss>he went seeking

                                anywhere</emph> (i.e. <emph>to find P. if haply he

                            e)feu/rw</foreign>. This is true, whatever theory we hold as to the nature
                            of the condition here. Again, this form is equally adapted to
                            suppositions which are not objects of wish or desire; as in <bibl

                        <p>We come then to the following conclusions. The theory that
                            wish is the fundamental idea of the optative finds no support in
                            conditional sentences with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> and the optative in Homer, for among 78 full sentences of
                            this class, only 27 express suppositions which are desired by the
                            speaker. The other optatives with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> which are said to express wishes stand without
                            apodosis, and the nature of these expressions is itself in question in
                            this discussion. As the presence of the idea of wish in the optative in
                            ordinary conditions would have been a strong proof that the same idea is
                            inherent in these other optatives, so the conspicuous absence of wish in
                            the former creates a presumption against its existence in the latter;
                            for it appears that, even if the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in wishes does express the wish by its
                            own natural force, this force has not passed over into the ordinary
                            optative in protasis, even in Homer. We have to consider, therefore,
                            whether in spite of this presumption it can be established that the
                            optative is the mood of wish, or that the two forms of optative in
                            wishes (with and without <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>) are identical in origin and construction. The theory of
                            their identity obliges us to believe that <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> is a sort of exclamatory particle;
                            whereas the older view, which has the authority of Aristarchus (&sect;
                            723), that the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in wishes is a protasis with a suppressed apodosis, avoids
                            this difficulty by making the form of wish the same as that of protasis.
                            The new theory also compels us to explain the past tenses of the
                            indicative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> and the
                            optative with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in wishes
                            on different principles. The cases in 2 (p. 376) of an optative with
                                <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in a wish followed
                            by an apodosis in a separate sentence are easily explained by supposing
                            an actual apodosis to be expressed in them, where commonly only a
                            general idea of satisfaction (like <foreign lang="greek">kalw=s a)\n e)/xoi</foreign>) is understood. The cases of <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with the optative without
                            an apodosis in 4 are to be explained by the implied apodosis: they are
                            not necessarily expressions of desire, and the optative here generally
                            represents an original subjunctive.</p>
                        <p>As a negative result, we do not find in the Homeric examples
                            as a whole any satisfactory proof that wish is the fundamental idea, or
                            even an essential idea, of the optative.</p>
                        <p>For the original meaning of the optative we must go, not to
                            the developed wish, still less to the developed potential construction
                            with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> or to the protasis
                            with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, but rather to
                            certain simpler and less decided expressions, a few of which remain in
                            Homer. In <bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.17">Il. iv.

                            do not make the usual potential apodosis, nor do they express a wish;
                            and yet a very slight change in the thought would make them either of
                            these. With <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> added, the meaning would

                            used with the same general idea in mind as <foreign lang="greek">a)/goito</foreign> in iv. 19, and <foreign lang="greek">nai/oite</foreign> is like <foreign lang="greek">oi)ke/oito</foreign>. This example would rather lead
                            us to understand both <foreign lang="greek">a)/goito</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">oi)ke/oito</foreign> as wishes. But in iii. 255 we have <foreign

                            though expressing the same general idea as <foreign lang="greek">a)ge/sqw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/goito</foreign> above. Also, in iii. 256 we have
                                <foreign lang="greek">nai/oimen</foreign> (like <foreign
                                lang="greek">nai/oite</foreign> in 74) and <foreign
                                lang="greek">ne/ontai</foreign> (as future). Again, in
                            iii. 138 Iris says to Helen <foreign lang="greek">tw=| de/

                            optative without <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> which
                            comes very near to that of the optative with <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign>, and also to that of the imperative and
                            of the future (with and without <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign>). This neutral use of the optative is generally called

                        <p>In other cases, the optative without <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> has a more decided potential force; as

                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> was freely used in the

                            corresponded to the subjunctives <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">i)/dw</foreign>, <gloss>I shall go</gloss> and <emph>I shall see</emph>, as weaker forms for expressing
                            future time. But both moods had inherited another use, by which <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/lqw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">i)/dw</foreign> meant <emph>let me
                            go</emph> and <emph>let me see</emph>, while <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/lqoimi</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">i)/doimi</foreign> meant <emph>may I go</emph> and <emph>may I
                            see.</emph> The reasons given above, for thinking a derivation of the
                            hortatory subjunctive from the simple future expression more probable
                            than the reverse, apply equally to the corresponding uses of the
                            optative.</p>
                        <p>In these neutral optatives, of which <bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.18">Il. iv. 18</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 19">Il. 19</bibl> gives the most striking
                            examples, we probably come nearest to the primitive use out of which the
                            two most common uses of the independent optative (potential and wishing)
                            were developed. Before the Homeric period these two uses were already
                            established, the potential with its mark of <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> and its negative <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, and the wishing with no external mark and its negative
                                <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>. It is hardly
                            possible that the first potential use of the optative was marked by
                                <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, for we find undoubted
                            potential optatives in Homer without either of these particles (see
                            &sect; 240), and even in Attic poetry such indefinite expressions as
                                <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)/sq' o(/stis, ou)k e)sq'
                                o(/pws</foreign>, etc. have the optative without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> (&sect; 241). Although the early
                            Greek, even in Homer, did not always use <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> with the potential optative, there is no evidence that
                            it ever failed to distinguish the wishing optative in negative sentences
                            by the use of <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, while the
                            potential was always negatived by <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>. The Sanskrit optative, which must have had a common
                            origin with the Greek, appears in its earliest use in the state in which
                            we have supposed the early Greek optative to have been, <foreign
                                lang="la">i.e.</foreign> used both in a potential
                            sense and in wishes without any particle like <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, and occasionally in a neutral or concessive sense.
                            But while the negative <foreign lang="sanskrit">na/</foreign> (= <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>) is
                            always found in the potential use, we have both <foreign lang="sanskrit">mA/</foreign> (= <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>) and <foreign lang="sanskrit">na/</foreign> in wishes and similar expressions in
                            which the Greek has only <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>.<note n="1" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See Delbr&uuml;ck, <emph> Conj.u.

                                <quote>But the expression of desire, on the one hand, passes naturally
                                over into that of request or entreaty, so that the optative becomes
                                a softened imperative; and on the other hand, it comes to signify
                                what is generally desirable or proper, what should or ought to be,
                                and so becomes the mode of prescription; or, yet again, it is
                                weakened into signifying what may or can be, what is likely or
                                usual, and so becomes at last a softened statement of what is.</quote>

                                of use of either is scarcely to be found to which the other does not
                                furnish a practical equivalent.</quote> The original relation of the
                                Sanskrit subjunctive and optative here stated closely resembles what
                                I believe to have been the original relation of the Greek
                                subjunctive and optative, the optative being essentially a sort of
                                weaker subjunctive, both expressing essentially the same ideas. My
                                own view would, I think, agree substantially with that suggested by
                                Delbr&uuml;ck (<emph>Syntaktische
                                Forschungen</emph>, <bibl n="Damian. Opt. 4"> Opt. iv.</bibl> p. 117) as an alternative to his
                                earlier view presented in his <emph>Conjunctiv und

                                I was, of course, not aware of this important concession of
                                Delbr&uuml;ck when I suggested in the same month (August,
                                1879), in my Greek Grammar, p. 258, the relation of the
                                optative to the subjunctive which is advocated in the present work.
                                Since the above was written, Delbr&uuml;ck in his <emph>Alt-Indische Syntax</emph> has expressed an
                                opinion (in contradiction to his earlier view, discussed above),
                                that the potential and wishing functions of the optative are
                                distinct in their origin.</note> The same peculiarity has been
                            noticed in the use of negatives with the subjunctive (p. 373).</p>
                        <p>It is probable that at some early period the Greek had two
                            parallel uses of the subjunctive and optative in independent sentences,
                            as follows:&mdash;</p>
                        <p><foreign lang="greek">e)/lqw</foreign>, <gloss>I shall go</gloss> (neg. <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>), or <emph>let me
                            go</emph> (neg. <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>)</p>
                        <p><foreign lang="greek">e)/lqh|s</foreign>, <gloss>thou wilt go</gloss> ( &rdquo; ), or <emph>go thou</emph> ( &rdquo; )</p>
                        <p><foreign lang="greek">e)/lqh|</foreign>, <gloss>he will go</gloss> ( &rdquo; ), or <emph>let him go</emph> ( &rdquo; )</p>
                        <p><foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoimi</foreign>, <gloss>I may</gloss> or <emph>might
                            go</emph> (neg. <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>), or
                                <emph>may I go</emph> (neg. <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>)</p>
                        <p><foreign lang="greek">e)/lqois</foreign>, <gloss>thou mayest</gloss> or <emph>mightest
                                go</emph> ( &rdquo; ), or <emph>mayest thou
                            go</emph> ( &rdquo; )</p>
                        <p><foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoi</foreign>, <gloss>he may</gloss> or <emph>might
                            go</emph> ( &rdquo; ), or <emph>may he go</emph> (
                            &rdquo; )</p>
                        <p>Although the Greek which is best known to us did not use the
                            second and third persons of the subjunctive in a hortatory sense, there
                            can be little doubt that such a use existed in the earlier language, as
                            appears from the use in Sanskrit and in Latin, and from the Greek
                            prohibitions with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>. (See
                            &sect; 258.) In an Elean inscription we find two cases of the third
                            person: <foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ ya/fisma . . .

                                says of this use: <quote>Es ist nicht zu bezweifeln, dass dieser
                                Conjunctiv-Typus im Griechischen ausstarb, weil der Imperativ dem

                        <p>Both moods alike developed a distinct potential use, which
                            was distinguished from the other by <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n;</foreign>
                            and in Homer we have forms like <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqw ke</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqh|
                                ke</foreign> parallel with <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoimi/ ke</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoi ke</foreign>, all negatived by <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>. The potential subjunctive, however, did
                            not survive the Epic period, while the potential optative became fixed
                            in the language. The future indicative also developed a potential form
                            with <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, which appears to have
                            survived the potential subjunctive, at least in the colloquial language.
                            The English has no form except its vague <emph>I may
                            take</emph> to express the various shades of meaning denoted by <foreign
                                lang="greek">e(lou=mai/ ke, e(/lwmai, e(/lwmai/
                            ke</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">e(loi/mhn</foreign>,
                            which once stood between <foreign lang="greek">e(lou=mai</foreign>, <gloss>I shall take</gloss>, and
                                <foreign lang="greek">e(loi/mhn a)/n</foreign>, <gloss>I should take.</gloss> (See &sect; 399.) The
                            subjunctive, therefore, in its two chief uses in independent sentences,
                            from which all others are derived, was originally accompanied by a
                            weaker future form, the optative, expressing the same idea less
                            distinctly and decidedly.</p>
                        <p>Let us now see how this weaker subjunctive (or future) form
                            enters into the various dependent constructions, that is, into
                            conditional and final sentences and indirect discourse.</p>
                        <p>The only dependent construction in which the optative is an
                            original form, not representing another mood after a past tense, is that
                            of protasis (including the conditional relative clause, but excluding
                            the past generic condition). Here we see the same relation between
                                <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n</foreign> (or <foreign
                                lang="greek">ei)</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ei) e)/lqoimi</foreign>, <gloss>if I
                                shall go</gloss> and <emph>if I should go</emph>, as
                            between the original <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqw</foreign>,
                                <gloss>I shall go</gloss>, and <foreign lang="greek">e)/lqoimi</foreign>, <gloss>I
                            may</gloss> (or <emph>might</emph>) <emph>go</emph>, the optative being a less distinct and vivid form for
                            presenting a future supposition, it may be for presenting the same
                            supposition which has already been presented by the subjunctive. The
                            distinction, whatever it may be thought to be, is that which appears in
                            our distinction of <emph>shall</emph> and <emph>should</emph>, and there will always be differences
                            of opinion as to the exact nature of this.<note n="1"

                                and their Greek Equivalents,</quote> in the <emph>Transactions of the Assoc. Phil. for</emph> 1876, pp. 87-107,
                                and in the English <emph>Journal of Philology</emph>,
                                vol. viii. no. 15, pp. 18-38. I have there given the best answer in
                                my power to the objection that my explanation of the optative in
                                protasis as <quote>less distinct and vivid</quote> than the
                                subjunctive lacks distinctness; this answer is, briefly, that my
                                statement is as distinct as the distinction itself to which it
                                refers.</note> The objections to deriving this form of condition
                            from the optative in wishes have already been considered. On the theory
                            that the protasis is an offshoot of the conditional relative clause (see
                            &sect; 398), we should understand <foreign lang="greek">ei) e)/lqw</foreign> as meaning originally <emph>in
                                case</emph> (i.e. <emph>in the case in which</emph>)
                                <emph>I shall go</emph> or <emph>may
                                go</emph>, and <foreign lang="greek">ei)
                            e)/lqoimi</foreign>, <gloss>in case I should go</gloss> or
                                <emph>might go</emph>,&mdash;<emph>should</emph> and <emph>might</emph> being here
                            merely weakened forms of <emph>shall</emph> and <emph>may.</emph> (Homeric optatives referring to the
                            present are discussed below.)</p>
                        <p>In the whole class of final sentences, in which the
                            subjunctive and optative are probably the only primitive forms, the
                            optative always represents a dependent subjunctive in the changed
                            relation to its leading verb in which it is placed when this verb is
                            changed from present or future to past time, a change which we represent
                            by our change from <emph>may</emph> to <emph>might</emph> or from <emph>shall</emph> to <emph>should;</emph> as <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/rxetai i(/na i)/dh| tou=to</foreign>,
                                <gloss>he comes that he may see this</gloss>, <foreign
                                lang="greek">h)=lqen i(/na i)/doi tou=to</foreign>,
                                <gloss>he came that he might see this</gloss>, etc.
                            The thought in the dependent clause is in both cases what would be
                            expressed originally by <foreign lang="greek">i(/na
                            i)/dw</foreign>, adapted to different circumstances; and the original
                            subjunctive (<foreign lang="greek">i(/na i)/dh|</foreign>)
                            could always be retained, even after past tenses, and by some writers it
                            was generally retained (&sect;&sect; 318-321). The change is, in fact,
                            the same which is made in indirect discourse when the leading verb is
                            past, since a past final clause always expresses the past thought of the
                            leading subject (&sect; 703). This relation to indirect discourse is
                            especially clear when the future indicative is used after primary
                            tenses, with the future optative corresponding to it after past tenses.</p>
                        <p>The optative of indirect discourse has much wider relations,
                            which were greatly extended as the language developed. Here the optative
                            represents not merely the subjunctive but also the indicative in the
                            changed relation in which these are placed by a change of the leading
                            verb from present or future to past time, the tenses of the optative
                            (with some restrictions) representing the corresponding tenses of either
                            subjunctive or indicative at pleasure, the present including also the
                            imperfect. In the development of the language, the want of an optative
                            form to represent the future indicative was felt, and the future
                            optative was added to the verb to supply the need, appearing first in
                            Pindar. In Homer, this use of the optative is imperfectly developed, as
                            the optative with <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> or
                                <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> in a quotation
                            representing a simple indicative is still unknown (&sect; 671). Still
                            the Homeric language has most of the other constructions of indirect
                            discourse, including the optative in indirect questions representing
                            both the indicative and the subjunctive. This optative in Homer appears
                            (as we should expect) more as the correlative of the subjunctive than as
                            that of the indicative. In indirect discourse, as in final
                            constructions, the optative is not absolutely demanded after past
                            tenses; and in some writers the original indicatives and subjunctives
                            are more common (&sect; 670). The future optative, as a new form, is
                            always less freely used than the older tenses.</p>
                        <p>In final constructions and in indirect discourse the optative
                            appears as a subjunctive or indicative (as it were) transferred to the
                            past, and it here has many points in common with the Latin imperfect and
                            pluperfect subjunctive. In Homer, moreover, the present optative is
                            regularly used in present unreal conditions and conclusions, and both
                            present and aorist optative with <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign> occasionally refer to the past like the imperfect and
                            aorist indicative with <foreign lang="greek">ke/</foreign>
                            or <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>. These uses, taken
                            in connexion with the secondary terminations of the optative, might lead
                            us to think that the optative was originally a past expression, so that
                                <foreign lang="greek">kai/ nu/ ken e)/nq'
                            a)po/loito</foreign>, <gloss>and now he would have
                                perished there</gloss>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.311">Il. v. 311</bibl>, would represent the regular use of
                            the primitive optative, instead of being (as is commonly thought) a rare
                            exception. Against this view, however, there are many considerations to
                            be urged.</p>
                        <p>1. The optative is fully established in Homer in wishes and
                            conditions as a future expression, and also in <emph>present</emph> unreal conditions, the imperfect indicative here
                            being still confined (like the aorist) to the past. In <emph>past</emph> unreal conditions the optative never
                            appears in protasis, and only rarely in apodosis, the aorist indicative
                            being already established here before Homer. Thus, while <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou)k a)\n gnoi/hs</foreign> in <bibl
                                n="Hom. Il. 5.85">Il. v. 85</bibl>
                            means <emph>you would not have discerned</emph>, it would
                            commonly mean, even in Homer, <emph>you would not
                            discern</emph> (as future), and the common Homeric expression in <bibl
                                n="Hom. Il. 5.85">Il. v. 85</bibl>
                            would be <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n e)/gnws</foreign>.
                            The evidence of the Homeric language, therefore, shows that the present
                            optative is the original form in present unreal conditions and
                            conclusions and in present unattained wishes, but is opposed to the view
                            that the optative was ever regularly past.</p>
                        <p>2. It is hardly possible that the past unreal conditional
                            preceded in development the ordinary future supposition. Every primitive
                            language must have needed expressions like <emph>if he
                                should go he would see this</emph> before it ventured upon <emph>if he had gone he would have seen this.</emph> If now
                            we suppose that <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n
                            gnoi/hs</foreign> had originally the sense <emph>you would
                                not have discerned</emph>, we must assume that the Greek expressed
                            this idea before it could express <emph>you would not
                                discern</emph> (future), for the language never had any other form
                            to express the latter. We cannot hesitate, therefore, to find in the
                            common future meaning of <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n
                                gnoi/hs</foreign> the original force of the expression, and to look
                            upon the occasional reference to the past as a relic of an early attempt
                            to express <emph>you would not have discerned</emph> by a
                            form already appropriated to another use.</p>
                        <p>3. The Homeric optative in conditional sentences agrees
                            remarkably with the Sanskrit in both the future and the present use, the
                            Sanskrit optative being used both in future and in unreal present
                            conditions and conclusions, but not in past conditions or conclusions.
                            This seems to show that the Greek inherited the two principal Homeric
                            uses of the optative, <ref target="s1">(1)</ref> in future conditions and wishes, and <ref
                                target="s2">(2)</ref> in <emph>present</emph> unreal conditions and unattained wishes, while, so far
                            as our evidence goes, the occasional use of the optative in past
                            potential expressions is an extension of its use beyond its hereditary
                            limits made by the early Greek itself.</p>
                        <p>4. The argument drawn from the past tenses of the Latin
                            subjunctive will not apply to Greek conditional sentences, for here the
                            present and perfect subjunctive in Latin (not the imperfect and
                            pluperfect) correspond to the Greek optative in its most frequent use,
                            and in the older Latin these primary tenses sometimes express present
                            unreal conditions.</p>
                        <p>The most natural view seems to be, that the primitive
                            optative, before it came into the Greek language, was a weak future
                            form, like <emph>he may go</emph> and <emph>may he go</emph>, from which on one side came its
                            potential and its future conditional use, and on the other side its use
                            in exhortations and wishes. These uses would naturally all be
                            established before there was any occasion to express either an unreal
                            condition or an unattained wish. The need of a form for present unreal
                            conditions and present unattained wishes would naturally come next, and
                            the present optative was made to include these also, no practical
                            difficulty being caused by having a single form for <emph>it would be</emph> as both present and future, none being felt in
                            Homer and none being now felt in English. In this state the optative
                            probably came into the Greek, before any attempt was made to extend its
                            use to past unreal conditions. When a form was required for these, the
                            optative may have been used at first, on the analogy of present unreal
                            conditions; but here the serious difficulty of using <foreign lang="greek">a)po/loito/ ke</foreign> for <emph>he
                                would have perished</emph> when it was already familiar in the sense
                                <emph>he would perish</emph> (hereafter) probably
                            prevented the establishment of this usage. Before our evidence begins,
                            the past tenses of the indicative were firmly established in past unreal
                            conditions, while the optative was here a rare exception, even in
                            apodosis, and was never used in protasis. But no attempt was yet made to
                            dislodge the present optative from present unreal conditions or the
                            corresponding wishes, although the use of <foreign lang="greek">w)/felon</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">w)/fellon</foreign> in Homer shows that a past
                            indicative in a present sense was not absolutely repugnant even to the
                            early usage. But afterwards a new tendency prevailed, and the imperfect
                            indicative took the place of the optative in present unreal conditions,
                            still retaining its older use (with the aorist) in past conditions. The
                            Greek, Sanskrit, and Latin appear to have developed their expressions of
                            past unreal conditions independently. The Sanskrit, which seldom needed
                            such a form, used its past future, as the Greek occasionally used <foreign
                                lang="greek">e)/mellon</foreign> with the infinitive
                            (see &sect; 428).</p>
                        <p>The optative in past general suppositions only represents the
                            corresponding subjunctive transferred to the past. This is, moreover,
                            not to be treated as a primitive use of the optative, for reasons which
                            apply also to the generic subjunctive (see &sect;&sect; 11, <emph>b</emph>, and 17).</p>
                        <p>If the optative, at the time of its origin in some ancestral
                            language, ever actually existed as a past form, as its terminations
                            certainly seem to indicate, no effect has come down to the Greek from
                            this remote origin, except perhaps the use of the optative to represent
                            the subjunctive (and afterwards the indicative) transferred to the past
                            in final constructions and indirect discourse. Even here, its relation
                            to the subjunctive, which is probably all that is primitive in this use,
                            is substantially that of a <quote>remoter future,</quote> as it is in
                            independent sentences and in protasis. </p>

                            explained. While there is a general agreement as to the meaning of the
                            two forms of expression in which this double negative occurs, that <ref
                                target="s1">(1)</ref>
                            <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ ge/nhtai</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ genh/setai</foreign> is <emph>it will not happen</emph>, and <ref
                                target="s2">(2)</ref>
                            <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ katabh/sei</foreign> is <emph>do not come down</emph>, there is great diversity of
                            opinion as to the manner in which these meanings are obtained from the
                            Greek expressions, and still greater as to the origin of the
                            constructions themselves. Most scholars have explained expressions of
                                <emph>denial</emph> with <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> and those of <emph>prohibition</emph> on entirely different theories, which involve
                            different views of the functions of the negatives in the two forms. The
                            explanation of the expressions of denial (like <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ ge/nhtai</foreign>) which has gained most
                            favour is that of an ellipsis after <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> of a verb or other form denoting fear, on which <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh\ ge/nhtai</foreign> depends; so that
                            the full form would be <foreign lang="greek">ou) de/os
                                e)sti\ mh\ ge/nhtai</foreign>, <gloss>there is no fear
                                that it will happen.</gloss> Since a strong argument for this
                            ellipsis is the existence of such examples as <foreign lang="greek">ou) fo/bos mh/ se a)ga/gw</foreign>, <bibl
                                n="Xen. Mem. 2.1.25">XEN. Mem. ii. 1,
                            25</bibl> , and <foreign lang="greek">ou)xi\ de/os mh/ de
                                filh/sh|</foreign>, <bibl n="Aristoph. Eccl. 650">AR. Eccl. 650</bibl>, which, by omitting <foreign
                                lang="greek">fo/bos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">de/os</foreign>, would become <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/ se a)ga/gw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ou)xi\ mh/ se filh/sh|</foreign>, it can hardly be
                            said that this is supposed to be one of the unconscious ellipses which
                            are no longer felt in actual use. This explanation, however, does not
                            help to account for the prohibitions in the second person, like <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ katabh/sei</foreign>, for there
                            is no freak of language by which <foreign lang="greek">ou)
                                de/os e)sti\ mh\ katabh=|s</foreign> or even <foreign lang="greek">ou) de/os e)sti\ mh\ katabh/sei</foreign> (if we can
                            suppose such an expression) could be transformed into <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ katabh/sei</foreign>, in the
                            sense <emph>do not come down.</emph> The prohibitions
                            have, therefore, generally been explained, on Elmsley's theory, as
                            interrogative; and <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\
                                katabh/sei;</foreign> is supposed to mean <emph>will
                                you not not come down?</emph> i.e. <emph>do not come
                                down.</emph> All subjunctives that are found in these prohibitions,
                            as in <cit>

                        <p>But all attempts to explain these constructions of <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> on different theories
                            lead to fatal difficulties. We cannot make all the prohibitions
                            interrogative, nor can we change all the prohibitory subjunctives to
                            futures without violence to the text; nor are all cases of <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> with the second person
                            of the subjunctive or of the future prohibitory. The following examples
                            show a complete transition from one of the uses of <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> to the other, and yet no line of
                            distinction, on which different theories of construction can reasonably
                            be based, can be drawn between any two of them:&mdash;</p>

                        <p>A preliminary question to be settled, if possible, is whether
                                <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> and <foreign

                            single strong negative, or whether <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> as an independent adverb negatives <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> and the verb taken together. The
                            difficulty either of conceiving <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> as
                            forming a single strong negative, as <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ou)de/n</foreign>
                            or <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">mhde/n</foreign> often do, or of
                            understanding how <foreign lang="greek">mh\
                            ge/nhtai</foreign>, which by itself cannot mean <emph>it
                                will not happen</emph>, can be strengthened by <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> into an expression <emph>with</emph> this very meaning, has made it impossible to defend the
                            former view on any recognised principle, even when it was adopted for
                            want of something better, as in the earlier editions of the present
                            work. The supposed analogy of <foreign lang="greek">mh\
                                ou)</foreign> forming a single negative with the infinitive will
                            hardly hold as a support of this; for, while we cannot have a sentence
                            like <foreign lang="greek">ou)x o(/sio/n e)sti mh\ ou)
                                bohqei=n</foreign> continued by an infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">ou)de/</foreign> (e.g. by <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\ a)mu/nesqai</foreign>), we frequently have
                            sentences like <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ kalei=s me
                                mhde\ katerei=s tou)/noma</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">mhde/</foreign> continues the prohibition without
                            repeating <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, showing the
                            distinct force of each part of this double negative. But this only
                            brings out more emphatically the perplexing question that lies at the
                            basis of the whole discussion. If <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> is an independent negative, as by every principle of
                            Greek negatives it should be, what does it negative? It is clear that
                            there is only one <emph>active</emph> negative in <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ ge/nhtai</foreign>, <gloss>it will not happen;</gloss> and <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ skw/yh|s</foreign>, <gloss>do
                                not jeer</gloss>, surely does not have one <emph>more</emph> active negative than <foreign lang="greek">mh\ skw/yh|s</foreign>.<note n="1" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">The idea suggested rather than advocated by
                                Gildersleeve (<emph>American Journal of

                        <p>It seems obvious, therefore, that if <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> is an independent negative in <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ ge/nhtai</foreign>, the negative
                            force of the <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> must in
                            some way be in abeyance, as otherwise the two simple negatives would
                            make the sentence as a whole positive. We may naturally turn for a
                            suggestion here to the principal form of expression in which the
                            negative force of <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> seems
                            to be in abeyance,&mdash;to Plato's favourite subjunctive with <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh/</foreign> as a form of cautious
                            assertion, as <foreign lang="greek">mh\ faulo\n
                            h)=|</foreign>, <gloss>I think it will prove to be

                            are, practically, cautious affirmative statements, the fear that
                            something may prove true having by usage softened into a suspicion, and
                            this again into an idea of probability or possibility, so that <foreign

                            originally meant <emph>may it not prove bad</emph> (<emph>as I fear it may</emph>), has come to mean <emph>I suspect it may prove bad</emph>, and finally, <emph>I think it will prove bad</emph> or <emph>it will probably prove bad.</emph> The expression,
                            however, always retains at least the implication that the fact thus
                            stated is an object of apprehension to <emph>some
                            one</emph>, though it has lost all of its original reference to such

                            with the independent subjunctive in Plato, is, however, confined to the

                            in Plato. (See examples in &sect; 295.) Still, the successful
                            application of the principle to the few present subjunctives which are

                        <p>The independent subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> is by no means confined to the Platonic

                            in Attic Greek. It is familiar in Homer in expressions of apprehension
                            combined with a desire to avert the object of fear; as <foreign

                            itself and sometimes the desire to avert the danger is more prominent;

                            interrogatives in Plato: <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 64C">Phaed. 64C</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 603C"> Rep. 603 C</bibl>, <bibl

                            independent <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> that have
                            been quoted, we should never know that the construction existed between
                            Homer and Plato. We have good ground for believing that it remained as a
                            colloquial idiom in the language, though it seldom appeared in
                            literature until Plato revived it and restored it to common use as a
                            half-sarcastic form of expressing mildly a disagreeable truth. In Plato,
                            the construction is not confined to this peculiar sense, for we find
                            cases in which honest apprehension is expressed as in the older use.

                            meaning, even in Plato, we may probably assume that the expression more
                            frequently included the idea of apprehension which is essential to it in
                            Homer. But the other examples show that <foreign lang="greek">mh\ la/bwsi/ se</foreign> must have been in equally
                            good use in the sense <emph>I suspect they will seize
                            you</emph> (implying no apprehension). If now we suppose <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou)</foreign> to be prefixed to <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh\ la/bwsi/ se</foreign>, we shall have
                                <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ la/bwsi/ se</foreign>,
                            which could be said with the meaning <emph>I am not
                                afraid that they will seize you</emph>, and equally well with the
                            meaning <emph>they shall not seize you.</emph> The former

                                suspicion (e.g. denying that there is any suspicion that something
                                will happen). Surely no one could understand <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou) dunato\s w)=</foreign>, <gloss>I suspect I shall not be able</gloss>, as the

                        <p>If it is thought that the limited number of cases of
                            independent <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> with the
                            subjunctive not implying apprehension do not justify the assumptions
                            which have been based on them, it is easy to see how the change from the
                            denial of an apprehension to the denial of a suspicion might have taken
                            place within the <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign>
                            construction itself. If we suppose such expressions as <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ lhfqw=</foreign> and <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/ ti/s se u(bri/sh|</foreign> to
                            have been established as the negatives of <foreign lang="greek">mh\ lhfqw=</foreign>, <gloss>I fear I
                                may be caught</gloss>, and <foreign lang="greek">mh/
                                ti/s se u(bri/sh|</foreign>, <gloss>I fear some one
                                may insult you</gloss>, they must soon have fallen out of this
                            relation to the parent forms, and have been felt in use to be mere
                            future negative assertions, so that they could not long be restricted to
                            sentences in which apprehension was implied. Thus, <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ nau=s a)formi/sh| xqono/s</foreign> would soon
                            become as natural to those who used these forms as the older <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/ ti/s se u(bri/sh|</foreign>.
                            According to this view, <foreign lang="greek">ou)
                            mh/</foreign> with the subjunctive would come into the language in the
                            sense of a denial of an apprehension, which is essentially the same
                            general sense as that supposed by the theory of an ellipsis of <foreign
                                lang="greek">de/os e)sti/n</foreign>. But there is a
                            great advantage in dispensing with this troublesome and improbable
                            ellipsis, and deriving the meaning from the sentence as it stands. There
                            is surely no more ground for assuming this ellipsis here than in the
                            independent subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, which is an older construction than the dependent
                            subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>. And if
                            we accept <foreign lang="greek">mh/ ti/s se
                            u(bri/sh|</foreign> as a complete construction, without the help of <foreign
                                lang="greek">de/os e)sti/n</foreign>, it is absurd to
                            invent an ellipsis to explain <foreign lang="greek">ou)
                                mh/ ti/s se u(bri/sh|</foreign> as a shorter form for <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) de/os e)sti\ mh/ ti/s se
                            u(bri/sh|</foreign>. In fact, dispensing with this ellipsis removes the
                            most fatal objection to the view of the sentence on which the old theory
                            was based.</p>
                        <p>In whichever of the two ways above suggested the subjunctive
                            with <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> came to express
                            a simple future denial, it was only natural that the Attic Greek should
                            soon begin to use the future indicative in place of the subjunctive in
                            the same sense. Thus we have in <cit>

                            the subjunctive must have been lost, as there was no corresponding
                            clause with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> and the
                            future indicative in common use, of which <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> with the future could be the

                            </cit> (See <ref target="s69">&sect;
                            69</ref>.) The dramatists soon introduced the form with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> into such prohibitions,
                            generally with the future indicative, but occasionally with the more
                            primitive subjunctive. Thus <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\
                                katabh/sei</foreign> had the sense of <gloss>do not
                                come down</gloss>, derived from <gloss>you shall not
                                come down</gloss>, as <foreign lang="greek">ou)
                                yau/seis</foreign> (above) from meaning <gloss>you
                                shall not touch</gloss> came to mean <gloss>do not
                                touch.</gloss> One of the strongest objections to the older views of
                            the forms with <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> is
                            that they generally require a distinct explanation of this prohibitory
                            construction. Elmsley's theory of a question with two negatives,
                            explaining <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\
                            katabh/sei;</foreign> as <gloss>will you <emph>NOT NOT</emph> come down?</gloss> hence <gloss>do not come down</gloss>, was stated in the <title>Quarterly Review</title> for June 1812, and in his
                            note to <bibl n="Eur. Med. 1120">EUR. Med.
                                1120</bibl> (1151 Dind.). Many who do not adopt Elmsley's theory in
                            full still accept the interrogative form, and these sentences are now
                            generally printed as questions. Long before Elmsley, the famous 
                            <quote>Canon Davesianus</quote> had proscribed all sigmatic aorist
                            subjunctives with <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> as
                            well as with <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh/</foreign>.
                            This edict removed nearly or quite all the troublesome subjunctives that
                            would have opposed Elmsley's view, and left only the future indicative
                            in his doubly-negatived questions, which of course required an
                            indicative. This again set up an artificial distinction in form between
                            the prohibitory construction allowing only the future indicative, and
                            the other construction allowing both subjunctive and future indicative.</p>
                        <p>But it has been more and more evident in later years that
                            this distinction in form between the two constructions cannot be
                            maintained. It was seen by Brunck, before Elmsley's interrogative theory
                            appeared, that it would be absurd to distinguish sentences like <cit>

                                lang="greek">e)kpleu/seis</foreign> proved to be even
                            a greater solecism than <foreign lang="greek">e)kpleu/sh|s</foreign> was thought to be, for the only classic future of

                            to be restored. Again, while almost all the sentences containing a

                            followed by a positive command with <foreign lang="greek">a)lla/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>,

                                and follow me?</gloss> &mdash; another passage of the Clouds
                            resisted both of these and also the prescribed form. In <bibl
                                n="Aristoph. Cl. 296">296</bibl>, the
                            Mss. have <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ skw/yh|s mhde\
                                poih/sh|s a(/per oi( trugodai/mones ou(=toi: a)ll'
                            eu)fh/mei</foreign>. Brunck emended this without hesitation to <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ skw/yeis mhde\
                            poih/seis</foreign>, with the note <quote><foreign lang="la">
                                soloece vulgo</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">skw/yh|s . . .
                                    poih/sh|s</foreign>.</quote> But there was no place for
                            Elmsley's interrogative mark, which could not stand after the
                            imperative, and could not be inserted after <foreign lang="greek">ou(=toi</foreign> without implying that the other
                            sentences (like <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 505">AR. Nub. 505</bibl> above) were wrongly punctuated. The emendation
                                <foreign lang="greek">skw/yeis</foreign> was as
                            unfortunate as <foreign lang="greek">e)kpleu/seis</foreign>,
                            as the future of <foreign lang="greek">skw/ptw</foreign> is
                                <foreign lang="greek">skw/yomai</foreign>, not <foreign
                                lang="greek">skw/yw</foreign>, so that a further
                            emendation to <foreign lang="greek">skw/yei</foreign> was
                            needed. In this battered condition, and with no interrogative mark to
                            help the interpretation, the passage usually appears, even in the latest
                            editions. (See &sect;&sect; <ref target="s298">298</ref>, <ref target="s300">300</ref>, <ref target="s301">301</ref>.) So long as it is proposed to explain these
                            prohibitions and the ordinary denials with <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> on entirely different theories, with
                            nothing common to the two constructions, it may not seem unreasonable to
                            force a few examples like <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 296">AR. Nub. 296</bibl> and <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 367">367</bibl> into conformity with the
                            general usage. But on any theory which makes no distinction in
                            construction between the prohibitions and the other negative expressions
                            of denial or refusal (for example, between <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ e)kpleu/sh|s</foreign>, <gloss>you shall not sail away</gloss>, and <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ katabh/sei</foreign>, <gloss>do not come down</gloss>, i.e. <gloss>you shall not
                                come down</gloss>), there is no more reason for objecting to <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ skw/yh|s</foreign> than to <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ e)kpleu/sh|s</foreign>. An
                            occasional subjunctive, like <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\
                                skw/yh|s</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\
                                lhrh/sh|s</foreign>, is indeed no more than we should naturally expect
                            in a construction which had its origin in the subjunctive. In such
                            expressions, further, the analogy of the equivalent <foreign lang="greek">mh\ skw/yh|s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mh\ lhrh/sh|s</foreign> would tend to make the aorist
                            subjunctive unobjectionable and perfectly natural. A reference to the
                            list of passages quoted on page 390 will show the inconsistencies into
                            which every one must fall who attempts to explain the prohibitions and
                            the clauses of denial on different theories. We cannot separate <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ skw/yh|s</foreign> from <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ e)kpleu/sh|s</foreign> in
                            construction, nor the latter from <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ pa/qh|s</foreign>, nor this again from <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/ tis u(bri/sh|</foreign>, on any consistent
                            principle of interpretation.<note n="1" place="unspecified"

                        <p>In conclusion, we may sum up the result of the investigation
                            as follows. The original construction of <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> with the subjunctive was developed
                            as a negative form of the independent subjunctive with <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, which had already become
                            an expression of apprehension with desire to avert its object, even if
                            it had not passed into the stage of a cautious assertion; in either
                            case, the real negative force of <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> was in abeyance. The aorist subjunctive is the most common
                            form here, the present being less frequent. This form of future denial
                            next admitted the future indicative in the same sense as the
                            subjunctive. The second person singular of this future with <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> was used by the
                            dramatists as a prohibition, without abandoning the sense which the
                            future can always have in both positive and negative commands. In these
                            prohibitions the future indicative, in which they had their origin, is
                            generally used; but the subjunctive occasionally occurs, being analogous
                            to the ordinary aorist subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> in prohibitions; e.g. <foreign
                                lang="greek">mh\ skw/yh|s</foreign> supporting <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) mh\ skw/yh|s</foreign>.<note

                                </foreign></quote> the other, <quote><foreign lang="de">Ich

                                    werdest.</foreign></quote> By prefixing <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">mh\ qa/nh|s</foreign> in these meanings, he
                                arrives at two uses of <foreign lang="greek">ou)
                                mh/</foreign> with the subjunctive. The second meaning comes so near
                                the independent subjunctive with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> in Homer, that it is surprising that neither this
                                nor the equally important <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> in Plato is mentioned. But no use is made of the
                                advantage here gained in explaining <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh/</foreign> with the future indicative,
                                either in prohibitions or in denials. The prohibitions are made
                                interrogative, <foreign lang="greek">ou) mh\ dusmenh\s
                                    e)/sei;</foreign> being explained as <quote><foreign lang="de">Nicht wahr?&mdash;du wirst doch nicht
                                    feindselig seyn?</foreign></quote> The future of denial is
                                explained simply as developed from the interrogative future, as a
                                form of reply to this, by leaving out the interrogative
                            element.</note>

                            known that Xenophon is almost the only writer of Attic prose who uses
                                <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> freely in the final
                            constructions. Weber's statistics (p. 398) show that while <foreign
                                lang="greek">w(s</foreign> is the favourite final
                            particle in tragedy, it is hardly found in Aristophanes, Thucydides,
                            Plato, and the Orators. Xenophon forms a strange exception to the prose
                            usage, having <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> or <foreign
                                lang="greek">w(s a)/n</foreign> in 91 of his pure
                            final clauses. There is nothing peculiar in his use of final <foreign
                                lang="greek">w(s</foreign> with either subjunctive or
                            optative, as it merely takes the place of another final particle.</p>
                        <p>2. In his use of <foreign lang="greek">w(s
                            a)/n</foreign> in final clauses, however, several peculiarities appear,
                            which show that Xenophon felt the original force of <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> as a relative adverb of manner (<ref
                                target="s312">&sect; 312</ref>). The

                            Xenophon's favourite final particle is <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign>, but there is nothing peculiar in his
                            use of it in pure final clauses with either subjunctive or optative. He
                            further uses <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws a)/n</foreign>
                            with the subjunctive like other Attic writers (see examples in <ref

                        <p>With the optative he uses <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws a)/n</foreign> in four cases with a distinct final and an
                            equally distinct potential force. These examples are quoted in <ref

                        <p>Xenophon is more peculiar in his use of <foreign lang="greek">w(s, w(s a)/n</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws a)/n</foreign> in these clauses than in pure
                            final clauses. Here he generally uses <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign> with the future indicative,
                            subjunctive, and optative, and occasionally <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws a)/n</foreign> with the subjunctive, like other
                            Attic writers (see examples in &sect;&sect; <ref
                                target="s339">339</ref> and <ref
                                target="s348">348</ref>). But he distinctly violates
                            Attic usage by having <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign>
                            (in the sense of <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign>)
                            with both subjunctive and future indicative, and with the present,
                            aorist, and future optative; also <foreign lang="greek">w(s a)/n</foreign> with both subjunctive and optative and <foreign
                                lang="greek">o(/pws a)/n</foreign> with the optative;
                            and further by allowing the optative with <foreign lang="greek">w(s a)/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws a)/n</foreign> to follow both primary and
                            secondary tenses. His use of <foreign lang="greek">w(s
                                a)/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws
                            a)/n</foreign> with the optative, especially after primary tenses, shows
                            strongly the original relative and interrogative force of <foreign

                    <p>THE familiar construction by which <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei, xrh=n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">e)xrh=n, ei)ko\s h)=n, prosh=ken, e)ch=n</foreign>, and
                        other imperfects denoting <emph>obligation, propriety</emph>,
                        or <emph>possibility</emph>, are used with the infinitive in
                        an idiomatic sense, the whole expression becoming a form of potential
                        indicative, and generally implying the opposite of the action or the
                        negation of the infinitive, has already been explained in <ref
                            target="s415">&sect;&sect; 415-423</ref>. Some
                        additional remarks, however, seem necessary, to guard against prevailing
                        misapprehensions.</p>
                    <p>The important distinction between this idiomatic construction and
                        the use of these imperfects as ordinary past tenses (<ref
                            target="s417">&sect; 417</ref>) is generally indicated
                        only by the context, and not by the words themselves. It may even be
                        doubtful in some cases which meaning is intended. Thus, in <cit>
                            <bibl n="Dem. 18.190">DEM. xviii. 190,</bibl>
                            <quote lang="greek">ti/ to\n su/mboulon e)xrh=n poiei=n;
                                ou) . . . e(le/sqai;</quote>
                        </cit> nothing in the words shows whether the action of <foreign lang="greek">e(le/sqai</foreign> is real or not; but the following
                            <foreign lang="greek">tou=to toi/nun e)poi/hsa</foreign>
                        shows that the questions refer merely to a past duty which the speaker
                        actually performed. Indeed, the idiomatic use of <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign> etc. with the infinitive may be found in
                        the same sentence with the ordinary use of these imperfects as past tenses
                        without reference to any condition. A familiar case is in the New Testament,
                            <cit>
                            <bibl n="Matthew 23.23">MATTH. xxiii. 23,</bibl>

                                <note resp="wwg" place="inline" anchored="yes">(taking tithes)</note> undone.</gloss> This is equivalent to two
                        sentences, <foreign lang="greek">tau=ta e)/dei u(ma=s
                        poih=sai</foreign>, <gloss>ye ought to have done these</gloss>
                        (which ye did not do), and <foreign lang="greek">e)kei=na
                            e)/dei u(ma=s mh\ a)fei=nai</foreign>, <gloss>ye were
                            right in not leaving those undone</gloss> (which ye did not leave
                        undone). We have a decisive proof of the idiomatic use when the present
                        infinitive with <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign> etc.
                        refers to present time, as when <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n se
                            tou=to poiei=n</foreign> means <gloss>you ought to be
                            doing this</gloss> (but are not); for these words without the potential
                        force could mean only <gloss>it was (once) your duty to do
                            this.</gloss> This use of a past tense to express present time, which is
                        found in Greek, Latin, and English (<ref target="s417">&sect; 417</ref>), is an important characteristic of this
                        idiom.</p>
                    <p>It is generally laid down as an absolute rule that in this idiom
                        the opposite of the infinitive is <emph>always</emph>
                        implied. See Kr&uuml;ger, &sect; 53, 2, 7, where the usual formula is
                        given, that with <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei tou=to
                            gi/gnesqai</foreign> we must understand <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' ou) gi/gnetai</foreign>, but with <foreign
                            lang="greek">e)/dei a)\n tou=to gi/gnesqai</foreign> we
                        must understand <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' ou) dei=</foreign>.
                        This principle was first formulated, I believe, by G. Hermann.<note n="1"

                                oportebat. Itaque quod opponere potes, aliud est: <foreign
                                    lang="greek">a)ll' ou)k

                            negative expression of this kind (even when the negation belongs to the
                            leading verb) is an affirmative. Thus <foreign lang="greek">ou) prosh=ken e)lqei=n</foreign>, <gloss>he ought not to have gone</gloss>, implies <foreign

                        zw=sin</foreign>.</note> It covers nearly all the ordinary cases, and has
                        generally been found to be a convenient working rule, though many passages
                        show that it is not of universal application. The following three classes of
                        examples show the need of a more flexible formula.</p>
                    <p>(1) In the following cases the opposite of the leading verb is
                        implied far more than that of the infinitive, the action of the latter in

                    <p>These examples are important as showing that there is nothing in
                        an expression like <foreign lang="greek">e)ch=n soi poiei=n

                    <p>(3) In some concessive examples, in which the apodosis ought to
                        be affirmed, we find the action of the infinitive denied.</p>

                        apodosis in these expressions with <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign> etc. is not to be found in the infinitive <emph>alone.</emph></p>
                    <p>It is well known that the imperfects in question (without <foreign
                            lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>) can be used with the
                        infinitive in two ways, &mdash; (a) alone, with no protasis expressed or
                        implied except the condition which is contained in the expression itself, as
                        in <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei se e)lqei=n</foreign>, <gloss>you ought to have gone;</gloss> and (b) as the apodosis
                        of an unreal condition, as in <foreign lang="greek">ei)
                            ou(=to/s se e)ke/leusen, e)/dei se e)lqei=n</foreign>, <gloss>if he had commanded you, you should have gone.</gloss>
                        It will be noticed that all the examples quoted above under (1) and (2) are
                        of the latter class, for in <cit>

                        from their protases, we shall find that no one of them can then have the

                    <p>When these potential expressions without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> stand alone, they always imply the opposite
                        of the action or the negation of the infinitive; so that <foreign lang="greek">ei)ko\s h)=n se tou=to paqei=n</foreign> by itself can
                        mean only <gloss>you would properly have suffered
                        this</gloss> (but you did not). This is necessary because the equivalent of
                        this form, <foreign lang="greek">tou=to a)\n e)/paqes ei) to\
                            ei)ko\s e)/paqes</foreign>, always involves <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)/paqes tou=to</foreign>, since <foreign lang="greek">tou=to</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)ko/s</foreign> are here made identical, and <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)ko\s e)/paqes</foreign> is denied. When, however,
                        one of these expressions is made the apodosis of an unreal condition
                        external to itself, it may be so modified by the new condition as no longer
                        to imply the opposite of the infinitive as before. This is the case with the
                        four examples under (1), in which we certainly do not find <foreign
                            lang="greek">ou) poie/eis, a)/llo le/gei kai\
                            sumbouleu/ei, ou)k h)|tia/sato</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ou)k h)ra/sqhs</foreign> implied in the form of
                        expression. The apparent paradox here is explained by the principle stated
                        in <ref target="s511">&sect; 511</ref>, that
                        when several protases, not co-ordinate, belong to the same sentence, one
                        always contains the leading condition, to which the rest of the sentence
                        (including the other conditions) forms the conclusion; and when this leading
                        condition is unreal, it makes all subordinate past or present conditions
                        also unreal, so far as the supposed case is concerned, without regard to
                        their own nature. A sentence like this, <emph>If you had been
                            an Athenian, you would have been laughed at if you had talked as you
                        did</emph>, shows the principle clearly. This has become the relation of the
                        unreal protasis involved in <foreign lang="greek">ei)ko\s h)=n
                            se tou=to paqei=n</foreign>, when this expression is made the apodosis of
                        a new unreal condition. Thus, when <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n
                            se poie/ein</foreign> in <bibl n="Hdt. 1. 39">HDT. i. 39</bibl>, which by itself could admit only an unreal object,
                        follows <foreign lang="greek">ei) u(po\ o)do/ntos ei)=pe
                            teleuth/sein me</foreign>, even <foreign lang="greek">ta\
                            poie/eis</foreign> can be its object, and the whole can mean <emph>if the dream had said I was to perish by a tooth, you
                            would do what you now do if you did what was right.</emph> The new chief
                        protasis that has come in has changed the whole relation of the old implied
                        protasis to the sentence as a whole.</p>
                    <p>It is often difficult to express in English the exact force of
                        these expressions, even when no external protasis is added, and the opposite
                        of the infinitive (not that of the leading verb) is therefore implied. Thus,

                    <p>We have seen that we cannot make the denial of the action of the
                        infinitive an absolute test of the proper use of the form without <foreign
                            lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> where there is an external
                        protasis added to the condition implied in the expression itself. The
                        examples last quoted show that we cannot make the denial of the leading verb
                        an absolute test of the proper use of the form with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>. In fact, this idiom is too flexible and
                        too dependent on the momentary feeling of the speaker or writer to subject
                        itself to any such strict rules as are usually forced upon it. The following
                        rules seem to me to be as exact as the Greek usage warrants.<note n="1"
                            place="unspecified" anchored="yes">When an external
                            protasis is added, there is no necessity for any denial of the action of

                            generally implied in the apodosis of an unreal condition, and the
                            apodosis (as a whole) happens to be denied in all the cases of the
                            construction of <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign> etc.
                            with the infinitive which are discussed here. No notice is taken,
                            therefore, of the principle of &sect; 412 in this discussion.</note></p>
                    <p>1. The form without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is used when the infinitive is the principal word, on which
                        the chief force of the expression falls, while the leading verb is an
                        auxiliary which we can express by <emph>ought, might,
                        could</emph>, or by an adverb.</p>
                    <p>2. On the other hand, when the chief force falls on the
                        necessity, propriety, or possibility of the act, and not on the act itself,

                        quoted by La Roche, we find <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei
                        a)/n</foreign> in its meaning <gloss>there would be (or would
                            have been) need</gloss>, whereas in the form without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> we generally have <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign> in the sense of <emph>ought</emph>, expressing <emph>obligation</emph> and not
                            <emph>necessity.</emph> Of course, the idea of necessity
                        is incompatible with that of an act not done. If La Roche's statistics are
                        complete here, we see that the Greeks almost always expressed obligation or
                        propriety, and generally expressed possibility, by the form without <foreign
                            lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, reserving <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei a)/n</foreign> for the idea of necessity, and
                            <foreign lang="greek">e)ch=n a)/n</foreign> for a few cases
                        in which the idea of possibility was to be made specially emphatic.</p>
                    <p>It is not surprising, under these circumstances, that the form
                        without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> should often be
                        used where we are at first inclined to think <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is required. It must be remembered that the
                        real apodosis here is not the central infinitive alone, but this infinitive
                        modified by the idea of obligation, propriety, or possibility in the leading
                        verb, that is, conditioned by the implied protasis which the expression
                        includes (see <ref target="s420">&sect;
                        420</ref>). This modification may be so slight as to leave the infinitive
                        the only important word in the apodosis; in this case the opposite of the
                        infinitive is generally implied, as it always is when no protasis is added:
                        thus, <cit>

                            pei/sas me</foreign>. It may be so great as to make the idea of obligation
                        etc. a prominent factor in the apodosis, still stopping short of the point
                        at which this favourite Greek idiom was abandoned and an ordinary apodosis
                        with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> was substituted in its
                        place. The Greeks preferred the form without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> almost always where we can express the
                        apodosis by the verb of the infinitive with <emph>ought,
                            might</emph>, or <emph>could</emph>, or with an adverb,
                        although we sometimes find it hard to express the combined idea in English
                        without giving undue force to the leading verb. Sometimes, when the idea of
                        obligation, propriety, or possibility is specially prominent in the
                        apodosis, although no <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is
                        used, the opposite that is suggested combines this idea with that of the
                        infinitive. This is the case with the examples in <ref
                            target="s1">(1)</ref>, in which the distinction between
                        the two forms is very slight and of little practical account. In <bibl
                            n="Hdt. 1. 39">HDT. i. 39</bibl>, the
                        apodosis is <gloss>you would then properly do what you now
                            do</gloss> (or <gloss>you would then, if you did what
                            you ought, do what you now do</gloss>), implying <emph>now you do not do this properly.</emph> With <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n a)/n</foreign> it would have been <gloss>it would then be your duty to do what you now
                        do</gloss>, the chief force being transferred from the act to the duty or
                        necessity. Still, this change might have been made without otherwise
                        affecting the sense. In <bibl n="Dem. 9.6">DEM.
                            ix. 6</bibl>, the apodosis is <gloss>in that case the
                            speaker would properly talk of nothing else than this</gloss> (implying
                            <emph>now he may properly talk of another matter</emph>);
                        whereas with <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei a)/n</foreign> it
                        would be <emph>there would then be no need of his talking of
                            anything else</emph>, with greater emphasis on the <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign> and with a change of meaning. In <cit>
                            <bibl n="Dem. 23.37">DEM. xxiii. 37,</bibl>
                            <quote lang="greek">e)nh=n ai)tia/sasqai</quote>

                        a)/n</foreign> it would have been <emph>it would then have been
                            possible for him to accuse me</emph>, the emphasis being transferred
                        with no other change of sense. The same is true of <bibl n="Eur. Med. 490">EUR. Med. 490.</bibl> Likewise, in <bibl
                            n="Isoc. 18. 21">ISOC. xviii. 21</bibl>, the
                        apodosis, <gloss>in that case we ought not to wonder at
                        him</gloss> or <gloss>we should not properly wonder at
                        him</gloss>, is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)\n
                            e)qauma/zomen a)ci/ws</foreign>, with the opposite implied, <emph>now we do wonder at him properly</emph> (<foreign
                            lang="greek">nu=n qauma/zomen a)ci/ws</foreign>). This
                        combination of two ideas in an apodosis of this kind is analogous to that
                        which we often find in an ordinary apodosis with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>; thus, in <cit>

                    <p>A striking illustration of the modification of the infinitive in
                        an apodosis of this kind by the force of the leading verb may be seen in the
                        examples under <ref target="s3">(3)</ref>. Here
                        in concessive sentences, in which the apodosis must be affirmed, we find the
                        action of the infinitives denied. This shows that the infinitive alone is
                        not the real apodosis. In <bibl n="Soph. OT 255">SOPH. OT 255</bibl>, the actual apodosis is <quote>you
                            would not properly leave the guilt unpurged</quote> (implying <gloss>you do not properly leave it</gloss>). In <bibl
                            n="Thuc. 1. 38">THUC. i. 38</bibl>, the
                        apodosis is <quote>they would fairly have yielded</quote>
                        (implying <gloss>they did not yield, but it was fair that
                            they should</gloss>). In <bibl n="Isoc. 12. 71">ISOC. xii. 71</bibl>, it is <quote>they
                            would deservedly have received</quote>, = <foreign lang="greek">e)/tuxon a)\n a)ci/ws</foreign> (implying that it was only
                            <emph>undeservedly</emph> that they <emph>failed to receive</emph> the reward). The remarks that have been made
                        above apply also to the concessive sentences in <ref
                            target="s2">(2)</ref>, in which nothing in the apodosis is
                        denied. Here, too, the form with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> might have been used by transferring the force of the
                        expression from the infinitive to the leading verb.</p>
                    <p>It has been seen that <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei
                            a)/n</foreign> with the infinitive differs from <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign> without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in meaning as well as in the balance of
                        emphasis. On the other hand, <foreign lang="greek">e)ch=n
                        a)/n</foreign> differs from <foreign lang="greek">e)ch=n</foreign>
                        only in the latter respect. See <cit>

                            perish unjustly;</gloss> but in <bibl n="Lys. 12.48">48</bibl>, referring to the same man and the same acts,
                        the orator says <foreign lang="greek">ei)/per h)=n a)nh\r

                            informer</gloss>. La Roche proposes to omit <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in the second passage, because it would be
                        absurd to suppose that <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'
                        e)xrh=n</foreign> is implied in the sense that <emph>E. had a
                            right to be lawless in office</emph> (<quote><foreign lang="de">er durfte</foreign>
                        <foreign lang="greek">parano/mws a)/rxein</foreign></quote>)
                        because he was not honest. What is implied is rather <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' ou)k e)xrh=n mh\ parano/mws a)/rxein</foreign>, i.e.
                            <gloss>not being an honest man, he did not have to
                            abstain from lawlessness in office</gloss>, etc., which we can
                        understand without absurdity. The passage, like so many sentences of this
                        class, is simply an argument to prove that E. was not honest. <emph>If he had been honest</emph> (it is said), <emph>he would have had to do certain things</emph> (which, it
                        is implied, all honest men do); <emph>but he did not do
                        these</emph> (as is stated, <foreign lang="greek">ei)s th\n

                        pollw=n</foreign>); <emph>therefore he was not honest.</emph>
                        There is a slight slip in showing (in the words last quoted) that he <emph>did not do</emph> the things in question, and not that
                            <emph>he did not have to do</emph> them; so that of the
                        two constructions, <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n</foreign> in 32
                        and <foreign lang="greek">e)xrh=n a)/n</foreign> in 48, the
                        former is more strictly logical. This use of <foreign lang="greek">e)xrh=n a)/n</foreign> is the counterpart of that of
                            <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n, e)/dei, e)nh=n</foreign>, and
                            <foreign lang="greek">qaumasto\n h)=n</foreign> in the
                        passages quoted above <ref target="s1">(1)</ref>, where the forms with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> might have been used.</p>
                    <p>The Latin follows precisely the same principle as the Greek in
                        the use of such imperfects as <foreign lang="la">debebat,
                            licebat</foreign> (= <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n,
                        e)ch=n</foreign>), and <foreign lang="la">deberet,

                            a)/n</foreign>), with reference to present time. But when such expressions
                        are past, the Latin uses <foreign lang="la">debuit</foreign> or <foreign lang="la">debuerat</foreign>
                        in the sense of <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n</foreign>, and
                            <foreign lang="la">debuisset</foreign> for <foreign
                            lang="greek">xrh=n a)/n</foreign>, both with the present
                        infinitive; while the Greek keeps the imperfect in all cases. See <cit>

                        <p>2. Expressions like <foreign lang="greek">ou)k
                                e)/xei o(/ ti ei)/ph|</foreign>, <gloss>he has nothing
                                to say</gloss>, give rise by analogy to <foreign lang="greek">e)/xei o(/ ti ei)/ph|</foreign>, <gloss>he has something to say</gloss>, though in the
                            latter there is really no indirect question. See examples in <ref
                                target="s572">&sect; 572, 1.</ref></p>
                        <p>3. A further extension of the deliberative usage leads to the
                            subjunctive and optative in clauses introduced by true relatives with
                            distinct antecedents, when these depend on expressions implying doubt,
                            perplexity, or ignorance. See examples in <ref
                                target="s572">&sect; 572, 2</ref>. Thus, in <foreign
                                lang="greek">ou) ga\r a)/llon oi)=d' o(/tw|
                            le/gw</foreign>, we cannot distinguish the modal force of the subjunctive
                            from that in <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r oi)=d' o(/tw|
                                a)/llw| le/gw</foreign>, the subjunctive being deliberative in both.
                            The former is the result of a simple evolution, by which a relative
                            clause derives its modal force from an interrogative form. Whatever
                            final force is felt in the expression comes from the intimate relation
                            between the deliberative and the hortatory subjunctive (see <ref
                                target="s291">&sect; 291</ref>). See A.
                            Sidgwick in the Classical Review for 1891, p. 148. We have the evolution
                            actually going on in <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1.7.7">XEN. An. i. 7, 7</bibl>, where <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)k e)/xw o(/ ti dw=</foreign> is interrogative
                            and <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ou)k e)/xw i(kanou\s oi(=s
                                dw=</foreign> is purely relative, while the modal force of <foreign
                                lang="greek">dw=</foreign> must be the same in both.

                            simply explained as correlatives of the deliberative subjunctive, a very
                            different problem is presented by the examples in <ref

                            </cit> clearly expresses purpose, and we cannot think of substituting

                            and <foreign lang="greek">o(/stis fqe/gcetai</foreign>, the
                            true Attic expression, is found in the next verse: the latter decides
                            the force of <foreign lang="greek">o(/stis la/koi</foreign>.
                            It would seem that the optative, which is further removed than the
                            subjunctive from the original deliberative construction, took another
                            step in the process of <quote>extension,</quote> and gave us a few such
