<div1 type="Book" n="1"><p>
<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The thought once occurred to us how many<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Preface: the instability of government</note> republics have been overthrown by people who preferred to live under any form of government other than a republican, and again, how many monarchies and how many oligarchies in times past have been abolished by the people. We reflected, moreover, how many of those individuals who have aspired to absolute power have either been deposed once for all and that right quickly; or if they have continued in power, no matter for how short a time, they are objects of wonder as having proved to be wise and happy men. Then, too, we had observed, we thought, that even in private homes some people who had rather more than the usual number of servants and some also who had only a very few were nevertheless, though nominally masters, quite unable to assert their authority over even those few.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And in addition to this, we reflected that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Animals more tractable than men</note> cowherds are the rulers of their cattle, that grooms are the rulers of their horses, and that all who are called herdsmen might properly be regarded as the rulers of the animals over which they are placed in charge. Now we noticed, as we thought, that all these herds obeyed their keepers more readily than men obey their rulers. For the herds go wherever their keeper directs them and graze in those places to which he leads them and keep out of those from which he excludes them. They allow their keeper, moreover, to enjoy, just as he will, the profits that accrue from them. And then again, we have never known of a herd conspiring against its keeper, either to refuse obedience to him or to deny him the privilege of enjoying the profits that accrue. At the same time, herds are more intractable to strangers than to their rulers and those who derive profit from them. Men, however, conspire against none sooner than against those whom they see attempting to rule over them.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, as we meditated on this analogy, we were inclined to conclude that for man, as he is constituted, it is easier to rule over any and all other creatures than to rule over men. But when we reflected that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> a king of men</note> there was one <persName>Cyrus</persName>, the Persian, who reduced to obedience a vast number of men and cities and nations, we were then compelled to change our opinion and decide that to rule men might be a task neither impossible nor even difficult, if one should only go about it in an intelligent manner. At all events, we know that people obeyed <persName>Cyrus</persName> willingly, although some of them were distant from him a journey of many days, and others of many months; others, although they had never seen him, and still others who knew well that they never should see him. Nevertheless they were all willing to be his subjects.
    <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But all this is not so surprising after all, so very different was he from all other kings, both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers and those who have gained their crowns by their own efforts; the Scythian king, for instance, would never be able to extend his rule over any other nation besides his own, although the Scythians are very numerous, but he would be well content if he could maintain himself in power over his own people; so the Thracian king with his Thracians, the Illyrian with his Illyrians, and so also all other nations, we are told. Those in <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, at any rate, are said to be free and independent of one another even to this day. But <persName>Cyrus</persName>, finding the nations in Asia also independent in exactly the same way, started out with a little band of Persians and became the leader of the Medes by their full consent and of the Hyrcanians<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The extent of his kingdom</note> by theirs; he then conquered <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, Assyria, <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, both Phrygias, <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013255">Babylonia</placeName>; he ruled also over <placeName key="tgn,7016612">Bactria</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>; and he was likewise king of the Sacians, Paphlagonians, Magadidae, and very many other nations, of which one could not even tell the names; he brought under his sway the Asiatic Greeks also; and, descending to the sea, he added both <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> to his empire.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He ruled over these nations, even though they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The secret of his power</note> did not speak the same language as he, nor one nation the same as another; for all that, he was able to cover so vast a region with the fear which he inspired, that he struck all men with terror and no one tried to withstand him; and he was able to awaken in all so lively a desire to please him, that they always wished to be guided by his will. Moreover, the tribes that he brought into subjection to himself were so many that it is a difficult matter even to travel to them all, in whatever direction one begin one's journey from the palace, whether toward the east or the west, toward the north or the south.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Believing this man to be deserving of all admiration, we have therefore investigated who he was in his origin, what natural endowments he possessed, and what sort of education he had enjoyed, that he so greatly excelled in governing men. Accordingly, what we have found out or think we know concerning him we shall now endeavour to present.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The father of <persName>Cyrus</persName> is said to have been<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His parentage</note> Cambyses, king of the Persians: this Cambyses belonged to the stock of the Persidae, and the Persidae derive their name from Perseus. His mother, it is generally agreed, was Mandane; and this Mandane was the daughter of Astyages, sometime king of the Medes. And even to this day the barbarians tell in story and in song that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was most handsome in person, most generous of heart, most devoted to learning, and most ambitious, so that he endured all sorts of labour and faced all sorts of danger for the sake of praise.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such then were the natural endowments, physical and spiritual, that he is reputed to have had; but he was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians; and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states. For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will, and the older people themselves to live as they please; and then they command them not to steal and not to rob, not to break into anybody's house, not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike, not to commit adultery, not to disobey an officer, and so forth; and if a man transgress anyone one of these laws, they punish him.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Persian<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persian system of education</note> laws, however, begin at the beginning and take care that from the first their citizens shall not be of such a character as ever to desire anything improper or immoral; and the measures they take are as follows.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They have their so-called &ldquo;Free Square,&rdquo; where the royal palace and other government buildings are located. The hucksters with their wares, their cries, and their vulgarities are excluded from this and relegated to another part of the city, in order that their tumult may not intrude upon the orderly life of the cultured.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This square, enclosing the government buildings, is divided into four parts; one of these belongs to the boys, one to the youths, another to the men of mature years, and another to those who are past the age for military service. And the laws require them to come daily to their several quarters&mdash;the boys and the full-grown men at daybreak; but the elders may come at whatever time it suits each one's convenience, except that they must present themselves on certain specified days. But the youths pass the night also in light armour about the government buildings&mdash;all except those who are married; no inquiry is made for such, unless they be especially ordered in advance to be there, but it is not proper for them to be absent too often.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Over each of these divisions there are twelve<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Its organization</note> officers, for the Persians are divided into twelve tribes. To have charge of the boys, such are chosen from the ranks of the elders as seem likely to make out of the boys the best men; to have charge of the youths, such are chosen from the ranks of the mature men as seem most likely on their part to develop the youths best; to preside over the mature men, those are selected who seem most likely to fit them best to execute the orders and requirements of the highest authorities<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">I.e., a Council of Elders, under the presidency of the king.</note>; and of the elders also chiefs are selected who act as overseers to see that those of this class also do their duty. And what duties are assigned to each age to perform we shall now set forth, that it may be better understood what pains the Persians take that their citizens may prove to be the very best.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The boys go to school and spend their time in<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Its method and curriculum: A. Boys</note> learning justice; and they say that they go there for this purpose, just as in our country they say that they go to learn to read and write. And their officers spend the greater part of the day in deciding cases for them. For, as a matter of course, boys also prefer charges against one another, just as men do, of theft, robbery, assault, cheating, slander, and other things that naturally come up; and when they discover any one committing any of these crimes, they punish him,
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>and they punish also any one whom they find accusing another falsely. And they bring one another to trial also charged with an offence for which people hate one another most but go to law least, namely, that of ingratitude; and if they know that any one is able to return a favour and fails to do so, they punish him also severely. For they think that the ungrateful are likely to be most neglectful of their duty toward their gods, their parents, their country, and their friends; for it seems that shamelessness goes hand in hand with ingratitude; and it is that, we know, which leads the way to every moral wrong.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They teach the boys self-control also; and it greatly conduces to their learning self-control that they see their elders also living temperately day by day. And they teach them likewise to obey the officers; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see their elders implicitly obeying their officers. And besides, they teach them self-restraint in eating and drinking; and it greatly conduces to this also that they see that their elders do not leave their post to satisfy their hunger until the officers dismiss them; and the same end is promoted by the fact that the boys do not eat with their mothers but with their teachers, from the time the officers so direct. Furthermore, they bring from home bread for their food, cress for a relish, and for drinking, if any one is thirsty, a cup to draw water from the river. Besides this, they learn to shoot and to throw the spear.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This, then, is what the boys do until they are sixteen or seventeen years of age, and after this they are promoted from the class of boys and enrolled among the young men.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the young men in their turn live as follows:<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">B. Youths</note> for ten years after they are promoted from the class of boys they pass the nights, as we said before, about the government buildings. This they do for the sake of guarding the city and of developing their powers of self-control; for this time of life, it seems, demands the most watchful care. And during the day, too, they put themselves at the disposal of the authorities, if they are needed for any service to the state. Whenever it is necessary, they all remain about the public buildings. But when the king goes out hunting, he takes out half the garrison; and this he does many times a month. Those who go must take bow and arrows and, in addition to the quiver, a sabre or bill<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The oriental bill was a tool or weapon with a curved blade, shorter than a sabre and corresponding very closely to the Spanish-American machete.</note> in its scabbard; they carry along also a light shield and two spears, on to throw, the other to use in case of necessity in a hand-to-hand encounter.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>They provide for such hunting out of the public treasury; and as the king is their leader in war, so he not only takes part in the hunt himself but sees to it that the others hunt, too. The state bears the expense of the hunting for the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The chase a school for war</note> reason that the training it gives seems to be the best preparation for war itself. For it accustoms them to rise early in the morning and to endure both heat and cold, and it gives them practice in taking long tramps and runs, and they have to shoot or spear a wild beast whenever it comes in their way. And they must often whet their courage when one of the fierce beasts shows fight; for, of course, they must strike down the animal that comes to close quarters with them, and they must be on their guard against the one that threatens to attack them. In a word, it is not easy to find any quality required in war that is not required also in the chase.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they go out hunting they carry along a lunch,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Greeks ate but two meals a day: the first, <foreign lang="greek">a)/riston</foreign>, toward midday, the other, <foreign lang="greek">dei=pnon</foreign>, toward sun-down.</note> more in quantity than that of the boys, as is proper, but in other respects the same; but they would never think of lunching while they are busy with the chase. If, however, for some reason it is necessary to stay longer on account of the game or if for some other reason they wish to continue longer on the chase, then they make their dinner of this luncheon and hunt again on the following day until dinner time; and these two days they count as one, because they consume but one day's provisions. This they do to harden themselves, in order that, if ever it is necessary in war, they may be able to do the same. Those of this age have for relish the game that they kill; if they fail to kill any, then cresses. Now, if any one thinks that they do not enjoy eating, when they have only cresses with their bread, or that they do not enjoy drinking when they drink only water, let him remember how sweet barley bread and wheaten bread taste when one is hungry, and how sweet water is to drink when one is thirsty.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The divisions remaining at home, in their turn, pass their time shooting with the bow and hurling the spear and practising all the other arts that they learned when they were boys, and they continually engage in contests of this kind with one another. And there are also public contests of this sort, for which prizes are offered; and whatever division has the greatest number of the most expert, the most manly, and the best disciplined young men, the citizens praise and honour not only its present chief officer but also the one who trained them when they were boys. And of the youths who remain behind, the authorities employ any that they may need, whether for garrison duty or for arresting criminals or for hunting down robbers, or for any other service that demands strength or dispatch.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such, then, is the occupation of the youths. And when they have completed their ten years, they are promoted and enrolled in the class of the mature men.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And these, in turn, for twenty-five years<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">C. Mature men</note> after the time they are there enrolled, are occupied as follows. In the first place, like the youths, they are at the disposal of the authorities, if they are needed in the interest of the commonwealth in any service that requires men who have already attained discretion and are still strong in body. But if it is necessary to make a military expedition anywhere, those who have been thus educated take the field, no longer with bow and arrows, nor yet with spears, but with what are termed &ldquo;weapons for close conflict&rdquo;&mdash;a corselet about their breast, a round shield upon their left arm (such as Persians are represented with in art), and in their right hands a sabre or bill. From this division also all the magistrates are selected, except the teachers of the boys.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they have completed the five-and-twenty years, they are, as one would expect, somewhat more than fifty years of age; and then they come out and take their places among those who really are, as they are called, the &ldquo;elders.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now these elders, in their turn, no longer perform<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">D. Elders</note> form military service outside their own country, but they remain at home and try all sorts of cases, both public and private. They try people indicted for capital offences also, and they elect all the officers. And if any one, either among the youths or among the mature men, fail in any one of the duties prescribed by law, the respective officers of that division, or any one else who will, may enter complaint, and the elders, when they have heard the case, expel the guilty party; and the one who has been expelled spends the rest of his life degraded and disfranchised.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, that the whole constitutional policy<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The constitutional policy of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></note> of the Persians may be more clearly set forth, I will go back a little; for now, in the light of what has already been said, it can be given in a very few words. It is said that the Persians number about one hundred and twenty thousand men<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">This number is meant to include the nobility only, the so-called &ldquo;peers&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">o(mo/timoi</foreign>, and not the total population of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.</note>; and no one of these is by law excluded from holding offices and positions of honour, but all the Persians may send their children to the common schools of justice. Still, only those do send them who are in a position to maintain their children without work; and those who are not so situated do not. And only to such as are educated by the public<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Each class a prerequisite to the one above it</note> teachers is it permitted to pass their young manhood in the class of the youths, while to those who have not completed this course of training it is not so permitted. And only to such among the youths as complete the course required by law is it permitted to join the class of mature men and to fill offices and places of distinction, while those who do not finish their course among the young men are not promoted to the class of the mature men. And again, those who finish their course among the mature men without blame become members of the class of elders. So, we see, the elders are made up to those who have enjoyed all honour and distinction. This is the policy by the observance of which they think that their citizens may become the best.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There remains even unto this day evidence of their moderate fare and of their working off by exercise what they eat: for even to the present time it is a breach of decorum for a Persian to spit or to blow his nose or to appear afflicted with flatulence; it is a breach of decorum also to be seen going apart either to make water or for anything else of that kind. And this would not be possible for them, if they did not lead an abstemious life and throw off the moisture by hard work, so that it passes off in some other way.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This, then, is what we have to say in regard to the Persians in general. Now, to fulfil the purpose with which our narrative was begun, we shall proceed to relate the history of <persName>Cyrus</persName> from his childhood on.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the education that <persName>Cyrus</persName> received until he was twelve years old or a little more; and he showed himself superior to all the other boys of his age both in mastering his tasks quickly and in doing everything in a thorough and manly fashion. It was at this period of his life that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> goes to visit his grandfather</note> Astyages sent for his daughter and her son; for he was eager to see him, as he had heard from time to time that the child was a handsome boy of rare promise. Accordingly, Mandane herself went to her father and took her son <persName>Cyrus</persName> with her.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As soon as she arrived and <persName>Cyrus</persName> had recognized in Astyages his mother's father, being naturally an affectionate boy he at once kissed him, just as a person who had long lived with another and long loved him would do. Then he noticed that his grandfather was adorned with pencillings beneath his eyes, with rouge rubbed on his face, and with a wig of false hair&mdash;the common Median fashion. For all this is Median, and so are their purple tunics, and their mantles, the necklaces about their necks, and the bracelets on their wrists, while the Persians at home even to this day have much plainer clothing and a more frugal way of life. So, observing his grandfather's adornment and staring at him, he said: &ldquo;Oh mother, how handsome my grandfather is!&rdquo; And when his mother asked him which he thought more handsome, his father or his grandfather, <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered at once: &ldquo;Of the Persians, mother, my father is much the handsomest; but of the Medes, as far as I have seen them either on the streets or at court, my grandfather here is the handsomest by far.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then his grandfather kissed him in return and gave him a beautiful dress to wear and, as a mark of royal favour, adorned him with necklaces and bracelets; and if he went out for a ride anywhere, he took the boy along upon a horse with a gold-studded bridle, just as he himself was accustomed to go. And as <persName>Cyrus</persName> was a boy fond of beautiful things and eager for distinction, he was pleased with his dress and greatly delighted at learning to ride; for in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, on account of its being difficult to breed horses and to practise horsemanship because it is a mountainous country, it was a very rare thing even to see a horse.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And then again, when Astyages dined with<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A Median dinner</note> his daughter and <persName>Cyrus</persName>, he set before him dainty side-dishes and all sorts of sauces and meats, for he wished the boy to enjoy his dinner as much as possible, in order that he might be less likely to feel homesick. And <persName>Cyrus</persName>, they say, observed: &ldquo;How much trouble you have at your dinner, grandfather, if you have to reach out your hands to all these dishes and taste of all these different kinds of food!&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said Astyages. &ldquo;Really now, don't you think this dinner much finer than your Persian dinners?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, grandfather,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> replied to this; &ldquo;but the road to satiety is much more simple and direct in our country than with you; for bread and meat take us there; but you, though you make for the same goal as we, go wandering through many a maze, up and down, and only arrive at last at the point that we long since have reached.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, my boy,&rdquo; said Astyages, &ldquo;we do not object to this wandering about; and you also,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you taste, will see that it is pleasant.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, grandfather,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I observe that even you are disgusted with these viands.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And by what, pray, do you judge, my boy,&rdquo; asked Astyages, &ldquo;that you say this?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I observe that when you touch bread, you do not wipe your hand on anything; but when you touch any of these other things you at once cleanse your hand upon your napkin, as if you were exceedingly displeased that it had become soiled with them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, my boy,&rdquo; Astyages replied to this, &ldquo;if that is your judgment, at least regale yourself with meat, that you may go back home a strong young man.&rdquo; And as he said this, he placed before him an abundance of meat of both wild and domestic animals.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw that there was a great quantity of meat, he said: &ldquo;And do you really mean to give me all this meat, grandfather, to dispose of as I please?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon <persName>Cyrus</persName> took some of the meat and proceeded to distribute it among his grandfather's servants, saying to them in turn: &ldquo;I give this to you, because you take so much pains to teach me to ride; to you, because you gave me a spear, for at present this is all I have to give; to you, because you serve my grandfather so well; and to you, because you are respectful to my mother.&rdquo; He kept on thus, while he was distributing all the meat that he had received.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Astyages, &ldquo;are you not going to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> and the cupbearer</note> give any to Sacas, my cupbearer, whom I like best of all?&rdquo; Now Sacas, it seems, chanced to be a handsome fellow who had the office of introducing to Astyages those who had business with him and of keeping out those whom he thought it not expedient to admit.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked pertly, as a boy might do who was not yet at all shy, &ldquo;Pray, grandfather, why do you like this fellow so much?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And Astyages replied with a jest: &ldquo;Do you not see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how nicely and gracefully he pours the wine?&rdquo; Now the cupbearers of those kings perform their office with fine airs; they pour in the wine with neatness and then present the goblet, conveying it with three fingers, and offer it in such a way as to place it most conveniently in the grasp of the one who is to drink.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, grandfather,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;bid Sacas give me the cup, that I also may deftly pour for you to drink and thus win your favour, if I can.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And he bade him give it. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> took the cup and rinsed it out well, exactly as he had often seen Sacas do, and then he brought and presented the goblet to his grandfather, assuming an expression somehow so grave and important, that he made his mother and Astyages laugh heartily. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself also with a laugh sprang up into his grandfather's lap and kissing him said: &ldquo;Ah, Sacas, you are done for; I shall turn you out of your office; for in other ways,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall play the cupbearer better than you and besides I shall not drink up the wine myself.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, it is a well known fact that the king's cupbearers, when they proffer the cup, draw off some of it with the ladle, pour it into their left hand, and swallow it down&mdash;so that, if they should put poison in, they may not profit by it.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon Astyages said in jest: &ldquo;And why,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s temperance lecture</note> pray, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, did you imitate Sacas in everything else but did not sip any of the wine?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was afraid that poison had been mixed in the bowl. And I had reason to be afraid; for when you entertained your friends on your birthday, I discovered beyond a doubt that he had poured poison into your company's drink.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And how, pray,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did you discover that, my son?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I saw that you were unsteady both in mind and in body. For in the first place you yourselves kept doing what you never allow us boys to do; for instance, you kept shouting, all at the same time, and none of you heard anything that the others were saying; and you fell to singing, and in a most ridiculous manner at that, and though you did not hear the singer, you swore that he sang most excellently; and though each one of you kept telling stories of his own strength, yet if you stood up to dance, to say nothing of dancing in time, why, you could not even stand up straight. And all of you quite forgot&mdash;you, that you were king; and the rest, that you were their sovereign. It was then that I also for my part discovered, and for the first time, that what you were practising was your boasted &lsquo;equal freedom of speech&rsquo;; at any rate, never were any of you silent.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, my boy,&rdquo; Astyages said, &ldquo;does not your father get drunk, when he drinks?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, how does he manage it?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;He just quenches his thirst and thus suffers no further harm; for he has, I trow, grandfather, no Sacas to pour wine for him.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But why in the world, my son,&rdquo; said his mother,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His antipathy toward Sacas</note> &ldquo;are you so set against Sacas?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because, by Zeus,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> replied, &ldquo;I don't like him; for oftentimes, when I am eager to run in to see my grandfather, this miserable scoundrel keeps me out. But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I beg of you, grandfather, allow me for just three days to rule over him.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And how would you rule over him?&rdquo; said Astyages.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I would stand at the door,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> replied, &ldquo;just as he does, and then when he wished to come in to luncheon, I would say, &lsquo;You cannot interview the luncheon yet; for it is engaged with certain persons.&rdquo;And then when he came to dinner, I would say, &lsquo;It is at the bath.&rsquo; And if he were very eager to eat, I would say, &lsquo;It is with the ladies.&rsquo; And I would keep that up until I tormented him, just as he torments me by keeping me away from you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such amusement he furnished them at dinner; and during the day, if he saw that his grandfather or his uncle needed anything, it was difficult for any one else to get ahead of him in supplying the need; for <persName>Cyrus</persName> was most happy to do them any service that he could.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when Mandane was making preparations<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Mandane leaves <persName>Cyrus</persName> in Media</note> to go back to her husband, Astyages asked her to leave <persName>Cyrus</persName> behind. And she answered that she desired to do her father's pleasure in everything, but she thought it hard to leave the boy behind against his will.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Astyages said to <persName>Cyrus</persName>:
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>&ldquo;My boy, if you will stay with me, in the first place Sacas shall not control your admission to me, but it shall be in your power to come in to see me whenever you please, and I shall be the more obliged to you the oftener you come to me. And in the second place you shall use my horses and everything else you will; and when you go back home, you shall take with you any of them that you desire. And besides, at dinner you shall go whatever way you please to what seems to you to be temperance. And then, I present to you the animals that are now in the park and I will collect others of every description, and as soon as you learn to ride, you shall hunt and slay them with bow and spear, just as grown-up men do. I will also find some children to be your playfellows; and if you wish anything else, just mention it to me, and you shall not fail to receive it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Astyages had said this, his mother asked<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Why he wished to stay</note> <persName>Cyrus</persName> whether he wished to stay or go. And he did not hesitate but said at once that he wished to stay. And when he was asked again by his mother why he wished to stay, he is said to have answered: &ldquo;Because at home, mother, I am and have the reputation of being the best of those of my years both in throwing the spear and in shooting with the bow; but here I know that I am inferior to my fellows in horsemanship. And let me tell you, mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this vexes me exceedingly. But if you leave me here and I learn to ride, I think you will find, when I come back to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, that I shall easily surpass the boys over there who are good at exercises on foot, and when I come again to Media, I shall try to be a help to my grandfather by being the best of good horsemen.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And his mother said,
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>&ldquo;My boy, how will you learn justice here, while your teachers are over there?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered, &ldquo;that is one thing that I understand thoroughly.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; said Mandane.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my teacher appointed me,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His training in justice</note> on the ground that I was already thoroughly versed in justice, to decide cases for others also. And so, in one case,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I once got a flogging for not deciding correctly.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>The case was like this: a big boy with a little tunic, finding a little boy with a big tunic on, took it off him and put his own tunic on him, while he himself put on the other's. So, when I tried their case, I decided that it was better for them both that each should keep the tunic that fitted him. And thereupon the master flogged me, saying that when I was a judge of a good fit, I should do as I had done; but when it was my duty to decide whose tunic it was, I had this question, he said, to consider&mdash;whose title was the rightful one; whether it was right that he who took it away by force should keep it, or that he who had had it made for himself or had bought it should own it. And since, he said, what is lawful is right and what is unlawful is wrong, he bade the judge always render his verdict on the side of the law. It is in this way, mother, you see, that I already have a thorough understanding of justice in all its bearings; and,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if I do require anything more, my grandfather here will teach me that.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;but at your grandfather's<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Median <title>vs.</title> Persian ideals of justice</note> court they do not recognize the same principles of justice as they do in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. For he has made himself master of everything in Media, but in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> equality of rights is considered justice. And your father is the first one to do what is ordered by the State and to accept what is decreed, and his standard is not his will but the law. Mind, therefore, that you be not flogged within an inch of your life, when you come home, if you return with a knowledge acquired from your grandfather here of the principles not of kingship but of tyranny, one principle of which is that it is right for one to have more than all.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But your father, at least,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;is more shrewd at teaching people to have less than to have more, mother. Why, do you not see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that he has taught all the Medes to have less than himself? So never fear that your father, at any rate, will turn either me or anybody else out trained under him to have too much.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this way <persName>Cyrus</persName> often chattered on. At<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s popularity among the Medes</note> last, however, his mother went away, but <persName>Cyrus</persName> remained behind and grew up in Media. Soon he had become so intimately associated with other boys of his own years that he was on easy terms with them. And soon he had won their father's hearts by visiting them and showing that he loved their sons; so that, if they desired any favour of the king, they bade their sons ask <persName>Cyrus</persName> to secure it for them. And <persName>Cyrus</persName>, because of his kindness of heart and his desire for popularity, made every effort to secure for the boys whatever they asked.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And Astyages could not refuse any favour that <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked of him. And this was natural; for, when his grandfather fell sick, <persName>Cyrus</persName> never left him nor ceased to weep but plainly showed to all that he greatly feared that his grandfather might die. For even at night, if Astyages wanted anything, <persName>Cyrus</persName> was the first to discover it and with greater alacrity than any one else he would jump up to perform whatever service he thought would give him pleasure, so that he won Astyages's heart completely.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He was, perhaps, too talkative, partly on account<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His talkativeness</note> of his education, because he had always been required by his teacher to render an account of what he was doing and to obtain an account from others whenever he was judge; and partly also because of his natural curiosity, he was habitually putting many questions to those about him why things were thus and so; and because of his alertness of mind he readily answered questions that others put to him; so that from all these causes his talkativeness grew upon him. But it was not unpleasant; for just as in the body, in the case of those who have attained their growth although they are still young, there yet appears that freshness which betrays their lack of years, so also in <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s case his talkativeness disclosed not impertinence but nai+vete/ and an affectionate disposition, so that one would be better pleased to hear still more from his lips than to sit by and have him keep silent.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But as he advanced in stature and in years to the time of attaining youth's estate, he then came to use fewer words, his voice was more subdued, and he became so bashful that he actually blushed whenever he met his elders; and that puppy-like manner of breaking in upon anybody and everybody alike he no longer exhibited with so much forwardness. So he became more quiet, to be sure, but in social intercourse altogether charming. The boys liked him,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His spirit of comradeship</note> too; for in all the contests in which those of the same age are wont often to engage with one another he did not challenge his mates to those in which he knew he was superior, but he proposed precisely those exercises in which he knew he was not their equal, saying that he would do better than they; and he would at once take the lead, jumping up upon the horses to contend on horseback either in archery or in throwing the spear, although he was not yet a good rider, and when he was beaten he laughed at himself most heartily.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as he did not shirk being beaten and take refuge in refusing to do that in which he was beaten, but persevered in attempting to do better next time, he speedily became the equal of his fellows in horsemanship and soon on account of his love for the sport he surpassed them; and before long he had exhausted the supply of animals in the park by hunting and shooting and killing them, so that Astyages was no longer able to collect animals for him. And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw that notwithstanding his desire to do so, the king was unable to provide him with many animals alive, he said to him: &ldquo;Why should you take the trouble, grandfather, to get animals for me? If you will only send me out with my uncle to hunt, I shall consider that all the animals I see were bred for me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But though he was exceedingly eager to go out hunting, he could no longer coax for it as he used to do when he was a boy, but he became more diffident in his approaches. And in the very matter for which he found fault with Sacas before, namely that he would not admit him to his grandfather&mdash;he himself now became a Sacas unto himself; for he would not go in unless he saw that it was a proper time, and he asked Sacas by all means to let him know when it was convenient. And so Sacas now came to love him dearly, as did all the rest.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>However, when Astyages realized that he was<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He goes hunting</note> exceedingly eager to hunt out in the wilds, he let him go out with his uncle and he sent along some older men on horseback to look after him, to keep him away from dangerous places and guard him against wild beasts, in case any should appear. <persName>Cyrus</persName>, therefore, eagerly inquired of those who attended him what animals one ought not to approach and what animals one might pursue without fear. And they told him that bears and boars and lions and leopards had killed many who came close to them, but that deer and gazelles and wild sheep and wild asses were harmless. And they said this also, that one must be on one's guard against dangerous places no less than against wild beasts; for many riders had been thrown over precipices, horses and all.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All these lessons <persName>Cyrus</persName> eagerly learned. But when he saw a deer spring out from under cover, he forgot everything that he had heard and gave chase, seeing nothing but the direction in which it was making. And somehow his horse in taking a leap fell upon its knees and almost threw him over its head. However, <persName>Cyrus</persName> managed, with some difficulty, to keep his seat, and his horse got up. And when he came to level ground, he threw his spear and brought down the deer&mdash;a fine, large quarry. And he, of course, was greatly delighted; but the guards rode up and scolded him and told him into what danger he had gone and declared that they would tell of him. Now <persName>Cyrus</persName> stood there, for he had dismounted, and was vexed at being spoken to in this way. But when he heard a halloo, he sprang upon his horse like one possessed and when he saw a boar rushing straight toward him, he rode to meet him and aiming well he struck the boar between the eyes and brought him down.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This time, however, his uncle also reproved him, for he had witnessed his foolhardiness. But for all his scolding, <persName>Cyrus</persName> nevertheless asked his permission to carry home and present to his grandfather all the game that he had taken himself. And his uncle, they say, replied: &ldquo;But if he finds out that you have been giving chase, he will chide not only you but me also for allowing you to do so.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And if he choose,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;let him flog me, provided only I may give him the game. And you, uncle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may punish me in any way you please&mdash;only grant me this favour.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And finally Cyaxares said, though with reluctance: &ldquo;Do as you wish; for now it looks as if it were you who are our king.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So <persName>Cyrus</persName> carried the animals in and gave them to his grandfather, saying that he had himself taken this game for him. As for the hunting spears, though he did not show them to him, he laid them down all blood-stained where he thought his grandfather would see them. And then Astyages said: &ldquo;Well, my boy, I am glad to accept what you offer me; however, I do not need any of these things enough for you to risk your life for them.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, grandfather,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;if you do<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He distributes the game among his age-fellows</note> not need them, please give them to me, that I may divide them among my boy friends.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;All right, my boy,&rdquo; said Astyages, &ldquo;take both this and of the rest of the game as much as you wish and give it to whom you will.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So <persName>Cyrus</persName> received it and took it away and proceeded to distribute it among the boys, saying as he did so: &ldquo;What tomfoolery it was, fellows, when we used to hunt the animals in the park. To me at least, it seems just like hunting animals that were tied up. For, in the first place, they were in a small space; besides, they were lean and mangy; and one of them was lame and another maimed. But the animals out on the mountains and the plains&mdash;how fine they looked, and large and sleek! And the deer leaped up skyward as if on wings, and the boars came charging at once, as they say brave men do in battle. And by reason of their bulk it was quite impossible to miss them. And to me at least,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;these seem really more beautiful, when dead, than those pent up creatures, when alive. But say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would not your fathers let you go out hunting, too?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, and readily,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;if Astyages should give the word.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Whom, then, could we find to speak about it<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The boys lay schemes to go hunting</note> to Astyages?&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;who would be better able to to gain his consent than you yourself?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not I; I do not know what sort of fellow I have become; for I cannot speak to my grandfather or even look up at him any more, as I used to do. And if I keep on at this rate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I fear I shall become a mere dolt and ninny. But when I was a little fellow, I was thought ready enough to chatter.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That's bad news you're giving us,&rdquo; answered the boys, &ldquo;if you are not going to be able to act for us in case of need, and we shall have to ask somebody else to do your part.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> was nettled at hearing this and went away without a word; and when he had summoned up his courage to make the venture, he went in, after he had laid his plans how he might with the least annoyance broach the subject to his grandfather and accomplish for himself and the other boys what they desired. Accordingly, he began as follows: &ldquo;Tell me, grandfather,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if one of your servants runs away and you catch him again, what will you do to him?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What else,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but put him in chains and make him work?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But if he comes back again of his own accord, what will you do?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but flog him to prevent his doing it again, and then treat him as before?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;It may be high time, then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;for you to be making ready to flog me; for I am planning to run away from you and take my comrades out hunting.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You have done well to tell me in advance,&rdquo; said Astyages; &ldquo;for now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I forbid you to stir from the palace. For it would be a nice thing, if, for the sake of a few morsels of meat, I should play the careless herdsman and lose my daughter her son.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard this, he obeyed and stayed<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">They have a great hunt</note> at home; he said nothing, but continued downcast and sulky. However, when Astyages saw that he was exceedingly disappointed, wishing to give him pleasure, he took him out to hunt; he had got the boys together, and a large number of men both on foot and on horseback, and when he had driven the wild animals out into country where riding was practicable, he instituted a great hunt. And as he was present himself, he gave the royal command that no one should throw a spear before <persName>Cyrus</persName> had his fill of hunting. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> would not permit him to interfere, but said: &ldquo;If you wish me to enjoy the hunt, grandfather, let all my comrades give chase and strive to outdo one another, and each do his very best.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon, Astyages gave his consent and from his position he watched them rushing in rivalry upon the beasts and vying eagerly with one another in giving chase and in throwing the spear. And he was pleased to see that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was unable to keep silence for delight, but, like a well-bred hound, gave tongue whenever he came near an animal and urged on each of his companions by name. And the king was delighted to see him laugh at one and praise another without the least bit of jealousy. At length, then, Astyages went home with a large amount of game; and he was so pleased with that chase, that thenceforth he always went out with <persName>Cyrus</persName> when it was possible, and he took along with him not only many others but, for <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s sake, the boys as well.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> passed most of his time, contriving some pleasure and good for all, but responsible for nothing unpleasant to any one.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when <persName>Cyrus</persName> was about fifteen or sixteen years old, the son of the Assyrian king, on the eve of his marriage, desired in person to get the game for that occasion. Now, hearing that on the frontiers of Assyria and Media there was plenty of game that because of the war had not been hunted, he desired to go out thither. Accordingly, that he might hunt without danger, he took along a large force of cavalry and targeteers, who were to drive the game out of the thickets for him into country that was open and suitable for riding. And when he arrived where their frontier-forts and the garrison were, there he dined, planning to hunt early on the following day.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And now when evening had come, the relief-corps<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Assyrian's foray into Media</note> for the former garrison came from the city, both horse and foot. He thought, therefore, that he had a large army at hand; for the two garrisons were there together and he himself had come with a large force of cavalry and infantry. Accordingly, he decided that it was best to make a foray into the Median territory and he thought that thus the exploit of the hunt would appear more brilliant and that the number of animals captured would be immense. And so, rising early, he led his army out; the infantry he left together at the frontier, while he himself, riding up with the horse to the outposts of the Medes, took his stand there with most of his bravest men about him, to prevent the Median guards from coming to the rescue against those who were scouring the country; and he sent out the proper men in divisions, some in one direction, some in another, to scour the country, with orders to capture whatever they came upon and bring it to him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So they were engaged in these operations.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>But when word was brought to Astyages that there were enemies in the country, he himself sallied forth to the frontier in person with his body-guard, and likewise his son with the knights that happened to be at hand marched out, while he gave directions to all the others also to come out to his assistance. But when they saw a large number of Assyrian troops drawn up and their cavalry standing still, the Medes also came to a halt.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw the rest marching out with<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> goes to the front</note> all speed, he put on his armour then for the first time and started out, too; this was an opportunity that he had thought would never come&mdash;so eager was he to don his arms; and the armour that his grandfather had had made to order for him was very beautiful and fitted him well. Thus equipped he rode up on his horse. And though Astyages wondered at whose order he had come, he nevertheless told the lad to come and stay by his side.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw many horsemen over against them, he asked: &ldquo;Say, grandfather,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are those men enemies who sit there quietly upon their horses?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, they are,&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Are those enemies, too,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;who are riding up and down?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, they are enemies, too.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, by Zeus, grandfather,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at any rate, they are a sorry looking lot on a sorry lot of nags who are raiding our belongings. Why, some of us ought to charge upon them.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But don't you see, my son,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;what a dense array of cavalry is standing there in line? If we charge upon those over there, these in turn will cut us off; while as for us, the main body of our forces has not yet come.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But if you stay here,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;and take up the reinforcements that are coming to join us, these fellows will be afraid and will not stir, while the raiders will drop their booty, just as soon as they see some of us charging on them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It seemed to Astyages that there was something<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His plan for the battle</note> in <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s suggestion, when he said this. And while he wondered that the boy was so shrewd and wide-awake, he ordered his son to take a division of the cavalry and charge upon those who were carrying off the spoil. &ldquo;And if,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;these others make a move against you, I will charge upon them, so that they will be forced to turn their attention to us.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So then Cyaxares took some of the most powerful horses and men and advanced. And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw them starting, he rushed off and soon took the lead, while Cyaxares followed after, and the rest also were not left behind. And when the foragers saw them approaching, they straightway let go their booty and took to flight.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>But <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his followers tried to cut them off, and those whom they caught they at once struck down, <persName>Cyrus</persName> taking the lead; and they pursued hard after those who succeeded in getting past, and they did not give up but took some of them prisoners.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As a well-bred but untrained hound rushes recklessly<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His reckless daring</note> upon a boar, so <persName>Cyrus</persName> rushed on, with regard for nothing but to strike down every one he overtook and reckless of anything else.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The enemy, however, when they saw their comrades hard pressed, advanced their column in the hope that the Medes would give up the pursuit on seeing them push forward.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>But none the more did <persName>Cyrus</persName> give over, but in his battle-joy he called to his uncle and continued the pursuit; and pressing on he put the enemy to headlong flight, and Cyaxares did not fail to follow, partly perhaps not to be shamed before his father; and the rest likewise followed, for under such circumstances they were more eager for the pursuit, even those who were not so very brave in the face of the enemy.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when Astyages saw them pursuing recklessly and the enemy advancing in good order to meet them, he was afraid that something might happen to his son and <persName>Cyrus</persName>, if they fell in disorder upon the enemy in readiness for battle, and straightway he advanced upon the foe.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the enemy on their part, when they saw the Medes advance, halted, some with spears poised, others with bows drawn, expecting that the other side would also halt, as soon as they came within bow-shot, just as they were accustomed generally to do; for it was their habit to advance only so far against each other, when they came into closest quarters, and to skirmish with missiles, oftentimes till evening. But when they saw their comrades rushing in flight toward them, and <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his followers bearing down close upon them, and Astyages with his cavalry getting already within bow-shot, they broke and fled with all their might from the Medes who followed hard after them.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Medes caught up with many of them; and those whom they overtook they smote, both men and horses; and the fallen they slew. Nor did they stop, until they came up with the Assyrian infantry. Then, however, fearing lest some greater force might be lying in ambush, they came to a halt.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Astyages marched back, greatly rejoicing<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The victory due to him</note> over the victory of his cavalry but not knowing what to say of <persName>Cyrus</persName>; for though he realized that his grandson was responsible for the outcome, yet he recognized also that he was frenzied with daring. And of this there was further evidence; for, as the rest made their way homeward, he did nothing but ride around alone and gloat upon the slain, and only with difficulty did those who were detailed to do so succeed in dragging him away and taking him to Astyages; and as he came, he set his escort well before him, for he saw that his grandfather's face was angry because of his gloating upon them.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was his life in Media; and <persName>Cyrus</persName> was not only on the tongues of all the rest both in story and in song, but Astyages also, while he had esteemed him before, was now highly delighted with him. And Cambyses, <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s father, was pleased to learn this. But when he heard that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was already performing a man's deeds, he summoned him home to complete the regular curriculum in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> also, we are told, said then that he wished to go home, in order that his father might not feel any displeasure nor the state be disposed to criticise; and Astyages, too, thought it expedient to send him home.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So he let him go and not only gave him the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His return to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></note> horses that he desired to take, but he packed up many other things for him because of his love for him and also because he cherished high hopes that his grandson would be a man able both to help his friends and to give trouble to his enemies. And everybody, both boys and men, young and old, and Astyages himself, escorted him on horseback as he went, and they say that there was no one who turned back without tears.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> also, it is said, departed very tearfully. And they say that he distributed as presents among his young friends many of the things that Astyages had given to him; and finally he took off the Median robe which he had on and gave it to one whom he loved very dearly. It is said, however, that those who received and accepted his presents carried them to Astyages, and Astyages received them and returned them to <persName>Cyrus</persName>; but <persName>Cyrus</persName> sent them back again to Media with this message: &ldquo;If you wish me ever to come back to you again, grandfather, without having to be ashamed, permit those to whom I have given anything to keep it.&rdquo; And when Astyages heard this, he did as <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s letter bade.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, if we may relate a sentimental story, we<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A sentimental story</note> are told that when <persName>Cyrus</persName> was going away and they were taking leave of one another, his kinsmen bade him good-bye, after the Persian custom, with a kiss upon his lips. And that custom has survived, for so the Persians do even to this day. Now a certain Median gentleman, very noble, had for some considerable time been struck with <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s beauty, and when he saw the boy's kinsmen kissing him, he hung back. But when the rest were gone, he came up to <persName>Cyrus</persName> and said: &ldquo;Am I the only one of your kinsmen, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, whom you do not recognize as such?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;do you mean to say that you, too, are a kinsman?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That is the reason, then, it seems,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;why you used to stare at me; for if I am not mistaken, I have often noticed you doing so.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for though I was always desirous of coming to you, by the gods I was too bashful.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, you ought not to have been&mdash;at any rate, if you were my kinsman,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; and at the same time he went up and kissed him.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he had been given the kiss, the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName> asked: &ldquo;Really, is it a custom in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> to kiss one's kinsfolk?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;at least, when they see one another after a time of separation, or when they part from one another.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;It may be time, then, for you to kiss me once again,&rdquo; said the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName>; &ldquo;for, as you see, I am parting from you now.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so <persName>Cyrus</persName> kissed him good-bye again and went on his way. But they had not yet gone far, when the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName> came back with his horse in a lather. And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw him he said: &ldquo;Why, how now? Did you forget something that you intended to say?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I have come back after a time of separation.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By Zeus, cousin,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;a pretty short time.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Short, is it?&rdquo; said the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName>; &ldquo;don't you know, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that even the time it takes me to wink seems an eternity to me, because during that time I do not see you, who are so handsome?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then <persName>Cyrus</persName> laughed through his tears and bade him go and be of good cheer, for in a little while he would come back to them, so that he might soon look at him&mdash;without winking, if he chose.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when <persName>Cyrus</persName> had returned, as before<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> resumes his education in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></note> narrated, he is said to have spent one more year in the class of boys in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. And at first the boys were inclined to make fun of him, saying that he had come back after having learned to live a life of luxurious ease among the Medes. But when they saw him eating and drinking with no less relish than they themselves, and, if there ever was feasting at any celebration, freely giving away a part of his own share rather than asking for more; and when, in addition to this, they saw him surpassing them in other things as well, then again his comrades began to have proper respect for him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he had passed through this discipline and had now entered the class of the youths, among these in turn he had the reputation of being the best both in attending to duty and in endurance, in respect toward his elders and in obedience to the officers.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the course of time Astyages died in Media, and Cyaxares, the son of Astyages and brother of <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s mother, succeeded to the Median throne.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At that time the king of Assyria had subjugated<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Assyria's plans for world conquest</note> all <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, a very large nation, and had made the king of <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName> his vassal; he already had <placeName key="tgn,7016639">Hyrcania</placeName> under his dominion and was closely besetting <placeName key="tgn,7016612">Bactria</placeName>. So he thought that if he should break the power of the Medes, he should easily obtain dominion over all the nations round about; for he considered the Medes the strongest of the neighbouring tribes.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Accordingly, he sent around to all those under his sway and to Croesus, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, to the king of <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>; to both Phrygias, to <placeName key="tgn,7016760">Paphlagonia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>; and to a certain extent also he misrepresented the Medes and Persians, for he said that they were great, powerful nations, that they had intermarried with each other, and were united in common interests, and that unless some one attacked them first and broke their power, they would be likely to make war upon each one of the nations singly and subjugate them. Some, then, entered into an alliance with him because they actually believed what he said; others, because they were bribed with gifts and money, for he had great wealth.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when Cyaxares heard of the plot and of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Medes and Persians</note> the warlike preparations of the nations allied against him, without delay he made what counter preparations<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">make counter preparations</note> he could himself and also sent to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> both to the general assembly and to his brother-in-law, Cambyses, who was king of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. And he sent word to <persName>Cyrus</persName>, too, asking him to try to come as commander of the men, in case the Persian state should send any troops. For <persName>Cyrus</persName> had by this time completed his ten years among the youths also and was now in the class of mature men.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So <persName>Cyrus</persName> accepted the invitation, and the elders in council chose him commander of the expedition to Media. And they further permitted him to choose two hundred peers<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The &ldquo;peers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;equals-in-honour,&rdquo; were so called because they enjoyed equality of rights in matters of education, politics, and offices of honour and distinction. See Index, s.v.</note> to accompany him, and to each one of the two hundred peers in turn they gave authority to choose four more, these also from the peers. That made a thousand. And each one of the thousand in their turn they bade choose in addition from the common people of the Persians ten targeteers, ten slingers, and ten bowmen. That made ten thousand bowmen, ten thousand targeteers, and ten thousand slingers&mdash;not counting the original thousand. So large was the army given to <persName>Cyrus</persName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now as soon as he was chosen, his first act was to consult the gods; and not till he had sacrificed and the omens were propitious, did he proceed to choose his two hundred men. And when these also had chosen each his four, he called them all together and then addressed them for the first time as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My friends, I have chosen you not because I<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> addresses his troops</note> now see your worth for the first time, but because I have observed that from your boyhood on you have been zealously following out all that the state considers right and abstaining altogether from all that it regards as wrong. As for myself, I wish to make known to you why I have not hesitated to assume this office and why I have invited you to join me.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I have come to realize that our forefathers were no whit worse than we. At any rate, they also spent their time in practising what are considered the works of virtue. However, what they gained by being what they were, either for the commonwealth of the Persians or for themselves, I can by no means discover.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And yet I think that no virtue is practised by men except with the aim that the good, by being such, may have something more than the bad; and I believe that those who abstain from present pleasures do this not that they may never enjoy themselves, but by this self-restraint they prepare themselves to have many times greater enjoyment in time to come. And those who are eager to become able speakers study oratory, not that they may never cease from speaking eloquently, but in the hope that by their eloquence they may persuade men and accomplish great good. And those also who practice military science undergo this labour, not that they may never cease from fighting, but because they think that by gaining proficiency in the arts of war they will secure great wealth and happiness and honour both for themselves and for their country.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But when men go through all this toil<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The folly of wasting effort</note> and then allow themselves to become old and feeble before they reap any fruit of their labours, they seem to me at least to be like a man who, anxious to become a good farmer, should sow and plant well but, when harvest time came, should permit his crop to fall back again to the ground ungathered. And again, if an athlete after long training and after getting himself in condition to win a victory should then persist in refusing to compete, not even he, I ween, would rightly be considered guiltless of folly.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>But, fellow-soldiers, let us not make this mistake; but, conscious that from our boyhood on we have practised what is good and honourable, let us go against the enemy, who, I am sure, are too untrained to contend against us. For those men are not yet valiant warriors, who, however skilful in the use of bow or spear and in horsemanship, are still found wanting if it is ever necessary to suffer hardship; such persons are mere tiros when it comes to hardships. Nor are those men valiant warriors, who are found wanting when it is necessary to keep awake; but these also are mere tiros in the face of sleep. Nor yet are those men valiant warriors, who have these qualifications but have not been taught how they ought to treat comrades and how to treat enemies, but it is evident that they also are unacquainted with the most important branches of education.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now you, I take it, could make use of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The superior advantages of Persian discipline</note> the night just as others do of the day; and you consider toil the guide to a happy life; hunger you use regularly as a sauce, and you endure drinking plain water more readily than lions do, while you have stored up in your souls that best of all possessions and the one most suitable to war: I mean, you enjoy praise more than anything else; and lovers of praise must for this reason gladly undergo every sort of hardship and every sort of danger.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now if I say this concerning you while I believe the contrary to be true, I deceive myself utterly. For if any of these qualities shall fail to be forthcoming in you, the loss will fall on me. But I feel confident, you see, both from my own experience and from your good-will toward me and from the ignorance of the enemy that these sanguine hopes will not deceive me. So let us set out with good heart, since we are free from the suspicion of even seeming to aim unjustly at other men's possessions. For, as it is, the enemy are coming, aggressors in wrong, and our friends are calling us to their assistance. What, then, is more justifiable than to defend oneself, or what more noble than to assist one's friends?
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;This, moreover, will, I think, strengthen your confidence: I have not neglected the gods as we embark upon this expedition. For you have been with me enough to know that not only in great things but also in small I always try to begin with the approval of the gods.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What more need I add?&rdquo; he said in closing. &ldquo;Choose you your men and get them together, and when you have made the necessary preparations come on to Media. As for myself, I will first return to my father and then go on ahead of you, to learn as soon as possible what the plans of the enemy are and to make what preparations I may require, in order that with God's help we may make as good a fight as possible.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They, for their part, proceeded to do as he had said.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, when <persName>Cyrus</persName> had gone home and prayed to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The importance of divine omens</note> ancestral Hestia, ancestral Zeus, and the rest of the gods, he set out upon his expedition; and his father also joined in escorting him on his way. And when they were out of the house, it is said to have thundered and lightened with happy auspices for him; and when this manifestation had been made, they proceeded, without taking any further auspices, in the conviction that no one would make void the signs of the supreme god.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Then, as they went on, his father began to speak to <persName>Cyrus</persName> on this wise:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My son, it is evident both from the sacrifices and from the signs from the skies that the gods are sending you forth with their grace and favour; and you yourself must recognize it, for I had you taught this art on purpose that you might not have to learn the counsels of the gods through others as interpreters, but that you yourself, both seeing what is to be seen and hearing what is to be heard, might understand; for I would not have you at the mercy of the soothsayers, in case they should wish to deceive you by saying other things than those revealed by the gods; and furthermore, if ever you should be without a soothsayer, I would not have you in doubt as to what to make of the divine revelations, but by your soothsayer's art I would have you understand the counsels of the gods and obey them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, father,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;as you have taught me, I always try to take care, as far as I can, that the gods may be gracious unto us and willingly give us counsel; for I remember,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;having once<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The secret of power in prayer</note> heard you say that that man would be more likely to have power with the gods, even as with men, who did not fawn upon them when he was in adversity, but remembered the gods most of all when he was in the highest prosperity. And for one's friends also, you said, one ought always to show one's regard in precisely the same way.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and owing to that very regard do you not come to the gods with a better heart to pray, and do you not expect more confidently to obtain what you pray for, because you feel conscious of never having neglected them?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, father,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I feel toward the gods as if they were my friends.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;and do you<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">God helps those who help themselves</note> remember the conclusion which once we reached&mdash;that as people who know what the gods have granted fare better than those who do not; as people who work accomplish more than those who are idle; as people who are careful live more securely than those who are indifferent; so in this matter it seemed to us that those only who had made themselves what they ought to be had a right to ask for corresponding blessings from the gods?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;I do indeed remember hearing you say so, and all the more because I could not help but agree with what you said. For I know that you always used to say that those who had not learned to ride had no right to ask the gods to give them victory in a cavalry battle; and those who did not know how to shoot had no right to ask to excel in marksmanship those who did know how; and those who did not know how to steer had no right to pray that they might save ships by taking the helm; neither had those who did not sow at all any right to pray for a fine crop, nor those who were not watchful in war to ask for preservation; for all that is contrary to the ordinances of the gods. You said, moreover, that it was quite as likely that those who prayed for what was not right should fail of success with the gods as that those who asked for what was contrary to human law should be disappointed at the hands of men.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, my son, have you forgotten the discussion<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The ruler's task</note> you and I once had&mdash;that it was a great task and one worthy of a man, to do the best he could not only to prove himself a truly good and noble man but also to provide a good living both for himself and his household? And while this was a great task, still, to understand how to govern other people so that they might have all the necessaries of life in abundance and might all become what they ought to be, this seemed to us worthy of all admiration.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do remember your saying this also; and I agreed with you, too, that it was an exceedingly difficult task to govern well; and now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I hold this same opinion still, when I consider the matter and think of the principles of governing. When I look at other people, however, and observe what sort of men those are who, in spite of their character, continue to rule over them, and what sort of opponents we are going to have, it seems to me an utter disgrace to show any respect for such as they are and not to wish to go to fight them. To begin with our own friends here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I observe that the Medes consider it necessary for the one who governs them to surpass the governed in greater sumptuousness of fare, in the possession of more money in his palace, in longer hours of sleep, and in a more luxurious manner of life, in every respect, than the governed. But I think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that the ruler ought to surpass those under his rule not in self-indulgence, but in taking forethought and willingly undergoing toil.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But let me tell you, my boy,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;there are some instances in which we must wrestle not against men but against actual facts, and it is not so easy to get the better of these without trouble. For<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Supplies essential to success</note> instance, you doubtless know that if your army does not receive its rations, your authority will soon come to naught.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but Cyaxares says that he will furnish supplies for all who come from here, however many they be.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you mean to say that you are marching out trusting to the funds at the command of Cyaxares?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But say,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;do you know how much he has?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I know nothing about it.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And do you nevertheless trust to these uncertainties? And do you not know that you will need many things and that he must now have many other expenses?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if his resources fail or if he play you false on purpose, how will your army fare?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Evidently not very well; but father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you have in mind any means that I might find at my own command for obtaining supplies, tell me about it, while we are still in a friendly country.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you ask me, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where you might yourself find means? Where might you better look to find the means of obtaining supplies than to the one who has an army? Now you are marching out from here with a force of infantry which you would not exchange, I am sure, for any other though many time as large; and you will have for cavalry to support you the Median horse, the best cavalry troops in the world. What nation, then, of those around do you suppose will refuse to serve you, both from the wish to do your side a favour, and for fear of suffering harm? And therefore in common with Cyaxares you should take care that you may never be without any of the things you need to have, and as a matter of habit, too, contrive some means of revenue. And above all I beg you to remember this: never postpone procuring supplies until want compels you to it; but when you have the greatest abundance, then take measures against want. And this is most expedient; for you will obtain more from those upon whom you make demands, if you do not seem to be in want, and besides you will thus be blameless in the eyes of your own soldiers; in this way, furthermore, you will command more respect from others also, and if you wish to do good or ill to any one with your forces, your soldiers will serve you better as long as they have what they need. And let me assure you that the words you say will have more more power to convince, when you can abundantly prove that you are in a position to do both good and ill.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it seems to me that you are right in all you say, both on other grounds and also because not one of my soldiers will be grateful to me for that which according to the agreement he is to receive; for they know on what terms Cyaxares is having them brought as his allies. But whatever any one receives in addition to what has been agreed upon, that he will consider as a reward, and he will probably be grateful to the giver. But for a man to have an army with which he may do good to his friends and get help in return and try to punish his enemies, and for him then to neglect to make due provision for it, do you think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that this is in any way less disgraceful than for a man to have fields and labourers to work them and after all to let his land lie idle and unprofitable? But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I, at any rate, shall not fail to provide supplies for my men, whether in a friendly or in a hostile land&mdash;you may be certain of that.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, my boy,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;tell<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">An incompetent teacher of military science</note> me, do you remember the other points which, we agreed, must not be neglected&mdash;eh?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I remember well when I came to you for money to pay to the man who professed to have taught me to be a general; and you, while you gave it me, asked a question something like this: &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; you said, &lsquo;the man to whom you are taking the pay has given you instruction in domestic economy as a part of the duties of a general, has he not? At any rate, the soldiers need provisions no whit less than the servants in your house.&rsquo; And when I told you the truth and said that he had given me no instruction whatever in this subject, you asked me further whether he had said anything to me about health or strength, inasmuch as it would be requisite for the general to take thought for these matters as well as for the conduct of his campaign.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when I said &lsquo;no&rsquo; to this also, you asked me once more whether he had taught me any arts that would be the best helps in the business of war. And when I said &lsquo;no&rsquo; to this as well, you put this further question, whether he had put me through any training so that I might be able to inspire my soldiers with enthusiasm, adding that in every project enthusiasm or faintheartedness made all the difference in the world. And when I shook my head in response to this likewise, you questioned me again whether he had given me any lessons to teach me how best to secure obedience on the part of an army.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And when this also appeared not to have been discussed at all, you finally asked me what in the world he had been teaching me that he professed to have been teaching me generalship. And thereupon I answered, &lsquo;tactics.&rsquo; And you laughed and went through it all, explaining point by point, as you asked of what conceivable use tactics could be to an army, without provisions and health, and of what use it could be without the knowledge of the arts invented for warfare and without obedience. And when you had made it clear to me that tactics was only a small part of generalship, I asked you if you could teach me any of those things, and you bade me go and talk with the men who were reputed to be masters of military science and find out how each one of those problems was to be met.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Thereupon I joined<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Practical teaching of military science</note> myself to those who I heard were most proficient in those branches. And in regard to provisions&mdash;I was persuaded that what Cyaxares was to furnish us was enough if it should be forthcoming; and in regard to health&mdash;as I had always heard and observed that states that wished to be healthy elected a board of health, and also that generals for the sake of their soldiers took physicians out with them, so also when I was appointed to this position, I immediately took thought for this; and I think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that you will find that I have with me men eminent in the medical profession.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Said his father in reply to this,
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>&ldquo;Yes, my son, but just as there are menders of torn garments, so also these physicians whom you mention heal us when we fall sick. But your responsibility for health will be a larger one than that: you must see to it that your army does not get sick at all.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And pray what course shall I take, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I may be able to accomplish that?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the first place, if you are going to stay for some time in the same neighbourhood, you must not neglect to find a sanitary location for your camp; and with proper attention you can not fail in this. For people are continually talking about unhealthful localities and localities that are healthful; and you may find clear witnesses to either in the physique and complexion of the inhabitants; and in the second place, it is not enough to have regard to the localities only, but tell me what means you adopt to keep well yourself.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the first place, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I try never to eat too much, for that is oppressive; and in the second place, I work off by exercise what I have eaten, for by so doing health seems more likely to endure and strength to accrue.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That, then, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the way in which you must take care of the rest also.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but will the soldiers find leisure for taking physical exercise?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Nay, by Zeus,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;they not only can, but they actually must. For if an army is to do its duty, it is absolutely necessary that it never cease to contrive both evil for the enemy and good for itself. What a burden it is to support even one idle man! It is more burdensome still to support a whole household in idleness; but the worst burden of all is to support an army in idleness. For not only are the mouths in an army very numerous but the supplies they start with are exceedingly limited, and they use up most extravagantly whatever they get, so that an army must never be left idle.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Methinks you mean, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that just as a lazy farmer is of no account, so also a lazy general is of no account at all.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But at any rate, as regards the energetic general,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;I can vouch for it that, unless some god do cross him, he will keep his soldiers abundantly supplied with provisions and at the same time in the best physical condition.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;but at all events, as to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Incentives to physical training and to moral enthusiasm</note> practice in the various warlike exercises, it seems to me, father, that by announcing contests in each one and offering prizes you would best secure practice in them, so that you would have everything prepared for use, whenever you might need it.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Quite right, my son,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for if you do that you may be sure that you will see your companies performing their proper parts like trained sets of dancers.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the next place,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;for putting enthusiasm into the soldiers nothing seems to be more effectual than the power of inspiring men with hopes.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but that is just as if any one on a hunt should always call up his dogs with the call that he uses when he sees the quarry. For at first, to be sure, he will find them obeying him eagerly; but if he deceives them often, in the end they will not obey him when he calls, even though he really does see a wild beast. So it stands with respect to those hopes also. If any one too often raises false expectations of good things to come, eventually he can gain no credence, even when he holds forth well-grounded hopes. But, my son, you should refrain from saying what you are not perfectly sure of; by making certain others your mouthpiece, however, the desired end may be accomplished; but faith in your own words of encouragement you must keep sacred to the utmost to serve you in the greatest crises.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus, father,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;I think you are right in what you say, and I like your idea better.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And then in regard to keeping the soldiers<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How obedience is best secured</note> in a state of obedience, I think, father, that I am not inexperienced in that direction; for you instructed me in obedience from my very childhood on, compelling me to obey you. Then you surrendered me to the charge of my teachers, and they pursued the same course; and when we were in the class of young men, the officer in charge paid especial attention to this same point; and most of the laws seem to me to teach these two things above all else, to govern and to be governed. And now, when I think of it, it seems to me that in all things the chief incentive to obedience lies in this: praise and honour for the obedient, punishment and dishonour for the disobedient.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;This, my son, is the road to compulsory obedience, indeed, but there is another road, a short cut, to what is much better&mdash;namely, to willing obedience. For people are only too glad to obey the man who they believe takes wiser thought for their interests than they themselves do. And you might recognize that this is so in many instances but particularly in the case of the sick: how readily they call in those who are to prescribe what they must do; and at sea how cheerfully the passengers obey the captain; and how earnestly travellers desire not to get separated from those who they think are better acquainted with the road than they are. But when people think that they are going to get into trouble if they obey, they will neither yield very much for punishment nor will they be moved by gifts; for no one willingly accepts even a gift at the cost of trouble to himself.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You mean to say, father, that nothing is more effectual toward keeping one's men obedient than to seem to be wiser than they?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is just what I mean.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And how, pray, father, could one most quickly acquire such a reputation for oneself?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;There is no shorter road, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;than<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Be what you would seem to be</note> really to be wise in those things in which you wish to seem to be wise; and when you examine concrete instances, you will realize that what I say is true. For example, if you wish to seem to be a good farmer when you are not, or a good rider, doctor, flute-player, or anything else that you are not, just think how many schemes you must invent to keep up your pretensions. And even if you should persuade any number of people to praise you, in order to give yourself a reputation, and if you should procure a fine outfit for each of your professions, you would soon be found to have practised deception; and not long after, when you were giving an exhibition of your skill, you would be shown up and convicted, too, as an impostor.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But how could one become really wise in foreseeing that which will prove to be useful?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Obviously, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by learning all that it is possible to acquire by learning, just as you learned tactics. But whatever it is not possible for man to learn, nor for human wisdom to foresee, that you may find out from the gods by the soothsayer's art, and thus prove yourself wiser than others; and if you know anything that it would be best to have done, you would show yourself wiser than others if you should exert yourself to get that done; for it is a mark of greater wisdom in a man to strive to secure what is needful than to neglect it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes; but as to the love of one's subjects&mdash;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The way to win affection</note> and this, it seems to me at least, is one of the most important questions&mdash;the same course that you would take if you wished to gain the affection of your friends leads also to that; that is, I think, you must show yourself to be their benefactor.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is a difficult matter, however, always to be in a position to do good to whom you will; but to show that you rejoice with them if any good befall them, that you sympathize with them if any ill betide, that you are eager to help them in times of distress, that you are anxious that they be not crossed in any way, and that you try to prevent their being crossed; it is in these respects somehow that you ought rather to go hand in hand with them.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And in his campaigns also, if they fall in the summer time, the general must show that he can endure the heat of the sun better than his soldiers can, and that he can endure cold better than they if it be in winter; if the way lead through difficulties, that he can endure hardships better. All this contributes to his being loved by his men.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You mean to say, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that in everything the general must show more endurance than his men.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is just what I mean; however, never fear for that, my son; for bear in mind that the same toils do not affect the general and the private in the same way, though they have the same sort of bodies; but the honour of the general's position and the very consciousness that nothing he does escapes notice lighten the burdens for him.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, father, when once your soldiers had supplies and were well and able to endure toils, and when they were practised in the arts of war and ambitious to prove themselves brave, and when they were more inclined to obey than to disobey, under such circumstances do you not think it would be wise to desire to engage the enemy at the very first opportunity?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;at any rate, if I<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Taking advantage of the enemy</note> expected to gain some advantage by it; otherwise, for my part, the better I though myself to be and the better my followers, the more should I be on my guard, just as we try to keep other things also which we hold most precious in the greatest possible security.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, father, what would be the best way to gain an advantage over the enemy?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is no easy or simple question that you ask now, my son; but, let me tell you, the man who proposes to do that must be designing and cunning, wily and deceitful, a thief and a robber, overreaching the enemy at every point.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;O Heracles, father,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName> with a laugh, &ldquo;what a man you say I must become!&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Such, my son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you would be at the same time the most righteous and law-abiding man in the world.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why then, pray, did you use to teach us the opposite of this when we were boys and youths?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and so we would have you still towards your friends and fellow-citizens; but, that you might be able to hurt your enemies, do you not know that you all were learning many villainies?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, indeed, father,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;not I, at any rate.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did you learn to shoot, and why to throw the spear? Why did you learn to ensnare wild boars with nets and pitfalls, and deer with traps and toils? And why were you not used to confront lions and bears and leopards in a fair fight face to face instead of always trying to contend against them with some advantage on your side? Why, do you not know that all this is villainy and deceit and trickery and taking unfair advantage?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;toward wild animals however; but if I ever even seemed to wish to deceive a man, I know that I got a good beating for it.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for, methinks, we did not permit you to shoot at people nor to throw your spear at them; but we taught you to shoot at a mark, in order that you might not for the time at least do harm to your friends, but, in case there should ever be a war, that you might be able to aim well at men also. And we instructed you likewise to deceive and to take advantage, not in the case of men but of beasts, in order that you might not injure your friends by so doing, but, if there should ever be a war, that you might not be unpractised in these arts.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if indeed it is<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Training for taking unfair advantage</note> useful to understand both how to do good and how to do evil to men, we ought to have been taught both these branches in the case of men, too.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, my son,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is said that in the time of our forefathers there was once a teacher of the boys who, it seems, used to teach them justice in the very way that you propose; to lie and not to lie, to cheat and not to cheat, to slander and not to slander, to take and not to take unfair advantage. And he drew the line between what one should do to one's friends and what to one's enemies. And what is more, he used to teach this: that it was right to deceive friends even, provided it were for a good end, and to steal the possessions of a friend for a good purpose.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>And in teaching these lessons he had also to train the boys to practise them upon one another, just as also in wrestling, the Greeks, they say, teach deception and train the boys to be able to practise it upon one another. When, therefore, some had in this way become expert both in deceiving successfully and in taking unfair advantage and perhaps also not inexpert in avarice, they did not refrain from trying to take an unfair advantage even of their friends.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>In consequence of that, therefore, an ordinance was passed which obtains even unto this day, simply to teach our boys, just as we teach our servants in their relations toward us, to tell the truth and not to deceive and not to take unfair advantage; and if they should act contrary to this law, the law requires their punishment, in order that, inured to such habits, they may become more refined members of society.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>But when they came to be as old as you are now, then it seemed to be safe to teach them that also which is lawful toward enemies; for it does not seem likely that you would break away and degenerate into savages after you had been brought up together in mutual respect. In the same way we do not discuss sexual matters in the presence of very young boys, lest in case lax discipline should give a free rein to their passions the young might indulge them to excess.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;True, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but seeing that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How to take advantage of the enemy</note> I am late in learning about this art of taking advantage of others, do not neglect to teach me, father, if you can, how I may take advantage of the enemy.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Contrive, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as far as is in your power, with your own men in good order to catch the enemy in disorder, with your own men armed to come upon them unarmed, and with your own men awake to surprise them sleeping, and then you will catch them in an unfavourable position while you yourself are in a strong position, when they are in sight to you and while you yourself are unseen.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And how, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;could one catch the enemy making such mistakes?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;both you and the enemy must necessarily offer many such opportunities; for instance, you must both eat, and you must both sleep, and early in the morning you must almost all at the same time attend to the calls of nature, and you must make use of such roads as you find. All this you must observe, and you must be particularly watchful on the side where you know yourselves to be weaker, and you must attack the enemy above all in that quarter in which you see that they are most vulnerable.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And is it possible to take advantage in these ways only,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;or in other ways also?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, far more in other ways, my son,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for in these particulars all men, as a rule, take strict precautions; for they know that they must. But those whose business it is to deceive the enemy can catch them off their guard by inspiring them with over-confidence; and, by offering them the opportunity of pursuit, can get them into disorder; and, by leading them on into unfavourable ground by pretended flight, can there turn and attack them.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>However, my son,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;since you are desirous of learning all these matters, you must not only utilize what you may learn from others, but you must yourself also be an inventor of stratagems against the enemy, just as musicians render not only those compositions which they have learned but try to compose others also that are new. Now if in music that which is new and fresh wins applause, new stratagems in warfare also win far greater applause, for such can deceive the enemy even more successfully.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And if you, my son,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;should<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The lessons of the chase applied to the arts of war</note> do nothing more than apply to your dealings with men the tricks that you used to practise so constantly in dealing with small game, do you not think that you would make a very considerable advance in the art of taking advantage of the enemy? For you used to get up in the coldest winter weather and go out before daylight to catch birds, and before the birds were astir you had your snares laid ready for them and the ground disturbed had been made exactly like the ground undisturbed; and your decoy birds had been so trained as to serve your purposes and to deceive the birds of the same species, while you yourself would lie in hiding so as to see them but not to be seen by them; and you had practised drawing your nets before the birds could escape.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And again, to catch the hare&mdash;because he feeds in the night and hides in the daytime&mdash;you used to breed dogs that would find him out by the scent. And because he ran so fast, when he was found, you used to have other dogs trained to catch him by coursing. And in case he escaped even these, you used to find out the runs and the places where hares take refuge and may be caught, and there you would spread out your nets so as to be hardly visible, and the hare in his headlong flight would plunge into them and entangle himself. And lest he escape even from that, you used to station men to watch for what might happen and to pounce upon him suddenly from a place near by. And you yourself from behind shouting with a cry that kept right up with the hare would frighten him so that he would lose his wits and be taken; those in front, on the other hand, you had instructed to keep silent and made them lie concealed in ambush.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As I said before, then, if you would employ<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cambyses's concluding suggestions</note> such schemes on men also, I am inclined to think that you would not come short of any enemy in the world. But if it is ever necessary&mdash;as it may well be&mdash;to join battle in the open field, in plain sight, with both armies in full array, why, in such a case, my son, the advantages that have been long since secured are of much avail; by that I mean, if your soldiers are physically in good training, if their hearts are well steeled and the arts of war well studied.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>Besides, you must remember well that all those from whom you expect obedience to you will, on their part, expect you to take thought for them. So never be careless, but think out at night what your men are to do for you when day comes, and in the daytime think out how the arrangements for the night may best be made.
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>But how you ought to draw up an army in battle array, or how you ought to lead it by day or by night, by narrow ways or broad, over mountains or plains, or how you should pitch camp, or how station your sentinels by night or by day, or how you should advance against the enemy or retreat before them, or how you should lead past a hostile city, or how attack a fortification or withdraw from it, or how you should cross ravines or rivers, or how you should protect yourself against cavalry or spearmen or bowmen, and if the enemy should suddenly come in sight while you are leading on in column, how you should form and take your stand against them, and if they should come in sight from any other quarter than in front as you are marching in phalanx, how you should form and face them, or how any one might best find out the enemy's plans or how the enemy might be least likely to learn his&mdash;why should I tell you all these things? For what I, for my part, know, you have often heard; and if any one else had a reputation for understanding anything of that kind, you never neglected to get information from him, nor have you been uninstructed. I think, then, that you should turn this knowledge to account according to circumstances, as each item of it may appear serviceable to you.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Learn this lesson, too, from me, my son,&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Obedience to divine guidance the first rule</note> said he; &ldquo;it is the most important thing of all: never go into any danger either to yourself or to your army contrary to the omens or the auspices, and bear in mind that men choose lines of action by conjecture and do not know in the least from which of them success will come.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>But you may derive this lesson from the facts of history; for many, and men, too, who seemed most wise, have ere now persuaded states to take up arms against others, and the states thus persuaded to attack have been destroyed. And many have made many others great, both individuals and states; and when they have exalted them, they have suffered the most grievous wrongs at their hands. And many who might have treated people as friends and done them favours and received favours from them, have received their just deserts from these very people because they preferred to treat them like slaves rather than as friends. Many, too, not satisfied to live contentedly in the enjoyment of their own proper share, have lost even that which they had, because they have desired to be lords of everything; and many, when they have gained the much coveted wealth, have been ruined by it.
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>So we see that mere human wisdom does not know how to choose what is best any more than if any one were to cast lots and do as the lot fell. But the gods, my son, the eternal gods, know all things, both what has been and what is and what shall come to pass as a result of each present or past event; and if men consult them, they reveal to those to whom they are propitious what they ought to do and what they ought not to do. But if they are not willing to give counsel to everybody, that is not surprising; for they are under no compulsion to care for any one unless they will.&rdquo;</p></div1>

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>&ldquo;Croesus, the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The probable number of the opposing forces</note> king of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, is said to be coming at the head of 10,000 horsemen and more than 40,000 peltasts and bowmen. And they say that Artacamas, the king of Greater Phrygia, is coming at the head of 8000 horse and not fewer than 40,000 lancers and peltasts; and Aribaeus, the king of <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, has 6000 horse and not fewer than 30,000 bowmen and peltasts; while the Arabian, Aragdus, has about 10,000 horsemen, about 100 chariots of war, and a great host of slingers. As for the Greeks who dwell in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, however, no definite information is as yet received whether they are in the coalition or not. But the contingent from <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, under Gabaedus, has arrived at Cay+stru-Pedium, it is said, to the number of 6000 horse and 10,000 peltasts.The Carians, however, and Cilicians and Paphlagonians, they say, have not joined the expedition, although they have been invited to do so. But the Assyrians, both those from <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> and those from the rest of Assyria, will bring, I think, not fewer than 20,000 horse and not fewer, I am sure, than 200 war-chariots, and a vast number of infantry, I suppose; at any rate, they used to have as many as that whenever they invaded our country.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You mean to say,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;that the enemy have 60,000 horse and more than 200,000 peltasts and bowmen. And at how many, pray, do you estimate the number of your own forces?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of the Medes more than 10,000 horse; and the peltasts and bowmen might be, from a country like ours, some 60,000; while from our neighbours, the Armenians, we shall get 4000 horse and 20,000 foot.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;we have less than one-fourth as many horsemen as the enemy and about half as many foot-soldiers.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; said Cyaxares, &ldquo;do you not consider the Persian force small which you say you are bringing?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;but we will consider later<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Their method of warfare</note> whether we need more men or not. Now tell me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;what each party's method of fighting is.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;About the same with all,&rdquo; said Cyaxares; &ldquo;for there are bowmen and spearmen both on their side and on ours.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;as their arms are of that sort, we must fight at long range.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cyaxares, &ldquo;that will be necessary.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In that case, then, the victory will be with the side that has the greater numbers; for the few would be wounded and killed off by the many sooner than the many by the few.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If that is so, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, then what better plan could any one think of than to send to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> to inform them that if anything happens to the Medes, the danger will extend to the Persians, and at the same time to ask for a larger army?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;let me assure you that even though all the Persians were to come, we should not surpass the enemy in point of numbers.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What better plan do you see than this?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I should as quickly<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Proposed reorganization of the Persian commoners</note> as possible have armour made for all the Persians who are coming here just like that of the so-called peers who are coming from our country&mdash;that is, a corselet to wear about the breast, a small shield upon the left arm, and a scimitar or sabre in the right hand. And if you provide these weapons, you will make it the safest procedure for us to fight at close quarters with the enemy, while for the enemy flight will prove preferable to standing their ground. And it is for us,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to range ourselves against those who hold their ground, while those of them who run away we propose to leave to you and the cavalry, that they may have no chance to stand their ground or to turn back.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> spoke. And to Cyaxares it seemed that he spoke to the point; and he no longer talked of sending for reinforcements, but he set about procuring the arms as suggested. And they were almost ready when the Persian peers came with the army from <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon <persName>Cyrus</persName> is said to have called the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> announces to the peers the proposed change</note> peers together and said: &ldquo;My friends: When I saw you thus equipped and ready in heart to grapple with the enemy in a hand-to-hand encounter, and when I observed that those Persians who follow you are so armed as to do their fighting standing as far off as possible, I was afraid lest, few in number and unaccompanied by others to support you, you might fall in with a large division of the enemy and come to some harm. Now then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have brought with you men blameless in bodily strength; and they are to have arms like ours; but to steel their hearts is our task; for it is not the whole duty of an officer to show himself valiant, but he must also take care that his men be as valiant as possible.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke. And they were all delighted, for they thought they were going into battle with more to support them. And one of them also spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;it will perhaps sound strange if I advise <persName>Cyrus</persName> to say something on our behalf, when those who are to fight along with us receive their arms. But I venture the suggestion, for I know that when men have most power to do both good and ill, then their words also are the most likely to sink deep into the hearts of the hearers. And if such persons give presents, even though the gifts be of less worth than those given by equals, still the recipients value them more highly. And now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our Persian comrades will be more highly pleased to be exhorted by <persName>Cyrus</persName> than by us; and when they have taken their place among the peers they will feel that they hold this honour with more security because conferred by their prince and their general than if the same honour were bestowed by us. However, our co-operation must not be wanting, but in every way and by all means we must steel the hearts of our men. For the braver these men are, the more to our advantage it will be.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, <persName>Cyrus</persName> had the arms brought in and arranged to view, and calling all the Persian soldiers together he spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>&ldquo;Fellow-citizens<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> announces the proposed reorganization to the commoners</note> of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, you were born and bred upon the same soil as we; the bodies you have are no whit inferior to ours, and it is not likely that you have hearts in the least less brave than our own. In spite of this, in our own country you did not enjoy equal privileges with us, but because you were obliged to earn your own livelihood. Now, however, with the help of the gods, I shall see to it that you are provided with the necessaries of life; and you are permitted, if you wish, to receive arms like ours, to face the same danger as we, and, if any fair success crowns our enterprise, to be counted worthy of an equal share with us.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now, up to this time you have been bowmen and lancers, and so have we; and if you were not quite our equals in the use of these arms, there is nothing surprising about that; for you had not the leisure to practise with them that we had. But with this equipment we shall have no advantage over you. In any case, every man will have a corselet fitted to his breast, upon his left arm a shield, such as we have all been accustomed to carry, and in his right hand a sabre or scimitar with which, you see, we must strike those opposed to us at such close range that we need not fear to miss our aim when we strike.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>In this armour, then, how could any one of us have the advantage over another except in courage? And this it is proper for you to cherish in your hearts no less than we. For why is it more proper for us than for you to desire victory, which gains and keeps safe all things beautiful and all things good? And what reason is there that we, any more than you, should desire that superiority in arms which gives to the victors all the belongings of the vanquished?
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You have heard all,&rdquo; he said in conclusion. &ldquo;You see your arms; whosoever will, let him take them and have his name enrolled with the captain in the same companies with us. But whosoever is satisfied to be in the position of a mercenary, let him remain in the armour of the hired soldiery.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>And when the Persians heard<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The commoners accept</note> it, they thought that if they were unwilling to accept, when invited to share the same toils and enjoy the same rewards, they should deserve to live in want through all time. And so they were all enrolled and all took up the arms.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And while the enemy were said to be<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Preliminary drill</note> approaching but had not yet come, <persName>Cyrus</persName> tried to develop the physical strength of his men, to teach them tactics, and to steel their hearts for war.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And first of all he received quartermasters from Cyaxares and commanded them to furnish ready made for each of the soldiers a liberal supply of everything that he needed. And when he had provided for this, he had left them nothing to do but to practise the arts of war, for he thought he had observed that those became best in any given thing who gave up paying attention to many things and devoted themselves to that alone. So, in the drill itself he relieved them of even the practice with bow and spear and left them only the drill with sword and shield and breastplate. And so he at once brought home to them the conviction that they must go into a hand-to-hand encounter with the enemy or else admit that as allies they were good for nothing. But such an admission is hard for those who know that they are being maintained for no other purpose than to fight for those who maintain them.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as, in addition to this, he had further<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Competitive drill</note> observed that people are much more willing to practise those things in which they have rivalry among themselves, he appointed contests for them in everything that he knew it was important for soldiers to practise. What he proposed was as follows: to the private soldier, that he show himself obedient to the officers, ready for hardship, eager for danger but subject to good discipline, familiar with the duties required of a soldier, neat in the care of his equipment, and ambitious about all such matters; to the corporal, that, besides being himself like the good private, he make his squad of five a model, as far as possible; to the sergeant, that he do likewise with his squad of ten, and the lieutenant with his platoon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The divisions of <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army were as follows:  5 men to a corporal's squad <foreign lang="greek">pempa/s</foreign>); officer: corporal (<foreign lang="greek">pempa/darxos</foreign>); total men: 5. 2 corporals' squads to a 1 sergeant's squad <foreign lang="greek">deka/s</foreign>; officer: sergeant <foreign lang="greek">deka/darxos</foreign>; total men: 10. 5 sergeants' squads to a platoon <foreign lang="greek">lo/xos</foreign>; officer: lieutenant <foreign lang="greek">loxago/s</foreign>; total men: 50. 2 platoons to a company <foreign lang="greek">ta/cis</foreign>; officer: captain <foreign lang="greek">taci/arxos</foreign>; total men: 100. 10 companies to a 1 regiment <foreign lang="greek">xiliostu/s</foreign>; officer: colonel <foreign lang="greek">xili/arxos</foreign>; total men: 1,000. 10 regiments to a brigade <foreign lang="greek">muriostu/s</foreign>; officer: general <foreign lang="greek">muri/arxos</foreign>); total men: 10,000.</note>; and to the captain, that he be unexceptionable himself and see to it that the officers under him get those whom they command to do their duty.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As rewards, moreover, he offered the following:<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Rewards of merit</note> in the case of captains, those who were thought to have got their companies into the best condition should be made colonels; of the lieutenants, those who were thought to have put their platoons into the best condition should be advanced to the rank of captains; of the sergeants, those who were the most meritorious should be promoted to the rank of lieutenant; in the same way, the best of the corporals should be promoted to the rank of sergeants; and finally of the privates, the best should be advanced to the rank of corporal. Moreover, all these officers not only had a right to claim the respect of their subordinates, but other distinctions also appropriate to each office followed in course. And to those who should deserve praise still greater hopes were held out, in case in time to come any greater good fortune should befall.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Besides, he offered prizes of victory to whole companies and to whole platoons and to squads of ten and of five likewise, if they showed themselves implicitly obedient to the officers and very ready in performing the afore mentioned duties. And the prizes of victory for these divisions were just such as were appropriate to groups of men.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such, then, were the competitions appointed, and the army began to train for them.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, he had tents made for them&mdash;in number,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Tenting by companies</note> as many as there were captains; in size, large enough to accommodate each a company. A company, moreover, was composed of a hundred men. Accordingly, they lived in tents each company by itself; for <persName>Cyrus</persName> thought that in occupying tents together they had the following advantages for the coming conflict: They saw one another provided for in the same way, and there could be no possible pretext of unjust discrimination that could lead any one to allow himself to prove less brave than another in the face of the enemy. And he thought that if they tented together it would help them to get acquainted with one another. And in getting acquainted with one another, he thought, a feeling of considerateness was more likely to be engendered in them all, while those who are unacquainted seem somehow more indifferent&mdash;like people when they are in the dark.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He thought also that their tenting together helped them not a little to gain a perfect acquaintance with their positions. For the captains had the companies under them in as perfect order as when a company was marching single file, and the lieutenants their platoons, and the sergeants and corporals their squads in the same way.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>He thought, moreover, that such perfect acquaintance with their places in the line was exceedingly helpful both to prevent their being thrown into confusion and to restore order sooner in case they should be thrown into confusion; just as in the case of stones and timbers which must be fitted together, it is possible to fit them together readily, no matter in how great confusion they may chance to have been thrown down, if they have the guide-marks to make it plain in what place each of them belongs.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>And finally, he thought that comradeship would be encouraged by their messing together and that they would be less likely to desert one another; for he had often observed that even animals that were fed together had a marvellous yearning for one another, if any one separated them.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> also took care that they should never<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Physical culture in <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s discipline</note> come to luncheon or to dinner unless they had had a sweat. For he would get them into a sweat by taking them out hunting; or he would contrive such sports as would make them sweat; or again, if he happened to have some business or other to attend to, he so conducted it that they should not come back without having had a sweat. For this he considered conducive to their enjoying their meals, to their health, and to their being able to endure hardships, and he thought that hardships conduced to their being more reasonable toward one another, for even horses that work together stand more quietly together. At any rate, those who are conscious that they have been well drilled are certainly more courageous in the face of the enemy.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And for himself <persName>Cyrus</persName> had a tent made big<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s invitations</note> enough to accommodate all whom he might invite to dinner. Now he usually invited as many of the captains as he thought proper, and sometimes also some of the lieutenants and sergeants and corporals; and occasionally he invited some of the privates, sometimes a squad of five together, or a squad of ten, or a platoon, or a whole company in a body. And he also used to invite individuals as a mark of honour, whenever he saw that they had done what he himself wished everybody to do. And the same dishes were always placed before those whom he invited to dinner as before himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The quartermasters in the army he always<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The quartermasters</note> allowed an equal share of everything; for he thought that it was fair to show no less regard for the purveyors of the army stores than for heralds or ambassadors. And that was reasonable, for he held that they must be trustworthy, familiar with military affairs, and intelligent, and, in addition to that, energetic, quick, resolute, steady. And still further, <persName>Cyrus</persName> knew that the quartermasters also must have the qualities which those have who are considered most efficient and that they must train themselves not to refuse any service but to consider that it is their duty to perform whatever the general might require of them.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whenever <persName>Cyrus</persName> entertained company at dinner,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s entertainments</note> he always took pains that the conversation introduced should be as entertaining as possible and that it should incite to good. On one occasion he opened the conversation as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me, men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do our new comrades seem to be any worse off than we because they have not been educated in the same way as we, or pray do you think that there will be no difference between us either in social intercourse or when we shall have to contend with the enemy?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hystaspas in reply, &ldquo;for my part,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A story of bad manners</note> I cannot tell yet how they will appear in the face of the enemy. But in social intercourse, by the gods, some of them seem ill-mannered enough. The other day, at any rate,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;Cyaxares had meat sent in to each company, and as it was passed around each one of us got three pieces or even more. And the first time round the cook began with me as he passed it around; but when he came in the second time to pass it, I bade him begin with the last and pass it around the other way.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then one of the men sitting in the middle of the circle called out and said, &lsquo;By Zeus, this is not fair at all&mdash;at any rate, if they are never going to begin with us here in the middle.&rsquo; And when I heard that, I was vexed that any one should think that he had less than another and I called him to me at once. He obeyed, showing good discipline in this at least. But when that which was being passed came to us, only the smallest pieces were left, as one might expect, for we were the last to be served. Thereupon he was greatly vexed and said to himself: &lsquo;Such luck! that I should happen to have been called here just now!&rsquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>&lsquo;Well, never mind,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;They will begin with us next time, and you, being first, will get the biggest piece.&rsquo; And at that moment the cook began to pass around the third time what was left of the course; and the man helped himself; and then he thought the piece he had taken too small; so he put back the piece he had, with the intention of taking another. And the cook, thinking that he did not want any more to eat, went on passing it before he got his other piece.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Thereupon he took his mishap so to heart that he lost not only the meat he had taken but also what was still left of his sauce; for this last he upset somehow or other in the confusion of his vexation and anger over his hard luck. The lieutenant nearest us saw it and laughed and clapped his hands in amusement. And I,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;pretended to cough; for even I could not keep from laughing. Such is one man, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that I present to you as one of our comrades.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this they laughed, of course.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But another<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A comical result of literal obedience</note> of the captains said: &ldquo;Our friend here, it seems, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, has fallen in with a very ill-mannered fellow. But as for me, when you had instructed us about the arrangement of the lines and dismissed us with orders each to teach his own company what we had learned from you, why then I went and proceeded to drill one platoon, just as the others also did. I assigned the lieutenant his place first and arranged next after him a young recruit, and the rest, as I thought proper. Then I took my stand out in front of them facing the platoon, and when it seemed to me to be the proper time, I gave the command to go ahead.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And that young recruit, mark you, stepped ahead&mdash;of the lieutenant and marched in front of him! And when I saw it, I said: &lsquo;Fellow, what are you doing?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am going ahead, as you ordered,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I ordered not only you, but all to go ahead.&rsquo; When he heard this, he turned about to his comrades and said: &lsquo;Don't you hear him scolding? He orders us all to go ahead.&rsquo; Then the men all ran past their lieutenant and came toward me.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But when the lieutenant ordered them back to their places, they were indignant and said: &lsquo;Pray, which one are we to obey? For now the one orders us to go ahead, and the other will not let us.&rsquo; I took this good-naturedly, however, and when I had got them in position again, I gave instructions that no one of those behind should stir before the one in front led off, but that all should have their attention on this only&mdash;to follow the man in front.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But when a certain man who was about to start for <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> came up and asked me for the letter which I had written home, I bade the lieutenant run and fetch it, for he knew where it had been placed. So he started off on a run, and that young recruit followed, as he was, breastplate and sword; and then the whole fifty, seeing him run, ran after. And the men came back bringing the letter. So exactly, you see, does my company, at least, carry out all your orders.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The rest, of course, laughed over the military escort of the letter, and <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;O Zeus and all the gods! What sort of men we have then as our comrades; they are so easily won by kindness that we can make many of them our firm friends with even a little piece of meat; and they are so obedient that they obey even before the orders are given. I, for my part, do not know what sort of soldiers one could ask to have in preference to these!&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> praised his soldiers, laughing at<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Objections raised to both stories</note> the same time. But one of his captains, Aglai+tadas by name, one of the most austere of men, happened to be in <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s tent at the same time and he spoke somewhat as follows: &ldquo;You don't mean to say, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that you think what these fellows have been telling is true?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;what object could they have, pray, in telling a lie?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What object, indeed,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;except that they wanted to raise a laugh; and so they tell these stories and try to humbug us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>. &ldquo;Don't call these men humbugs. For to me, the name &lsquo;humbug&rsquo; seems to apply to those who pretend that they are richer than they are or braver than they are, and to those who promise to do what they cannot do, and that, too, when it is evident that they do this only for the sake of getting something or making some gain. But those who invent stories to amuse their companions and not for their own gain nor at the expense of their hearers nor to the injury of any one, why should these men not be called &lsquo;witty&rsquo; and &lsquo;entertaining&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;humbugs&rsquo;?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> defended those who had furnished<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Is it better to make men laugh than weep?</note> the fun, and the captain himself who had told the anecdote about his platoon said: &ldquo;Verily, Aglai+tadas, you might find serious fault with us, if we tried to make you weep, like some authors who invent touching incidents in their poems and stories and try to move us to tears; but now, although you yourself know that we wish to entertain you and not to do you any harm at all, still you heap such reproaches upon us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said Aglai+tadas, &ldquo;and justly, too, since he that makes his friends laugh seems to me to do them much less service than he who makes them weep; and if you will look at it rightly, you, too, will find that I speak the truth. At any rate, fathers develop self-control in their sons by making them weep, and teachers impress good lessons upon their pupils in the same way, and the laws, too, turn the citizens to justice by making them weep. But could you say that those who make us laugh either do good to our bodies or make our minds any more fitted for the management of our private business or of the affairs of state?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hereupon Hystaspas answered somewhat as follows: &ldquo;If you will heed me, Aglai+tadas, you will freely expend this very valuable commodity upon your enemies and will try to set them to weeping; but upon us and your friends here you will please to lavish this cheap article, laughter. And you can, for I know you must have a great quantity of it stored up; for you have never spent it upon yourself nor do you ever afford any laughter for your friends or for your enemies if you can help it. So you have no excuse for begrudging us a laugh.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Aglai+tadas; &ldquo;do you really think, Hystaspas, to get a laugh out of me?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, by Zeus,&rdquo; said the other captain, &ldquo;he is a very foolish fellow, let me tell you, if he does; for I believe one might rub fire out of you more easily than provoke a laugh from you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this, of course, the rest laughed; for they knew his character, and Aglai+tadas himself smiled at the sally. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> seeing him brighten up said: &ldquo;It is not right, captain, for you to corrupt our most serious man by persuading him to laugh, and that, too,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when he is such a foe to laughter.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With that, the subject was dropt. But at this point Chrysantas spoke as follows.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>&ldquo;<persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and all you here present, I observe, for my part, that some have come out with us who are of superior merit, others who are less deserving than we. Now, if we meet with success, these will all expect to have share and share alike. And yet I<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The proper basis for distributing prize money</note> do not believe that anything in the world is more unfair than for the bad and good to be awarded equal shares.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, then, in the name of the gods, my men,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> replied to this, &ldquo;will it not be a very good thing for us to suggest to the army a debate on this question: shall we, in case God gives us any success to reward our toils, give to all an equal share or shall we take into consideration each man's services and bestow increased rewards upon him commensurate with them?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And what is the use,&rdquo; said Chrysantas, &ldquo;of starting a discussion concerning this matter? Why not rather announce that you propose to do thus and so? Pray, did you not announce the games and offer the prizes that way?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;but this is not a parallel case. For what the men obtain by fighting, that, I suppose, they will consider their own common property; but the command of the army they still consider fairly to be mine, so that when I appoint the judges, I am sure they think I am within my rights.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And do you really believe,&rdquo; said Chrysantas, &ldquo;that the mass meeting would adopt a resolution that each one should not have an equal share, but that the best should have the preference both in honours and gifts?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I do, partly because we recommend<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Rewards according to merit</note> it, and partly because it is mean to oppose a proposition that the one who suffers the most and does the most for the state should also receive the highest rewards. And I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that even to the worst it will seem proper that the good should have the larger share.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now <persName>Cyrus</persName> wished for the sake of the peers themselves that this measure should pass; for he thought that even they themselves would be better, if they knew that they also should be judged by their works and should receive according to their deserts. And so it seemed to him to be the proper time to bring this matter to a vote now, while the peers also were questioning the commoners' claims to equality. Accordingly, those in the tenth agreed to submit the question to a discussion and they said that whoever thought himself to be a man ought to advocate it.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But one of the captains said with a laugh: &ldquo;Well, I know a man of the commoners, too, who will support the proposition not to have share and share alike in that indiscriminate fashion.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Another asked him whom he meant; and he answered: &ldquo;By Zeus, he is a messmate of ours, who in everything does his best to get the largest share.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What! the largest share of hard work, too?&rdquo; asked another.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;not by any means; but here I have been caught in a falsehood. For my observation is that he very good-naturedly consents to have a smaller share of hard work and other things of that sort than anybody else.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, men,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I am convinced that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The vicious and lazy have no place in an army</note> such fellows as this one of whom our friend has just been telling us must be weeded out of the ranks, if we are to keep our army industrious and obedient. For it seems to me that the majority of the soldiers are the sort to follow wherever any one leads; and the good and noble, I think, try to lead only to what is good and noble, and the vicious to what is vicious.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And therefore the base oftentimes find a larger following of congenial spirits than the noble. For since vice makes her appeal through the pleasures of the moment, she has their assistance to persuade many to accept her views; but virtue, leading up hill, is not at all clever at attracting men at first sight and without reflection; and especially is this true, when there are others who call in the opposite direction, to what is downhill and easy.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so, when people are bad only because of laziness and indolence, I believe that they, like drones, damage their associates only by the cost of their keeping. But those who are poor companions in toil, and also extravagant and shameless in their desire for any advantage, these are likely also to lead others to what is vicious; for they are often able to demonstrate that vice does gain some advantage. And so we must weed out such men at any cost.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do not, however, endeavour to fill up their<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How to fill vacant places in the ranks</note> places in the ranks with your own countrymen only; but, just as in selecting a team you seek out not horses that are home-bred but those which are best, so also in the case of men, take them from all sources&mdash;whoever you think will be most likely to contribute to your strength and to your honour. And I have the following illustrations to prove the worth of my suggestion: a chariot would never go fast, I am sure, if slow horses were attached to it, nor would it be serviceable if horses unfit for service were harnessed to it; nor yet could a house be well managed if it employed vicious servants, but it would suffer less from having no servants at all than from being kept in confusion by incapable servants.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Let me assure you of this, too, my friends,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that the weeding out of the vicious will bring not only this advantage, that the vicious will be out of the way, but also among those who remain the ones that have already been infected with vice will be purged of it, while the virtuous seeing the vicious disgraced will cleave more eagerly to virtue.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With that he concluded; and all his friends agreed that what he said was true, and they began to act upon that principle.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After that <persName>Cyrus</persName> began again to jest with them;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The ugly favourit</note> for he had observed that one of the lieutenants had brought along as a guest and companion at table an exceedingly hairy and exceedingly ill-favoured man; and addressing the lieutenant by name he spoke as follows: &ldquo;Well, Sambaulas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so you also have adopted the Greek fashion, have you, and take about with you everywhere this youngster who is now beside you, because he is so handsome?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said Sambaulas; &ldquo;at all events I enjoy both his company and his looks.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When his messmates heard this, they looked at the man; and when they saw that his countenance was exceedingly ugly, they all laughed. And one of them said: &ldquo;In the name of the gods, Sambaulas, what has this fellow done to make such a hit with you?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By Zeus, fellows,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I will tell you. Every time that I have called him, whether by day or by night, he has never made any excuse saying that &lsquo;he had not time,&rsquo; nor has he answered my call slowly, but always on a run. And as often as I have bidden him do anything, I have never seen him perform it without sweat; and besides, by showing them not by precept but by example what sort of men they ought to be, he has made his whole squad of ten just like himself.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said one of the men, &ldquo;although he is such an excellent fellow, you don't kiss him as you do your relatives?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And the homely man answered this and said: &ldquo;No, by Zeus, for he is not fond of hard work; for if he wished to kiss me, that would be an ample substitute for all his drill-work.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Things of this sort, both grave and gay, were said and done at the dinner party. And finally when they had made the third libation<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Xenophon here introduces a Greek custom; the Persians poured no libations. But at the conclusion of a dinner, the Greeks poured three libations: the first, to the gods; the second, to the heroes; the third to Zeus, or to Hermes.</note> and prayed to the gods for their blessings, the party broke up, and they all went to bed. Then on the morrow, <persName>Cyrus</persName><note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The mass meeting</note> called all his soldiers together and spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Friends, the conflict is at hand; for the enemy are approaching. As for the prizes of victory, if we are victorious&mdash;and we must assume that we shall be and work to that end&mdash;it is evident that the enemy and all that is theirs will belong to us. But, on the other hand, if we are defeated&mdash;in this case, too, all the possessions of the vanquished are invariably the prizes set for the victors.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Accordingly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must realize that when men who are united as comrades in war are fully persuaded that nothing will come out as it should unless each individual man exerts himself, then many splendid achievements are speedily accomplished; for nothing that needs to be done is neglected. But when each one assumes that there will be some one else to do and to fight, even if he proves a weakling, let me assure you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that to such men, all alike, all that is grievous comes in a flood.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And God has ordained it in some such way as this: in the case of those who will not compel themselves to work out their own good, he assigns others to be their commanders. Now, therefore, let any one<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes rewards on the basis of merit</note> stand up and speak to this question before us, whether he thinks that valour would be more cultivated among us, if the one who will do and dare most is also to receive the greatest rewards, or if we know that it makes no difference whether a man be a coward or not, as we shall all share and share alike.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hereupon Chrysantas, one of the peers, a man<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chrysantas seconds the proposal</note> neither large nor powerful to look upon, but preminent in understanding, stood up and spoke: &ldquo;Well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think that you are introducing this discussion not because you think that the bad ought to have an equal share with the good, but because you wish to prove whether a single man will really be found who will care to let it be known that he thinks that, even if he himself does nothing good and noble, he should have an equal share of that which others win by their valour.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Now I,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;am neither fleet of foot nor strong of arm, and I know that in view of what I shall accomplish by my bodily strength I should not be judged either the first or the second, or even, I suppose, the thousandth, and perhaps not even the ten thousandth. But on this point I am perfectly clear, that if those who are powerful men take matters vigorously in hand, I shall have as large a share of any good fortune that may come as I deserve. But if the bad do nothing and the good and strong lose heart, I am afraid,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I shall have a larger share than I wish of something other than good.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus spoke Chrysantas. And after him<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Pheraulas adds his support</note> Pheraulas stood up, one of the Persian common ers, but a man who for some reason or other had from the beginning won <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s confidence and affection; besides he was well-favoured in body and a gentleman at heart. His speech was as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I think, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and all you Persians here assembled, that we are all now starting on an equal footing in a contest of merit; for I observe that we are all taking the same bodily exercise, that we all have the same rations, that we are all considered worthy to move in the same society, and that the prizes are offered alike to all. For obedience to the officers has been enjoined equally upon us all, and whoever shows himself prompt to comply, I observe that he receives honour from <persName>Cyrus</persName>. Again, to be brave in the face of the enemy is not a thing to be expected of one and not of another, but it is considered far the noblest thing for all alike.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we have been initiated into a method of fighting, which, I observe, all men naturally understand, just as in the case of other creatures each understands some method of fighting which it has not learned from any other source than from instinct: for instance, the bull knows how to fight with his horns, the horse with his hoofs, the dog with his teeth, the boar with his tusks. And all know how to protect themselves, too, against that from which they most need protection, and that, too, though they have never gone to school to any teacher.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for myself, I have understood from my very childhood how to protect the spot where I thought I was likely to receive a blow; and if I had nothing else I put out my hands to hinder as well as I could the one who was trying to hit me. And this I did not from having been taught to do so, but even though I was beaten for that very act of putting out my hands. Furthermore, even when I was a little fellow I used to seize a sword wherever I saw one, although, I declare, I had never learned, except from instinct, even how to take hold of a sword. At any rate, I used to do this, even though they tried to keep me from it&mdash;and certainly they did not teach me so to do&mdash;just as I was impelled by nature to do certain other things which my father and mother tried to keep me away from. And, by Zeus, I used to hack with a sword everything that I could without being caught at it. For this was not only instinctive, like walking and running, but I thought it was fun in addition to its being natural.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;since this method of fighting awaits us, which demands courage more than skill, why should we not gladly compete with the peers here? For the prizes proposed for excellence are equal, but we shall go into the trial not having at stake interests equal with theirs; for they have at stake a life of honour, which is the most happy of all, while we risk only a life of toil unhonoured, which I think is most burdensome.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And this, comrades, gives me the most courage for the competition with these gentlemen, that <persName>Cyrus</persName> is to be the judge; for he decides not with partiality, but (I swear it by the gods) I verily think that <persName>Cyrus</persName> loves no less than himself those whom he recognizes as valiant. At any rate, I observe that, whatever he has, he is much more pleased to give it to them than to keep it for himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And yet I know that these men pride themselves upon having been trained, as they say, to endure hunger and thirst and cold, but they do not know that in this we also have been trained by a better teacher than they have had; for in these branches there is no better teacher than necessity, which has given us exceedingly thorough instruction in them.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And they have been in training for hard labour by carrying weapons, which all men have so devised that they may be as easy as possible to bear; while we, on our part, have been obliged to walk and to run with heavy burdens, so that the carrying of arms now seems to me more like having wings than bearing a burden.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Let me inform you, therefore, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I, for one, shall not only enter this contest, but I shall also expect you to reward me according to my deserts, whatever I am, for better or worse. And you, my fellow-commoners,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I recommend you to enter with alacrity into the competition with these gentlemen in this sort of warfare; for now they have been trapped in a contest with commoners.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus Pheraulas spoke. And many others from both orders rose to speak in favour of the measure. They decided that each one should receive rewards according to his deserts, and that <persName>Cyrus</persName> should be the judge. Thus, then, the matter was satisfactorily settled.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And once <persName>Cyrus</persName> invited a captain and his whole<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A sham battle: cudgels <title>vs.</title> clods</note> company to dinner, because he had noticed him drawing up one half of the men of his company against the other half for a sham battle. Both sides had breastplates and on their left arms their shields; in the hands of the one side he placed stout cudgels, while he told the other side that they would have to pick up clods to throw.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when they had taken their stand thus equipped, he gave the order to begin battle. Then those on the one side threw their clods, and some struck the breastplates and shields, others also struck the thighs and greaves of their opponents. But when they came into close quarters, those who had the cudgels struck the others&mdash;some upon the thighs, others upon the arms, others upon the shins; and as still others stooped to pick up clods, the cudgels came down upon their necks and backs. And finally, when the cudgel-bearers had put their opponents to flight, they pursued them laying on the blows amid shouts of laughter and merriment. And then again, changing about, the other side took the cudgels with the same result to their oppononts, who in turn threw clods.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this <persName>Cyrus</persName> admired both the captain's cleverness and the men's obedience, and he was pleased to see that they were at the same time having their practice and enjoying themselves and also because that side was victorious which was armed after the fashion of the Persians. Pleased with this he invited them to dinner; and in his tent, observing some of them wearing bandages&mdash;one around his leg, another around his arm&mdash;he asked them what the matter was; and they answered that they had been hit with the clods.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And he inquired further, whether it had happened when they were close together or far apart. And they said it was when they were far apart. But when they came to close quarters, it was capital fun&mdash;so the cudgel-bearers said; but those who had been thoroughly drubbed with the cudgels cried out that it did not seem any fun to them to be beaten at close quarters, and at the same time they showed the marks of the cudgels on their arms and their necks and some also on their faces. And then, as was natural, they laughed at one another.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the following day the whole plain was full of men following their example; and if they had nothing more important to do, they indulged in this sport.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And once he saw another captain leading his<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Military drill made pleasant</note> company up from the river left about in single file and ordering when he thought it was proper, the second division and then the third and the fourth to advance to the front; and when the lieutenants were in a row in front, he ordered each division to march up in double file. Thus the sergeants came to stand on the front line. Again, when he thought proper, he ordered the divisions to line up four abreast; in this formation, then, the corporals in their turn came to stand four abreast in each division; and when they arrived at the doors of the tent, he commanded them to fall into single file again, and in this order he led the first division into the tent; the second he ordered to fall in line behind the first and follow, and, giving orders in like manner to the third and fourth, he led them inside. And when he had thus led them all in, he gave them their places at dinner in the order in which they came in. Pleased with him for his gentleness of discipline and for his painstaking, <persName>Cyrus</persName> invited this company also with its captain to dinner.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With another doubling up of ranks, they assume a front of sixteen men and a depth of six:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Finally in these groups of six each, they are led, single file, in to dinner.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now there was present another captain who had been invited to the dinner and he said: &ldquo;<persName>Cyrus</persName>, will you not invite my company to your tent? My company, too, does all this when we go to mess, and when the meal is finished the rear-guard leader of the last division leads that division out, keeping in the rear those whose place in the battle line is in front; then, next after them, the second rear-guard leader brings out the men of the second division, and the third and the fourth in like manner, in order that,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;they may also know how to withdraw, if ever it is necessary to retreat before the enemy. And when we take our places on the parade-ground, I take the lead, when we march toward the east, and the first division of the company goes first, the second in its proper order, and then the third and the fourth and the squads of ten and five in each division, until I give the order for some change of formation; then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when we march toward the west, the rear-guard leader and the rear-guard lead off first. Still, even so, they have to look to me for the commands, though I march last, so that they may get into the habit of obeying just the same whether they follow or whether they lead.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you always do that way?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as often as we go to dinner.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I will invite you, because you give your lines practice both in coming and in going, by night and by day, and also because you give your bodies exercise by marching about, and improve your minds by instruction. Since, therefore, you do all this doubly, it is only fair that I should furnish you a double feast also.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;at any rate not on the same day, unless you will furnish us with double stomachs as well.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus they brought that dinner to a close. And on the following day <persName>Cyrus</persName> invited that company, as he had promised, and again the next day. And when the others heard about it, they all followed, in the future, the example of that company.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Once when <persName>Cyrus</persName> was holding a general review<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">An embassy from <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName></note> and parade of all his men under arms, a messenger came from Cyaxares saying that an embassy had arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>. &ldquo;He therefore bids you come as soon as possible. Moreover,&rdquo; said the messenger, &ldquo;I am bringing you a very beautiful robe from Cyaxares; for he expressed the wish that you appear as brilliant and splendid as possible when you come, for the Indians will see how you approach him.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard this, he gave orders to the captain who was stationed first to take his stand at the head of the line, bringing up his company in single file and keeping himself to the right; he told him to transmit the same order to the second captain and to pass it on through all the lines. And they obeyed at once and passed the order on, and they all executed it promptly, and in a little while they were three hundred abreast on the front line, for that was the number of the captains, and a hundred men deep.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they had got into their places, he ordered them to follow as he himself should lead. And at once he led them off at a double quick step. But when he became aware that the street leading to the king's headquarters was too narrow to admit all his men with such a front, he ordered the first regiment in their present order to follow him, the second to fall in behind the first, and so on through them all, while he himself led on without stopping to rest, and the other regiments followed, each the one before it.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And he sent also two adjutants to the entrance of the street, to tell what was to be done, if any one did not understand. And when they arrived at Cyaxares's doors, he ordered the first captain to draw up his company twelve deep, while the sergeants were to take their places on the front line about the king's headquarters. He bade him transmit the same orders to the second captain, and so on to all the rest;
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and they proceeded to do so, while he presented<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> presents himself and his army</note> himself before Cyaxares in his Persian dress, which was not at all showy. When Cyaxares saw him, he was pleased at his promptness but displeased with the plainness of his dress and said: &ldquo;How is this, <persName>Cyrus</persName>? What do you mean by appearing thus before the Indians? Now I wished you to appear with as much magnificence as possible, for it would have been a mark of respect to me to have my sister's son appear in all possible grandeur.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Should I be showing you more respect, Cyaxares,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> made reply to this, &ldquo;if I arrayed myself in purple and adorned myself with bracelets and put on a necklace and at my leisure obeyed your orders, than I have in obeying you with such dispatch and accompanied by so large and so efficient an army? And I have come myself adorned with sweat and marks of haste to honour you and I present the others likewise obedient to you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> spoke, and Cyaxares recognizing that he was right summoned the Indians.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And when<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The audience</note> the Indians came in they said that the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> had sent them with orders to ask on what ground the Medes and the Assyrians had declared war. &ldquo;And he has ordered us,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;when we have heard your statement, to go also to the Assyrian and ask him the same question; and finally, he bade us say to both of you that the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> declared that when he was weighed the merits of the case, he will side with the party wronged.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Cyaxares made reply to this, &ldquo;let me tell you that we are not guilty of doing any wrong to the Assyrian; but go now, if you wish, and ask him what he has to say.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName>, who was present, asked Cyaxares, &ldquo;May I also tell them what I think?&rdquo; And Cyaxares bade him say on.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if Cyaxares has no objection, tell the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> that we propose, in case the Assyrian says he has been wronged by us, to choose the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> himself to be our arbitrator.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon hearing this, they went away.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And when they had gone out, <persName>Cyrus</persName> addressed Cyaxares as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Cyaxares, I came from home without very much<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> calls upon Cyaxares for funds</note> money of my own, and of what I had I have very little left. I have spent it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;upon my soldiers. Now you wonder, perhaps, how I have spent it upon them, when you are maintaining them; but I want you to know that it has gone for nothing else than rewards and entertainments, whenever I am pleased with any of my soldiers.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the case of all those whom one wishes to make efficient coadjutors in any enterprise of any sort whatsoever, it seems to me pleasanter to draw them on by kind words and kind services rather than by compulsion and force; but in the case of those whom one wishes to make enthusiastic followers in his plans of war, one must by all means try to capture them with kind words and kind offices. For those men who are to be trusty comrades, who will not envy their commander in his successes nor betray him in his adversity, must be his friends and not his enemies.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Accordingly, as I recognize this in advance, I think I need more money. However, it seems to me unreasonable for every one to be looking to you, who, I observe, are put to great expense; but I think that you and I should together lay plans that funds may never fail you. For if you have plenty, I am sure it would be possible for me to draw money whenever I needed it, especially if I should take it to spend for something that would be more to your advantage also.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now I remember hearing you say one day<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Armenian defection</note> recently that the Armenian king despises you now, because he has heard that the enemy are coming against you, and that therefore he is neither sending troops nor paying the tribute which is due.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;that is just what he is doing; and so, for my part, I am in doubt whether it is better to proceed against him and try to enforce allegiance or to let him alone for the present, for fear we bring him also upon us as an enemy, in addition to the others.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But his residences,&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;are they all in fortified places or are perhaps some of them in places easy of approach?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;His residences,&rdquo; answered Cyaxares, &ldquo;are in places not very well fortified; I did not fail to attend to that. However, there are mountains where he could take refuge and for a time be safe from falling into our hands himself, and where he could insure the safety of whatever he could have carried up there secretly, unless some one should occupy the approaches and hold him in siege, as my father did.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> then made answer, &ldquo;if you would give me as many horsemen as you think reasonable and send me there, I think that with the help of the gods I could make him send the troops and pay the tribute to you. And besides, I hope that he will be made a better friend to us than he now is.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I also have hopes,&rdquo; Cyaxares replied, &ldquo;that they would come to you sooner than to me; for I understand that some of his sons were among your companions in the chase; and so, perhaps, they would join you again. And if they should fall into your hands, everything would be accomplished as we wish.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;do you think it good policy to have this plan of ours kept a secret?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Cyaxares; &ldquo;for then some of them would be more likely to fall into our hands, and besides, if one were to attack them, they would be taken unprepared.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Listen then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;and see if you<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s scheme to entrap the Armenian</note> think there is anything in what I say. Now I have often hunted with all my forces near the boundary between your country and the Armenians, and have even gone there with some horsemen from among my companions here.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Cyaxares, &ldquo;if you were to do the same again, you would excite no suspicion; but if they should notice that your force was much larger than that with which you used to hunt, this would at once look suspicious.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;it is possible to devise a pretext that will be credited both here and also there, if some one bring them word that I wish to institute a great hunt; and horsemen I should ask of you openly.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;A very clever scheme!&rdquo; said Cyaxares; &ldquo;and I shall refuse to give you more than a reasonable number, on the ground that I wish to visit the outposts on the Assyrian border. And that will be no lie, for in reality,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do wish to go there and to make them as strong as possible. And when you have gone ahead with the forces you have and have already been hunting for two days, I will send you a sufficient number of the cavalry and infantry that are mustered with me, and you may take them and make an inroad at once. And I myself, with the rest of my forces, will try to be not far away from you, to make my appearance upon the scene, should occasion require it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon Cyaxares at once proceeded to get his cavalry and infantry together for visiting the outposts, and to send out wagon-loads of provisions on the road to the outposts. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> proceeded to offer sacrifice in behalf of his expedition, and at the same time he sent to Cyaxares and asked for some of his younger horsemen. But, although very many wished to go along, Cyaxares would not give him many.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now after Cyaxares with his forces of cavalry and infantry had already started off on the road to the outposts, <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s sacrifice turned out favourable for proceeding against the Armenian. Accordingly, he led his men out equipped as if for hunting.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as he proceeded on his way, in the very first field a hare started up. And an eagle flying up from the east<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ai)/sios</foreign> means, strictly speaking, &ldquo;auspicious,&rdquo; &ldquo;bringing (good) omens;&rdquo; and good omens came from the east, the home of light.</note> caught sight of the hare as it ran and swooping down struck it, seized it, and carried it up, then bore it away to a hill not far off and disposed of his prey at his pleasure. Then <persName>Cyrus</persName>, observing the omen, was delighted and did homage to Sovereign Zeus and said to those who were by: &ldquo;Our hunt, comrades, please God, will be successful.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they arrived at the frontier, he at once<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The hunt on the Armenian frontier</note> proceeded to hunt, as he used to do; and the most of his men, on foot and on horseback, were marching in a straight line before him, in order to start up the game as they approached. But the best of his foot and horse stood at intervals and lay in wait for what was started up, and pursued it in relays. And they took many boars, deer, antelope, and wild asses; for many wild asses breed in those regions even unto this day.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he stopped hunting, he marched up to the Armenian border and dined; and on the following day, he went up to the mountains toward which he was aiming and hunted again. And when again he stopped, he sat down to dinner; but when he saw the army from Cyaxares approaching, he sent to them secretly and bade them take their dinner at a distance of about two parasangs, for he foresaw that this also would contribute to the secrecy of his design; but he ordered their commander to come to him when they had finished their dinner. Then, after dinner, he called together his captains; and when they had come he addressed them as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My friends, the Armenian king formerly was<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> lays his real design before his captains</note> both an ally and a dependent of Cyaxares; but now since he has seen the enemy coming upon us, he is insolent and neither sends us his complement of soldiers nor pays his tribute. Now, therefore, he is the game we have come to catch, if we can. And here is the plan that I think we should pursue: do you, Chrysantas, when you<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His instructions to Chrysantas</note> have had as much rest as you reasonably need, take half of the Persians who are with us, and following the mountain road take possession of the heights to which they say he flees for refuge when anything alarms him. I will furnish you with guides.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now they say that these mountains are thickly wooded, and so I have hopes of your not being seen. Nevertheless, suppose you send ahead of your army some active men, in the guise of brigands both as to numbers and accountrements; these, if they met any Armenians, would capture them and so prevent their spreading any reports; or, if they failed to capture them, they would frighten them away and so prevent their seeing the whole of your army, and would thus cause them to take precautions as against only a band of thieves.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Do you, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do this; but I, at break of day, with half the infantry and all the cavalry, will proceed through the plain straight toward the capital. And if he resists, we shall have to fight, of course; and if he abandons the field, of course we shall have to chase him; but if he flees to the mountain, then it is your business not to let any one of those who come your way escape.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And bear in mind that, just as in hunting, we shall be the ones beating out the game, you the man in charge of the nets. Remember this, then, that the runs must be blocked before the game starts; and those at the entrance to those runs must keep out of sight, if they are not to turn the animals aside as they come on.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>However,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;do not in this case do as you sometimes do, Chrysantas, in your fondness for hunting: you often keep yourself busy all night without sleeping; but now you should let your men rest long enough, so that they may be able to resist drowsiness.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Again, do not, because you personally are accustomed to wander up and down the mountains without following human guides but running after the game wherever it leads you&mdash;do not now go into such dangerous and difficult places, but order your guides to lead you by the easiest road, unless it is much too long; for the easiest road is the shortest for an army.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And do not lead your men at a run because you are used to running up mountains, but lead with moderate haste, that your army may be able to follow you easily.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>And it is a good thing for some of the strongest and most zealous to fall back sometimes and encourage the rest; and when the column has passed by them, it is an incentive to all to hasten when these are seen running past them as they walk.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On hearing this, Chrysantas was elated with his commission from <persName>Cyrus</persName>; he took his guides and went away, and after giving what orders he thought necessary to those who were to go with him he went to rest. And when they had slept as long as he thought reasonable, he started for the mountains.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when it was day, <persName>Cyrus</persName> sent forward a<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s ultimatum</note> messenger to the Armenian with instructions to speak to him as follows: &ldquo;&lsquo;King of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, <persName>Cyrus</persName> bids you take steps as quickly as possible to deliver to him the tribute and the troops.&rsquo; And if he asks where I am, tell the truth and say that I am at the frontier. And if he asks whether I also am coming in person, tell the truth in that case also and say that you do not know. But if he inquires how many men we are, bid him send some one along with you and find out.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With such instructions he sent the messenger off, for he thought that this was a more friendly course than to march upon him without notice. And he himself set out with his army in the formation which he thought best adapted both for covering distance and for fighting if necessary. He ordered his soldiers to molest no one, and, if any one met any Armenians, to bid them have no fear but to say that if any one of them wished to sell food or drink, he should feel free to bring it wherever they were and open a market.</p></div1>
<div1 type="Book" n="3"><p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> was thus employed; but when the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Armenians hear of <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s approach</note> Armenian king heard from the envoy the message of <persName>Cyrus</persName>, he was alarmed, for he knew that he was doing wrong in witholding the tribute due and in failing to send the troops, and he was afraid most of all because he saw that he was sure to be detected in the act of beginning to build his palace in such a way as to render it strong enough for armed resistance.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Disturbed by the consciousness of all these faults, he sent around and collected his forces, and at the same time he sent away to the mountains his younger son, Sabaris, and the women, both his queen and his son's wife, and his daughters. And he sent along with them his most valuable jewels and chattels and gave them an escort. At the same time he sent scouts to spy out what <persName>Cyrus</persName> was doing, while he went on assigning positions in his service to the Armenians as they came in to him. Presently still others arrived with the news that the man himself was quite near.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then he no longer had the courage to join battle with him but retreated. When the Armenians saw him act thus, they dispersed at once, each to his own possessions, wishing to get their belongings out of the way.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw the plain full of men running about and driving away, he sent secretly to say that he had no quarrel with any who remained; but he declared that if he caught any one trying to get away, he should treat him as an enemy. Accordingly, the most of them remained, but some retreated with the king.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now as those with the women in charge went<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chrysantas captures the train of fugitives</note> forward they came upon the forces in the mountain. At once they raised a cry and as they tried to escape many of them were caught. And finally the young prince and the wives and daughters were captured and all the treasure that happened to be in the train.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the king himself learned what was going on, he was in a quandary which way to turn and took refuge upon a certain hill.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king entrapped</note> this he surrounded the hill with the troops he had with him and sent orders to Chrysantas to leave a guard upon the mountains and come. Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army was being brought together.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he sent a herald to the Armenian to ask him the following question: &ldquo;Tell me, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether you prefer to remain there and fight against hunger and thirst, or to come down into the plain and fight it out with us?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Armenian answered that he had no wish to fight against either.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Again <persName>Cyrus</persName> sent to him and asked: &ldquo;Why then do you sit there and refuse to come down?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am in a quandary what to do.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;there is no occasion whatever for that; for you are free to come down for trial.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And who,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will be my judge?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;He, to be sure, to whom God has given the power to deal with you as he will, even without a trial.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the Armenian, recognizing the exigency of his case, came down. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> received both the king and all that belonged to him into the midst and set his camp round them, for by this time he had all his forces together.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now at this juncture Tigranes, the king's elder son, returned from a journey abroad. He it was who had been <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s companion once on a hunt; and when he heard what had occurred, he came at once, just as he was, to <persName>Cyrus</persName>. And when he saw his father and mother and brothers and sisters and his own wife all made prisoners, he wept, as might be expected.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But <persName>Cyrus</persName>, when he looked upon him, showed him no token of friendship, but merely remarked: &ldquo;You have come just in time to attend your father's trial.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And immediately he called together the officers of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The court martial of the king</note> both the Medes and the Persians and all the Armenian nobles who were present. And the women who were there in their carriages he did not exclude but permitted them to attend.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When everything was in order, he began his examination: &ldquo;King of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I advise you in the first place in this trial to tell the truth, that you may be guiltless of that offence which is hated more cordially than any other. For let me assure you that being caught in a barefaced lie stands most seriously in the way of a man's receiving any mercy. In the next place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your children and your wives here and also the Armenians present are cognizant of everything that you have done; and if they hear you telling anything else than the facts, they will think that you are actually condemning your own self to suffer the extreme penalty, if ever I discover the truth.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ask what you will, and be assured that I will tell the truth, let happen what will as a result of it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;did you ever have a war with Astyages, my mother's father, and with the rest of the Medes?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And when you were conquered by him, did you agree to pay tribute and to join his army, wherever he should command you to go, and to own no forts?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Those are the facts.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, then, have you now failed to pay the tribute and to send the troops, and why have you been building forts?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I longed for liberty; for it seemed to me to be a glorious thing both to be free myself and to bequeath liberty to my children.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;it is a noble thing to fight that one may never be in danger of becoming a slave. But if any one has been conquered in war or in any other way reduced to servitude and is then caught attempting to rob his masters of himself, are you the first man to reward him as an honest man and one who does right, or do you punish him as a malefactor if you catch him?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I punish him,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for you will not let me<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king convicts himself</note> tell a lie.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Answer each of these questions explicitly then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;if any one happens to be an officer under you and does wrong, do you permit him to continue in office or do you put another in his place?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I put another in his place.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And what if he has great possessions&mdash;do you allow him to continue rich, or do you make him poor?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I confiscate all that he may happen to possess,&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And if you find out that he is trying to desert to the enemy, what do you do?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I put him to death,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I may as well confess, for why should I convict myself of lying and be put him to death for that, instead of telling the truth?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then his son, when he heard this, stripped off his turban and rent his garments, and the women cried aloud and tore their cheeks, as if it were all over with their father and they were already lost. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> bade them be silent and said: &ldquo;Very well, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>; so that is your idea of justice; in accordance with it, then, what do you advise us to do?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the Armenian was silent, for he was in a quandary whether to advise <persName>Cyrus</persName> to put him to death or to propose to him a course opposite to that which he admitted he himself always took.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Tigranes pleads his father's case</note> his son Tigranes put a question to <persName>Cyrus</persName>, saying: &ldquo;Tell me, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, since my father seems to be in doubt, may I advise you in regard to him what I think the best course for you?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now <persName>Cyrus</persName> had observed when Tigranes used to go hunting with him that there was a certain philosopher with him who was an object of admiration to Tigranes; consequently he was very eager to hear what he would say.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tigranes, &ldquo;if you approve either of my father's theory or his practice, then I advise you by all means to imitate him.

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, but you would be doing yourself a great injury,&rdquo; said Tigranes, &ldquo;if you should put your friends to death just at the time when it was of the greatest advantage to you to have them.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;could men be of the greatest advantage to me just at the time when they were caught doing wrong?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;They would be, I think, if at that time they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The acquisition of discretion</note> should become discreet.

But every friend is useful and every servant good, if he be endowed with discretion.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you mean to say, then,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered, &ldquo;that in one day's time your father has become discreet when he was indiscreet before?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do, indeed.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By that you mean to say that discretion is an affection of the soul, as sorrow is, and not an acquisition.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Xenophon makes <persName>Cyrus</persName> apparently accept the Socratic doctrine that wisdom and the other virtues are matters for learning, the results of study and practice&mdash;not a mood, like sorrow, anger, or any other emotion.</note> For I do not suppose that a man could instantly pass from being indiscreet to being discreet, if indeed the one who is to be discreet must first have become wise.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What, have you never observed, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that when a man indiscreetly ventures to fight a stronger man than himself and has been worsted, he is instantly cured of his indiscretion toward that particular man? And again,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;have you never seen how when one state is in arms against another it is at once willing, when defeated, to submit to the victor instead of continuing the fight?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;To what defeat of your father's do you refer,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;that you are so confident that he has been brought to discretion by it?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why that, by Zeus,&rdquo; Tigranes answered, &ldquo;which<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How the king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName> learned discretion</note> he is conscious of having sustained, inasmuch as when he aimed at securing liberty he has become more of a slave than ever, and as he has not been able to accomplish a single thing of all that he thought he should effect by secrecy or by surprise or by actual force. And he knows that when you desired to outwit him, you did it as effectually as one could do who set out to deceive men blind or deaf or deprived of all their senses; and when you thought you ought to act secretly, you acted with such secrecy that the fortified places which he thought he had provided for his own safety you had secretly turned into prisons for him in advance. And so much did you surpass him in dispatch, that you came from a distance with a large army before he could muster the forces he had at home.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;do you really think that such a defeat is adequate to make men discreet&mdash;I mean, when they find out that others are their superiors?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tigranes, &ldquo;much more than when they are defeated in combat. For the one who is overcome by strength sometimes conceives the idea that, if he trains his body, he may renew the combat. Even cities too, when captured, think that by taking on new allies they might renew the fight. But if people are convinced that others are superior to themselves, they are often ready even without compulsion to submit to them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You seem to think,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;that the insolent do not recognize those more discreet than they, that thieves do not recognize the truthful, and wrong-doers those who do right. Do you not know,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that even now your father has played false and has not kept his agreement with us, although he knew that we have not been violating any of the agreements made by Astyages?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes; but neither do I mean that simply recognizing their superiors makes people discreet, unless they are punished by those superiors, as my father now is.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;your father has not yet suffered the least harm; but he is afraid, to be sure, that he will suffer the worst.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you think, then,&rdquo; said Tigranes, &ldquo;that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Fear of harm worse than the reality</note> anything breaks a man's spirit sooner than object fear? Do you not know that those who are beaten with the sword, which is considered the most potent instrument of correction, are nevertheless ready to fight the same enemy again; but when people really fear anyone very much, then they cannot look him in the face, even when he tries to cheer them?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You mean to say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that fear is a heavier punishment to men than real correction.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;know that what I say is true; for you are aware that, on the one hand, those who are afraid that they are to be exiled from their native land, and those who on the eve of battle are afraid that they shall be defeated, and those who fear slavery or bondage, all such can neither eat nor sleep for fear; whereas those who are already in exile or already defeated or already in slavery can sometimes eat and sleep better than those enjoying a happier lot.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And from the following considerations it is still clearer what a burden fear is: some, for fear that they will be caught and put to death, in terror take their own lives before their time&mdash;some by hurling themselves over a precipice, other by hanging themselves, others by cutting their own throats; so does fear crush down the soul more than all other terrors. As for my father,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;in what a state of mind do you think he is? For he is in dread not only for himself, but also for me, for his wife, and for all of his children.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;it is not at all unlikely, I suppose, that he is for the moment in such a state of mind. However, it seems to me that we expect of a man who is insolent in success and abject in failure that, when set on his feet once more, he will again wax arrogant and again cause more trouble.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, by Zeus, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our wrong-doing<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Tigranes discusses plans for adjustment</note> does, no doubt, give you cause to distrust us; but you may build forts in our country and occupy the strongholds already built and take whatever else you wish as security. And yet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you will not find us very much aggrieved by your doing so; for we shall remember that we are to blame for it all. But if you hand over our government to some one of those who have done no wrong and yet show that you distrust them, see to it lest they regard you as no friend, in spite of your favours to them. But if again, on your guard against incurring their hatred, you fail to place a check upon them to keep them from rebellion, see to it lest you need to bring them to discretion even more than you did in our case just now.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Nay, by the gods,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do not think I should like to employ servants that I knew served me only from compulsion. But if I had servants who I thought assisted me, as in duty bound, out of goodwill and friendship toward me, I think I should be better satisfied with them when they did wrong than with others who disliked me, when they performed all their tasks faithfully but from compulsion.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To this Tigranes replied: &ldquo;From whom could you ever get such friendship as you now can from us?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;From those, I presume,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who have never been my enemies, if I would do them such favours as you now bid me do you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as things now are,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He argues for the continuance of his father's reign</note> could you find any one to whom you could do as great favours as you can to my father? For example, if you grant any one of those who have done you no wrong his life, what gratitude do you think he will feel toward you for that? And again, who will love you for not depriving him of his wife and children more than he who thinks that it would serve him right to lose them? And do you know of any one who would be more grieved than we, not to have the throne of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>? Well, then,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it is evident that he who would be most grieved not to be king, would also be most grateful for receiving the throne.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And it you care at all to leave matters here in as little confusion as possible when you go away, consider whether you think the country would be more tranquil under the beginning of a new administration than if the one we are used to should continue. And if you care to take with you as large an army as possible, who do you think would be in a better position to organize the troops properly than he who has often employed them? And if you need money also, who do you think could supply it better than he who knows and commands all the sources of supply? My good <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;beware lest in casting us aside you do yourself a greater injury than any harm my father has been able to do you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> was more than pleased at hearing him, for he thought that everything that he had promised Cyaxares to do was in course of accomplishment; for he remembered having told him that he would make the Armenian more his friend than he was before.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,&rdquo; he therefore asked,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> takes a conciliatory attitude</note> &ldquo;if I yield to you in this matter, how large an army will you send with me and how much money will you contribute to the war?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I have nothing to propose more simple or more fair, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; the Armenian replied to this, &ldquo;than for me to show you all the forces I have and for you, when you have seen them, to take as many as you see fit, leaving the rest here to protect the country. And in the same way in regard to the money, it is proper for me to show you all that I have, and for you to decide for yourself and take as much as you please and to leave as much as you please.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;tell me how large your forces are and how much money you have.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Armenian then answered, &ldquo;there are about eight thousand cavalry and about forty thousand infantry. And the property,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;including the treasures that my father left me, amounts, when reduced to cash, to more than three thousand talents.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And without hesitation, <persName>Cyrus</persName> replied: &ldquo;Send<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His demands</note> with me then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;only half the army, since your neighbours, the Chaldaeans, are at war with you. And of the money, instead of the fifty talents which you used to pay as tribute, pay Cyaxares double that sum because you are in arrears with your payments. And lend me personally a hundred more,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and I promise you that if God prospers me, I will in return for your loan either do you other favours worth more than that amount or at least pay you back the money, if I can; but if I cannot, I may seem insolvent, I suppose, but I should not justly be accounted dishonest.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;For heaven's sake, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;do not talk that way. If you do, you will make me lose heart. But consider,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that what you leave here is no less yours than what you take away.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;now how much money would you give to get your wife back?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As much as I could,&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And how much to get your children?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;For these also,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as much as I could.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;that makes already twice as much as you have.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>And you, Tigranes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell me how much you would pay to get your wife back?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it happened that he was newly married and loved his wife very dearly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I would give my life, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to keep her from slavery.&rdquo;
    <milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take her back; she is<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His generosity</note> your own. For I, for my part, do not consider that she has been made a prisoner of war at all, since you never ran away from us. And you too, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, may take back your wife and children without paying any ransom for them, that they may know that they return to you free men and women. And now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;stay and have dinner with us; and when you have dined you may drive away wherever you have a mind to go.&rdquo; So they stayed.
    <milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And after dinner, as the party was breaking up,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName></note> <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked: &ldquo;Tell me, Tigranes, where is the man who used to hunt with us? You seemed to admire him very much.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;did not my father here have him put to death?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What wrong did he find him doing?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;He said that he was corrupting me. And yet, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he was so noble and so good that when he was about to be put to death, he called me to him and said: &lsquo;Be not angry with your father, Tigranes, for putting me to death; for he does it, not from any spirit of malice, but from ignorance, and when men do wrong from ignorance, I believe they do it quite against their will.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Poor man!&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> exclaimed on hearing this.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here the Armenian king interrupted: &ldquo;Do not men who discover strangers in intercourse with their wives kill them, not on the ground that they make their wives more inclined to folly, but in the belief that they alienate from them their wives' affections&mdash;for this reason they treat them as enemies. So I was jealous of him because I thought that he made my son regard him more highly than he did me.&rdquo;
    <milestone unit="section" n="40"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, by the gods, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;your sin seems human; and you, Tigranes, must forgive your father.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then when they had thus conversed and showed their friendly feelings toward one another, as was natural after a reconciliation, they entered their carriages and drove away with their wives, happy.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they got home they talked, one of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Armenian appreciation of <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s wisdom, another of his strength, another of his gentleness, and still another of his beauty and his commanding presence.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Tigranes asked his wife: &ldquo;Tell me, my Armenian princess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did you, too, think <persName>Cyrus</persName> handsome?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, by Zeus,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I did not look at him.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;At whom, then?&rdquo; asked Tigranes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;At him, by Zeus, who said that he would give his life to keep me from servitude.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then as might be expected after such experiences, they went to rest together.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And on the following day the Armenian king sent guest-presents to <persName>Cyrus</persName> and all his army, and he commanded those of his men who were to take the field to present themselves on the third day; and he paid <persName>Cyrus</persName> double the sum of money that he had named. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> accepted only the amount specified and returned the rest. Then he asked which of the two was to go in command of the forces, the king himself or his son. They both answered at the same instant, the father saying: &ldquo;Whichever you command&rdquo;; and the son: &ldquo;I will never leave you,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Tigranes joins <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army</note> <persName>Cyrus</persName>, not even if I have to accompany you as a camp-follower.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName>, laughing, said: &ldquo;How much would you take to have your wife told that you were a camp-follower?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she will not need to be told anything about it; for I shall take her with me, so that she will be in a position to see whatever I do.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it may be high time for you to be getting your things together.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Be sure,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we shall be here with everything brought together that my father gives us.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the soldiers had received their presents they went to bed.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the morrow <persName>Cyrus</persName> took with him Tigranes,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Preparations for the conquest of Chaldaea</note> the best of the Median horsemen, and as many of his own friends as he thought proper, and rode around to inspect the country with a view to finding a place in which to build a fort. And when he had come to a certain eminence he asked Tigranes which were the mountains from which the Chaldaeans were accustomed to descend to make forays into the country. And Tigranes pointed them out. And again he asked: &ldquo;And are these mountains now unoccupied?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but they always have scouts up there who signal to the rest whatever they see.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what do they do, when they receive the signals?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;They run out to the heights to help,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;each as best he can.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the account to which <persName>Cyrus</persName> listened; and as he looked he observed that a large portion of the Armenians' country was deserted and uncultivated as a result of the war. And then they went back to camp and after they had dined they went to rest.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the following day Tigranes presented himself with his baggage all ready for the start; and under his command were assembled about four thousand horsemen and about ten thousand bowmen and as many peltasts besides.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While they had been coming together, <persName>Cyrus</persName> had been sacrificing; and when his sacrifice gave favourable omens, he called a meeting of the officers of the Persians and of the Medes;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and when they were come together, he spoke as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My friends, these mountains which we see belong to Chaldaea; but if we should seize them and have a fort of our own built upon the summit, both parties&mdash;the Armenians, I mean, and the Chaldaeans&mdash;would have to behave with discretion toward us. Now, the sacrifices give us favourable omens; but, for the execution of our plan, nothing would be so strong an ally to human zeal as dispatch. For if we get up there before the enemy have time to come together, we may gain possession of the heights altogether without a battle, or we may at least find enemies few in number and without strength.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Of the tasks before us, therefore, none is<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He hurls his army into the Chaldaean mountains</note> easier or less fraught with danger,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;than now bravely to endure the strain of haste. Therefore, to arms! And....<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You, Medes, march on our left; and you, Armenians, half keep to our right and half lead on in front; while you, cavalrymen, shall follow behind, to encourage and push us on upward; and if any one is inclined to show weakness, do not allow it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With this command <persName>Cyrus</persName> brought his companies to ploy into column and took his place at their head. And when the Chaldaeans realized that the movement was directed toward the heights, they immediately gave the signal to their people, called to one another to assemble, and began to come together.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave command: &ldquo;Fellow-Persians, they are signalling us to hasten; for if we get up there first, the enemy's efforts will be of no avail.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the Chaldaeans carried each a wicker shield and two spears, and they were said to be the most warlike of the peoples in that region. They also serve for hire when any one wants them, for they are fond of war and poor of purse; for their country is mountainous and only a small part of it is productive.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his men were getting<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The battle</note> nearer to the heights, Tigranes, who was marching with <persName>Cyrus</persName>, said: &ldquo;Do you know, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that we ourselves shall have to do the fighting, and in a very few moments? For the Armenians, I am sure, will never sustain the enemy's attack.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> answered that he knew that and gave the command to the Persians to make ready, as it would be necessary in a moment to give chase, as soon as the Armenians by pretending flight should decoy the enemy into close quarters.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So the Armenians led on. And when they came near, the Chaldaeans already there raised the battle cry, according to their custom, and charged upon them. And the Armenians, according to their custom, failed to sustain the charge.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>But when the Chaldaeans in pursuit saw before them the swordsmen rushing up against them, some came near and were cut down at once, others fled, and some others of their number were taken prisoners; and soon the heights were taken. And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his men were in possession of the heights, they looked down on the dwellings of the Chaldaeans and saw the people fleeing from their homes near by.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then when the soldiers were all together, <persName>Cyrus</persName> bade his men take luncheon; and when they had lunched and he had discovered that the place where the scouts had their posts of observation was strong and well supplied with water, he at once proceeded to build a fort there. He also bade Tigranes send for his father and bid him come with all the carpenters and masons that he had. So a messenger was off to bring the Armenian king, but <persName>Cyrus</persName> proceeded to build the wall with the men he had at hand.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this juncture they brought to <persName>Cyrus</persName> the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He releases the prisoners</note> prisoners in chains and also some that had been wounded. And when he saw them he at once ordered that the fetters be taken off, and he sent for surgeons and bade them attend to the wounded men. And then he told the Chaldaeans that he had come with no wish to destroy them and with no desire to make war, but because he wished to make peace between the Armenians and the Chaldaeans.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now I know that before the heights were taken you had no wish at all for peace, for everything of yours was secure, while you carried off and plundered the property of the Armenians; but now see in what a predicament you are!
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I am going to let you who have been captured go home and consult with the rest of the Chaldaeans whether you wish to have war with us or to be our friends. And if you choose war, do not come this way again without weapons, if you are wise; but if you decide that you desire peace, come without arms. I shall see to it that you have no cause to complain, if you become our friends.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the Chaldaeans heard this, they commended <persName>Cyrus</persName> highly, shook hands with him heartily, and departed for home.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, when the king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName> received <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s summons and heard of his plans, he came to <persName>Cyrus</persName> as quickly as he could with the carpenters and all that he thought was necessary.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And when he saw <persName>Cyrus</persName>, he said: &ldquo;How little of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Armenian king expresses his gratification</note> the future, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, we mortals can foresee, and yet how much we try to accomplish. Why, just now, when I was striving to secure liberty, I became more a slave than ever before; and when we were taken prisoners, we then thought our destruction certain, but we now find that we are saved as never before. For those who never ceased to do us no end of injury I now behold in just the condition that I desired.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And believe me, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when I say that to have driven the Chaldaeans from these heights I would have given many times as much money as you now have from me; and the benefit that you promised to do us, when you received the money, you have already conferred so fully that we obviously now owe you a new debt of gratitude besides; and we on our part, if we have not lost all self-respect, should be ashamed if we did not repay it to you.'
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus the Armenian king spoke.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the Chaldaeans had come back with the request that <persName>Cyrus</persName> should make peace with them. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked them: &ldquo;Is this the reason that you, Chaldaeans, now desire peace, because you think, that since we are in possession of these heights, you could live in greater security if we had peace than if we were at war?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Chaldaeans assented.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if still other blessings should accrue to you as a result of the proposed peace?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;We should be still more pleased,&rdquo; they answered.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you think that you are now poor for any other reason than because you have so little fertile land?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this also they agreed with him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;would you avail yourselves of the permission to till as much Armenian land as you wish on condition that you paid in full just as much rental as other tenants in <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName> do?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Chaldaeans, &ldquo;if we could be sure of not being molested.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me, King of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would you be willing that that land of yours which now lies uncultivated should be cultivated, if those who cultivate it would pay you the usual rental?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Armenian answered that he would give a great deal to have it so; for in this way his revenues would be greatly increased.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And tell me, Chaldaeans,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;seeing that you have fine mountains, would you be willing to let the Armenians pasture their herds there, if the herdsmen would pay you what is fair?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Chaldaeans said they would; for they would get large profits by it, without any labour on their own part.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you, King of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would you be willing to rent their pasture lands, if by letting the Chaldaeans have a little profit you were to get much greater profit for yourself?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I thought I could pasture my cattle there in security.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;could you pasture them there in security, if the heights were in the possession of your friends?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Armenian.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, by Zeus,&rdquo; said the Chaldaeans, &ldquo;we could not even work our own farms in security, to say nothing of theirs, if they were to have possession of the heights.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;suppose on the other hand that the heights were in the possession of your friends?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;we should be all right.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, by Zeus,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;we, on our part, should not be all right, if they are again to get possession of the heights, especially now that they have been fortified.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;This then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;is what I shall<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> guarantees peace between them</note> do: I shall not give possession of the heights to either of you, but we shall keep a garrison there ourselves; and if either of you does wrong, we shall side with the injured party.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they heard this proposal, both sides gave it their approval and said that only in this way could the peace be effective; and upon these conditions they interchanged assurances of friendship, and agreed that each party should be independent of the other, that there should be the right of intermarriage and of mutual tillage and pasturage in each other's territory, and that there should be a defensive alliance, in case any one should injure either party.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such, then, was the agreement entered into at that time; and to this day the covenants which were then made between the Chaldaeans and the king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName> still continue in force. And when the treaty was made, they both together began with enthusiasm at once to build the fort for their common protection, and then together they stocked it with provisions.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When evening was drawing on, he entertained both sides, now made friends, as his guests at dinner. And while the party was in progress, one of the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chaldaean mercenaries</note> Chaldaeans said that to all the rest of them this state of affairs was desirable; but there were some of the Chaldaeans, so they said, who lived by plundering and would not know how to farm and could not, for they were used to making their living by the business of war; for they were always making raids or serving as mercenaries; they were often in the service of the Indian king (and he paid well, they said, for he was a very wealthy man) and often in the service of Astyages.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then why do they not enter my service now?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;I will pay as much as any one ever did.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They assented and said that the volunteers would be many.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These terms were thus agreed upon; and<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes an embassy to <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName></note> when <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard that the Chaldaeans made frequent trips to the Indian king, remembering that representatives from him had once come to Media to investigate conditions there and had then visited the enemy to inquire into theirs also, he wished to have him learn what he had done.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>Accordingly, he began to speak as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;King of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you Chaldaeans, tell me&mdash;if I should now send one of my men to the Indian king, would you send along some of yours to conduct him on the way and to co-operate with him in getting what I want from the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>? Now I should like to have more money, in order to be in a position both to pay generous wages when I ought, and to honour with rewards those of my fellow-soldiers who deserve it; and the reason why I wish to have a generous a supply of money as possible is that I expect to need it, and I shall be glad to spare yours; for I now count you among my friends; but from the Indian king I should be glad to accept a contribution, if he would offer it.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now, when the messenger, to whom I am asking you to furnish guides and co-workers, arrives there, he will speak on this wise: &lsquo;King of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, <persName>Cyrus</persName> has sent me to you; he says that he needs more funds, for he is expecting another army from his home in Persia&rsquo;&mdash;and that is true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I am expecting one&mdash;&lsquo;if, therefore, you will send him as much as you conveniently can, he says that if God will give him good success, he will try to make you think that you were well advised in doing him this favour.'
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This my envoy will say; do you now, in your turn, give your representatives such instructions as you think expedient for you. And if we get anything thing from him, we shall have more abundant funds to use; and if we do not, we shall know that we owe him no thanks, but may, as far as he is concerned, settle everything with a view to our own interests.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> spoke; and he believed that those of the Armenians and Chaldaeans who were to go would say such things of him as he desired all men to say and to hear of him. And then, when it was time, the banquet came to an end, and they went to rest.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the following day <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave the envoy the commission of which he had spoken and sent him on his way; and the Armenian king and the Chaldeans sent along those who they thought would be most competent to co-operate and to say what was appropriate concerning <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he manned the fort with a competent garrison,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s departure from <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName></note> supplied it with all things necessary, and left in command a Mede who he thought would be most acceptable to Cyaxares; and then he departed, taking with him not only the army which he had brought with him but also the reinforcements that he had received from the Armenians, and about four thousand Chaldaeans, who considered themselves actually better than all the rest put together.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he came down into the inhabited part of the country, not one of the Armenians remained indoors, but all, both men and women, in their joy at the restoration of peace, came forth to meet him, each one carrying or bringing whatever he had of value. And their king did not disapprove, for he thought that <persName>Cyrus</persName> would thus be all the better pleased at receiving honour from all. And finally also the queen with her daughters and her younger son came up to him bringing not only the money which before <persName>Cyrus</persName> had refused to take, but other gifts as well.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he saw it <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;You shall not make me go about doing good for pay! No, good queen; take back home with you this money which you bring; and do not give it to the king again to bury, but with it get your son as fine an outfit as possible and send him to the army; and with what is left get both for yourself and your husband, your daughters and your sons, anything the possession of which will enable you to adorn yourselves more handsomely and spend your days more happily. But let it suffice,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to bury in the earth only our bodies, when the end shall come to each.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke and rode past her. And the king of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName> escorted him on his way, as did all the rest of the people, proclaiming him again and again their benefactor, their valiant hero. And this they continued to do until he had quitted their borders. And as there was now peace at home, the king increased the contingent of troops that he sent with him.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> departed, not only enriched with the ready money that he had received, but also having secured by his conduct far larger funds in reserve, to draw upon in time of need.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That night he encamped upon the frontier, and the next day he sent the army and the money to Cyaxares; for he was near by, as he had promised to be. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself went hunting with Tigranes and the best of his Persians, wherever they came across game, and he was delighted with the sport.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when he came back to Media he gave to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Rewards for the meritorious</note> each of his captains as much of the money as he thought sufficient, so that they in turn might be able to reward any of the men under them with whose conduct they were pleased; for he thought that if each one made his division worthy of commendation, he would find the whole army in fine condition. And whenever he himself saw anywhere anything calculated to improve his army, he always procured it and distributed it in presents from time to time among the most deserving; for he thought that everything that his army had that was beautiful and fine was an adornment to himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he was about to distribute a portion of what he had received, he took his place in the midst of the captains, lieutenants, and all whom he was about to reward, and spoke to this effect: &ldquo;My friends, there seems now to be a kind of gladness in our hearts, both because some degree of prosperity has come to us and because we have the means of rewarding those whom we will and of receiving rewards, each according to his deserts.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But let us be sure to remember to what kind of conduct these blessings are due; for if you will consider, you will find that it is this&mdash;watching when occasion demanded, undergoing toil, making due haste, and never yielding to the enemy. Accordingly, we must in future also be brave men, knowing that obedience, perseverance, and the endurance of toil and danger at the critical time bring the great pleasures and the great blessings.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> now saw that his soldiers were in good<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> thinks of invading the enemy's country</note> physical condition to endure the fatigue of military service, that their hearts were disposed to regard the enemy with contempt, that they were skilled each in the exercise adapted to his kind of armour, and that they were all well disciplined to obey the officers; accordingly, he was eager to undertake some move against the enemy at once, for he knew that generals often find some even of their best laid plans brought to naught through delay.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And he further observed that, because they were so eager to excel in those exercises in which they vied with one another, many of the soldiers were even jealous of one another; for this reason also he wished to lead them into the enemy's country as soon as possible. For he knew that common dangers make comrades kindly disposed toward one another, and that in the midst of such dangers there is no jealousy of those who wear decorations on their armour or of those who are striving for glory; on the contrary, soldiers praise and love their fellows even more, because they recognize in them co-workers for the common good.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, he first completely armed his<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He rouses his army to take the offensive</note> forces and marshalled them in the best and most imposing order possible; then he called together the generals, colonels, captains, and lieutenants; for these had been exempted from enrolment in the lines of the regular battalions; and even when it was necessary for any of them to report to the commander-in-chief or to transmit any order, no part of the army was left without a commanding officer, for the sergeants and corporals kept in proper order the divisions from which the superior officers had gone.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the staff-officers<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">oi( e)pikai/rioi</foreign> are literally &ldquo;the most timely,&rdquo; &ldquo;the most important,&rdquo; &ldquo;the chief officers.&rdquo; It is consistently rendered by &ldquo;staff-officers&rdquo; in this translation, though the word may be applied to all who are in authority, whether military or civil.</note> had come together, he conducted them along the ranks, showed them in what good order everything was and pointed out to them the special strength of each contingent of the auxiliaries. And when he had filled them with an eager desire for immediate action, he bade them them go to their own several divisions and tell their men what he had told them and try to inspire in them all a desire to begin the campaign, for he wished them all to start out in the best of spirits; and early in the morning they were to meet him at Cyaxares's gates.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Thereupon they all went their way and proceeded so to do. At daybreak on the following day the staff-officers presented themselves at the gates of the king. So <persName>Cyrus</persName> went in with them to Cyaxares and began to speak as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I am sure, Cyaxares,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you have<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He lays his plan before Cyaxares</note> this long time been thinking no less than we of the proposition that I am going to lay before you; but perhaps you hesitate to broach the subject for fear it should be thought that you speak of an expedition from here because you are embarrassed at having to maintain us.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Therefore, since you do not say anything, I will speak both for you and for ourselves. We are all agreed that, inasmuch as we are quite ready, it is best not to sit down here in a friendly country and wait till the enemy have invaded your territory before we begin to fight, but to go as quickly as possible into the enemy's country.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>For now, while we are in your country, we do your people's property much injury quite against our will; but if we go into the enemy's country, we shall do injury to theirs with all our hearts.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the second place, you support us now at great expense; whereas, if we take the field, we shall get our support from the enemy's country.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> And then again, if we were likely to be in any greater danger there than here, we should, perhaps, have to choose the safer course. But their numbers will be the same, whether we wait here or whether we go and meet them in their own territory. And our numbers in the fight will be just the same, whether we engage them as they come hither or whether we go against them to join battle.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>We shall, however, find the courage of our soldiers much better and stronger, if we assume the offensive and show that we are not unwilling to face the foe; and they will be much more afraid of us, when they hear that we do not sit down at home and cower in fear of them, but that, when we hear that they are coming, we advance to meet them to join battle as soon as possible, and do not wait until our country is ravaged, but take the initiative and devastate theirs.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> And surely,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if we make them more afraid and ourselves more courageous, I think it would be a great gain to us and it would, as I reckon it, lessen the danger under such circumstances for us and increase it for the enemy. And my father always says, and so do you, and all the rest agree, that battles are decided more by men's souls than by the strength of their bodies.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke; and Cyaxares answered: &ldquo;Do<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares approves</note> not let yourselves imagine, <persName>Cyrus</persName> and the rest of you Persians, that I am embarrassed at having to support you. As for invading the enemy's country at once, however, I too consider that the better plan from every point of view.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;since we are agreed, let us make ready and, as soon as ever the gods give us their sanction, let us march out without a moment's delay.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hereupon they gave the soldiers the word to make ready to break camp. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> proceeded to sacrifice first to Sovereign Zeus and then to the rest of the gods; and he besought them to lead his army with their grace and favour and to be their mighty defenders and helpers and counsellors for the common good.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>And he called also upon the heroes who dwelt in Media and were its guardians.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the sacrifice was found to be favourable<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> invades Assyria</note> and his army was assembled at the frontier, then amid favourable auspices he crossed into the enemy's country. And as soon as he had crossed the boundary, there again he made propitiatory offerings to Earth with libations and sought with sacrifices to win the favour of the gods and heroes that dwelt in Assyria. And when he had done this he sacrificed again to Zeus, the god of his fathers; and of the other divinities that were brought to his attention he neglected not one.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when these rites were duly performed, they at once led the infantry forward a short distance and pitched camp, while with the cavalry they made a raid and got possession of a large quantity of every sort of booty. And thenceforward they shifted their camp from time to time, kept provisions supplied in abundance, and ravaged the country, while they awaited the enemy's approach.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when rumours came that the enemy were advancing and no longer ten days' march away, then <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;Now, Cyaxares, is the time for us to go to meet them and not to let either the enemy or our own men suppose that we fail to advance against them out of fear, but let us make it clear that we are not going to fight against our will.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As Cyaxares agreed to this, they advanced<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> and Cyaxares advance to meet the foe</note> in battle order each day as far as they thought proper. Their dinner they always prepared by day-light, and at night they never lighted a fire in camp. They did, however, keep fires burning in front of the camp, in order that if any one approached in the dark, they might see him by the light of the fire but not be seen. And frequently also they kept fires burning in the rear of the camp for the purpose of deceiving the enemy; and so sometimes the enemy's scouts fell into the hands of the pickets; for because the fires were behind, they supposed themselves to be still far in front of the camp.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, when the two armies were near each<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A barbarian encampment</note> other, the Assyrians and their allies drew a ditch around their camp, as even to this day the barbarian kings do whenever they go into camp; and they throw up such entrenchments with ease because of the multitude of hands at their command. They take this precaution because they know that cavalry troops&mdash;especially barbarian cavalry&mdash;are at night prone to confusion and hard to manage.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>For they keep their horses hobbled at the mangers, and if any enemy should make an attack, it is a difficult task to loose the horses in the darkness, it is difficult to bridle them, difficult to saddle them, difficult to put on a coat of mail, and utterly impossible to mount and ride through camp. For all these reasons and also because they think that if they are behind fortifications they are in a position to choose their time for fighting, the Assyrians and the rest of the barbarians throw up breastworks.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With such tactics the armies were approaching each other; but when, as they advanced, they were only about a parasang apart, the Assyrians encamped in the manner described in a place surrounded, indeed, by a ditch, but open to view. <persName>Cyrus</persName>, on the other hand, encamped in a place as much out of sight as possible, keeping under cover behind the hills and villages, for he thought that if all one's equipment for war flashes suddenly into view, it inspires more terror in the enemy. And that night each side stationed advance guards, as was proper, and went to rest.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And on the following day the Assyrian king<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> and Cyaxares await an attack</note> and Croesus and the other commanders let their troops rest within the entrenchments; but <persName>Cyrus</persName> and Cyaxares awaited them in battle array, ready to fight if the enemy should come on. But when it was evident that the enemy would not come out from behind their breastworks nor accept battle that day, Cyaxares called <persName>Cyrus</persName> and the staff officers besides and spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>&ldquo;Men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I propose to march up to those fellows' breastworks, drawn up just as we are now, and show them that we are eager to fight. For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if we do that and they do not come out against us, our men will come back to camp more full of courage, and the enemy seeing our daring will be more frightened.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was his proposal. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;No, by the gods, Cyaxares, let us not do that; never! For if we march out and show ourselves, as you suggest, the enemy will see us marching up but will have no fear, for they know that they are secure against any injury; and when we withdraw without having accomplished anything, they will furthermore see that our numbers are inferior to their own and despise us; and to-morrow they will come out with much stouter hearts.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>But as matters stand now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as they know that we are here but do not see us, you may be sure that they do not despise us but inquire anxiously what in the world this means, and I am positive that they are talking about us all the time. But when they come out, then we must show ourselves and at once engage them hand to hand, when we shall have them where we have long since been wishing to have them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> had thus spoken, Cyaxares and the rest agreed with him. And then, when they had dined and stationed their sentinels and lighted many fires in front of the outposts, they went to rest.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Early on the following day <persName>Cyrus</persName> crowned<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> offers sacrifice and exhorts the peers</note> himself with a garland and prepared to sacrifice, and sent word to the rest of the peers to attend the service with chaplets on their heads. And when the sacrifice was concluded, <persName>Cyrus</persName> called them together and said: &ldquo;Men, the gods announce, as the soothsayers say and also as I interpret it, that there is to be a battle; through the omens of the sacrifice they grant us victory and promise us no loss.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I should be ashamed indeed to suggest to you how you ought to conduct yourselves at such a time; for I know that you understand what you have to do, that you have practised it, and have been continually hearing of it just as I have, so that you might properly even teach others. But if you happen not to have had this other matter called to your attention, listen.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Those whom we recently took as our comrades and whom we are trying to make like ourselves&mdash;these men we must remind of the conditions on which we have been maintained by Cyaxares, what we have been in training for, why we have invited them to join us, and what it is in which they said they would gladly be our rivals.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>And remind them also that this day will prove what each one is worth. For when people are late in learning anything, it is not surprising that some of them actually need a monitor; and we may be content if they manage even with the help of a suggestion to prove themselves valiant.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>And in doing this, you will at the same time be getting a proof of yourselves also. For he who on such an occasion can make others more valiant would naturally also gain the consciousness that he is himself a thoroughly valiant man; he, on the other hand, who keeps all to himself the admonition to such conduct and rests satisfied with that might properly consider himself but half valiant.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The reason why I do not speak to them but bid you do so is that so they may try to please you, for you are in touch with them, each in his own division. And remember this, that if in their eyes you prove yourselves courageous, you will teach not only your comrades but many others also, not by precept merely but by example, to be courageous.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>In concluding, he told them to go with their chaplets on and take luncheon and when they had poured the libation to go, still wearing the chaplets, to their posts.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they had gone away, he called in the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He exhorts also the rear-guard officers</note> officers of the rear-guard and gave them the following instructions:
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>&ldquo;Men of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, you also have now taken your places among the peers, and you have been selected for your positions because you are considered in every way equal to the bravest, and by virtue of your years even more discreet than they. And so you occupy a place not at all less honourable than that of our front-rank men. For as you are behind, you can observe those who are valiant and by exhorting them make them still more valiant; and if any one should be inclined to hang back and you should see it, you would not permit it.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And because of your years and because of the weight of your armour it is more to your advantage than to any others' that we should be victorious. And if those in front call to you and bid you follow, obey them and see that you be not outdone by them even in this respect but give them a counter cheer to lead on faster against the enemy. Now go and get your luncheon and then go with your chaplets on your heads with the others to your posts.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his men were occupied; and the Assyrians, when they had lunched, came out boldly and bravely drew up in line. And the king in person rode along in his chariot and marshalled the lines and exhorted them as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>&ldquo;Men of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king of Assyria exhorts his troops</note> Assyria, now is the time for you to be brave men; for the struggle now impending is one for your lives, for the land in which you were born, for the homes in which you were bred, for your wives and children and all the blessings you enjoy. For if you are victorious, you will have possession of all that, as before; but if you are defeated, be well assured that you will surrender it all to the enemy.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/> Therefore, as you desire victory, stand and fight; for it would be folly for men who desire to win a battle to turn their backs and offer to the enemy the side of their body that is without eyes or hands or weapons; and any one who wishes to live would be a fool if he tried to run away, when he knows that it is the victors who save their lives, while those who try to run away are more likely to meet their death than those who stand their ground. And if any one desires wealth, he also is foolish if he submits to defeat. For who does not know that the victors not only save what is their own but take in addition the property of the vanquished, while the vanquished throw both themselves and all they have away?&rdquo;  Thus the Assyrian was occupied;
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>and Cyaxares<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares proposes an immediate attack</note> sent to <persName>Cyrus</persName> to say that now was the time to advance upon the enemy. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;although those outside the fortifications are as yet but few, they will become many while we are advancing; let us therefore not wait until their numbers are more than our own, but let us go while yet we think we could defeat them easily.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, Cyaxares,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered, &ldquo;if it is<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> wisely counsels delay</note> not more than half of them that are defeated, you may rest assured that they will say that we attacked only a few because we were afraid of their main body, and they will maintain that they have not been defeated; the result will be that you will find another battle necessary; and then they may perhaps plan better than they have now in delivering themselves so completely to our disposal that we may fight as many or as few of them as we please.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The messengers received this answer and were gone. And at this juncture Chrysantas, the Persian, and certain other peers came up with some deserters. And <persName>Cyrus</persName>, as a matter of course, asked the deserters what was going on among the enemy; and they said that the troops were already coming out under arms and that the king was out in person marshalling them and addressing them with many earnest words of exhortation as they came out in succession. So, they said, those reported who heard him.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How would it do, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; Chrysantas then<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The value of exhortations to valour</note> asked, &ldquo;for you to get your men together, too, while yet you may, and exhort them, and see if you also might make your soldiers better men.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do not let the exhortations of the Assyrian trouble you in the least, Chrysantas,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered; &ldquo;for no speech of admonition can be so fine that it will all at once make those who hear it good men if they are not good already; it would surely not make archers good if they had not had previous practice in shooting; neither could it make lancers good, nor horsemen; it cannot even make men able to endure bodily labour, unless they have been trained to it before.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; answered Chrysantas, &ldquo;it is really enough if you make their souls better with your words of exhortation.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you really think,&rdquo; returned <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;that one word spoken could all at once fill with a sense of honour the souls of those who hear, or keep them from actions that would be wrong, and convince them that for the sake of praise they must undergo every toil and every danger? Could it impress the idea indelibly upon their minds that it is better to die in battle than to save one's life by running away?
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if such sentiments are to be imprinted on men's hearts and to be abiding, is it not necessary in the first place that laws be already in existence such that by them a life of freedom and honour shall be provided for the good, but that upon the bad shall be imposed a life of humiliation and misery which would not be worth living?
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And then again, I think, there must be, in addition to the laws, teachers and officers to show them the right way, to teach them and accustom them to do as they are taught, until it becomes a part of their nature to consider the good and honourable men as really the most happy, and to look upon the bad and the disreputable as the most wretched of all people. For such ought to be the feelings of those who are going to show the victory of training over fear in the presence of the enemy.
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>But if, when soldiers are about to go armed into battle, when many forget even the lessons oft learned of old, if then any one by an oratorical flourish can then and there make men warlike, it would be the easiest thing under heaven both to learn and to teach the greatest virtue in the world.
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>For even in the case of those whom we have kept and trained among ourselves, I, for my part, should not trust even them to be steadfast, if I did not see you also before me, who will be an example to them of what they ought to be and who will be able to prompt them if they forget anything. But I should be surprised, Chrysantas, if a word well spoken would help those wholly untrained in excellence to the attainment of manly worth any more than a song well sung would help those untrained in music to high attainments in music.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus they conversed. And again Cyaxares sent<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares orders a charge</note> to <persName>Cyrus</persName> to say that he was making a serious mistake to delay instead of leading as soon as possible against the enemy. And then <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered the messengers saying: &ldquo;Very well; but I want him to know that there are not yet as many of them outside the breastworks as we ought to have; and tell him this in the presence of all. Nevertheless, since he thinks best, I will lead on at once.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had said this, he prayed to the gods<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The charge of the Persians</note> and led out his army. And as soon as he began to advance, he led on at a double-quick pace and they followed in good order, for they understood marching in line and had practised it; moreover, they followed courageously, because they were in eager rivalry with one another and because their bodies were in thorough training and because the front-rank men were all officers; and they followed gladly, because they were intelligent men; for they had become convinced by long instruction that the easiest and safest way was to meet the enemy hand to hand&mdash;especially if that enemy were made up of bowmen, spearmen, and cavalry.
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While they were still out of range, <persName>Cyrus</persName> passed the watchword, Zeus our Helper and our Guide. And when the watchword came back and was delivered again to him, <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself began the usual paean, and they all devoutly joined with a loud voice in the singing, for in the performance of such service the God-fearing have less fear of men.
<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>And when the paean was ended, the peers marched on cheerily &lt;,well-disciplined&gt;, looking toward one another, calling by name to comrades beside them and behind them, and often saying: &ldquo;On, friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;On, brave fellows;&rdquo; thus they encouraged one another to the charge. And those behind, hearing them, in their turn cheered the front line to lead them bravely on. So <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army was filled with enthusiasm, ambition, strength, courage, exhortation, self-control, obedience; and this, I think, is the most formidable thing an enemy has to face.
<milestone unit="section" n="60"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when the main body of the Persians began<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Assyrians fail to withstand the charge</note> to get close to them, those of the Assyrians who dismounted from their chariots and fought in front of their army remounted their chariots and gradually drew back to their own main body, while the bowmen, spearmen, and slingers let fly their missiles long before they could reach the enemy.
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>And when the Persians, charging on, set foot upon the missiles that had been discharged, <persName>Cyrus</persName> shouted, &ldquo;Bravest of men, now let each press on and distinguish himself and pass the word to the others to come on faster.&rdquo; And they passed it on; and under the impulse of their enthusiasm, courage, and eagerness to close with the enemy some broke into a run, and the whole phalanx also followed at a run.
<milestone unit="section" n="62"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And even <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself, forgetting to proceed at a walk, led them on at a run and shouted as he ran: &ldquo;Who will follow? Who is brave? Who will be the first to lay low his man?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And those who heard him shouted with the same words, and the cry passed through all the ranks as he had started it: &ldquo;Who will follow? Who is brave?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In such spirit the Persians rushed to the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">They flee into their entrenchments</note> encounter, and the enemy could not longer stand their ground but turned and fled back into their entrenchments.
<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>And the Persians on their part, following them up to the gates, mowed many of them down as they were pushing and shoving one another; and upon some who fell into the ditches they leaped down and slew them, both men and horses; for some of the chariots were forced in their flight to plunge into the ditches.
<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>And when the Median cavalry saw this, they also charged upon the enemy's cavalry; but the latter gave way, like the rest. Then followed a pursuit of horses and men and slaughter of both.
<milestone unit="section" n="66"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And those of the Assyrians inside the fort who<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The panic in the camp</note> stood upon the rampart of the breastworks neither had the presence of mind to shoot arrows or hurl spears at the enemy who were mowing down their ranks, nor had they the strength to do so because of the awful spectacle and their own panic fear. And presently, discovering that some of the Persians had cut their way through to the gates in the embankment, they turned away even from the inner rampart of the breastworks.
<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>And the women of the Assyrians and their allies, seeing the men in flight even inside the camp, raised a cry and ran panic-stricken, both those who had children and the younger women as well, while they rent their garments, tore their cheeks, and begged all whom they met not to run away and leave them but to defend both them and their children and themselves as well.
<milestone unit="section" n="68"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then even the kings themselves with their most trusty followers took their stand at the gates, mounted upon the ramparts, and both fought in person and encouraged the rest to fight.
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when <persName>Cyrus</persName> realized what was going on, he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> orders a retreat</note> feared lest his men, even if they did force their way in, might be worsted by superior numbers, for his own men were but few; so he gave orders to retreat still facing the foe, until they were out of range.
<milestone unit="section" n="70"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then one might have seen the ideal discipline of the peers; for they themselves obeyed at once and at once passed on the word to the rest. And when they were out of range, they halted in their regular positions, for they knew much more accurately than a chorus, each the spot where he should stand.</p></div1>
<div1 type="Book" n="4"><p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> remained there for a while with his army<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> withdraws</note> and showed that they were ready to do battle, if any one should come out. But as no one did come out against him, he withdrew as far as he thought proper and encamped. And when he had stationed his outposts and sent out his scouts, he called together his own men, took his place in their midst, and addressed them as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Fellow-citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, first of all I praise the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His address to his troops</note> gods with all my soul; and so, I believe, do all of you; for we not only have won a victory, but our lives have been spared. We ought, therefore, to render to the gods thank-offerings of whatsoever we have. And I here and now commend you as a body, for you have all contributed to this glorious achievement; but as for the deserts of each of you individually, I shall try by word and deed to give every man his due reward, when I have ascertained from proper sources what credit each one deserves.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But as to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chrysantas promoted</note> Captain Chrysantas, who fought next to me, I have no need to make enquiry from others, for I myself know how gallant his conduct was; in everything else he did just as I think all of you also did; but when I gave the word to retreat and called to him by name, even though he had his sword raised to smite down an enemy he obeyed me at once and refrained from what he was on the point of doing and proceeded to carry out my order; not only did he himself retreat but he also with instant promptness passed the word on to the others; and so he succeeded in getting his division out of range before the enemy discovered that we were retreating or drew their bows or let fly their javelins. And thus by his obedience he is unharmed himself and he has kept his men unharmed.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But others,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I see wounded; and when I have enquired at what moment of the engagement they received their wounds, I will then express my opinion concerning them. But Chrysantas, as a mighty man of war, prudent and fitted to command and to obey&mdash;him I now promote to a colonelship. And when God shall vouchsafe some further blessing, then, too, I shall not forget him.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I wish also to leave this thought with all of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The lessons of the battle</note> you,&rdquo; he went on: &ldquo;never cease to bear in mind what you have just seen in this day's battle, so that you may always judge in your own hearts whether courage is more likely to save men's lives than running away, and whether it is easier for those to withdraw who wish to fight than for those who are unwilling, and what sort of pleasure victory brings; for you can best judge of these matters now when you have experience of them and while the event is of so recent occurrence.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And if you would always keep this in mind, you would be more valiant men.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now go to dinner, as men beloved of God and brave and wise; pour libations to the gods, raise the song of victory, and at the same time be on the lookout for orders that may come.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had said this, he mounted his horse and rode away to Cyaxares. They exchanged congratulations, as was fitting, and after <persName>Cyrus</persName> had taken note of matters there and asked if there were anything he could do, he rode back to his own army. Then he and his followers dined, stationed their pickets duly, and went to rest.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Assyrians, on the other hand, inasmuch as<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Assyrians decamp</note> they had lost their general and with him nearly all their best men, were all disheartened, and many of them even ran away from the camp in the course of the night. And when Croesus and the rest of their allies saw this, they too lost heart; for the whole situation was desperate; but what caused the greatest despondency in all was the fact that the leading contingent of the army had become thoroughly demoralized. Thus dispirited, then, they quitted their camp and departed under cover of the night.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And when it became day and the enemy's camp was found to be forsaken of men, <persName>Cyrus</persName> at once led his Persians first across the entrenchments. And many sheep and many cattle and many wagons packed full of good things had been left behind by the enemy. Directly after this, Cyaxares also and all his Medes crossed over and had breakfast there.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And when they had breakfasted, <persName>Cyrus</persName> called together his captains and spoke as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What good things, fellow-soldiers, and how great, have we let slip, it seems, while the gods were delivering them into our hands! Why, you see with your own eyes that the enemy have run away from us; when people behind fortifications abandon them and flee, how would any one expect them to stand and fight, if they met us in a fair and open field? And if they did not stand their ground when they were yet unacquainted with us, how would they withstand us now, when they have been defeated and have suffered heavy loss at our hands? And when their bravest men have been slain, how would their more cowardly be willing to fight us?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why not pursue them as swiftly as possible,&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Pursuit proposed</note> said one of the men; &ldquo;now that the good things we have let slip are so manifest to us?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we have not horses enough; for the best of the enemy, those whom it were most desirable either to capture or to kill, are riding off on horseback. With the help of the gods we were able to put them to flight, but we are not able to pursue and overtake them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then why do you not go and tell Cyaxares this?&rdquo; said they.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Come with me, then, all of you,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;so that he may know that we are all agreed upon this point.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon they all followed and submitted such arguments as they thought calculated to gain their object.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now Cyaxares seemed to feel some little jealousy because the proposal came from them; at the same time, perhaps, he did not care to risk another engagement; then, too, he rather wished to stay where he was, for it happened that he was busily engaged in making merry himself, and he saw that many of the other Medes were doing the same. However that may be, he spoke as follows:<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares replies</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I know from what I see and hear that you Persians are more careful than other people not to incline to the least intemperance in any kind of pleasure. But it seems to me that it is much better to be moderate in the greatest pleasure than to be moderate in lesser pleasures; and what brings to man greater pleasure than success, such as has now been granted us?
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If, therefore [when we are successful], we follow up our success with moderation, we might, perhaps, be able to grow old in happiness unalloyed with danger. But if we enjoy it intemperately and try to pursue first one success and then another, see to it that we do not share the same fate that they say many have suffered upon the sea, that is, because of their success they have not been willing to give up seafaring, and so they have been lost; and many others, when they have gained a victory, have aimed at another and so have lost even what they gained by the first.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And that is the way with us; for if it were because they were inferior to us in numbers that the enemy are fleeing from us, perhaps it might be safe for us actually to pursue this lesser army. But, as it is, reflect with what a mere fraction of their numbers we, with all our forces, have fought and won, while the rest of theirs have not tasted of battle; and if we do not compel them to fight, they will remain unacquainted with our strength and with their own, and they will go away because of their ignorance and cowardice. But if they discover that they are in no less danger if they go away than if they remain in the field, beware lest we compel them to be valiant even against their will.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>And let me assure you that you are not more eager to capture their women and children than they are to save them. And bethink you that even wild swine flee with their young, when they are discovered, no matter how great their numbers may be; but if any one tries to catch one of the young, the old one, even if she happens to be the only one, does not think of flight but rushes upon the man who is trying to effect the capture.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>And now, when they had shut themselves up in their fortifications, they allowed us to manage things so as to fight as many at a time as we pleased. But if we go against them in an open plain and they learn to meet us in separate detachments, some in front of us (as even now), some on either flank, and some in our rear, see to it that we do not each one of us stand in need of many hands and many eyes. And besides,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now that I see the Medes making merry, I should not like to rout them out and compel them to go into danger.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName> in reply; &ldquo;please do not<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> answers his uncle's objections</note> place anybody under compulsion; but allow those who will volunteer to follow me, and perhaps we may come back bringing to you and each of your friends here something for you all to make merry with. For the main body of the enemy we certainly shall not even pursue; for how could we ever overtake them? But if we find any detachment of their army straggling or left behind, we shall bring them to you.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> And remember,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that we also, when you asked us, came a long journey to do you a favour; and it is therefore only fair that you should do us a favour in return, so that we may not have to go home empty-handed nor always be looking to your treasury here for support.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Cyaxares then; &ldquo;if indeed<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares accepts <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s proposal</note> any one will volunteer to follow you, I for my part should be really grateful to you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;send with me some one of these notables in positions of trust to announce your commands.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Take any of them you wish,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and go.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it happened that the man who had once<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">I. iv. 27-28</note> pretended to be a kinsman of his and had got a kiss from him was present there. <persName>Cyrus</persName>, therefore, said at once: &ldquo;This man will do.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Let him follow you, then,&rdquo; said Cyaxares. &ldquo;And do you,&rdquo; he added to Artabazus, &ldquo;say that whoever will may go with <persName>Cyrus</persName>.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So then he took the man and went away. And when they had come out, <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;Now then, you shall prove if you spoke the truth when you said that you liked to look at me.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If you talk that way,&rdquo; said the Mede, &ldquo;I shall never leave you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Will you do your best, then, to bring others also with you?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; he answered with an oath, &ldquo;to such an extent that I shall make you also glad to look at me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, as he had his commission from Cyaxares also, he not only gave his message to the Medes with enthusiasm, but he added that, for his part, he himself would never leave the noblest and best of men, and what was more than all, a man descended from the gods.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While <persName>Cyrus</persName> was thus occupied, messengers<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Hyrcanians</note> came as if providentially from the Hyrcanians. Now the Hyrcanians are neighbours of the Assyrians; they are not a large nation; and for that reason they also were subjects of the Assyrians. Even then they had a reputation for being good horsemen, and they have that reputation still. For this reason the Assyrians used to employ them as the Spartans do the Sciritae, sparing them neither in hardships nor in dangers. And on that particular occasion they were ordered to bring up the rear (they were cavalrymen about a thousand strong), in order that, if any danger should threaten from behind, they might have to bear the brunt of it instead of the Assyrians.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But as the Hyrcanians were to march in the very rear, they had their wagons also and their families in the rear. For, as we know, most of the Asiatic peoples take the field accompanied by their entire households. So in this particular campaign, the Hyrcanians had taken the field thus attended.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But as they reflected how they were being treated by the Assyrians, that the Assyrian monarch was now slain and the army defeated, that there was great panic throughout the ranks, and that the allies were discouraged and deserting&mdash;as they thought over these conditions, they decided that now was a good opportunity to revolt, if <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his followers would join them in an attack. So they sent envoys<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">They send envoys to <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> to <persName>Cyrus</persName>; for in consequence of the battle his name had been very greatly magnified.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And those who were sent told <persName>Cyrus</persName> that they had good reason to hate the Assyrians and that now, if he would proceed against them, they would be his allies and his guides as well. And at the same time they also gave him an account of the enemy's plight, for they wished above all things to incite him to push the campaign.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you really think,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> enquired, &ldquo;that we could still overtake them before they reach their strongholds? For we,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;consider it hard luck that they have run away from us when we were not watching.&rdquo; Now he said this to make them think as highly as possible of his troops.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They answered that if <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his army<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">They report the enemy within striking distance</note> would start out at daybreak in light marching order, he would come up with them the next day: for because their numbers were so vast and so encumbered with baggage, the enemy were marching slowly. &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;as they had no sleep last night, they have gone ahead only a little way and are now encamped.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Have you, then, any surety to give us,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked, &ldquo;to prove that what you say is true?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;we are ready to ride away and bring you hostages this very night. Only do you also give us assurance in the name of the gods and give us your right hand, that we may give to the rest of our people, too, the same assurance that we receive from you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon he gave them his solemn promise that, if they should make good their statements, he would treat them as his true friends, so that they should count for no less in his esteem than the Persians or the Medes. And even to this day one may see the Hyrcanians holding positions of trust and authority, just like those of the Persians and Medes who are thought to be deserving.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they had dined, he led out his army<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The volunteers to follow <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> while it was still daylight, and he bade the Hyrcanians wait for him that they might go together. Now the Persians, as was to be expected, came out to a man to go with him, and Tigranes came with his army;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>while of the Medes some came out because as boys they had been friends of <persName>Cyrus</persName> when he was a boy, others because they liked his ways when they had been with him on the chase, others because they were grateful to him for freeing them, as they thought, from great impending danger, and still others because they cherished the hope that as he seemed to be a man of ability he would one day be exceedingly successful and exceedingly great besides; others wished to requite him for some service he had done for them while he was growing up in Media; many, too, owed to his kindness of heart many a favour at the hands of his grandfather; and many, when they saw the Hyrcanians and when the report spread that these would lead them to rich plunder, came out (apart from other motives) for the sake of getting some gain.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The result was that almost all came out&mdash;even the Medes, except those who happened to be feasting in the same tent with Cyaxares; these and their subordinates remained behind. But all the rest hastened out cheerily and enthusiastically, for they came not from compulsion but of their own free will and out of gratitude.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they were out of the camp, he went<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He assigns the order of marching</note> first to the Medes and praised them and prayed the gods above all things graciously to lead them and his own men, and he prayed also that he himself might be enabled to reward them for this zeal of theirs. In concluding, he stated that the infantry should go first, and he ordered the Medes to follow with their cavalry. And wherever they were to rest or halt from their march, he enjoined it upon them that some of their number should always come to him, that they might know the need of the hour.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he ordered the Hyrcanians to lead the way.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; they exclaimed, &ldquo;are you not going to wait until we bring the hostages, that you also may have a guarantee of our good faith before you proceed?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he is said to have answered; &ldquo;for I consider that we have the guarantee in our own hearts and hands. For it is with these, I think, that we are in a position to do you a service, if you speak the truth; but if you are trying to deceive us, we think that, as things are, we shall not be in your power, but rather, if the gods will, you shall be in ours. And hark you, men of Hyrcania,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as you say that your people are bringing up the enemy's rear, inform us, as soon as you see them, that they are yours, that we may do them no harm.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Hyrcanians heard this, they led the way, as he ordered. They wondered at his magnanimity; and they no longer had any fear of either the Assyrians or the Lydians or their allies, but they feared only lest he should think that it was not of the slightest moment whether they joined him or not.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As they proceeded, night came on, and it is<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He comes up with the Hyrcanians</note> said that a light from heaven shone forth upon <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his army, so that they were all filled with awe at the miracle but with courage to meet the enemy. And as they were proceeding in light marching order with all dispatch, they naturally covered a great distance, and in the morning twilight they drew near to the army of the Hyrcanians.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And when the messengers recognized the fact, they reported to <persName>Cyrus</persName> that these were their own people; for they said that they recognized them both by the fact that they were in the rear and by the number of their fires.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon hearing this report he sent one of the two messengers to them with orders to say that if they were friends, they should come to meet him with their right hands raised. And he sent along also one of his own men and ordered him to tell the Hyrcanians that he and his army would govern their conduct according to the way in which they should see the Hyrcanians behave. And thus it came to pass that one of the messengers remained with <persName>Cyrus</persName>, while the other rode away to the Hyrcanians.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While <persName>Cyrus</persName> was watching to see what the Hyrcanians were going to do, he haltedd his army. and Tigranes and the officers of the Medes rode up to him and asked what they should do. And he said to them: &ldquo;What you see there not far away is the Hyrcanian army; and one of their envoys has gone to them, and one of our men with him, to tell them all, if they are our friends, to come to meet us with their right hands upraised. Now, if they do so, give to them the right hand of fellowship, each of you to the man opposite himself, and at the same time bid them welcome. But if they raise a weapon or attempt to run away, we must lose no time in trying not to leave a single one of these first alive.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were his commands. And the Hyrcanians<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">They all join his army</note> were delighted when they heard the report of the envoys, and leaping upon their horses they came at once with right hands upraised, as directed, and the Medes and Persians gave the right hand of fellowship and bade them welcome.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Men of Hyrcania,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> said presently, &ldquo;we trust you now, as you see; and you also ought to feel the same way toward us. But tell us first how far it is from here to the headquarters of the enemy and the main body of their army.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Not much more than a parasang,&rdquo; they answered.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Come on, then, Persians and Medes,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> cried; &ldquo;and you Hyrcanians&mdash;for now I speak with you also as confederates and allies&mdash;you must know that we are in a position where we shall meet with nothing but disaster if we betray a lack of courage; for the enemy know what we have come for. But if<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> outlines plans for a second attack</note> we go into the attack upon the enemy with might and main and with stout hearts, you will see right soon that, just like a lot of slaves caught in an attempt to run away, some of them will beg for mercy, others will try to escape, others still will not even have presence of mind to do either. For they will see us before they have recovered from their first defeat, and they will find themselves caught neither thinking of our coming, nor drawn up in line, nor prepared to fight.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>If, therefore, we wish from this time forth to eat well, to sleep soundly, and to live comfortably, let us not give them time either to take counsel or to provide any defence for themselves, or even to recognize at all that we are human beings; but let them think that nothing but shields, swords, bills, and blows have descended upon them.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you, Hyrcanians,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;spread yourselves out in the van and march before us, in order that only your arms may be seen and that our presence here may be concealed as long as possible. And when I come up with the enemy's army, then leave with me, each of you, a division of cavalry for me to use while I remain near their camp.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>But you, officers and men of years, march together in close order, if you are wise, so that if you fall in with any compact body you may never be forced back; and leave the pursuit to the younger men, and let them kill all they can; for this is the safest measure&mdash;to leave now as few of the enemy alive as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And if we win the battle,&rdquo; he continued,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How to conserve the results of victory</note> &ldquo;we must be on our guard against an error which has lost the day for many in the hour of victory&mdash;turning aside to plunder. For the man who does this is no longer a soldier but a camp-follower; and any one who will is free to treat him as a slave.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You should realize this also, that nothing is more enriching than victory. For the victor has swept together all the spoil at once, the men and the women, the wealth and all the lands. Therefore have an eye to this alone&mdash;that we may conserve our victory; for even the plunderer himself is in the enemy's power if he is conquered. And remember even in the heat of pursuit to come back to me while it is yet daylight; for after nightfall we shall not admit another man.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had said this he sent them away to their several companies with orders to issue, as they marched, the same directions each to his own corporals (for the corporals were in the front so as to hear); and they were to bid the corporals each one to announce it to his squad.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the Hyrcanians led the way while he himself with his Persians occupied the centre as they marched. The cavalry he arranged, as was natural, on either flank.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when daylight came, some of the enemy<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The panic flight of the Assyrian army</note> wondered at what they saw, some realized at once what it meant, some began to spread the news, some to cry out, some proceeded to untie the horses, some to pack up, others to toss the armour off the pack-animals, still others to arm themselves, while some were leaping upon their horses, some bridling them, others helping the women into the wagons, and others were snatching up their most valuable possessions to save them; still others were caught in the act of burying theirs, while the most of them sought refuge in precipitate flight. We may imagine that they were doing many other things also&mdash;all sorts of other things&mdash;except that no one offered to resist, but they perished without striking a blow.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As it was summer, Croesus, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, had had his women sent on by night in carriages, that they might proceed more comfortably in the cool of the night, and he himself was following after with his cavalry.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>And the Phrygian king, the ruler of <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, they say, did the same. And when they saw the fugitives who were overtaking them, they enquired of them what was happening, and then they also took to flight as fast as they could go.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But the king of <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName> and the Arabian king, as they were still near by and stood their ground though unarmed, were cut down by the Hyrcanians. But the majority of the slain were Assyrians and Arabians. For as these were in their own country, they were very leisurely about getting away.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the Medes and Hyrcanians, as they pursued,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How the victors behaved</note> committed such acts as men might be expected to commit in the hour of victory. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> ordered the horsemen who had been left with him to ride around the camp and to kill any that they saw coming out under arms; while to those who remained inside he issued a proclamation that as many of the enemy's soldiers as were cavalrymen or targeteers or bowmen should bring out their weapons tied in bundles and deliver them up, but should leave their horses at their tents. Whoever failed to do so should soon lose his head. Now <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s men stood in line around them, sabre in hand.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>Accordingly, those who had the weapons carried them to one place, where he directed, and threw them down, and men whom he had appointed for the purpose burned them.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now <persName>Cyrus</persName> recollected that they had come with neither food nor drink, and without these it was not possible to prosecute a campaign or to do anything else. And as he was considering how to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> organizes his commissariat</note> procure the best possible supplies with the greatest possible dispatch, it occurred to him that all those who take the field must have some one to take care of the tent and to have food prepared for the soldiers when they came in.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>So he concluded that of all people these were the ones most likely to have been caught in the camp, because they would have been busy packing up. Accordingly, he issued a proclamation for all the commissaries to come to him; but if a commissary officer should be lacking anywhere, the oldest man from that tent should come. And to any one who should dare to disobey he threatened direst punishment. But when they saw their masters obeying, they also obeyed at once. And when they had come, he first ordered those of them to sit down who had more than two months' supply of provisions in their tents.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>And when he had noted them, he gave the same order to those who had one month's supply. Hereupon nearly all sat down.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>And when he had this information he addressed them as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now then, my men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if any of you have a dislike for trouble and wish that you might receive kind treatment at our hands, be sure to see to it that there be twice as much food and drink prepared in each tent as you used to get ready every day for your masters and their servants; and get everything else ready that belongs to a good meal; for whichever side is victorious, they will very soon be here and they will expect to find plenty of every sort of provisions. Let me assure you, then, that it would be to your advantage to entertain those men handsomely.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they heard this, they proceeded with great alacrity to carry out his directions, while he called together his captains and spoke as follows: &ldquo;I<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> exhorts the Persians to self-denial and consideration of others</note> realize, friends, that it is possible for us now to take luncheon first, while our comrades are away, and to enjoy the choicest food and drink. But I do not think that it would be of more advantage to us to eat this luncheon than it would to show ourselves thoughtful for our comrades; neither do I think that this feasting would add as much to our strength as we should gain if we could make our allies devoted to us.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>But if we show ourselves to be so neglectful of them that we are found to have broken our fast even before we know how they are faring, while they are pursuing and slaying our enemies and fighting any one that opposes them, let us beware lest we be disgraced in their eyes and lest we find ourselves crippled by the loss of our allies. If, on the other hand, we take care that those who are bearing the danger and the toil shall have what they need when they come back, a banquet of this sort would, in my opinion, give us more pleasure than any immediate gratification of our appetites.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>And remember,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that even if we were under no obligation to show them every consideration, even so it is not proper for us as yet to sate ourselves with food or drink; for not yet have we accomplished what we wish, but, on the contrary, everything is now at a crisis and requires care. For we have enemies in camp many times our own number, and that, too, under no confinement. We not only must keep watch against them but we must keep watch over them, so that we may have people to look after our provisions. Besides, our cavalry are gone, making us anxious to know where they are and whether they will stay with us if they do come back.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And so, my men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it seems to me that we should take only such meat and such drink as one would suppose to be least likely to overcome us with sleep and foolishness.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Besides, there is also a vast amount of treasure in the camp, and I am not ignorant of the fact that it is possible for us to appropriate to ourselves as much of it as we please, though it belongs just as much to those who helped us to get it. But I do not think it would bring us greater gain to take it than it would to show that we mean to be fair and square, and by such dealing to secure greater affection from them than we have already.
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>And so it seems best to me to entrust the division of the treasure to the Medes and Hyrcanians and Tigranes when they come; and if they apportion to us the smaller share, I think we should account it our gain; for because of what they gain, they will be the more glad to stay with us.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>For to secure a present advantage would give us but short-lived riches. But to sacrifice this and obtain the source from which real wealth flows, that, as I see it, could put us and all of ours in possession of a perennial fountain of wealth.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And if I am not mistaken, we used to train ourselves at home, too, to control our appetites and to abstain from unseasonable gain with this in view, that, if occasion should ever demand it, we might be able to employ our powers of self-control to our advantage. And I fail to see where we could give proof of our<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persians ready to put their training to the proof</note> training on a more important occasion than the present.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke; and Hystaspas, one of the Persian peers, supported him in the following speech: &ldquo;Why, yes, <persName>Cyrus</persName>; on the chase we often hold out without a thing to eat, in order to get our hands on some beast, perhaps one worth very little; and it would be strange indeed now, when the quarry we are trying to secure is a world of wealth, if we should for a moment allow those passions to stand in our way which are bad men's masters but good men's servants. I think, if we did so, we should be doing what does not befit us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was Hystaspas's speech, and all the rest agreed with it. Then <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;Come then, since we are of one mind on this point, send each of you five of the most reliable men from his platoon. Let them go about and praise all those whom they see preparing provisions; and let them punish more unsparingly than if they were their masters those whom they see neglectful.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, they set about doing so.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now a part of the Medes were already bringing<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The cavalry bring in spoils</note> in the wagons which had been hurried forward and which they had overtaken and turned back packed full of what an army needs; others were bringing in the carriages that conveyed the most high-born women, not only wedded wives but also concubines, who on account of their beauty had been brought along; these also they captured and brought in.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For even unto this day all who go to war in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> take with them to the field what they prize most highly; for they say that they would do battle the more valiantly, if all that they hold dearest were there; for these, they say, they must do their best to protect. This may, perhaps, be true; but perhaps also they follow this custom for their own sensual gratification.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw what the Medes and Hyrcanians were doing, he poured reproach, as it were, upon himself and his men, because during this time the others seemed to be surpassing them in strenuous activity and gaining something by it, too, while he and his men remained in a position where there was little or nothing to do. And it did seem so; for when the horsemen brought in and showed to <persName>Cyrus</persName> what they brought, they rode away again in pursuit of the others; for, they said, they had been instructed by their officers so to do.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Though <persName>Cyrus</persName> was naturally nettled at this, still he assigned a place to the spoil. And again he called his captains together and standing where they would all be sure to hear his words of counsel, he spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>&ldquo;Friends, we all appreciate, I am sure, that if we could but make our own the good fortune that is now dawning upon us, great blessings would come to all the Persians and above all, as is reasonable, to us by whom they are secured. But I fail to see how we are to establish a valid claim to the spoil if we cannot gain it by<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persians handicapped without cavalry of their own</note> our own strength; and this we cannot do, unless the Persians have cavalry of their own.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Just think of it,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;we Persians have arms with which, it seems, we go into close quarters and put the enemy to flight; and then when we have routed them, how could we without horses capture or kill horsemen or bowmen or targeteers in their flight? And what bowmen or spearmen or horsemen would be afraid to come up and inflict loss upon us, when they are perfectly sure that they are in no more danger of being harmed by us than by the trees growing yonder?
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And if this is so, is it not evident that the horsemen who are now with us consider that everything that has fallen into our hands is theirs no less than ours, and perhaps, by Zeus, even more so?
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>As things are now, therefore, this is necessarily the case. But suppose we acquired a body of cavalry not interior to theirs, is it not patent to us all that we should be able even without them to do to the enemy what we are now doing with their aid, and that we should find them then less presumptuous toward us? For whenever they chose to remain or to go away, we should care less, if we were sufficient unto ourselves without them. Well and good.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>No one, I think, would gain-say<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes to have Persian cavalry</note> me in this statement, that it makes all the difference in the world whether the Persians have their own cavalry or not. But perhaps you are wondering how this may be accomplished. Well then, supposing that we wished to organize a division of cavalry, had we not better consider our resources and our deficiencies?
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Here, then, in camp are numbers of horses which we have taken and reins which they obey, and everything else that horses must have before you can use them. Yes, and more, all that a horseman must use we have&mdash;breastplates as defensive armour for the body and spears which we may use either to hurl or to thrust.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>What then remains? Obviously we must have men. Now these above all other things we have; for nothing is so fully ours as we ourselves are our own.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But perhaps some one will say that we do not know how to ride. No, by Zeus; and no one of these who now know how to ride did know before he learned. But, some one may say, they learned when they were boys.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And are boys more clever in learning what is explained to them and what is shown them than are men? And which are better able with bodily strength to put into practice what they have learned, boys or men?
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Again, we have more time for learning than either boys or other men; for we have not, like boys, to learn to shoot, for we know how already; or to throw the spear, for we understand that, too. No; nor yet again are we so situated as other men, some of whom are kept busy with their farming, some with their trades, and some with other domestic labours, while we not only have time for military operations, but they are forced upon us.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And this is not like many other branches of military discipline, useful but laborious; nay, when it comes to marching, is not riding more pleasant than tramping along on one's own two feet? And when speed is required, is it not delightful quickly to reach a friend's side, if need be, and quickly to overtake a man or an animal, if occasion should require one to give chase? And is this not convenient, that the horse should help you to carry whatever accoutrement you must take along? Surely, to have and to carry are not quite the same thing.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What one might have most of all to fear, however, is that in case it is necessary for us to go into action on horseback before we have thoroughly mastered this task, we shall then be no longer infantrymen and not yet competent cavalrymen. But not even this is an insurmountable difficulty; for whenever we wish, we may at once fight on foot; for in learning to ride we shall not be unlearning any of our infantry tactics.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> spoke; and Chrysantas seconded<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chrysantas supports the proposition</note> him in the following speech: &ldquo;I, for one, am so eager to learn horsemanship, that I think that if I become a horseman I shall be a man on wings.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>For as we are now, I, at least, am satisfied, when I have an even start in running a race with any man, if I can beat him only by a head; and when I see an animal running along, I am satisfied if I can get a good aim quickly enough to shoot him or spear him before he gets very far away. But if I become a horseman I shall be able to overtake a man though he is as far off as I can see him; and I shall be able to pursue animals and overtake them and either strike them down from close at hand or spear them as if they were standing still; [and they seem so, for though both be moving rapidly, yet, if they are near to one another, they are as if standing still.]
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the creature that I have envied most is, I think, the Centaur (if any such being ever existed), able to reason with a man's intelligence and to manufacture with his hands what he needed, while he possessed the fleetness and strength of a horse so as to overtake whatever ran before him and to knock down whatever stood in his way. Well, all his advantages I combine in myself by becoming a horseman.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>At any rate, I shall be able to take forethought for everything with my human mind, I shall carry my weapons with my hands, I shall pursue with my horse and overthrow my opponent by the rush of my steed, but I shall not be bound fast to him in one growth, like the Centaurs.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Indeed, my state will be better than being grown together in one piece; for, in my opinion at least, the Centaurs must have had difficulty in making use of many of the good things invented for man; and how could they have enjoyed many of the comforts natural to the horse?
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>But if I learn to ride, I shall, when I am on horseback, do everything as the Centaur does, of course; but when I dismount, I shall dine and dress myself and sleep like other human beings; and so what else shall I be than a Centaur that can be taken apart and put together again?
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall have the advantage of the Centaur in this, too, that he used to see with but two eyes and hear with but two ears, while I shall gather evidence with four eyes and learn through four ears; for they say that a horse actually sees many things with his eyes before his rider does and makes them known to him, and that he hears many things with his ears before his rider does and gives him intimation of them. Put me down, therefore,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as one of those who are more than eager to become cavalrymen.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said all the rest, &ldquo;and us too.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How would it do, then,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked, &ldquo;since<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The captains are unanimous</note> we are all so very well agreed upon this matter, if we should make a rule for ourselves that it be considered improper for any one of us whom I provide with a horse to be seen going anywhere on foot, whether the distance he has to go be long or short, so that people may think that we are really Centaurs?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He put the question thus and they all voted aye. And so from that time even to this day, the Persians follow that practice, and no Persian gentleman would be seen going anywhere on foot, if he could help it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were their discussions on this occasion.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when it was past midday, the Median and<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The allies return with prisoners of war</note> Hyrcanian horsemen came in, bringing both horses and men that they had taken. For they had spared the lives of all who had surrendered their arms.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they had ridden up, <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked them first whether his men were all safe. And when they answered this in the affirmative, he asked how they had fared. And they narrated to him what they had accomplished and proudly told how gallantly they had behaved in every particular.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And he listened with pleasure to all they wished to tell him, and then he praised them in these words:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;It is quite evident that you have conducted yourselves as brave men; and any one can see it, for you appear taller and handsomer and more terrible to look upon than heretofore.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he enquired of them further how far they had ridden and whether the country was inhabited. And they replied, first, that they had ridden a long way, and second, that all the country was inhabited and that it was full of sheep and goats, cattle and horses, grain and all sorts of produce.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;There are two things,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that it were<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">What to do with these prisoners</note> well for us to look out for: that we make ourselves masters of those who own this property, and that they stay where they are. For an inhabited country is a very valuable possession, but a land destitute of people becomes likewise destitute of produce.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Those, therefore, who tried to keep you off, you slew, I know; and you did right. For this is the best way to conserve the fruits of victory. But those who surrendered you have brought as prisoners of war. Now, if we should let them go, we should, I think, do what would be in itself an advantage.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For, in the first place, we should not have to keep watch against them nor should we have to keep watch over them, nor yet to furnish them with food; for, of course, we do not mean to let them starve to death; and in the second place, if we let them go, we shall have more prisoners of war than if we do not.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>For, if we are masters of the country, all they that dwell therein will be our prisoners of war; and the rest, when they see these alive and set at liberty, will stay in their places and choose to submit rather than to fight. This, then, is my proposition; but if any one else sees a better plan, let him speak.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when they heard his proposal they agreed to adopt it.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, <persName>Cyrus</persName> called the prisoners together and spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>&ldquo;My men,&rdquo; said<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> offers them their liberty</note> he, &ldquo;you have now saved your lives by your submission; and in the future also, if you continue to be obedient, no change whatever shall come to you except that you shall not have the same ruler over you as before; but you shall dwell in the same houses and work the same farms; you shall live with the same wives and have control of your children just as now.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>But you shall not have to fight either us or any one else; but when any one injures you, we will fight for you; and that no one may even ask military service of you, bring your arms to us. And those that bring them shall have peace, and what we promise shall be done without guile. But as many as fail to deliver up their weapons of war, against these we ourselves shall take the field immediately.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>But if any one of you comes to us in a friendly way and shows that he is dealing fairly with us and giving us information, we shall treat him as our benefactor and friend and not as a slave. Accept these assurances for yourselves, and convey them to the rest also.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>But if,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;while, you are willing to accept these terms of submission, some others are not, do you lead us against them that you may be their masters and not they yours.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke and they did obeisance and promised to do what he directed.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they were gone, <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;Medes<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">General orders for dinner</note> and Armenians, it is now high time for us all to go to dinner; and everything necessary has been prepared for you to the best of our ability. Go, then, and send to us half of the bread that has been baked&mdash;enough has been made for all; but do not send us any meat nor anything to drink; for enough has been provided for us at our own quarters.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you, Hyrcanians,&rdquo; he said to these, &ldquo;lead them to their several tents&mdash;the officers to the largest (you know which they are), and the rest as you think best. And you yourselves also may dine where it best pleases you. For your own tents also are safe and sound, and there also the same provision has been made as for these.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And all of you may be assured of this, that we shall keep the night-watches for you outside the camp, but do you look out for what may happen in the tents and have your arms stacked conveniently; for the men in the tents are not yet our friends.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the Medes and Tigranes and his men bathed, changed their clothes (for they were provided with a change), and went to dinner. Their horses also were provided for.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of the bread, half was sent to the Persians; but neither meat for relish nor wine was sent, for they thought that <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his men had those articles left in abundance. But what <persName>Cyrus</persName> meant was that hunger was their relish and that they could drink from the river that flowed by.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, when <persName>Cyrus</persName> had seen that the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How the night was spent by the Persians</note> Persians had their dinner, he sent many of them out, when it was dark, in squads of five and ten, with orders to lie in hiding round about the camp; for he thought that they would serve as sentinels, in case any one should come to attack from the outside, and at the same time that they would catch any one who tried to run away with his possessions. And it turned out so; for many did try to run away, and many were caught.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> permitted those who effected the capture to keep the spoil, but the men he bade them slay; and so after that you could not easily have found, had you tried, any one attempting to get away by night.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, the Persians employed their time;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">by the Medes</note> but the Medes drank and revelled and listened to the music of the flute and indulged themselves to the full with all sorts of merry-making. For many things that contribute to pleasure had been captured, so that those who stayed awake were at no loss for something to do.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the night in which <persName>Cyrus</persName> had marched out,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">by Cyaxares</note> Cyaxares, the king of the Medes, and his messmates got drunk in celebration of their success; and he supposed that the rest of the Medes were all in camp except a few, for he heard a great racket. For inasmuch as their masters had gone off, the servants of the Medes were drinking and carousing without restraint, especially as they had taken from the Assyrian army wine and many other supplies.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when it was day and no one came to his headquarters except those who had been dining with him, and when he heard that the camp was forsaken by the Medes and the cavalry, and when he discovered on going out that such was really the case, then he fumed and raged against both <persName>Cyrus</persName> and the Medes because they had gone off and left him deserted. And straightway, in keeping with his reputation for being violent and unreasonable, he ordered one of those present to take his own cavalry corps and proceed at topmost speed to <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army and deliver the following message:
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I should think that even you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king's message to <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> would not have shown such want of consideration toward me; and if <persName>Cyrus</persName> were so minded, I should think that at least you Medes would not have consented to leave me thus deserted. And now, if <persName>Cyrus</persName> will, let him come with you; if not, do you at least return to me as speedily as possible.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was his message. But he to whom he gave the marching order said: &ldquo;And how shall I find them, your majesty?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;did <persName>Cyrus</persName> and those with him find those against whom they went?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;by Zeus, I am told that some Hyrcanians who had deserted from the enemy came hither and went away as his guides.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon hearing this, Cyaxares was much more angry than ever with <persName>Cyrus</persName> for not even having told him that, and he sent off in greater haste to recall the Medes, for he hoped to strip him of his forces; and with even more violent threats than before, he ordered the Medes to return. And he threatened the messenger also if he did not deliver his message in all its emphasis.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, the officer assigned to this duty set out with his cavalry, about a hundred in number, vexed with himself for not having gone along with <persName>Cyrus</persName> when he went. And as they proceeded on their journey, they were misled by a certain by-path and so lost their way and did not reach the army of their friends, until they fell in with some deserters from the Assyrians and compelled them to act as their guides. And so they came in sight of the camp-fires sometime about midnight.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And when they came up to the camp, the sentinels, following the instructions of <persName>Cyrus</persName>, refused to admit them before daylight.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now at peep of day the first thing that <persName>Cyrus</persName> did was to call the magi and bid them select the gifts ordained for the gods in acknowledgment of such success;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>and they proceeded to attend to this, while he called the peers together and said: &ldquo;Friends, God holds out before us many blessings. But we Persians are, under the present circumstances, too few to avail ourselves of them. For if we fail to guard what we win, it will again become the property of others; and if we leave some of our own men to guard what falls into our possession, it will very soon be found out that we have no strength.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, I have decided that one of you should<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> sends to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> for reinforcements</note> go with all speed to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, present my message and ask them to send reinforcements with the utmost dispatch, if the Persians desire to have control of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and the revenues accruing therefrom.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Do you, therefore, go, for you are the senior officer, and when you arrive tell them this; and say also that for whatever soldiers they send I will provide maintenance after they come. Conceal from them nothing in regard to what we have, and you see for yourself what there is. And what portion of these spoils honour and the law require that I should send to Persia&mdash;in regard to what is due the gods, ask my father; in regard to what is due to the State, ask the authorities. And let them send men also to observe what we do and to answer our questions. And you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;make ready and take your own platoon to escort you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this he called in the Medes also and<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king's message is received</note> at the same moment the messenger from Cyaxares presented himself and in the presence of all reported his king's anger against <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his threats against the Medes; and at the last he said that Cyaxares ordered the Medes to return, even if <persName>Cyrus</persName> wished to stay.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On hearing the messenger, therefore, the Medes were silent, for they were at a loss how they could disobey him when he summoned them, and they asked themselves in fear how they could obey him when he threatened so, especially as they had had experience of his fury.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>But <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;Well, Sir Messenger and you Medes, inasmuch as Cyaxares saw in our first encounter that the enemy were numerous and as he does not know how we have been faring, I am not at all surprised that he is concerned for us and for himself. But when he discovers that many of the enemy have been slain and all have been routed, in the first place he will banish his fears and in the second place he will realize that he is not deserted now, when his friends are annihilating his enemies.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But further, how do we deserve any blame, since we have been doing him good service and have not been doing even that on our own motion? But I, for my part, first got his consent to march out and take you with me; while you did not ask whether you might join the expedition and you are not here now because you desired to make such an expedition, but because you were ordered by him to make it&mdash;whoever of you was not averse to it. This wrath, therefore, I am quite sure, will be assuaged by our successes and will be gone with the passing of his fear.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now, therefore, Sir Messenger,&rdquo; said he,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s plans to meet the crisis</note> &ldquo;take some rest, for you must be fatigued, and since we are expecting the enemy to come either to surrender, or possibly to fight, let us, fellow-Persians, get into line in as good order as possible; for if we present such as appearance, it is likely that we shall better promote the accomplishment of what we desire. And you, king of Hyrcania, be pleased to order the commanders of your forces to get them under arms, and then attend me here.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the Hyrcanian had done so and returned, <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;I am delighted, king of Hyrcania, to see that you not only show me your friendship by your presence, but also that you evidently possess good judgment. And now it is evident that our interests are identical. For the Assyrians are enemies to me, and now they are still more hostile to you than to me.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Under these circumstances, we must both take counsel that none of the allies now present shall desert us, and also that, if we can, we may secure other allies besides. Now you heard the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName> recalling the cavalry; and if they go away, we only, the infantry, shall be left.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, it is necessary for you and for me to do all we can to make this man also who is recalling them desire to remain with us himself. Do you, therefore, find and assign to him a tent where he will have the best kind of a time, with everything he wants; while I, for my part, will try to assign him some post that he himself would rather fill than go away. And do you have a talk with him and tell him what wealth we have hopes that all our friends will obtain, if we are successful in this; and when you have done this, come back again to me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, the Hyrcanian took the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName> and went away to a tent. And then the officer who was going to leave for <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> presented himself ready to start. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> commissioned him to tell the Persians what has been set forth in the foregoing narrative and also to deliver a letter to Cyaxares. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish to read my message to you also, that you may understand its contents and confirm the facts, if he asks you anything in reference to them.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the contents of the letter ran as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My Dear Cyaxares:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We have not left you deserted; for no one<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s answer to Cyaxares</note> is deserted by his friends at a time when he is conquering his enemies. We do not even think that we have brought you into any danger through our departure; but we maintain that the farther away we are, the greater the security we provide for you.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For it is not those who sit down nearest to their friends that provide them with the greatest security; but it is those who drive the enemy farthest away that help their friends most effectually out of danger.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And consider how I have acted toward you and how you have acted toward me, and yet in spite of all, you are finding fault with me. At all events, I brought you allies&mdash;not merely as many as you persuaded to come, but as many as ever I had it in my power to bring; whereas you gave to me, when I was on friendly soil, as many as I could persuade to join me, and now when I am in the enemy's territory you are recalling not merely those who may be willing to leave me, but all my men.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Indeed, I thought at that time that I was under obligation both to you and to your men; but now you are acting so as to force me to leave you out of consideration and to try to devote all my gratitude to those who have followed me.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;However, I cannot on my part treat you in the same spirit as you treat me, but at this very moment I am sending to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> for reinforcements, with directions that as many as shall come to join me shall be at your service, if you need them for anything before we return, not as they may be pleased to serve, but as you may wish to employ them.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Furthermore, although I am a younger man than you, let me advise you not to take back what you have once given, lest ill-will be your due instead of gratitude, nor to summon with threats those whom you would have come to you quickly; and again let me advise you not to employ threats against large numbers, while at the same time you assert that you are deserted, for fear you teach them to pay no attention to you.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;We shall try, however, to come to you just as soon as we have accomplished what we think it would be a common benefit to you and to us to have done.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Farewell.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName>.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Deliver this to him and whatever he asks<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Final directions to his envoy</note> you in regard to these matters, answer him in keeping with what is written. And you can do this with perfect truth, for my instructions to you in regard to the Persians correspond exactly with what is written in my letter.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke to him and giving him the letter sent him away, adding the injunction that he should make haste as one who knows that it is important to be back again promptly.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this moment he observed that all&mdash;both the Medes and the Hyrcanians and Tigranes's men&mdash;were already under arms, and the Persians also stood under arms. And some of the natives from near by were already delivering up horses and arms.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And the javelins he commanded them to throw down in the same place as in the former instance,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">IV. ii. 33</note> and they whose task this was burned all that they did not themselves need. But as for the horses, he commanded those who brought them to keep them and wait until he sent them word. Then he called in the officers of the cavalry and of the Hyrcanians and spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Friends and allies, do not wonder that I call you together so often. For our present situation is novel, and many things about it are in an unorganized condition; and whatever lacks organization must necessarily always cause us trouble until it is reduced to order.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;We now have much spoil that we have taken,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Medes and Hyrcanians directed to divide the spoils</note> and men besides. But, as we do not know how much of it belongs to each one of us, and as the captives do not know who are their several masters, it is consequently impossible to see very many of them attending to their duty, for almost all are in doubt as to what they are expected to do.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>In order, therefore, that this may not go on so, divide the spoil; and whoever has been assigned a tent with plenty of food and drink and people to serve him, and bedding and clothing and other things with which a soldier's tent should be furnished so as to be comfortable&mdash;in such a case nothing more need be added, except that he who has received it should be given to understand that he must take care of it as his own. But if any one has got into quarters that lack something, do you make a note of it and supply the want.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>And I am sure that what is left over will be considerable, for the enemy had more of everything than is required by our numbers. Furthermore, the treasurers, both of the Assyrian king and of the other monarchs, have come to me to report that they have gold coin in their possession, by which they referred to certain payments of tribute.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Notify them, therefore, to deliver all this also to you, wherever you have your headquarters. And give that man reason to fear who shall not do as you command. And do you take the money and pay it out to the cavalry and infantry in the proportion of two to one, in order that you may all have the wherewithal to buy whatever you still may need.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Further,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;let the herald proclaim that no one shall interfere with the market in the camp, but that the hucksters may sell what each of them has for sale and, when they have disposed of that, get in a new stock, that our camp may be supplied.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And they proceeded at once to issue the proclamation. But the Medes and Hyrcanians asked: &ldquo;How could we divide this spoil without help from you and your men?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> in turn answered their question as follows: &ldquo;Why, my good men, do you really suppose that we must all be present to oversee everything that has to be done, and that I shall not be competent in case of need to do anything on your behalf, nor you again on ours? How else could we make more trouble and accomplish less than in this way?
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you must look to it, for we have kept it for you and you must have confidence in us that we have kept it well; now for your part, do you divide it, and we shall have the same confidence in your dividing it fairly.
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>And there is something more that we, on our part, shall try to gain for the common advantage. For here,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> asks for the horses for his Persians</note> you observe, first of all, how many horses we have right now, and more are being brought in. If we leave them without riders, they will be of no use to us but will only give us the trouble of looking after them; but if we put riders upon them, we shall at the same time be rid of the trouble and add strength to ourselves.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>If, therefore, you have others to whom you would rather give them and with whom you would rather go into danger, if need should be, than with us, offer them the horses. If, however, you should wish to have us as your comrades in preference to others, give them to us.
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>And I have good reasons for asking; for just now when you rode on into danger without us, you filled us with apprehension lest something should happen to you and made us very much ashamed because we were not at your side. But if we get the horses, we shall follow you next time.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>And if it seems that we are of more use to you by fighting with you on horseback, in that case we shall not fail for want of courage. But if it seems that by turning footmen again we could assist to better advantage, it will be open to us to dismount and at once stand by you as foot soldiers; and as for the horses, we shall manage to find some one to whom we may entrust them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke, and they made answer: &ldquo;Well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, we have no men whom we could mount upon these horses; and if we had, we should not choose to make any other disposition of them, since this is what you desire. So now,&rdquo; they added, &ldquo;take them and do as you think best.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I accept them; may good<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He suggests suitable gifts for others</note> fortune attend our turning into horsemen and your dividing the common spoils. In the first place, set apart for the gods whatever the magi direct, as they interpret the will of the gods. Next select for Cyaxares also whatever you think would be most acceptable to him.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They laughed and said that they would have to choose women for him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Choose women then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and whatever else you please. And when you have made your choice for him, then do you Hyrcanians do all you can to see that all those who volunteered to follow me have no cause to complain.
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And do you Medes, in your turn, show honour to those who first became our allies, that they may think that they have been well advised in becoming our friends. And allot his proper share of everything to the envoy who came from Cyaxares and to those who attended him; and invite him also to stay on with us (and give him to understand that this is my pleasure also), so that he may know better the true state of things and report the facts to Cyaxares concerning each particular.
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>As for the Persians with<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persians will be content with what is left</note> me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is left after you are amply provided for will suffice for us; for we have not been reared in any sort of luxury, but altogether in rustic fashion, so that you would perhaps laugh at us, if anything gorgeous were to be put upon us, even as we shall, I know, furnish you no little cause for laughter when we are seated upon our horses, and, I presume,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;when we fall off upon the ground.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hereupon they proceeded to the division of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The spoils are divided</note> the spoil, laughing heartily at his joke about the Persian horsemanship, while he called his captains and ordered them to take the horses and the grooms and the trappings of the horses, and to count them off and divide them by lot so that they should each have an equal share for each company.
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And again <persName>Cyrus</persName> ordered proclamation to be<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> finds squires for his Persians</note> made that if there were any one from Media or <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7016612">Bactria</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> or anywhere else forced into service as a slave in the army of the Assyrians or Syrians or Arabians, he should show himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>And when they heard the herald's proclamation, many came forward gladly. And he selected the finest looking of them and told them that they should be made free, but that they would have to act as carriers of any arms given them to carry; and for their sustenance he himself, he said, would make provision.
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so he led them at once to his captains and presented them, bidding his men give them their shields and swords without belts, that they might carry them and follow after the horses. Furthermore, he bade his captains draw rations for them just as for the Persians under him. The Persians, moreover, he bade always ride on horseback with their corselets and lances, and he himself set the example of doing so. He also instructed each one of the newly-mounted officers to appoint some other peer to take his place of command over the infantry of the peers.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, they were occupied. Meanwhile<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The arrival of Gobryas</note> Gobryas, an Assyrian, a man well advanced in years, came up on horseback with a cavalry escort; and they all carried cavalry weapons. And those who were assigned to the duty of receiving the weapons ordered them to surrender their spears, that they might burn them as they had done with the rest. But Gobryas said that he wished to see <persName>Cyrus</persName> first. Then the officers left the rest of the horsemen there, but Gobryas they conducted to <persName>Cyrus</persName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when he saw <persName>Cyrus</persName>, he spoke as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Sire, I am by birth an Assyrian; I have also<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His story</note> a castle, and wide are the domains which I govern. I have also about a thousand horse which I used to put at the disposal of the Assyrian king, and I used to be his most devoted friend. But since he has been slain by you, excellent man that he was, and since his son, who is my worst enemy, has succeeded to his crown, I have come to you and fall a suppliant at your feet. I offer myself to be your vassal and ally and ask that you will be my avenger; and thus, in the only way I may, I make you my son, for I have no male child more.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For he who was my son, my only son, a beautiful and brave young man, Sire, and one who loved me and paid me the filial reverence that would make a father happy&mdash;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">1.The grief-stricken father's recital is broken with sobs; the sentences begun are never finished.</note> him this present king&mdash; when the old king, the father of the present ruler, invited my son to his court purposing to give him his daughter in marriage&mdash;and I let him go; for I was proud that, as I flattered myself, I should see my son wedded to the king's daughter&mdash;then, I say, the man who is now king invited him to go hunting with him and gave him permission to do his best in the chase, for he thought that he himself was a much better rider than my son. And my boy went hunting with him as his friend, and when a bear came out, they both gave chase and the present ruler let fly his javelin but missed. Oh! would to God he had not! Then my son threw (as he should not have done) and brought down the bear.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And then that man was vexed, to be sure, as it proved, but covered his jealousy in darkness. But when again a lion appeared, he missed again. There was nothing remarkable in that, so far as I can see; but again a second time my son hit his mark and killed the lion and cried, &lsquo;Have I not thrown twice in succession and brought an animal down each time!&rsquo; Then that villain no<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The murder of his son</note> longer restrained his jealous wrath but, snatching a spear from one of the attendants, smote him in the breast&mdash;my son, my only, well-loved son&mdash;and took away his life.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And I, unhappy I, received back a corpse instead of a bridegroom, and, old man that I am, I buried with the first down upon his cheeks my best, my well-beloved son. But the murderer, as if he had slain an enemy, has never shown any repentance, nor has he, to make amends for his wicked deed, ever deigned to show any honour to him beneath the earth. His father, however, expressed his sorrow for me and showed that he sympathized with me in my affliction.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And so, if he were living, I should never have come to you in a way to do him harm; for I have received many kindnesses at his hands and I have done him many services. But since the sceptre has passed on to the murderer of my son, I could never be loyal to him and I am sure that he would never regard me as a friend. For he knows how I feel toward him and how dark my life now is, though once it was so bright; for now i am forsaken and am spending my old age in sorrow.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If, therefore, you will receive me and I may find some hope of getting with your help some vengeance for my dear son, I think that I should find my youth again and, if I live, I should no longer live in shame; and if I die, I think that I should die without a regret.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke; and <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered: &ldquo;Well,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> and Gobryas make a compact</note> Gobryas, if you prove that you really mean all that you say to us, I not only receive you as a suppliant, but promise you with the help of the gods to avenge the murder of your son. But tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if we do this for you and let you keep your castle and your province and the power which you had before, what service will you do us in return for that?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;The castle,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I will give you for your quarters when you come; the tribute of the province, which before I used to pay to him, I will pay to you; and whithersoever you march I will march with you at the head of the forces of my province. Besides,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a daughter, a maiden well-beloved and already ripe for marriage. I used once to think that I was rearing her to be the bride of the present king. But now my daughter herself has besought me with many tears not to give her to her brother's murderer; and I am so resolved myself. And now I leave it to you to deal with her as I shall prove to deal with you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;According as what you have said is true,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> then made answer, &ldquo;I give you my right hand and take yours. The gods be our witnesses.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When this was done he bade Gobryas go and keep his arms; he also asked him how far it was to his place, for he meant to go there. And he said: &ldquo;If you start to-morrow early in the morning, you would spend the night of the second day with us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With these words he was gone, leaving a guide behind. And then the Medes came in, after they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How the spoils were divided</note> had delivered to the magi what the magi had directed them to set apart for the gods. And they had selected for <persName>Cyrus</persName> the most splendid tent and the lady of Susa, who was said to be the most beautiful woman in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and two of the most accomplished music-girls; and afterward they had selected for Cyaxares the next best. They had also supplied themselves with such other things as they needed, so that they might continue the campaign in want of nothing; for there was an abundance of everything.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And the Hyrcanians also took what they wanted; and they made the messenger from Cyaxares share alike with them. And all the tents that were left over they delivered to <persName>Cyrus</persName> for the use of his Persians. The coin they said they would divide, as soon as it was all collected; and this they did.</p></div1>
<div1 type="Book" n="5"><p>
<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such were their words and deeds. Then <persName>Cyrus</persName> ordered the men whom he knew to be Cyaxares's most intimate friends to divide among themselves the keeping of the king's portion of the booty. &ldquo;And<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s disposal of his prizes</note> what you offer me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I accept with pleasure; but it shall always be at the service of any one of you who at any time is most in need of it.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If you please, then, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said one of the Medes who was fond of music, &ldquo;when I listened last evening to the music-girls whom you now have, I was entranced; and if you will give me one of them, I should, I think, be more happy to go to war with you than to stay at home.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I will not only give her to you, but I believe that I am under greater obligation to you for your asking than you to me for receiving her; so thirsty am I to do you favours.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So he that asked received her.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then <persName>Cyrus</persName> called to him Araspas, a Mede, who had been his friend from boyhood&mdash;the same one to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">I. iv. 26</note> whom he had given his Median robe when he laid it off as he was returning from Astyages's court to Persia&mdash;and bade him keep for him both the lady and the tent.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now this woman was the wife of Abradatas of <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>; and when the Assyrian camp was taken, her husband happened not to be there, having gone on an embassy to the king of <placeName key="tgn,7016612">Bactria</placeName>; for the Assyrian king had sent him thither to negotiate an alliance, because he chanced to be a guest-friend of the Bactrian king. This, then, was the lady that <persName>Cyrus</persName> placed in the charge of Araspas, until such a time as he himself should take her.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And when he received this commission Araspas asked: &ldquo;And<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Araspas describes Panthea</note> have you seen the lady, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, whom you give into my keeping?&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;not I.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But I have,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I saw her when we selected her for you. And when we went into her tent, upon my word, we did not at first distinguish her from the rest; for she sat upon the ground and all her handmaids sat around her. And she was dressed withal just like her servants; but when we looked round upon them all in our desire to make out which one was the mistress, at once her superiority to all the rest was evident, even though she sat veiled, with her head bowed to the earth.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But when we bade her rise, all her attendants stood up with her, and then was she conspicuous among them both for her stature and for her nobility and her grace, even though she stood there in lowly garb. And she could not hide her tears as they fell, some down her dress, some even to her feet.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Then, when the oldest man in our company said: &lsquo;Have no fear, lady; for though we understand that your husband also is a noble man, yet we are choosing you out for a man who, be assured, is not his inferior either in comeliness or intelligence or power, but, as we at least think, if there is any man in the world who deserves admiration, that man is <persName>Cyrus</persName>; and his you shall henceforth be.' Now when the lady heard that, she rent her outer garment from top to bottom and wept aloud; and her servants also cried aloud with her.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And then we had vision of most of her face and vision of her neck and arms. And let me tell you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it seemed to me, as it did to all the rest who saw her, that there never was so beautiful a woman of mortal birth in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you must by all means see her for yourself.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;and all the less,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> declines to visit her</note> if she is as beautiful as you say.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked the young man.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if now I have heard from you that she is beautiful and am inclined just by your account of her to go and gaze on her, when I have no time to spare, I am afraid that she will herself much more readily persuade me to come again to gaze on her. And in consequence of that I might sit there, in neglect of my duties, idly gazing upon her.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said the young man breaking<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Araspas maintains that love is a matter of will</note> into a laugh, &ldquo;you do not think, do you, that human beauty is able to compel a man against his will to act contrary to his own best interests? Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if that were a law of nature, it would compel us all alike.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Do you observe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how fire burns all alike? That is its nature. But of beautiful things we love some and some we do not; and one loves one, another another; for it is a matter of free will, and each one loves what he pleases. For example, a brother does not fall in love with his sister, but somebody else falls in love with her; neither does a father fall in love with his daughter, but somebody else does; for fear of God and the law of the land are sufficient to prevent such love.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if a law should be passed forbidding those who did not eat to be hungry, those who did not drink to be thirsty, forbidding people to be cold in winter or hot in summer, no such law could ever bring men to obey its provisions, for they are so constituted by nature as to be subject to the control of such circumstances. But love is a matter of free will; at any rate, every one loves what suits his taste, as he does his clothes or shoes.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How then, pray,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;if falling in<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> maintains that it is a kind of slavery</note> love is a matter of free will, is it not possible for any one to stop whenever he pleases? But I have seen people in tears of sorrow because of love and in slavery to the objects of their love, even though they believed before they fell in love that slavery is a great evil; I have seen them give those objects of their love many things that they could ill afford to part with; and I have seen people praying to be delivered from love just as from any other disease, and, for all that, unable to be delivered from it, but fettered by a stronger necessity than if they had been fettered with shackles of iron. At any rate, they surrender themselves to those they love to perform for them many services blindly. And yet, in spite of all their misery, they do not attempt to run away, but even watch their darlings to keep them from running away.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the young man answered; &ldquo;there are<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Araspas claims that only the weakling is enslaved</note> some who do so; but such are wretched weaklings, and because of their slavery, I think, they constantly pray that they may die, because they are so unhappy; but, though there are ten thousand possible ways of getting rid of life, they do not get rid of it. And this very same sort attempt also to steal and do not keep their hands off other people's property; but when they commit robbery or theft, you see that you are the first to accuse the thief and the robber, because it was not necessary to steal, and you do not pardon him, but you punish him.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Now in this same way, the beautiful do not compel people to fall in love with them nor to desire that which they should not, but there are some miserable apologies for men who are slaves to all sorts of passions, I think, and then they blame love. But the high-minded and the good, though they also have a desire for money and good horses and beautiful women, have the power to let all that alone so as not to touch anything beyond the limit of what is right.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>At any rate,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I have seen this lady and though she seemed to me surpassingly beautiful, still I am here with you, I practise horsemanship, and I do everything else that it is my duty to do.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;for you came away perhaps in less time than love takes, as its nature is, to get a man ensnared. For, you know, it is possible for a man to put his finger in the fire and not be burned at once, and wood does not burst at once into flame; still, for my part, I neither put my hand into the fire nor look upon the beautiful, if I can help it. And I advise you, too, Araspas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not to let your eyes linger upon the fair; for fire, to be sure, burns only those who touch it, but beauty insidiously kindles a fire even in those who gaze upon it from afar, so that they are inflamed with passion.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Never fear, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;even if I never cease to look upon her, I shall never be so overcome as to do anything that I ought not.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Your professions,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are most excellent. Keep her then, as I bid you, and take good care of her; for this lady may perhaps be of very great service to us when the time comes.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this conversation, then, they separated.<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He falls in love</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as the young man found the lady so beautiful and at the same time came to know her goodness and nobility of character, as he attended her and thought he pleased her, and then also as he saw that she was not ungrateful but always took care by the hands of her own servants not only that he should find whatever he needed when he came in, but that, if he ever fell sick, he should suffer no lack of attention&mdash;in consequence of all this, he fell desperately in love with her; and what happened to him was perhaps not at all surprising. Thus matters began to take this turn.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName>, however, wishing to have his Medes<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> calls upon the Medes to answer Cyaxares</note> and allies stay with him voluntarily, called a meeting of all his staff-officers, and when they were come together he spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>&ldquo;Men of Media and all here present, I am very sure that you came out with me, not because you desired to get money by it nor because you thought that in this you were doing Cyaxares a service; but it was to me that you wished to do this favour, and it was out of regard for me that you were willing to make the night-march and to brave dangers with me.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>For this also I thank you&mdash;I should be in the wrong not to do so; but I do not think that I am as yet in a position to make you an adequate return, and this I am not ashamed to say. But let me assure you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I should be ashamed to say &lsquo;if you will stay with me, I will make you a proper return;&rsquo; for I think it would look as if I were saying it merely to make you more willing to stay with me. Instead of that, this is what I mean: even though you go back now in obedience to Cyaxares, still, if I achieve any success, I shall try so to act that you also will praise me.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>For as to myself, I certainly am not going back, but I will be true to the oaths and the pledges which I gave the Hyrcanians, and I will never be caught playing them false; and I will also endeavour so to conduct myself that Gobryas, who is now offering us both his castle and his country and his forces, shall not repent his coming to us.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>And above all, now that the gods are so manifestly blessing our efforts, I should fear to offend them, and I should be ashamed in their sight to go away without good reason and leave what they have bestowed. Thus, therefore, I propose to act,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and do you also do as you judge to be best, and tell me what your decision is.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke. And the first one to reply was<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Artabazus leads the movement to stay I. iv. 27-28</note> the man who had once upon a time claimed to be a kinsman of <persName>Cyrus</persName>. &ldquo;For my part, O my king,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;for to me you seem to be a born king no less than is the sovereign of the bees in a hive. For as the bees always willingly obey the queen-bee and not one of them deserts the place where she stays; and as not one fails to follow her if she goes anywhere else&mdash;so marvellous a yearning to be ruled by her is innate to them;
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>so also do men seem to me to be drawn by something like the same sort of instinct toward you. And of that we have proof; for when you started to return from our country to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">I. iv. 25-28</note> <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, what man of the Medes either young or old failed to follow you, until Astyages made us turn back? And when you hastened to our aid from <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, we saw that almost all your friends followed with you of their own free will. Again, when you wished to come out on this expedition, all the Medes volunteered to follow you.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And now, too, this is our feeling, so that with you we are not afraid even in the enemy's land, while without you we are afraid even to return home. Now the rest may tell for themselves what they mean to do. But as for me, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I, with the men whom I command, will remain with you and endure the sight of you and tolerate your goodness to us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Following him, Tigranes spoke as follows: &ldquo;<persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you need never be surprised when I fail to speak. For my mind has been disciplined not to offer counsel but to do what you command.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, Medes,&rdquo; said the Hyrcanian king, &ldquo;if you should go away now, I should say that it was the plot of the evil one to prevent your becoming exceedingly blest. For, in all common sense, who would turn away from the enemy when they are in flight, or refuse to take their arms when they surrender them, or their persons and property when they offer them&mdash;especially under such a leader as we have? For, I swear to you by all the gods, he seems to me happier in doing us kindnesses than in enriching himself.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Following him, all the Medes spoke to this<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The whole Median contingent stays with <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> effect: &ldquo;It is you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that have brought us out here, and when you think the time to return has come, lead us back with you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard that, he uttered this prayer: &ldquo;Hear me, I beseech thee, O Zeus almighty, and grant that in service to them I may surpass the honour they show to me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon he commanded the rest to station guards and after that to do for themselves whatever they pleased; and the Persians he bade divide the tents among themselves&mdash;to the cavalry the ones appropriate to their use and to the infantry such as sufficed for their needs&mdash;and to arrange matters so that the commissaries in the tents should do all that was required of them, prepare everything necessary, and carry it to the quarters of the Persians, and have their horses groomed and fed, and that the Persians should have no duty other than to practise the arts of war.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus they spent that day.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Rising early the next morning they started&mdash;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persian army visits Gobryas</note> <persName>Cyrus</persName>, on horseback, with those of the Persians who had been transformed into cavalrymen, to the number of about two thousand&mdash;to visit Gobryas. And those who carried the horsemen's shields and sabres followed behind them, to the same number; the rest of the army also proceeded in its proper divisions. He ordered the horsemen, each one, to inform their new squires that if any one of them should be seen behind the rear-guard or get in front of the van or be found on the flanks outside the line of march, he should be punished.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Toward evening of the second day they arrived at Gobryas's castle; and they saw that the fortress was exceedingly strong and that everything was ready on the walls so that there might be most effective fighting from them. And they saw many cattle also and a great many sheep driven up under protection of the fortifications.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Gobryas sent to <persName>Cyrus</persName> and bade him ride around and see where access was most easy and send in some of his trusted officers to examine what was inside and report back to him what they saw.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So <persName>Cyrus</persName>, wishing, as a matter of fact, to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gobryas shows him his resources</note> see for himself whether the fort could be stormed in case Gobryas should prove false, rode round on every side and saw that it was everywhere too strong for any one to approach. And those whom he had sent in to Gobryas brought back the report that there were provisions enough inside to last the garrison, as it seemed to them, for a whole generation.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now <persName>Cyrus</persName> was pondering what all this meant, when Gobryas himself came out bringing with him all his followers; and some of them brought out with them wine and flour and barley-meal; others brought cattle, goats, sheep, swine, and all kinds of provisions&mdash;a plenty of everything for a dinner for <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s whole army.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And they whose business it was apportioned it and set about preparing the meal. And when all his men were outside, Gobryas bade <persName>Cyrus</persName> enter, in whatever way he thought he might enter most safely. So <persName>Cyrus</persName> sent in ahead of him some scouts and a part of his forces, and then with this precaution he went in himself. And when he had gone in, keeping the gates wide open, he called to him all his friends and the officers of the troops with him.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And when they were inside, Gobryas brought out golden goblets, pitchers, and vases, all sorts of ornaments, an almost countless pile of darics, and all sorts of treasure in great quantities; and finally he brought out his daughter, a marvel of beauty and stature, but in mourning for her brother who was dead;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">IV. vi. 2f.</note> and he said: &ldquo;These treasures, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I present to you, and this my daughter I entrust to you to make what disposal of her you may see fit. But we make our prayer to you, I, as I have done already, that you avenge my son, and she that you be the avenger of her brother.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName> in reply to this, &ldquo;I promised<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> renews his covenant with Gobryas</note> you even then that, assuming that you did not speak me false, I should do all in my power to avenge you; and now, when I see that you are truthful, my promise is already due; and I promise her likewise that with heaven's help I will fulfil my promise to the letter.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now as to these treasures,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I accept them, but I give them again to your daughter here and the man who shall marry her. But one gift of yours will I take as I leave you, in place of which not even all the wealth of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> (and that is enormous)&mdash;no, not even all the wealth of all the world would send me away more happy than with this gift from you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And Gobryas, wondering what he meant and suspecting that he meant his daughter, asked: &ldquo;And what might that gift be, <persName>Cyrus</persName>?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Gobryas,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is this: I believe that there are many men who would not consent to be wicked or unjust or false, but they die before it is ever discovered what sort of men they are, simply because no one has ever seen fit to entrust them with great wealth or kingly power or mighty fortresses or lovely children;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>but you have now placed in my hands your fortress and all sorts of wealth, your forces and your precious child, and have thus given me an opportunity of showing to all the world that I would not do an act of wickedness against a friend or do a wrong for the sake of gain or willingly prove false to a covenant.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And so long as I am an honest man and receive men's approbation as bearing this reputation, I assure you that I shall never forget this proof of your confidence but shall try to show you all fair honour in return.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And as for your daughter,&rdquo; he continued,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s pledge for the daughter of Gobryas</note> &ldquo;do not fear that you shall fail to find a husband worthy of her; for I have many noble friends; some one of them will marry her. But whether he will have as much money as you are ready to give me or even many times as much, I could not say. Let me tell you, however, that there are some of them who do not admire you one whit the more for the money you have to offer; but with me they are vying now and praying to all the gods that it may be granted them one day to prove that they are not less faithful to their friends than I, and that so long as they live they would never yield to their enemies, unless some god should cross them. But their virtue and their good name they would not barter for all your wealth and the wealth of the Assyrians and Syrians to boot. Such men, let me tell you, are sitting here.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By the gods, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said Gobryas with a laugh, &ldquo;please show me where they are, that I may ask you for one of them to be my son-in-law.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;There will be no need of your getting that information from me,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;but, if you will go with us, you will be able yourself to point each one of them out to somebody else.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had thus spoken, he clasped<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gobryas is impressed by the simple life</note> Gobryas's right hand in his and rose to depart, taking with him all his followers. And though Gobryas urged him to dine in the castle, he declined, but dined in camp and took Gobryas with him as his guest.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And as he reclined upon a mat of straw he asked this question: &ldquo;Tell me, Gobryas, do you think you have more coverlets than each one of us?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I am perfectly sure, by Zeus,&rdquo; the other answered, &ldquo;that you have more coverlets and more couches,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Costly coverlets and couches were a special feature of oriental luxury.</note> and that your dwelling is much larger than mine; for you take heaven and earth for your dwelling, and you have as many couches as you can find resting-places on the ground, while you regard as your proper coverlets not wool that sheep produce, but whatever the mountains and plains bring forth.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, as Gobryas dined with them for the first time and saw the simplicity of the food set before them, he thought his own people more refined than they.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>But he soon perceived the temperance of the soldiers who sat at meat with him; for no Persian of the educated class would allow it to appear that he was captivated with any kind of food or drink, either with his eyes gloating over it, or with his hands greedy to get it, or with his thoughts so engrossed by it as to fail to observe things that would attract his attention if he were not at meat; but just as good horsemen do not lose their self-command when on horseback but can ride along and at the same time see and hear and say whatever they should, so also the educated Persians think that at their meals they ought to show themselves sensible and temperate; and to become excited over food or drink seems to them altogether swinish and bestial.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He noticed further about them that they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Plain living and high thinking</note> asked one another such questions as people are more pleased to be asked than not, that they indulged in such banter as is more agreeable to hear than not; he observed how far their jests were removed from insult, how far they were from doing anything unbecoming, and how far from offending one another.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> But what seemed to him most extraordinary of all was that when on active service they did not think they ought to be served with a larger share than any one else of those who were going into the same dangers, but that they considered it the most sumptuous feast to make those who were to be their comrades in arms as efficient as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Gobryas rose to go home, he is reported to have said: &ldquo;I am no longer surprised, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that while we possess more cups and clothing and gold than you, we ourselves are worth less than you are. For our whole thought is to have as much of those things as possible, while your whole thought seems to me to be that you may be yourselves as capable as possible.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke; and <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered: &ldquo;Please see to it, Gobryas, that you are here early in the morning with your cavalry under arms, so that we may see your forces, and then you shall lead us through your country so that we may know what we have to consider as belonging to our friends and what as belonging to our enemies.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they had thus spoken, they went away, each to his own proper task.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When day dawned, Gobryas came with his cavalry and led the way. But <persName>Cyrus</persName>, as became a general, turned his thoughts not only upon the march, but at the same time, as he proceeded, he kept studying the situation to see whether it might be in any way possible to make the enemy weaker or his own side stronger.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>So he called Gobryas and the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> consults with Gobryas and the Hyrcanian king</note> Hyrcanian king to him, for he supposed that they must know best what he thought he needed to learn, and said: &ldquo;My dear friends, I think that I should be making no mistake to consult with you in regard to this war and to rely upon your trustworthiness. For I observe that you have greater need than I to see to it that the Assyrian shall not get the upper hand of us: if I am unsuccessful in this, I shall, perhaps, find some other place of refuge; whereas in your case, I see that if he gains the upper hand, all that you have passes into other hands.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>For, as for me, he is my enemy, not because he hates me, but because he imagines that it would be inimical to his interests for our nation to become great, and for that reason he is making war upon us; but you he actually hates, for he thinks that you have done him wrong.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To this they both answered in the same way, that he should proceed with what he had to say, for they recognized the truth of what he had said and knew that it was a matter of vital concern to them how things turned out in the future.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Then he began as follows: &ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;does the Assyrian king believe that you are the only ones who are hostile to him, or do you know of any one else who is his enemy?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said the Hyrcanian; &ldquo;the Cadusians,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> aims to effect a combination with other enemies of Assyria</note> a large and powerful nation, are most bitter enemies of his; and so are our neighbours, the Sacians, for they have suffered very severely at his hands; for he attempted to subjugate them just as he did us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you think that these two nations would like to join us in an attack upon the Assyrian?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;and right eagerly, if they could find a way to combine their forces with ours.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And what is to hinder such a union of forces?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;The Assyrians,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;the same nation, through whose country you are now marching.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But, Gobryas,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, when he heard this, &ldquo;do you not accuse this young fellow who has just come to the throne of cruel insolence of character?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That judgment, I think,&rdquo; said Gobryas,&rdquo; is warranted by my experience with him.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Pray, are you the only man towards whom he has acted in this way,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked, &ldquo;or are there others also?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said Gobryas; &ldquo;there are<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king and Gadatas</note> others also. But why should I recount his acts of insolence toward the weak? For once when he and the son of a man much more powerful than I were drinking together, a young man who, like my son, was his comrade, he had him seized and castrated; and the occasion, so some people said, was simply because his concubine had praised his friend, remarking how handsome he was and felicitating the woman who should be his wife; but the king himself now maintains that it was because the man had made advances toward his concubine. And so now he is a eunuch, but he has come into the kingdom, for his father is dead.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;do you think that he also would be glad to see us, if he thought we could help him?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Think!&rdquo; said Gobryas, &ldquo;I am sure of it. But, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, it would be difficult to see him.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because, to effect a union of forces with him, one has to march along under the very walls of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, pray,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;is that so difficult?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because, by Zeus,&rdquo; said Gobryas, &ldquo;I know that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Assyrians' terror of <persName>Cyrus</persName> is disappearing</note> the forces that would come out of that city alone are many times as large as your own at present; and let me tell you that the Assyrians are now less inclined than heretofore to deliver up their arms and to bring in their horses to you for the very reason that to those of them who have seen your army it seemed a small one; and a rumour to this effect has now been widely spread abroad. And,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I think we should do better to proceed cautiously.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I think you are right, Gobryas, in admonishing us to march with the utmost caution,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> made answer upon hearing this suggestion from him. &ldquo;But when I think of it, I cannot conceive of any<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes to march straight for <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></note> safer procedure for us than to march directly upon <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, if that is where the main body of the enemy's forces is. For they are, as you say, numerous; and if they take courage, they will also, as I say, give us cause to fear them.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>However, if they do not see us and get the idea that we are keeping out of sight because we are afraid of them, then, let me assure you, they will recover from the fear with which we inspired them; and the longer we keep out of their sight, the greater the courage that will spring up within them in place of that fear. But if we march upon them at once, we shall find many of them still in tears over those whom we have slain, many still wearing bandages on the wounds they received from us, and all still mindful of the daring of this army of ours and of their own flight and defeat.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>And let me assure you, Gobryas,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that your large bodies of men, when they are inspired with confidence, display a spirit that is irresistible; but when once they are frightened, the greater their numbers are, the greater and more overpowering the panic that seizes them.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>For it comes over them increased by the many faint-hearted words they hear and magnified by the many wretched figures and the many dejected and distorted countenances they see; and by reason of the large numbers it is not easy with a speech to quell the panic, nor by a charge against the enemy to inspire them with courage, nor by a retreat to rally their spirits; but the more you try to encourage them to bravery, in so much the greater peril do they think they are.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Again, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us consider<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s grounds for confidence</note> precisely how this matter stands: if, in future, victory on the field of battle is to rest with that side which counts the greater numbers, you have good reason to fear for us and we really are in danger. If, however, battles are still to be decided by good fighting as they have been before, it would not be at all amiss for you to be bold and confident; for, please God, you will find far more men on our side who are eager to fight, than on theirs.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>And to give yourself still more confidence, bethink you also of this: the enemy are much fewer now than they were before we defeated them, much weaker than when they fled before us; while we are bigger now since we have conquered and stronger since you have been added to us. For you must no longer undervalue your own men, now that they are with us; for be assured, Gobryas, that when they are with the victors, even those who follow the camp go along without a fear.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And do not forget this either, that the enemy may find us even now, if they will. And, let me assure you, we could in no possible way strike more terror into them when they do see us, than by marching upon them. As this, therefore, is my conviction, lead us straight on to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As they thus proceeded, they arrived on the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persians prove to Gobryas their generosity</note> fourth day at the boundaries of Gobryas's domains. And as soon as <persName>Cyrus</persName> was in the enemy's country, he arranged in regular order under his own command the infantry and as much of the cavalry as seemed to him best. The rest of the cavalry he sent out to forage, with orders to kill those who were under arms but to bring every one else to him, as well as any cattle they might take. The Persians he ordered to join the foraging party. And many of them were thrown from their horses and came back, but many of them also came bringing a great quantity of plunder.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When all the booty was brought in, he called the peers and the officers of the Medes and Hyrcanians together and addressed them as follows: &ldquo;My friends, Gobryas has entertained us all with great munificence. So, if we should set apart the share of the spoil ordained for the gods and a portion sufficient for the army and give the rest to him, should we not be doing the right thing? For we should be giving immediate proof that we are trying to outdo those who do good to us, in the good we do to them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they heard this they all signified their approval and applauded the proposition; and one of them also spoke as follows: &ldquo;By all means, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us do that. And it would be a good stroke of policy, too; for it seems to me that Gobryas regards us as no better than a lot of beggars because we have not come here with our pockets full of darics and because we do not drink from golden goblets. And if we do this, then he would realize that it is possible for men to be gentlemen, even without gold.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;turn over to the magi what belongs to the gods, set apart for the army its share, and then call Gobryas in and give the rest to him.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So they set aside what was required and gave the rest to Gobryas.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this <persName>Cyrus</persName> renewed his march upon<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Assyrian refuses battle</note> <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, with his army in the same order as when the battle was fought. But as the Assyrians did not march out to meet them, <persName>Cyrus</persName> ordered Gobryas to ride up and say: &ldquo;If the king wishes to come out and fight for his country, I myself would join him and fight for him too; but if the king will not protect his country, then I must needs submit to the victors.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, Gobryas rode to a place where he could safely give his message; and the king sent out a messenger to deliver to Gobryas this reply: &ldquo;This is your sovereign's response to you, Gobryas: &lsquo;I do not regret that I killed your son, but only that I did not kill you, too. And if you and your men wish to fight, come back a month from now. Just at present we have no time to fight, for we are still busy with our preparations.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I only hope that this regret of yours may never cease,&rdquo; Gobryas replied; &ldquo;for it is evident that I have been something of a thorn in your flesh, ever since you began to feel it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Gobryas returned with the Assyrian king's reply, and when <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard it he drew off his army; then summoning Gobryas he said to him: &ldquo;Tell me, you were saying, were you not, that you thought that the prince who was castrated by the Assyrian would be on our side?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, of course;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I feel perfectly sure of it; for he and I have often talked together freely.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, when you think best, go to him;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> plans to gain the secret support of Gadatas</note> but first of all be sure that you meet him alone and in secret; and when you have conferred with him, if you see that he wishes to be our friend, you must manage to keep his friendship a secret. For in time of war one could not in any way do more good to one's friends than by seeming to be their enemy, nor more harm to enemies than by seeming to be their friend.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now mark my word,&rdquo; said Gobryas; &ldquo;I am sure that Gadatas would even pay for the opportunity of doing the present Assyrian king some serious harm. But what harm he could do it is for us on our part to consider.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now tell me this,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;in regard to the fort which stands upon the frontier of the country and which you say was built to serve as a base of operations against the Hyrcanians and the Sacians and an outwork to protect this country in time of war&mdash;do you think that the eunuch, if he went there with his army, would be admitted by the commandant?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes; certainly he would,&rdquo; said Gobryas, &ldquo;if he came to him as unsuspected as he now is.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;if I should make an attack on his fortifications as if I wished to gain possession of them, while he defended himself with all his might; and if I should take something of his and he in turn should capture either some of our other men or some of the messengers I send to those who, you say, are enemies of the Assyrian king; and if these captives should say that they had come out to get an army and ladders to use against the fortress; and if then the eunuch, on hearing this, should pretend that he had come to give warning; under these conditions, he would be unsuspected.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Under such circumstances,&rdquo; answered Gobryas, &ldquo;the commandant would certainly admit him&mdash;aye, and would beg him to remain there until you went away.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;if he could but once get in, he would be in a position to put the fort in our hands?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That is at all events probable,&rdquo; answered Gobryas, &ldquo;if he were within, helping with the preparations, while you on the outside made a vigorous attack.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> replied, &ldquo;go and try to explain these plans to him and win his coo+peration and then return. And no better assurance of our good faith could you give him in word or deed than to show him what you happen to have received at our hands.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon Gobryas went away; and when<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gadatas plays into <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s hands</note> the eunuch saw him, he gladly concurred in all the plans and settled with him the things they were to do.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So, when Gobryas reported back that all the proposals were heartily accepted by the eunuch, on the day following <persName>Cyrus</persName> made his attack and Gadatas his defence. And there was also a fort which <persName>Cyrus</persName> took, as Gadatas had indicated;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>while of the messengers whom <persName>Cyrus</persName> sent with instructions which way to go, some Gadatas allowed to escape to bring the troops and fetch the ladders; but some he took and straitly examined in the presence of many witnesses, and when he heard from them the purpose of their journey, he made ready at once and set out in the night as if to give the alarm.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>And the end was that he was trusted and entered the fort as an ally to defend it; and for a while he helped the commandant to the extent of his ability in making preparations; but when <persName>Cyrus</persName> came, he made himself master of the place, employing also as<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> gains the desired stronghold</note> his assistants in seizing it those men of <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s whom he had taken prisoners.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When this was accomplished, the eunuch, after setting things in order within the fort, came out and did him obeisance according to the custom and said: &ldquo;Joy be with you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>!&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for by the favour of the gods you not only bid me joy but even compel me to be joyful. For believe me, I consider it a great advantage to leave this place friendly to my allies in this country. From you, Gadatas,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> went on, &ldquo;the Assyrian has, it seems, taken away the power of begetting children, but at any rate he has not deprived you of the ability of acquiring friends. Let me assure you that by this deed you have made of us friends who will try, if we can, to stand by you and aid you no less efficiently than if we were your own children.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke; and at this juncture the Hyrcanian king, who had just heard what had happened, ran up to <persName>Cyrus</persName> and taking his right hand said to him: &ldquo;O what a blessing you are to your friends, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, and what a debt of gratitude to the gods you lay upon me, because they have brought me into association with you!&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Go then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;take this fortress on<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A base of operations established in the north-east</note> account of which you congratulate me and so dispose of it that it may be of the most service to your people and to the rest of the allies, and especially,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to Gadatas here, who gained possession of it and delivered it to us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; said the Hyrcanian. &ldquo;When the Cadusians come and the Sacians and my people, are we to call in some of them also, that all of us who are concerned may consult together how we may use the fortress to the best advantage?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To this plan <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave assent. And when all those who were interested in the fort were gathered together, they decided that it should be occupied in common by those to whose advantage it was to have it in the hands of friends, so that it might be an outwork for them in time of war and a base of operations against the Assyrians.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Because of this incident the Cadusians, Sacians, and Hyrcanians joined the expedition in greater numbers and with greatly increased zeal. And thereafter a new division was added to the army, consisting of Cadusians, about twenty thousand targeteers and about four thousand horsemen; of Sacians, about ten thousand bowmen and about two thousand mounted archers; while the Hyrcanians also sent as many more foot-soldiers as they could and filled up the ranks of their cavalry to the number of two thousand; for up to this time most of their cavalry had been left at home, because the Cadusians and the Sacians were enemies of the Assyrians.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now during the time that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was busy with the arrangements about the fortress, many of the Assyrians of the country round about surrendered their horses and many laid down their arms, because now they were afraid of all their neighbours.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And after this, Gadatas came to <persName>Cyrus</persName> and<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king threatens to invade Gadatas's country</note> said that messengers had come to him with the information that when the Assyrian king heard the facts about the fortress, he was exceedingly wroth and was preparing to invade his country. &ldquo;If, then, you will permit me to go, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I should try to save the fortified places; the rest is of less account.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If you start now,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;when shall you reach home?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;The day after to-morrow,&rdquo; answered Gadatas, &ldquo;I shall dine in my own land.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But you do not think, do you, that you will find the Assyrian already there?&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Nay, I am sure of it,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;for he will make haste while he thinks you are still far away.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How many days,&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;do you think it would take me with my army to get there?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; Gadatas made reply, &ldquo;your army now is large and you could not reach my residence in less than six or seven days.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;do you go as quickly as possible, and I will follow as best I can.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So Gadatas went away, and <persName>Cyrus</persName> summoned all the officers of the allies, and there seemed to be there now many noble men and brave. In this assembly, then, <persName>Cyrus</persName> spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Friends and allies, Gadatas has done what<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes that the whole army go to the relief of Gadatas</note> seems a very valuable service to us all, and that, too, before receiving any favour whatsoever at our hands. And now comes the report that the Assyrian is going to invade his country, partly, as it seems plain, from a wish to punish him because he thinks Gadatas has done him a great wrong; and perhaps also he understands that if those who desert him for us do not suffer any harm at his hands, while those who follow him are destroyed by us, the chances are that very soon no one will be willing to stay with him.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>So<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The whole army goes to help Gadatas</note> now, my men, it seems to me that we should be doing what is fair, if we gave Gadatas, our benefactor, our heartiest assistance; and at the same time we should be doing only what is right in paying a debt of gratitude. But apart from that, it seems to me that we should be gaining an advantage for ourselves.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For if we should show every one that we try to surpass in doing harm those who do us harm, and that we surpass in well-doing those who do well by us, the consequences of such conduct would be that many would wish to become our friends and not one would desire to be our enemy.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But should we decide to abandon Gadatas, with what arguments under heaven could we ever persuade any one else to do us a favour? How could we have the effrontery to approve our own conduct? And how could any one of us look Gadatas in the face, if, as numerous as we are, we should be surpassed in well-doing by one man and that one a man in such a plight as Gadatas is?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke, and all heartily agreed to do<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The army accepts the proposal</note> as he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;since you agree with these suggestions, and first, let us leave men in charge of the beasts of burden and the wagons, each division appointing such of their number as are best suited to go with them; and let Gobryas have<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The order of march</note> command of them in our place and be their guide;
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For he is acquainted with the roads and in other ways is qualified for that task. As for us, let us proceed with the most able-bodied men and horses, taking with us three days' provisions. For the more lightly and simply equipped we go, the more we shall enjoy our luncheon and dinner and sleep in the days to follow.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>And now let us march in the following order: Chrysantas, do you lead in the van the men armed with breastplates, for the road is smooth and wide. Have all your captains in front, each company following in single file; for, massed together, we can march with the greatest speed and the greatest safety.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>And the reason why I direct the men armed with breastplates to lead the march is that they are the slowest portion of the army; and when the slowest lead, then all the more quickly moving troops can follow easily, as a matter of course. But when at night the light forces lead, it is not at all a strange thing for the line to be broken and a gap formed, for the vanguard outstrips the rear.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Next let Artabazus follow at the head of the Persian targeteers and bowmen; following him, Andamyas, the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName>, in command of the Median infantry; next, Embas with the Armenian infantry; then, Artuchas with the Hyrcanians; he will be followed by Thambradas at the head of the Sacian infantry force and Datamas with that of the Cadusians.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>Let these all lead the way with their captains in front, the targeteers on the right and the archers on the left of their own squares; for, marching thus, they are more easily handled.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/> Next to these the camp-followers of all the army are to follow; their officers should see to it that they have everything ready packed up before they sleep, and early in the morning let them be present with the baggage at the appointed place, ready to follow the march in proper order.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;After the camp-followers let Madatas, the Persian, bring up the Persian cavalry; let him also arrange the cavalry captains in front, and let each captain lead his company in single file, just like the infantry officers.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>After them will come Rhambacas, the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName>, with his cavalry in the same order; after them you, Tigranes, with yours, and the rest of the cavalry officers, each with the forces with which he joined us. After them you Sacians are to fall in line; and last of all, just as they came, the Cadusians will bring up the rear; and you, Alceunas, who are their commander, for the present look out for all in the rear and do not allow any one to fall behind your horsemen.
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Take care to march in silence, both officers and all who are wise; for in the night there is more need to use ears than eyes to secure information and to have things done. And to be thrown into confusion in the night is a much more serious matter than in the daytime and one more difficult to remedy.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/> Therefore let silence be maintained, and let the prescribed order be preserved.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And the night watches, whenever you are to start off before daylight, must be made as short and as numerous as possible, so that want of sleep on account of doing sentinel duty may not be serious and exhaust the men for the march. And when the hour for starting comes, let the signal be given on the horn.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>And then do you all, with whatever is necessary, step out into the road to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>; and let each commander, as he gets his division in motion, pass the word to the man behind him to come on.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hereupon they went to their tents, and, as<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s memory for names</note> they went, they remarked to one another what a good memory <persName>Cyrus</persName> had and how he called every one by name as he assigned them their places and gave them their instructions.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>Now <persName>Cyrus</persName> made a study of this; for he thought it passing strange that, while every mechanic knows the names of the tools of his trade and the physician knows the names of all the instruments and medicines he uses, the general should be so foolish as not to know the names of the officers under him; and yet he must employ them as his instruments not only whenever he wishes to capture a place or defend one, but also whenever he wishes to inspire courage or fear. And whenever <persName>Cyrus</persName> wished to honour any one, it seemed to him proper to address him by name.
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/> Furthermore, it seemed to him that those who were conscious of being personally known to their general exerted themselves more to be seen doing something good and were more ready to abstain from doing anything bad.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>And when he wanted a thing done, he thought it foolish to give orders as do some masters in their homes: &ldquo;Some one go get water!&rdquo; &ldquo;Some one split wood!&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>For when orders are given in that way, all, he thought, looked at one another and no one carried out the order; all were to blame, but no one felt shame or fear as he should, because he shared the blame with many. It was for this reason, therefore, that he himself spoke to every one by name to whom he had any command to give.
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>Such, at least, was <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s opinion about this matter.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The soldiers, however, then went to dinner, stationed sentinels, packed up everything they needed, and went to bed.
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>At midnight the signal horn<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The midnight march</note> sounded. <persName>Cyrus</persName> informed Chrysantas that he would wait for him on the road ahead of the army, took with him his aides-de-camp, and went on; and a short time afterward Chrysantas came up at the head of his heavy-armed soldiers.
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>To him <persName>Cyrus</persName> turned over the guides and bade him advance leisurely, for the troops were not yet all on the way. He himself took his stand by the roadside, and as the troops came on he sent them forward in their order, and to those who were late he sent a messenger to bid them hasten.
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>And when they were all on the road, he sent some horsemen to Chrysantas to say that they were now all on the way; &ldquo;Now then, double quick!&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/> He himself riding his horse leisurely along to the front inspected the ranks; and to those whom he saw marching along in silence and in good order he would ride up and inquire who they were, and when he was informed he would praise them. But if he saw any in confusion, he would inquire into the cause of it and try to quiet the disorder.
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Only one of his measures of precaution that night has been left unmentioned&mdash;namely, that he sent out in front of the main body of the army a few light-armed infantrymen to keep Chrysantas in sight and be kept in sight by him, to listen and gather information in whatever way they could, and report to Chrysantas what it seemed expedient that he should know. There was also an officer in command of them who kept them in order, and what was of importance he communicated to Chrysantas, but he did not trouble him by reporting what was immaterial.
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this manner, therefore, they proceeded all<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The order by day</note> night long; but when it became day, he left the cavalry of the Cadusians with their infantry (for these also were in the extreme rear), so that the latter might not be without the protection of cavalry; but the rest he ordered to ride up to the front, because the enemy were in front. He adopted this plan, in order that, if he happened to find any opposition, he might have his forces in fighting order to meet it, and that, if anything should be seen anywhere in flight, he might give chase with the utmost readiness.
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>He always kept drawn up in order one body of troops who were to pursue and another who were to stay with him; but he never suffered his main line to be broken.
<milestone unit="section" n="59"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, <persName>Cyrus</persName> led his army; but he himself did not keep to the same position, but riding about, now here, now there, kept watch, and if they needed anything, he provided for it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his army were proceeding.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now there was a certain man among the officers<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Conspiracy against Gadatas</note> of Gadatas's cavalry who, when he saw that his prince had revolted from the Assyrian, concluded that if some misfortune were to overtake Gadatas, he might himself obtain from the Assyrian all his chief's wealth and power. With this in view, he sent one of his trusted friends to the Assyrian, instructing his messenger, in case he found the Assyrian army already in Gadatas's country, to tell their king that if he would lay an ambuscade, he would take Gadatas and his followers prisoners.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He furthermore commissioned him to explain how small an army Gadatas had and to make it clear that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was not with him; he also pointed out the road by which Gadatas was likely to return; and, that he might find fuller credence, he instructed his own subordinates to surrender to the Assyrian king, together with all that was in it, the fortress which he himself happened to be holding in Gadatas's country. He promised besides that he would come himself when he had slain Gadatas, if he could, but that, if he failed in the attempt, at least he would in future be on the king's side.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And the man who had been given this commission rode as fast as his horse could carry him; he came into the presence of the Assyrian king and made known the purpose of his coming. When the king heard it, he at once took possession of the fortress and with a large force of horse and chariots laid his ambuscade in a cluster of villages.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Gadatas was not far from these villages,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The plot almost succeeds</note> he sent some scouts on in advance to make a thorough search. And when the Assyrian was informed of the scouts' approach, he ordered two or three chariots and several horsemen to start up and gallop off as if they were affrighted and only a few in number. When the scouts saw that, they started in pursuit themselves and beckoned to Gadatas to come on. He, too, was deceived and started at full speed in pursuit. The Assyrians, in turn, when they thought Gadatas near enough to be taken, issued from their ambuscade.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And when Gadatas and his men saw this, they began to flee, as was natural; and the enemy, as was also natural, started in pursuit. At this juncture, the man who was plotting against Gadatas struck a blow at him but failed to inflict a mortal wound; still he smote him on the shoulder and wounded him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had done this, he darted off to join the pursuing Assyrians; and when they recognized who he was, he took his place with them and urging his horse at full speed he joined with the king in the pursuit.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Then those who had the slowest horses were evidently being overtaken by those who had the fleetest; and just as Gadatas's men were becoming quite exhausted, because they were already jaded and worn out by their march, they saw <persName>Cyrus</persName> coming up<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> saves the day</note> with his army, and one may imagine that they rushed up to them with delight, like men putting into port out of a storm.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>At first <persName>Cyrus</persName> was surprised; but when he comprehended the situation, he continued, while the enemy were all riding against him, to lead his army in battle order against them. But the enemy, recognizing the real state of affairs, turned and fled. Thereupon <persName>Cyrus</persName> ordered those who had been detailed for that purpose to start in pursuit, while he himself followed as he thought expedient.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Here chariots also were captured, some because the charioteers were thrown out, a part of them from wheeling around too sharply, others for other reasons, while some were intercepted by the cavalry and taken. And many men were slain, and among them the man who had wounded Gadatas.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Of the Assyrian infantry, however, who happened to be besieging Gadatas's fortress, some fled to that fort which had been lost to Gadatas by betrayal, others had time to reach a large city of Assyria, in which the king himself with his horsemen and chariots also took refuge.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when <persName>Cyrus</persName> finished his pursuit of the enemy, he returned to Gadatas's country; and after he had given instructions to those whose duty it was to take care of the spoil, he went at once to visit Gadatas and see how his wound was. But as he was going, he was met by Gadatas with his wound already bandaged. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> was delighted at seeing him and said: &ldquo;Why, I was coming to see how you were.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And I, by the gods,&rdquo; said Gadatas, &ldquo;was<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gadatas shows his gratitude</note> coming to gaze upon you again and see what you may look like, you who possess such a soul. For though I do not see what need you now have of my assistance, and though you made no promise to do this for me and have been put under no obligation whatever to me, at least no personal obligation, yet because you fancied that I had given some assistance to your friends, you have come so gallantly to my relief that at this moment, whereas by myself I am a lost man, by your goodness I am saved.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>By the gods, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, if I were such a man as once I was and had children, I doubt if I could have had a child as kind to me as you have been; for I know that this present king of Assyria, like many another son that I have known, has caused his own father much more trouble than he can now cause you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You fail to notice a much greater wonder, Gadatas, when you now express your wonder at me,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> made reply.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And what is that, pray?&rdquo; asked Gadatas.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That so many Persians have shown their interest in you,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and so many Medes and Hyrcanians, and all the Armenians, Sacians, and Cadusians here present.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;O Zeus,&rdquo; said Gadatas in prayer, &ldquo;I pray that the gods may grant many blessings to them and most of all to him who is responsible for their being so generous toward me. But, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, in order that we may entertain handsomely these men whom you have been praising, accept as gifts of friendship these trifles, such as I can give.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the same time he had a great many things brought out, so that any one who wished might sacrifice and that the whole army might be entertained in a manner worthy of their deeds of glory and the glorious issue.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Cadusian prince had been guarding the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Cadusian fiasco</note> rear and had no share in the pursuit; so, wishing to do something brilliant on his own account, he went off, without consulting <persName>Cyrus</persName> or saying anything to him, to make a foray into the country toward <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>. And as the Cadusian cavalry were scattered, the Assyrian, returning from his city in which he had taken refuge, came suddenly upon them with his own army in battle array.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And when he discovered that the Cadusians were alone, he made an attack, slew the commander of the Cadusians and many others, took some of their horses, and recovered the spoil which they happened to be carrying off. He also pursued them as far as he thought was safe and then turned back. So the survivors of the Cadusians arrived at the camp, the first of them towards evening.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> found out what had happened, he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> cares for the survivors</note> went out to meet them, and if he saw any one that was wounded he received him kindly and sent him on to Gadatas, that he might receive attention; the rest he helped into their tents and saw to it that they should have provisions, taking some of the Persian peers along to help him in looking after them. For under such circumstances, the good are ready to undertake extra labour.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Still <persName>Cyrus</persName> was evidently very much distressed, so that, when the rest went to dinner at the usual hour, he with his aides and the surgeons did not go; for he would not wittingly leave any uncared for, but either looked after them in person, or, if he did not succeed in doing that, he showed his personal interest by sending some one to attend to them.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus they went to sleep that evening. At<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The lessons of the Cadusian blunder</note> daybreak he made proclamation for all the Cadusians and the officers of the rest to assemble; and he addressed them as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Friends and allies, that which has happened might happen to any man; for it is not at all strange, I think, for mortal man to err. Still it is worth our while to reap some benefit from this occurrence, the lesson never to detach from our main body a force weaker than the forces of the enemy.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>I do not mean by that that we should never go off, if circumstances require it, with a still smaller detachment than that with which the Cadusian prince went. But if an officer, when he starts on an expedition, communicates his intention to one that is able to bring help, he may possibly fall into a trap, but then it is equally possible for the one who remains behind to entrap the enemy and turn them away from the detached corps; or he may annoy the enemy in some other way and so secure safety for his friends; and thus even those who are at a distance will not be out of reach but will keep in touch with the main body. But the man who goes off without communicating his purpose is in the same situation, no matter where he is, as if he were carrying on a campaign alone.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But in return for this, we shall ere long, God<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> vows revenge</note> willing, have our revenge on the enemy. So, as soon as you have had luncheon, I shall lead you to the place where this befell. There we shall not only bury the dead, but, God willing, on the very spot where the enemy think they have won a victory we will show them others better than they are. We shall at least let them have no satisfaction in looking even on the place where they slaughtered our allies. If they do not come out to meet us, we shall burn their villages and ravage their country, so that they may have no joy in viewing what they did to us but may be distressed at contemplating there their own misfortunes.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;The rest of you, therefore, go to luncheon. But you, Cadusians, go first and elect from your own number according to your custom a new general, who shall look out for your interests with the help of the gods and of us, if you have any need of our help as well; and when you have made your choice, send the man you have elected to me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So they did as he bade. And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> led the army out, he assigned the man elected by the Cadusians his position and bade him lead his contingent near to himself, &ldquo;in order,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we may, if we can, put new courage into your men.&rdquo; Thus, then, they proceeded; and when they came to the place, they buried the Cadusians and ravaged the country. And when they had done so they returned again into the land of Gadatas, bringing their supplies from the enemy's country.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he reflected that those who had gone over to him would suffer severely, as they were in the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, if he were not always at hand, he ordered those of the enemy whom he released to tell the Assyrian king (he also sent<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes mutual protection of the farms</note> a herald to bear the same message) that he was ready to leave in peace the labourers tilling the land and to do them no harm, provided the king, on his part, would be willing to allow those farmers who had transferred their allegiance to him to work their farms.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he had them say, &ldquo;even if you are able to hinder them, you will hinder but few; for the country of those who have come over to me is small; while the land under your dominion that I should allow to be cultivated is extensive. Then, as to the harvesting of the crops, if there is war, the victor, I suppose, will do the reaping; but if there is peace, it is evident that you will do it. If, however, any of my adherents take up arms against you, or any of yours against me, upon such we will both execute vengeance according to our ability.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This message he entrusted to the herald and sent him away. And when the Assyrians heard it, they did everything they could to persuade the king to accept the proposal, and to leave as little of the war as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>The Assyrian king, moreover, whether because he was persuaded by his countrymen or whether he himself also wished it so, agreed to the proposal; so a covenant was made to the effect that the farmers should have peace, but the men under arms war.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This concession <persName>Cyrus</persName> obtained for the farming classes. But as for the herds out grazing, he ordered his friends, if they wished, to drive them in and keep them in the territory under their own control; but the enemy's cattle they brought in as their legitimate prey from whatever quarter they could, so that the allies might be better pleased with the expedition. For the dangers were the same, even if they did not go foraging for provisions, while the burdens of war seemed lighter, if the army was to be fed at the enemy's cost.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> was making preparations to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gadatas brings gifts to <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> depart, Gadatas came to him and brought many gifts of every sort, as might be expected from a wealthy house, and, most important of all, he brought many horses that he had taken from horsemen of his own whom he had come to distrust on account of the conspiracy against him.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>When he came into <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s presence he spoke as follows: &ldquo;These gifts, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I beg to offer you for the present; and do you accept them, if you have any use for them. But pray consider that everything else of mine is yours; for there is not and never can be a child of my own to whom I can leave my estates, but with my death our race and name must be altogether blotted out.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>And by the gods, who see all things and hear all things, I swear to you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that it is not for anything wrong or base that I have said or done that I have suffered this affliction.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As he uttered these words he burst into tears over his lot and could say no more.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName>, as he listened, pitied him for his misfortune and answered him thus: &ldquo;Your horses I accept; for I shall do you a service by giving them to men who are more loyal to you, it seems, than your own men who had them but now; and for myself, I shall the sooner increase my Persian cavalry to full ten thousand horse, as I have been eager this long time to do. But do you take these other things away and keep them until you see me in possession of wealth enough so that I shall not be outdone in requiting you. For if, as we part, you should give me larger gifts than you receive from me, by the gods, I do not see how I could possibly help being ashamed.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Gadatas in reply, &ldquo;I can trust you for that; for I know your ways. Still, bethink you whether I am in a position to keep these things safe for you.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>For while we were friends to the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gadatas's relations with the Assyrian king</note> Assyrian king, my father's estate seemed to me the finest in the world; for it was so near to the mighty city of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> that we enjoyed all the advantages of a great city but could come back home and be rid of all its rush and worry. But now that we are his enemies, it is obvious that with your departure we ourselves and our whole house shall be the victims of plots; and I think we shall lead an utterly miserable life, for we shall have our enemies close at hand and see them stronger than ourselves.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Perhaps, then, some one might say: &lsquo;And why, pray, did you not think of that before you revolted?&rsquo; Because, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, on account of the outrage I had suffered and my consequent resentment, my soul was not looking out consistently for the safest course but was pregnant with this thought, whether it would ever be in my power to get revenge upon that enemy of gods and men, who cherishes an implacable hatred not so much toward the man who does him wrong as toward the one whom he suspects of being better than himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Therefore, since he is such a scoundrel himself, he will find no supporters but those who are worse scoundrels than himself. But if some one of them by any chance be found better than he, never fear, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that you will have to fight that good man; but he will take care of him, scheming unceasingly until he has got rid of that man who is better than himself. But as for me, he will, I think, even with worthless fellows easily be strong enough to harass me.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard this, it seemed to him that Gadatas said something worthy of consideration; so he answered at once: &ldquo;Pray then, Gadatas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us make the fortifications strong with garrisons and safe, that you may have confidence in their security, whenever you go into them; and then do you take the field with us yourself so that, if the gods continue on our side as they now are, he may be afraid of you, not you of him. And bring with you whatsoever of yours you like to look at or to have with you, and come. It seems to me, too, that you would be very useful to me, and I shall try to be the same to you, as far as I can.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On hearing this, Gadatas breathed more freely<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gadatas makes common cause with <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> and said: &ldquo;Could I get things ready before you go? For, you see, I should like to take my mother with me.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you will have plenty of time; for I will hold back until you say it is all right.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, Gadatas went away in company with <persName>Cyrus</persName> and strengthened the forts with garrisons and then packed up everything that a great house might need for comfort. And he brought with him many of his own loved and trusted friends and many also of those whom he distrusted, compelling some to bring along their wives, others their brothers and sisters, in order that he might keep them under control, when bound by such ties.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And from the first <persName>Cyrus</persName> kept Gadatas among those about him as he marched, to give him information in regard to roads and water, fodder and provisions, so that they might be able to camp where things were most abundant.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when, as he proceeded, he came in sight of the city of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> and it seemed to him that the road which he was following led close by the walls, he called Gobryas and Gadatas to him and asked if there were not another road, so that they need not march right by the wall.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; answered Gobryas; &ldquo;in fact, there are many roads; but I supposed that you would surely wish to march as near to the city as possible, in order to show him that your army is now large and imposing; for even when you had a smaller force, you came right up to the very walls and he saw that we had no great numbers. So now, even if he really is to some extent prepared (for he sent word to you that he was making preparations to fight you), I am sure that, when he sees your forces, his own will again seem to him extremely ill-prepared.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You seem to be surprised, Gobryas,&rdquo; said<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s tactics in passing <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></note> <persName>Cyrus</persName> in answer, &ldquo;that I marched right up to the walls when I came with a much smaller army, whereas now with a larger force I am unwilling to march close up under the walls.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>But do not be surprised; for marching up to and marching by are not the same thing. For every one leads up in the order best for fighting [and the wise also retreat in the safest possible way, and not in the quickest],
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>but an army must needs march by with the wagons in an extended line and with the rest of the baggage vans in a long train. And these must all be covered by soldiers, and the enemy must never see the baggage wagons unprotected by arms.
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>When people march in this way, therefore, they necessarily have the fighting men drawn out in a thin, weak line. If, then, the enemy should ever decide to sally out in a compact body from their walls, on whichever part they came to close quarters they would close with much greater force than those have who are marching by.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>Then, too, those who are marching in a long column must be a long distance from their supports, while the townspeople have but a short way to go to make a dash on a force near them and again retire.
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;On the other hand, if we march by at a distance from the walls not less than that at which we are now proceeding with our long extended line, they will have a view of our full numbers, to be sure, but behind the fringe of arms the whole host will look terrible.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>Be that as it may, if they should really make a sally at any point, we should see them a long way off and not be caught unprepared; or rather, I should say, friends, they will not so much as make the attempt when they have to go far from their walls, unless they judge that the whole of their force is superior to the whole of ours; for a retreat is a perilous thing for them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he said this, those present agreed that what he said was right, and Gobryas led the way as he had directed. And as the army marched by the city, he constantly kept the part just passing the city the strongest, and so moved on.
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he continued his march and came in the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> captures three forts</note> usual number of days to the place on the boundaries between Media and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> from which he had originally started. Of the three forts of the Syrians there, <persName>Cyrus</persName> in person assaulted one, the weakest, and took it by storm; of the other two, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, by intimidation, brought the garrison of the one to surrender, and Gadatas, by persuasion, that of the other.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When this had been accomplished, he sent to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> requests Cyaxares to come</note> Cyaxares and requested him to come to camp to hold a council of war concerning the disposition to be made of the forts which they had captured, and, after reviewing the army, to advise what steps he thought they ought to take next for the future conduct of the war. &ldquo;But if he bids me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell him that I would come and join camps with him.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, the messenger went away to deliver this message. Meanwhile <persName>Cyrus</persName> had given orders to bring out the tent of the Assyrian king which the Medes had selected for Cyaxares, to make it ready with all kinds of furnishings, and to conduct into the women's apartments of the tent the woman and with her the music-girls, who had been selected for Cyaxares. And this was done.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the envoy to Cyaxares had delivered his<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Reinforcements arrive from <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></note> message, Cyaxares gave it his attention and decided that it was better for the army to stay at the frontier. And there was the more reason, for the Persians whom <persName>Cyrus</persName> had sent for had come&mdash;forty thousand bowmen and peltasts.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And as he saw that these were a severe drain on the Median land, it seemed to him more desirable to get rid of the present army than to admit another host. So when the officer in command of the reinforcements from <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> inquired of Cyaxares, in accordance with the instructions<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">IV. v. 31</note> he had from <persName>Cyrus</persName>, whether he had any need of his army, he said &ldquo;No&rdquo;; and so this general went that same day at the head of his forces to <persName>Cyrus</persName>, for he heard that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was in that neighbourhood.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the following day Cyaxares set out with the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Meeting between <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his uncle</note> Median cavalry who had stayed with him, and when <persName>Cyrus</persName> learned that he was approaching, he went out to meet him with the Persian cavalry, which was now a large body; he took with him also all the Median, Armenian, and Hyrcanian horse, and those of the rest of the allies who were the best mounted and best armed; all these he took with him by way of displaying his forces to Cyaxares.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But when Cyaxares saw many fine, valiant men in the company of <persName>Cyrus</persName>, while his own escort was small and of little worth, he thought it a thing dishonourable, and grief gat hold on him. So when <persName>Cyrus</persName> dismounted from his horse and came up to him, intending to kiss him according to custom, Cyaxares dismounted from his horse but turned away. He refused to kiss him and could not conceal his tears.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon <persName>Cyrus</persName> bade all the rest withdraw and wait. And he himself caught Cyaxares by the hand, led him to the shade of some palm-trees away from the road, ordered some Median rugs to be spread for him, and begged him to be seated; then sitting down beside him, he spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the name of all the gods, uncle,&rdquo; said he,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares's jealous complaints</note> &ldquo;tell me why you are angry with me; and what do you find wrong that you take it so amiss?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; Cyaxares then made answer, &ldquo;while I am supposed to be the scion of a royal father and of a line of ancestors who were kings of old as far back as the memory of man extends, and while I am called a king myself, still I see myself riding along with a mean and unworthy equipage, while you come before me great and magnificent in the eyes of my own retinue as well as the rest of your forces.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And this I think it a hard thing to suffer even at the enemy's hands and much harder, O Zeus, at the hands of those from whom I should least of all expect such treatment. For I think I should rather ten times sink into the earth than be seen so humiliated and see my own men disregarding me and laughing at me; for I am not ignorant of the fact not only that you are greater than I, but also that even my vassals come to meet me more powerful than I am myself and well enough equipped to do more harm to me than I can do to them.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as he said this he was still more violently overcome with weeping, so that he affected <persName>Cyrus</persName>, too, till his eyes filled with tears. But after pausing for a moment <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered him as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, Cyaxares, in this you do not speak truly<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> reasons with his uncle</note> nor do you judge correctly, if you think that by my presence the Medes have been put in a position to do you harm;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>but that you are angered and threaten them gives me no surprise. However, whether your anger against them is just or unjust, I will not stop to inquire; for I know that you would be offended to hear me speak in their defence. To me, however, it seems a serious error for a ruler to be angry with all his subjects at the same time; for, as a matter of course, threatening many makes many enemies, and being angry with all at the same time inspires them all with a common sense of wrong.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It was for this reason, let me assure you, that I did not let them come back without me, for I was afraid that in consequence of your anger something might happen for which we should all be sorry. With the help of the gods, therefore, you are secured against that by my presence.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As to your supposition that you have been wronged by me&mdash;I am exceedingly sorry, if, while I have been striving to the utmost of my ability to do as much good as possible to my friends, I seem after all to be accomplishing just the opposite.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But enough of this; let us not thus idly accuse one another; but, if possible, let us examine what sort of wrong it is that has come from me. I am ready to make you a proposal, the fairest that can be made between friends: if it appear that I have done you harm, I confess that I am in the wrong; but if it turn out that I have done you no harm and intended none, will you then on your part confess that you have suffered no wrong at my hands?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Nay, I must,&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And if it is demonstrated that I have done you good and have been eager to do as much for you as I could, pray should I not deserve your praise rather than your blame?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That is only fair,&rdquo; said he.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;and let us consider<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> reviews his own conduct</note> all that I have done, all my acts one by one; for so it will be most clearly seen what is good and what is bad.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And let us begin, if you think it far enough back, with my assuming this command. Now, you remember, when you learned that the enemy had gathered in great numbers and that they were starting against you and your country, you at once sent to the Persian state to ask for help and to me personally to ask me to try to come myself at the head of the forces, if any of the Persians should come. Did I not comply with your request, and did I not come to you leading for your service as many and as valiant men as I could?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you certainly came.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;tell me first whether in this you impute to me any wrong against you or do you not rather count it a benefit towards you?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Obviously,&rdquo; Cyaxares replied, &ldquo;in that I see a benefit.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Good, then,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;and when the enemy came and we had to do battle with them, did you then see me ever shirking toil or avoiding danger?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I certainly did not.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Furthermore, when with the help of the gods the victory was ours and the enemy retreated, when I urged you to come in order that we might together pursue them, together take vengeance upon them, and together reap the fruits of victory if any rich spoil should fall to our lot&mdash;can you charge me with any selfish purpose in that?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To this Cyaxares said nothing. So <persName>Cyrus</persName> went on again: &ldquo;Well, seeing that it suits you better to be silent than to reply to this question, tell me<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He establishes his innocence of wrong</note> whether you thought you were wronged in any way because, when you did not think it safe to pursue, I excused you from a share in that peril and asked you to let some of your cavalry go with me. For if I did wrong also in asking that, and that, too, when I had previously given you my own services as an ally, that is yours to prove.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as Cyaxares again said nothing, <persName>Cyrus</persName> resumed: &ldquo;Well, seeing that you do not choose to answer that either, please tell me then if I did you wrong in the next step I took: when you answered that you saw that the Medes were enjoying themselves and that you would not be willing to disturb their pleasures and oblige them to go off into dangers, then, far from being angry with you for that, I asked you again for a favour than which, as I knew, nothing was less for you to grant or easier for you to require of the Medes: I asked you, as you will remember, to allow any one who would to follow me. Was there anything unfair, think you, in that?
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, when I had obtained this concession from you, it amounted to nothing, unless I were to gain their consent. So I went to see if I could get their consent; and those whom I persuaded I took with me, by your permission, on my expedition. But if you think that deserving of blame, then, no matter what you may offer, one may not, it seems, accept it from you without blame.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Thus, then, we started; and does not every one know what we did when we were gone? Did we not capture the enemy's camp? Are not many of those who came against you slain? Aye, and of the enemy still alive many have been deprived of their arms; many others of their horses; moreover, the belongings of those who before were robbing you and carrying off your property you now see in the hands of your friends and being brought in, some for you, some for those who are under your dominion.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But what is most important and best of all, you see your own territory increasing, that of the enemy diminishing; you see the enemy's fortresses in your possession, and your own, which had before all fallen under the Assyrian's power, now restored again to you. Now, I do not know that I can say that I should like to learn whether any one of these results is a bad thing or whether any one is not a good thing for you, but at any rate I have no objection to listening to what you have to say. So tell me what your judgment on the question is.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had thus spoken, <persName>Cyrus</persName> ceased, and<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares submits his grounds of complaint</note> Cyaxares answered as follows: &ldquo;Well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I do not see how any one could say that what you have done is bad; but still, let me tell you, these services of yours are of such a nature that the more numerous they appear to be, the more they burden me.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For as to territory, I should rather extend yours by my power than see mine thus increased by you; for to you it brings glory to do this, but to me these same things somehow bring disgrace.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>And as for money, it would be more agreeable for me to bestow it in this way upon you than to receive it from you under such circumstances as those under which you now offer it. For in being thus enriched by you, I feel even more wherein I am made poorer. And I think I should be less displeased to see my subjects actually wronged a little by you than to see, as I do, that they have received great benefits from you.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if it seems to you that it is unreasonable of me to take these things to heart, put yourself in my place and see in what light they appear to you. And tell me&mdash;if any one should pet your dogs, which you have been training for the protection of yourself and yours, and make them more familiar with himself than with you, would he please you with such petting?
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>Or if that seems to you a belittling comparison, think on this: if any one were to tamper with the attendants that you kept for your body-guard and for service in war, and so dispose them that they would rather be his than yours, would you be grateful to him for such kindness?
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>Again, let us take the object that men love most and most dearly cherish&mdash;suppose some one were to court your wife and make her love him more than yourself, would such kindness give you pleasure? Far from it, I think; for I am sure that he who should be guilty of such conduct would be doing you the greatest of all injuries.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But to quote an example most nearly akin to my own case&mdash;if any one should so treat the Persians whom you have brought here as to make them more glad to follow him than you, would you consider him your friend? I trow not; but you would consider him more of an enemy than if he were to slay many of them.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>Or again, if you in your kindness of heart were to tell one of your friends to take whatever of yours he wanted, and if he, accepting your offer, should make off with everything he could and enrich himself with what belonged to you, while you had not even enough left for moderate use, could you consider such a one a blameless friend?
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, it seems to me that your treatment of me has been, if not that, at least something like that; for what you say is true: I told you to take those who wished to go with you, and off you went with my whole force and left me deserted. And now what you have taken with my forces you bring to me, forsooth, and with my own strength you increase my realm; and I, it seems, having no share in securing this good fortune, must submit like a mere woman to receive favours, and you are a hero in the eyes of all the world and especially of my subjects here, while I am not considered worthy of my crown.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Do you think that these are deeds of kindness, <persName>Cyrus</persName>? Let me tell you that if you had any regard for me, there is nothing of which you would be so careful not to rob me as my reputation and my honour. For what do I gain, if I have my realm extended wide and lose my own honour? For I was not made king of the Medes because I was more powerful than they all, but rather because they themselves accounted us to be in all things better than themselves.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By the gods, uncle,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, interrupting<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares reconciled</note> him before he had finished speaking, &ldquo;if I have ever done you any favour before, please do me now the favour that I beg of you: desist from blaming me for the present, and when you have proof from us how we feel toward you, if it then appears that what I have done was done for your benefit, return my greeting when I greet you and consider me your benefactor; but if it seems the other way, then blame me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cyaxares, &ldquo;perhaps you are right after all; I will do so.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Say then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;may I kiss you, too?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said the other.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you will not turn away from me, as you did a little while ago?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So he kissed him.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the Medes and the Persians and the rest saw that, for they were all concerned to see what the outcome would be, they were satisfied and glad. Then <persName>Cyrus</persName> and Cyaxares mounted their horses and led the way, and the Medes followed after Cyaxares (for <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave them a nod so to do), the Persians fell in behind <persName>Cyrus</persName>, and the rest behind them.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they came to the camp and had<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He holds a reception</note> lodged Cyaxares in the tent that had been made ready for him, they who had been detailed to do so supplied him with what he needed;
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>and as long as he had leisure before dinner, Cyaxares received calls from the Medes; some of them came of their own accord, but most of them went at the suggestion of <persName>Cyrus</persName>, taking presents with them&mdash;the one a handsome cup-bearer, another a fine cook, another a baker, another a musician, another a cup, another fine raiment; and every one of them, as a rule, presented him with at least one of the things that he had himself taken,
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>so that Cyaxares changed his mind and realized that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was not alienating their affections from him and that the Medes were no less attentive to him than before.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the hour for dinner came, Cyaxares summoned <persName>Cyrus</persName> and asked him, as he had not seen him for a long time, to dine with him. But <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered: &ldquo;Please, Cyaxares, do not ask me. Do you not see that all these who are here are here at our instance? I should not be doing right, then, if I should let them get the impression that I was neglecting them and pursuing my own pleasure. For when soldiers think they are being neglected, the good ones become much more despondent and the bad much more presuming.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>But do you now go to dinner, especially as you have come a long way; and if any come to pay their respects to you, do you greet them kindly and entertain them well, so that they may feel confidence toward you also. For my part, I must go and attend to those matters of which I have been speaking to you.
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>And tomorrow morning my staff-officers will come with me to your headquarters, in order that we may all consult with you about what we should do next. Do you then and there lay before us the question whether it seems best to continue the campaign or whether it is now time to disband the armies.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this Cyaxares attended to his dinner,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> organizes for the continuance of the war</note> while <persName>Cyrus</persName> collected those of his friends who were most able to think and to co-operate with him when occasion demanded, and addressed them as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My friends, with the help of the gods we have, you see, all that we prayed for at the first. For wherever we go, we are masters of the country. What is more, we see the enemy reduced, and ourselves increased in both numbers and strength.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, if the allies we have gained would only stay on with us, we should be able to accomplish much more both by force, when occasion calls for it, and by persuasion, when that is needed; and it is not my business a whit more than it is yours to see to it that as many of the allies as possible agree to stay;
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>but just as, when we are called upon to fight, the one who conquers the greatest number has the glory of being considered the most valorous, so also when we are called upon to use persuasion, he that converts the greatest number to our opinion would justly be accounted at once the most eloquent and the most efficient.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>Do not, however, aim at displaying to us the arguments that you will address to each one of them, but set to work with the feeling that those who are persuaded by any one of you will show what they are by what they do.
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>Do you, therefore, see to this. And I, for my part, will try to see to it, as far as I can, that the soldiers are supplied with all that they need, while they are deliberating about going on with the campaign.&rdquo;</p></div1>
<div1 type="Book" n="6"><p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After spending that day in the manner described, they dined and went to rest. Early on the following morning all the allies came to Cyaxares's headquarters. So while Cyaxares was attiring himself (for he heard that there was a large concourse of people at his doors), various friends were presenting the allies to <persName>Cyrus</persName>. One<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The allies beg <persName>Cyrus</persName> to stay</note> group brought the Cadusians, who begged him to stay; another, the Hyrcanians; some one brought forward the Sacians, and some one else, Gobryas; Hystaspas presented Gadatas, the eunuch, and he also begged <persName>Cyrus</persName> to remain.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Then <persName>Cyrus</persName>, though he realized that Gadatas had for some time been frightened almost to death for fear the army should be disbanded, laughing said: &ldquo;It is clear, Gadatas, that Hystaspas here has been instigating you to the ideas that you have been expressing.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And Gadatas lifting up his hands toward heaven declared on his oath that he had not been influenced by Hystaspas to entertain those feelings. &ldquo;But I know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that if you and your men go away, it is all over with me. For this reason, I introduced the subject with him of my own accord, asking him if he knew what it was your intention to do with reference to disbanding the army.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I was wrong, then, as it seems,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;in accusing our friend Hystaspas.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, you were indeed,&rdquo; said Hystaspas. &ldquo;For I was only remarking to our friend Gadatas that it was not possible for you to go on with the campaign; for I told him that your father was sending for you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>. &ldquo;Did you dare to let that get out, whether I would or no?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;for I observe that you are exceedingly anxious to go around in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> the cynosure of all eyes, and to parade before your father the way you have managed everything here.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And do not you wish to go home yourself?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; said Hystaspas; &ldquo;and I am not going either; but I shall stay here and be general, until I have made our friend Gadatas master of the Assyrian.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus half-seriously did they jest with one another.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meantime, Cyaxares came out in gorgeous attire<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The conference on the continuance of the war</note> and seated himself on a Median throne. And when all whose presence was required had assembled and silence prevailed, Cyaxares addressed them as follows: &ldquo;Friends and allies, since I happen to be here and am older than <persName>Cyrus</persName>, it is perhaps proper for me to open the conference. To begin with, this seems to me to be an opportune time for us to discuss the question whether it is desirable to continue our campaign longer or at once to disband the armies. Any one, therefore, may express his opinion in regard to this question.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon the Hyrcanian was the first to speak: &ldquo;Friends and comrades, I, for my part, cannot see what is the use of words, when the facts themselves point out the best course to follow. For we all know that when we are together, we do the enemy more harm than they do us; whereas as long as we were apart, they treated us as was most agreeable to them and most disagreeable to us.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After him the Cadusian spoke: &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;should we talk about going back home and being separated from one another, since not even in the field, so it seems, is it well for us to get separated? At any rate, we not long ago went off on an expedition apart from your main body and paid for it, as you also know.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After him Artabazus, the one who once claimed<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">I. iv. 27-28</note> to be a kinsman of <persName>Cyrus</persName>, made the following speech: &ldquo;In one point, Cyaxares, I beg to differ from the previous speakers: they say that we must stay here and carry on the war; but I say that it was when I was at home that I was carrying on wars.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And I say truly; for I often had to go to the rescue when our property was being carried off; and when our fortresses were threatened, I often had trouble to defend them; I lived in constant fear and was kept continually on guard. And I fared thus at my own expense. But now we are in possession of their forts; I am in fear of them no longer; I revel in the good things of the enemy and drink what is theirs. Therefore, as life at home was warfare, while life here is a feast, I do not care to have this festal gathering break up.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After him Gobryas spoke: &ldquo;Friends and comrades, up to the present time I have only praise for <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s faithfulness; for he has not proved untrue in anything that he has promised. But if he leaves the country now, it is evident that the Assyrian will take new heart without having to pay any penalty for the wrongs he has attempted to do us all and for those which he has done me; and I, in my turn, shall pay to him the penalty for having been your friend.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Last of all <persName>Cyrus</persName> spoke: &ldquo;I, too, am not unaware,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> closes the debate</note> my friends, that if we disband the army, our own situation would become weaker, while the enemy will again gather force. For as many of them as have been deprived of their arms will soon have new ones made, and as many as have been deprived of their horses will soon again procure others, while in place of those who have been killed others will have grown to young manhood to take their places. And so it will not be at all surprising, if in a very short time they are able again to give us trouble.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why then do you suppose I suggested to Cyaxares to bring up the question of disbanding the army? Let me tell you; it was because I feared for the future; for I see foes advancing against us that we shall never be able to cope with, if we go on campaigning in our present fashion.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>For winter<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The battle against cold and hunger</note> is coming, you know; and even granting that we have shelter for ourselves, still, by Zeus, there will be none for our horses or for our attendants or for the rank and file of the army; and without them we could not carry on the war. The provisions, whereever we have gone, we have consumed; and where we have not gone, the people out of fear of us have conveyed them into their strongholds, so that they have them themselves, and we cannot get them.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Who then is so valiant and so strong that he can prosecute a war while battling against hunger and cold? If, therefore, we propose to go on with the war as we have been doing, I maintain that we ought of our own free will to disband the army, rather than against our will to be driven out of the country by lack of means. But if we wish to go on with the war, this I say we must do: we must try as<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Fortified posts in the enemy's country</note> quickly as we may to get possession of as many as possible of their forts and build for ourselves as many as we can. For, if this is done, that side will have more provisions which is able to get and store up more, and those will be in a state of siege who are weaker.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>As we are, we are not at all different from those who sail the seas: they keep on sailing continually, but they leave the waters over which they have sailed no more their own than those over which they have not sailed. But if we get fortresses, these will alienate the country from the enemy while everything will be smooth sailing for us.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But perhaps some of you may fear that you will possibly have to do garrison duty far from your own country. You need have no hesitation on that score. For since we are far from home in any event, we will take it upon ourselves to do the garrison duty for you in the places nearest to the enemy; but those parts of Assyria which are on your own borders&mdash;do you take possession of them and cultivate them.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>For if we can safely guard what is near the enemy, you will enjoy a plenitude of peace in possession of the regions far away from them; for they, I trow, will not be able to neglect those who are close to them, while they lay schemes against those who are far away.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After these speeches all the rest, and Cyaxares<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The unanimous decision for war</note> with them, stood up and declared that they would be glad to co-operate with him in these plans. And Gadatas and Gobryas said that if the allies would permit them, they would each of them build a fortress, so that the allies should have these also on their side.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw that all were ready to do whatever he suggested, he finally said: &ldquo;Well then, if we wish to put into execution what we say we ought to do, we should as soon as possible procure siege-engines to demolish the enemy's forts, and builders to erect strong towers for our own defence.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hereupon Cyaxares promised to have an<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Measures for strength and health</note> engine made at his own expense and to put it at their disposal, Gadatas and Gobryas promised another, and Tigranes a third; <persName>Cyrus</persName> said that he would himself try to furnish two.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>When this had been agreed upon, they set to work to procure engine-builders and to furnish whatever was needed for the construction of the engines; and they put in charge of it men whom they considered most competent to attend to this work.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since <persName>Cyrus</persName> realized that a long time would be required for the execution of these designs, he encamped with his army in a place which he thought was most healthful and most readily accessible for conveying there everything that was necessary. And wherever any point needed further strengthening, he made provision that those who from time to time remained there should be in safety, even if he should be encamped at a distance with the main body of his forces.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>But in addition to this, he made constant inquiry of those whom he thought likely to know about the country from what parts of it the army might get supplies as plentifully as possible and kept leading his men out on foraging expeditions; this he did partly that he might get supplies for the army in as great abundance as possible, partly that they might become inured to labour through these expeditions and might thus be in better health and strength, and partly that by such marches they might be enabled to keep their respective positions in mind.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, <persName>Cyrus</persName> was occupied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> a report was now brought by<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The king leaves <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></note> deserters and confirmed by his prisoners of war, that the Assyrian king had gone off in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> with many talents of gold and silver and with other treasures and jewels of every sort.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>So it became general talk among the rank and file of the soldiers that he was already conveying his treasures to a place of safety because he was afraid. But <persName>Cyrus</persName>, recognizing that he had gone for the purpose of forming, if he could, a coalition against him, made vigorous counter preparation in the expectation that he would have to fight again. And so he set<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> increases his cavalry</note> about bringing to its full complement the Persian cavalry, for which he obtained horses, some requisitioned from the captives, and a certain number also presented to him by his friends; for he accepted such gifts from every one and never refused anything, whether any one offered him a fine weapon or a horse.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Besides, with the chariots taken from the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> introduces a corps of chariots of war</note> enemy and with whatever others he could get he equipped a corps of chariots of his own. The method of managing a chariot employed of old at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and that in vogue among the Cyrenaeans even unto this day he abolished; for in previous times people in Media and in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and in <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, and all the people in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> used the chariot just as the Cyrenaeans now do.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>But it seemed to him that inasmuch as the best men were mounted on the chariots, that part which might have been the chief strength of the army acted only the part of skirmishers and did not contribute anything of importance to the victory. For three hundred chariots call for three hundred combatants and require twelve hundred horses. And the fighting men must of course have as drivers the men in whom they have most confidence, that is, the best men to be had. That makes three hundred more, who do not do the enemy the least harm.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>So he abolished this method of handling chariots, and in place of it he had chariots of war constructed with strong wheels, so that they might not easily be broken, and with long axles; for anything broad is less likely to be overturned. The box for the driver he constructed out of strong timbers in the form of a turret; and this rose in height to the drivers' elbows, so that they could manage the horses by reaching over the top of the box; and, besides, he covered the drivers with mail, all except their eyes.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>On both sides of the wheels, moreover, he attached to the axles steel scythes about two cubits long and beneath the axles other scythes pointing down toward the ground; this was so arranged with the intention of hurling the chariots into the midst of the enemy. And as <persName>Cyrus</persName> constructed them at that time, such even to this day are the chariots in use in the king's dominions.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He also had a large number of camels, some collected from among his friends and some taken in war, all brought together.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>Thus these plans were being put into execution.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, he wished to send some one as a spy into <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> to find out what the Assyrian was doing, and it seemed to him that Araspas, the guardian of the beautiful woman, was the proper person to go on this mission. Now Araspas's case had taken a turn like<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Araspas and Panthea</note> this: he had fallen in love with the lady and could not resist the impulse to approach her with amorous proposals.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>But she repulsed his advances and was true to her husband, although he was far away; for she loved him devotedly. Still, she did not accuse Araspas to <persName>Cyrus</persName>, for she shrank from making trouble between friends.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>But when Araspas, thinking that he should thus further the attainment of his desires, threatened the woman that he would use force if she would not submit willingly, then in fear of outrage the lady no longer kept it secret but<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">She appeals to <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> sent her eunuch to <persName>Cyrus</persName> with instructions to tell him the whole story.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard it he laughed outright at the man who had claimed to be superior to the passion of love; and he sent Artabazus back with the eunuch and bade him warn Araspas not to lay violent hands upon such a woman; but if he could win her consent, he himself would interpose no objection.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>So, when Artabazus came to Araspas, he rebuked him severely, saying that the woman had been given to him in trust; and he dwelt upon his ungodliness, sinfulness, and sensuality, until Araspas shed bitter tears of contrition and was overwhelmed with shame and frightened to death lest <persName>Cyrus</persName> should punish him.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>So, when <persName>Cyrus</persName> learned of this he sent for him<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> discusses with Araspas his fall</note> and had a talk with him in private. &ldquo;I see, Araspas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you are afraid of me and terribly overcome with shame. Do not feel that way, pray; for I have heard say that even gods are victims of love; and as for mortals, I know what even some who are considered very discreet have suffered from love. And I had too poor an opinion of myself to suppose that I should have the strength of will to be thrown in contact with beauty and be indifferent to it. Besides, I am myself responsible for your condition, for it was I that shut you up with this irresistible creature.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>&ldquo;Aye, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said Araspas, interrupting him, &ldquo;you are in this, just as in everything else, gentle and forgiving of human errors. Other men make me ready to sink with my shame; for ever since the report of my fall got out, my enemies have been exulting over me, while my friends come to me and advise me to keep out of the way, for fear that you punish me for committing so great a wrong.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>&ldquo;Let me tell you then, Araspas,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;that by reason of this very report which people have heard in regard to you, you are in a position to do me a very great favour and to be of great assistance to our allies.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Would that some occasion might arise,&rdquo; answered Araspas, &ldquo;in which I could be of service to you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>&ldquo;If, then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;under pretence<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> sends him as a spy</note> that you were fleeing from me you would go over into the enemy's country, I believe they would trust you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said Araspas, &ldquo;and I know that even with my friends I could start the story that I was running away from you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>&ldquo;Then you would return to us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with full information about the enemy's condition and plans. And I suppose that because of their trusting you they would make you a participant in their discussions and counsels, so that not a single thing that we wish to know would be hidden from you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will start at once; and one of the circumstances that will gain my story credence will be the appearance that I have run away because I was likely to be punished by you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>&ldquo;And will you be able to give up the beautiful Panthea?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for I evidently have two<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Doctrine of the duality of the soul</note> souls. I have now worked out this doctrine of philosophy in the school of that crooked sophist, Eros. For if the soul is one, it is not both good and bad at the same time, neither can it at the same time desire the right and the wrong, nor at the same time both will and not will to do the same things; but it is obvious that there are two souls, and when the good one prevails, what is right is done; but when the bad one gains the ascendency, what is wrong is attempted. And now, since she has taken you to be her ally, it is the good soul that has gained the mastery, and that completely.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;if you also have decided to go, this is what you must do so as to gain the more credence with them: tell them all<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s final instructions to Araspas</note> about our affairs, but frame your account in such a way that your information will be the greatest possible hindrance to the success of their plans. And it would be a hindrance, if you should represent that we were making ready to invade their country at some point; for upon hearing this, they would be less likely to gather in full force, as each man would be afraid for his own possessions at home.
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/> And stay with them as long as possible; for the most valuable information we can have will be in regard to what they are doing when they have come nearest to us. And advise them also to marshal themselves in whatever order seems best; for when you come away, it will be necessary for them to retain this order, even though they think you are familiar with it. For they will be slow to change it, and, if on the spur of the moment they make a change anywhere, they will be thrown into confusion.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Araspas withdrew; he got together the most trusted of his attendants, told some of his friends such things as he thought would contribute to the success of his scheme, and was gone.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Panthea learned that Araspas had gone<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Panthea sends for Abradatas</note> away, she sent word to <persName>Cyrus</persName>, saying: &ldquo;Do not be distressed, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that Araspas has gone over to the enemy; for if you will allow me to send to my husband, I can guarantee you that a much more faithful friend will come to you than Araspas was. And what is more, I know that he will come to you with as many troops as he can bring. For while the father of the present king was his friend, this present king once even attempted to separate me from my husband. Inasmuch, therefore, as he considers the king an insolent scoundrel, I am sure that he would be glad to transfer his allegiance to such a man as you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard that, he bade her send word to her husband; and she did so. And when Abradatas read the cipher message sent by his wife and was informed how matters stood otherwise, he joyfully proceeded with about a thousand horse to join <persName>Cyrus</persName>. When he came up to the Persian sentries, he sent to <persName>Cyrus</persName> to let him know who it was; and <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave orders to take him at once to his wife.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when Abradatas and his wife saw each other they embraced each other with joy, as was natural, considering they had not expected ever to meet again. Thereafter Panthea told of <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s piety and self-restraint and of his compassion for her.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me, Panthea,&rdquo; said Abradatas when he heard<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Abradatas makes common cause with <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> this, &ldquo;what can I do to pay the debt of gratitude that you and I owe to <persName>Cyrus</persName>?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What else, pray,&rdquo; said Panthea, &ldquo;than to try to be to him what he has been to you?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Later Abradatas went to <persName>Cyrus</persName>. When he saw him he took his right hand in his and said: &ldquo;In return for the kindnesses you have done us, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I do not know what more to say than that I offer myself to you to be your friend, your servant, your ally. And in whatsoever enterprise I see you engage, I shall try to co-operate with you to the very best of my ability.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And I accept your offer,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>. &ldquo;And now I will take leave of you and let you go to dinner with your wife. Some other time you will be expected to dine at my headquarters with your friends and mine.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this, as Abradatas observed that <persName>Cyrus</persName> was busily engaged with the scythe-bearing chariots and the mailed horses and riders, he tried to contribute from his own cavalry as many as a hundred chariots like them; and he made ready to lead them in person upon his chariot.
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>He had the harnessing of his own chariot, moreover, arranged with four poles and eight horses abreast; [and his wife, Panthea, with here own money had a golden corselet made for him and a helmet and armlet of gold;] and he had the horses of his chariot equipped with armour of solid bronze.
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the work of Abradatas; and when <persName>Cyrus</persName> saw his chariot with four poles, he conceived the idea that it was possible to make one even with eight poles, so as to move with eight yoke of oxen the lowest story of his movable towers; including the wheels, this portion was about three fathoms high from the ground.
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/> Moreover, when such towers were taken along with each division of the army, it seemed to him that they were a great help to his own phalanx and would occasion great loss to the ranks of the enemy. And on the different stories he constructed galleries also and battlements; and on each tower he stationed twenty men.
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when all the appurtenances of his towers were put together, he made an experiment of their draught; and the eight yoke of oxen drew the tower with the men upon it more easily than each individual yoke could draw its <emph>usual</emph> load of baggage; for the load of baggage was about twenty-five talents<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">That is, about <date value="1400">1400</date> pounds; the Attic talent is equivalent to 55 3/4 pounds avoirdupois.</note> to the yoke; whereas the weight of the tower, on which the timbers were as thick as those of the tragic stage, together with the twenty men and their arms amounted to less than fifteen talents to each yoke of oxen.
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Inasmuch, therefore, as he found that the hauling of the towers was easy, he made ready to take them with the army, for he thought that seizing an advantage in time of war was at once safety and justice and happiness.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this juncture, representatives from the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Envoys from <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> are sent as spies</note> Indian king arrived with money; they announced also that the Indian king sent him the following message: &ldquo;I am glad, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that you let me know what you needed. I desire to be your friend, and I am sending you the money, and if you need more, send for it. Moreover, my representatives have been instructed to do whatever you ask.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, when he heard this, &ldquo;I ask some of you to remain where you have been assigned quarters and keep guard of this money and live as best pleases you, while three of you will please go to the enemy on pretence of having been sent by the king of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> to make an alliance between them and him; and when you have learned how things stand there, what they are doing and proposing to do, bring word of it as soon as possible to me and to your king. And if you perform this service acceptably, I shall be even more grateful to you for that than I am for your bringing the money with which you have come. And this is service which you are eminently fitted to perform; for spies disguised as slaves can give information of nothing more in their reports than what every one knows; whereas men in your capacity often discover even what is being planned.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Indians were naturally pleased to hear this, and when they had been entertained by <persName>Cyrus</persName>, they made ready and set out on the following day with the solemn promise that when they had learned as much as they could they would return from the enemy's side with all possible dispatch.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The rest of his preparations for war <persName>Cyrus</persName> now<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Further preparations for the conflict</note> continued on a magnificent scale, for he was planning no mean enterprise; and he provided not only for that which his allies had agreed upon but he also inspired his friends to rivalry among themselves, in order that each complement might strive to show its men the best armed soldiers, the most skilled horsemen, the best marksmen with spear or bow, and the most industrious workers.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And, as a means of accomplishing this, he took them out to hunt and rewarded those who were in each particular most efficient. Furthermore, those officers who, he saw, were eager to have their own soldiers most efficient he spurred on with praise and with whatever favours he could bestow.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And then, too, whenever he performed a sacrifice or celebrated a festival, he instituted in connection with it contests in all those events in which people train as a discipline for war, and to the victors he offered splendid prizes; and the whole camp was in the best of spirits.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> now had almost everything ready that he wished to have for his expedition except the engines of war. For the ranks of his Persian horse were now filled up to the number of ten thousand, the scythe-bearing chariots that he himself had had constructed had now reached the full number of one hundred, and those which Abradatas of <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName> had undertaken to secure like those of <persName>Cyrus</persName> had also reached the full number of one hundred more.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> had persuaded Cyaxares to transform the Median chariots also from the Trojan and Libyan type to this same style, and these amounted to another full hundred. For the camel corps, bowmen were detailed, two upon each camel. Thus the rank and file of the army generally cherished the feeling that the victory was already perfectly assured and that the enemy's side was as nothing.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While they were in this state of mind, the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The report of the Indian spies</note> Indians that <persName>Cyrus</persName> had sent as spies to the enemy's camp returned with the report that Croesus had been chosen field-marshal and commander-in-chief of all the enemy's hosts, that all the allied kings had decided to join him with their entire forces, to contribute vast sums of money, and to expend them in hiring what soldiers they could and in giving presents to those whom they were under obligations to reward.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>They reported also that many Thracian swordsmen had already been hired and that Egyptians were under sail to join them, and they gave the number as one hundred and twenty thousand men armed with shields that came to their feet, with huge spears, such as they carry even to this day, and with sabres. Besides these, there was also the Cyprian army. The Cilicians were all present already, they said, as were also the contingents from both Phrygias, <placeName key="tgn,1003785">Lycaonia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7016760">Paphlagonia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>; the Assyrians were there under the king of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>; the Ionians also and the Aeolians and almost all the Greek colonists in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> had been compelled to join Croesus, and Croesus had even sent to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> to negotiate an alliance.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>This army, they said, was being mustered at the River Pactolus, but it was their intention to advance to Thymbrara, where even to-day is the rendezvous of the king's barbarians from the interior. And a general call had been issued to bring provisions to market there.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The prisoners also told practically the same story as the Indian spies; for this was another thing that <persName>Cyrus</persName> always looked out for&mdash;that prisoners should be taken, from whom he was likely to gain some intelligence. And he used also to send out spies disguised as slaves to pretend that they were deserters from him.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army heard this report, they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">General alarm at the report</note> were disturbed, as was natural; they went about more subdued than had been their wont, they gathered in groups, and every corner was full of people discussing the situation and asking one another's opinion.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> perceived that a panic was spreading through his army, he called together the officers of the different divisions and all others whose despondency he thought might cause injury and whose enthusiasm would be a help. And he sent word to his aides-de-camp that if any one else of the armed soldiers wished to attend the meeting and listen to the speeches, they should not hinder him. And when they had come together, he addressed them as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Friends and allies, I have called you<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> calms their fears</note> together because I observed that when this news came from the enemy, some of you looked as if you were frightened. Now it seems strange to me that any of you should really be afraid because the enemy are mustering; but when you see that we are mustered in much larger numbers than we had when we defeated them and that we are now, thank heaven, much better equipped than we were then&mdash;it is strange that when you see this you are not filled with courage!
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What in the name of heaven, pray, would you who are now afraid have done, if the situation were reversed and some one told you that these forces that we have now were coming against us? And what, if you heard, in the first place, that those who had defeated us before were coming again, their hearts full of the victory they then gained; and, in the second place, that those who before made short work of the skirmishing lines of bowmen and spearmen were now coming and others like them many times their number;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>and, in the third place, that, equipped in the same armour in which they were armed when their infantry defeated our infantry, they have cavalry now coming to meet our cavalry; that they have rejected the bow and the javelin, and that each man has adopted one heavy lance and is resolved to ride up and fight hand to hand?
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>And again, what would you have done, if you heard that chariots are coming which are not, as before, to stand still facing back as if for flight, but that the horses harnessed to the chariots are covered with mail, while the drivers stand in wooden towers and the parts of their body not defended by the towers are completely panoplied in breast-plates and helmets; and that scythes of steel have been fitted to the axles, and that it is the intention to drive these also into the ranks of the enemy?
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Or again, if you heard that they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">and fills them with new enthusiasm</note> have camels on which they will ride up to us, and a hundred horses could not endure the sight of any one of them? And again, that they are coming with towers, from which they will protect their comrades and by throwing missiles hinder us from fighting in a fair field?
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>If any one reported to you that this was the condition of things among the enemy, what would you, who are now so frightened, have done, seeing that you were terrified when the report came that Croesus had been elected commander-in-chief of the enemy&mdash;Croesus, who was a worse coward than the Syrians; for the Syrians fled because they were defeated in the battle, whereas Croesus, instead of standing by his allies, beat a hasty retreat when he saw that they were defeated?
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And finally, you see, the report is brought that the enemy do not feel that they are strong enough to fight us by themselves, but are hiring others in the hope that these will fight for them more valiantly than they can for themselves. However, if there are any to whom the situation over there&mdash;such as it is&mdash;seems formidable, while our own condition seems contemptible, I say, men, that we ought to send them over to the enemy, for they would be much more useful to us over there than in our ranks.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> had finished his speech, Chrysantas,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chrysantas explains away the apparent fear</note> the Persian, arose and spoke as follows: &ldquo;Do not wonder, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that some looked disconsolate when they heard the report; for it was not from fear that they felt this, but from vexation&mdash;just as, if it should be announced, when people are ready and waiting to sit down to luncheon, that there is some work that they must do before they may eat, not one, I venture to say, would be pleased to hear it. So we also, thinking we were just on the point of getting rich, all put on a disconsolate look when we heard that there was some work left over which we must do; and it was not because we were frightened, but because we wished that this, too, were already accomplished.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But our disappointment is past, seeing that we are to contend not for <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> only, where there is an abundance of grain and flocks and date-palms, but for <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> as well; for in that land there is an abundance of wine and figs and olive oil, and its shores are washed by the sea; and over its waters more good things are brought than any one has ever seen&mdash;when we think of that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we are no longer vexed, but our courage rises to the highest point, with desire to come all the more quickly into the enjoyment of these good things in <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> also.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke; and the allies were all pleased with his speech and applauded.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And indeed, my friends,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I propose<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes an immediate advance</note> that we move against them as soon as possible, in the first place that we may reach the place where their supplies are being collected, before they do, if we can; and in the second place, because the faster we march the less perfected we shall find their arrangements and the greater we shall find their deficiencies.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>This, then, is my proposal; but if any one thinks that any other course would be safer or easier for us, let him inform us.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Many supported him, saying that it was expedient to proceed as soon as possible against the enemy, and no one opposed his plan; so <persName>Cyrus</persName> began to speak as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Friends and allies, our souls and bodies and the arms that we shall have to use have, with God's help, long since been made ready. And now for the march we must get together for ourselves and for the animals that we use provisions for not less than twenty days; for in reckoning it up, I find that there will be more than fifteen days' journey in which we shall find no provisions at all; for everything there has been made away with: the enemy took all that they could, and we have taken the rest.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Accordingly, we must put up and carry with us food enough; for without this we should be unable either to fight or to live. As for wine, each one ought to take along only enough to last till we accustom ourselves to drinking water; for the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The wine habit to be broken off gradually</note> greater part of the march will be through a country where there is no wine, and for that all the wine we can carry will not suffice, even if we take along a very great quantity.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>That we may not, therefore, fall a prey to sickness when we suddenly find ourselves deprived of wine, we must take this course: let us now begin at once to drink water at our meals, for by so doing we shall not greatly change our manner of living.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>For whoever eats barley bread always eats meal that has been kneaded up with water, and whoever eats wheaten bread eats of a loaf that was mixed with water; and everything boiled is prepared with water in very liberal quantities. So, if after the meal we drink some wine, our soul will lack nothing and find refreshment.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>But later on we must also gradually diminish the amount taken after dinner, until unconsciously we have become teetotalers. For gradual transition helps any nature to bear changes. Why, God teaches us that, by leading us gradually from winter to endure the burning heat of summer, and from the heat of summer to the rigours of winter; and we should imitate Him and reach the end we would attain by accustoming ourselves beforehand.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;For your heavy blankets you may substitute<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">General directions for equipment</note> an equal weight of provisions; for excess of provisions will not be useless. And do not be afraid that you will not sleep soundly for want of your blankets; if you do not, I will take the blame. However, if any one has a generous supply of clothing with him, that will be of good service to him whether he be well or ill.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;For meats, we must pack up and take along only such as are sharp, pungent, salty; for these not only stimulate the appetite but also afford the most lasting nourishment. And when we come out into a country that has not been plundered, where we are at once likely to find grain again, we must then have hand-mills ready made with which to prepare food, for these are the lightest of the implements used in making bread.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Again, we must take with us the things that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Equipment for&mdash;(1) hospital,</note> sick people need; for the weight they add is very small and, if we have a case of sickness, they will be very necessary.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;We must also have plenty of straps; for nearly<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(2) packs,</note> everything that men and horses have is fastened on with straps, and when these wear out or break, everything must come to a standstill, unless one has some extra ones.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And it will be a good thing for the man who has<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(3) arms,</note> been taught how to smooth down a spear-shaft not to forget a rasp; and it will be well to bring along a file too;
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>for he that whets his spear whets his courage, in a way, at the same time; for a man must be overcome with shame to be whetting his spear and yet feel himself a coward.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;We must also have a good supply of lumber for<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(4) vehicles,</note> the chariots and the wagons, for from constant use many parts necessarily become defective. We must have also the most indispensable tools for all these purposes;
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>for we shall not find mechanics everywhere, and almost any one can make what will serve for a day. Besides these, we must have a shovel and mattock for every wagon, and for each pack-animal an axe and a sickle; for these are useful to each one individually and often serviceable for the common good as well.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As to what is needed for the commissariat,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(5) commissary,</note> you officers of the armed soldiers must make inquiry of the men under you, for we must not overlook anything of this sort that any one may need; for it is we that shall feel the want of it, if it is lacking. In reference to what I order for the pack-animals, you officers of the baggage-train must inquire into the matter, and if any man is not properly provided, require him to procure what is lacking.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You superintendents of the engineering corps<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(6) engineers</note> have here from me a list of the spearmen, the archers, and the slingers, whose names have been stricken from the roster. You must require those of them who were spearmen to carry on the march a woodcutter's axe, those who were bowmen a mattock, and those who were slingers a shovel. With these tools they are to march in squads ahead of the wagons, so that, in case there is any need of road-building, you may get to work without delay, and so that, if I require their services, I may know where to find them when the time comes.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And finally I shall take along those of an age<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Special arrangements for artisans</note> for military service who are smiths and carpenters and cobblers, in order that, if anything is wanted in the army in the line of their trades also, we may not suffer for lack of it. And they shall be relieved of assignments to duty under arms, but they shall occupy the position assigned to them and there ply their trades for pay at the order of whoever wishes their services.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And any merchant who wishes to accompany<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">and merchants</note> us, seeking a market for his wares, may do so; but if he is caught trying to sell anything within the number of days for which the troops are ordered to furnish their own provisions, he shall have all his goods confiscated. But when those days are past, he may sell as he pleases. And the man who seems to offer the largest stock of goods shall receive rewards and preferment both from the allies and from myself.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>And if any merchant thinks he needs more money for the purchase of supplies, let him bring me vouchers for his respectability and identity, and sureties as a pledge that he is really going with the army, and he shall receive a certain amount from the fund we have.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;These are the directions I have to give in advance. If any one thinks of anything else that we need, let him inform me of it.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now do you go and make ready, and I will sacrifice for a blessing upon our start; and when the omens from the gods are favourable, we shall give the signal, and all must come equipped with what has been prescribed and join their own commanders at the place appointed.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>And all of you officers, when you have made ready each his own division, come to me that you may acquaint yourselves with your several positions.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they heard this they began to make ready<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The advance begins</note> for the march, and <persName>Cyrus</persName> proceeded to sacrifice; and when the omens of the sacrifice were favourable, he set out with the army. On the first day he left the position he had occupied and encamped again as near as convenient to it. This he did, in order that, in case any one had forgotten anything, he might go back after it; and if any one discovered that he needed anything, he might still procure it.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Cyaxares, however, remained behind with one third of the Medes, so as not to leave the home country unprotected, while <persName>Cyrus</persName>, with the cavalry at the head of the line, marched as rapidly as possible; but he never failed to send patrols ahead, and scouts<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The order of march</note> up to the heights commanding the widest view before them. After these he arranged the baggage train, and where the country was flat he arranged many lines of wagons and pack-animals abreast; the phalanx followed next, and if any part of the baggage train lagged behind, such of the officers as happened to be at hand took care that they and their men should not be retarded in their advance.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But when the road was narrower, the soldiers put the baggage in between their lines and marched on either side of it; and if they met with any hindrance, those of the soldiers who were near the place took the matter in hand. For the most part, the companies marched with their own baggage next to them; for the baggage captains had orders to go along with their own respective companies unless something unavoidable should prevent it.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And the baggage man of each captain went ahead bearing an ensign that was known to the men of his own company. They were thus enabled to march close together, and they were extremely careful, each of his own property, that nothing should be left behind. As they maintained this order, it was never necessary for them to look for one another, and at the same time everything was kept close at hand and in greater safety, and the soldiers always obtained more promptly anything that was wanted.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the scouts who went forward thought they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The enemy is sighted</note> saw men getting fodder and fuel on the plain; and they also saw beasts of burden, some loaded with other supplies of that sort and others grazing. Then, as they looked further on into the distance, they thought that they detected smoke or a cloud of dust rising up. From all these evidences they pretty well recognised that the army of the enemy was somewhere in the neighbourhood.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Accordingly, the officer in command of the scouts at once sent a man to report the news to <persName>Cyrus</persName>; and when he heard it he ordered them to remain at their look-out place and send him reports from time to time of whatever they saw that was new. Moreover, he sent forward a company of cavalry with orders to try to capture some of the men moving up and down the plain, in order that he might learn more definitely the real state of affairs. Accordingly, those who received these orders proceeded to execute them.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He himself halted the rest of the army there, so that they might make what preparations he considered necessary before they were in too close quarters. And he gave the word to take luncheon first and then to remain at their posts and be on the watch for orders.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>So, when they had eaten, he summoned together the commanders of the cavalry, the infantry, and the chariot corps, and also the officers in charge of the engines, of the baggage train, and of the wagons, and they came.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> gets information about the enemy</note> those who made the raid into the plain had captured some people and now brought them in; and the prisoners, when cross-questioned by <persName>Cyrus</persName>, said that they were from the camp and had come out after fodder, passing out beyond their advanced guards, while others had gone after fuel; for by reason of the vast numbers of their army, everything was scarce.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>On hearing this, <persName>Cyrus</persName> asked: &ldquo;How far from here is your army?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;About two parasangs,&rdquo; they replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Was there any talk about us over there?&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> then asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;a great deal, and to the effect that you were already close upon us in your advance.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;were they glad when they heard we were coming?&rdquo; This question he asked for the benefit of the bystanders.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;they were not glad in the least, but were rather very much troubled.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And what are they doing now?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;They are being marshalled in battle array,&rdquo; they answered; &ldquo;and yesterday and the day before they were doing the same.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And the marshal,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;who is he?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Croesus himself,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;and with him a Greek and some one else&mdash;a Mede; the latter, however, was said to be a deserter from your side.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Grant, O Zeus almighty,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;that it be mine to get hold of him, as I desire!&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he ordered the prisoners to be led away,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The enemy reconnoitres</note> and turned to the bystanders as if to say something. But at that moment another messenger came from the captain of the scouts with word that a large body of cavalry was within sight on the plain. &ldquo;And we presume,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that they are coming with the intention of reconnoitring the army here. And we have good reasons for the suspicion, for at a considerable distance in advance of this company about thirty other horsemen are riding forward; as a matter of fact, they are riding in the direction of our party, aiming perhaps, if possible, to get possession of our look-out point; and we who are holding this particular point are only ten in number.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So <persName>Cyrus</persName> ordered a detachment of the horsemen who formed his body-guard to ride up to the foot of the place of look-out and to remain quiet there out of sight of the enemy. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;when our ten leave the look-out place, rush up and attack the enemy as they come up it. But that the horsemen of the large battalion may not bring you to grief, do you, Hystaspas,&rdquo; said he to that officer, &ldquo;take your regiment of cavalry, go out against them, and show yourself over against the enemy's battalion. But do not by any means allow yourself to pursue into places that you do not know, but when you have made sure that the look-out stations remain in your possession, come back. And if any ride toward you, holding up their right hands, receive them as friends.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, Hystaspas went away and donned<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Araspas returns</note> his armour; the men from <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s body-guard rode off at once, as he had ordered. And just within the picket line there met them, with his attendants, the man who had been sent some time since as a spy, the guardian of the lady of <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>So when <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard this, he sprang up from his seat, went to meet him, and welcomed him cordially; and the rest, knowing nothing of the facts, were naturally astonished at his actions until <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;My friends, here has come a man most loyal; for now all the world must know at once what he has done. He went away not because his disgrace was too great for him to bear, nor because he feared my displeasure, but because I sent him to discover for us the exact condition of the enemy and to report to us the true state of affairs.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And now, Araspas, I have not forgotten what I promised you, and I will fulfil it, and all these men shall help me; for it is only right, my friends, that you also should all honour him as a valiant man. For, for our general good, he has risked his life and borne the stigma that was put upon him.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then all embraced Araspas and gave him a hearty welcome. But <persName>Cyrus</persName>, remarking that there had been enough of that, added, &ldquo;Tell us, Araspas, what it is of the first importance for us to know; and do not detract anything from the truth nor underrate the real strength of the enemy. For it is better for us to think it greater and find it less than to hear that it is less and find it really more formidable.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Araspas, &ldquo;but I did take steps to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He delivers his report</note> get the most accurate information about the size of their army; for I was present in person and helped to draw it up in battle order.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;you are acquainted not only with their numbers but also with their order of battle.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; answered Araspas, &ldquo;I am; and I know also how they are planning to conduct the battle.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;still, tell us first, in round numbers, how many of them there are.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;with the exception of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The enemy's order of battle</note> the Egyptians, they are all drawn up thirty deep, both foot and horse, and their front extends about forty stadia; for I took especial pains to find out how much space they covered.&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The stadium is 600 feet; the ancient soldier was normally allowed 3 feet. That makes a front of 200 men per stadium, 8,000 for the entire front. That means, as they stood 30 deep, 240,000 in the army, and with the Egyptians 360,000.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And how are the Egyptians drawn up?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;for you said &lsquo;with the exception of the Egyptians.&rsquo;&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;The brigadier-generals drew them up&mdash;each one ten thousand men, a hundred square; for this, they said, was their manner of arranging their order of battle at home. And Croesus consented to their being so drawn up, but very reluctantly, for he wished to outflank your army as much as possible.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And what is his object in doing that, pray?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In order, by Zeus,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to surround you with the part that extends beyond your line.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;they may have an opportunity to find out whether the surrounders may not be surrounded.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Now we have heard from you what it is of the first importance for us to learn. And you,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> outlines his order of battle</note> my men, must carry out the following programme: when you leave me, look at once to your own accoutrement and that of your horses; for often, for want of a trifle, man or horse or chariot becomes useless. And early to-morrow morning, during the time that I shall be sacrificing, first you must all breakfast, both men and horses, so that we may not fail in anything that it may be of importance for us to do in any exigency.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And then do you, Arsamas,&rdquo; said he,...&ldquo;and you &lt;Chrysantas&gt; take charge of the right wing, as you always have done, and the rest of you brigadier-generals take the posts you now have. When the race is on, it is not the time for any chariot to change horses. So instruct your captains and lieutenants to form a line with each separate platoon two deep.&rdquo; &lt;Now each platoon contained twenty-four men.&gt;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And do you think, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said one of the generals, &ldquo;that drawn up with lines so shallow we shall be a match for so deep a phalanx?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;When phalanxes are too deep to reach the enemy with weapons,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;how do you think they can either hurt their enemy or help their friends?
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>For my part, I would rather have these<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He explains the advantages of his plan</note> hoplites who are arranged in columns a hundred deep drawn up ten thousand deep; for in that case we should have very few to fight against. According to the depth that I shall give my line of battle, I think I shall bring the entire line into action and make it everywhere mutually helpful.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>I shall bring up the spearmen immediately behind the heavy-armed troops, and the bowmen immediately behind the spearmen; for why should any one put in the front ranks those who themselves acknowledge that they could never withstand the shock of battle in a hand-to-hand encounter? But with the heavy-armed troops as a shield in front of them, they will stand their ground; and the one division with their spears, the other with their arrows will rain destruction upon the enemy, over the heads of all the lines in front. And whatever harm any one does to the enemy, in all this he obviously lightens the task of his comrades.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Behind all the rest I shall station the so-called rear-guard of veteran reserves. For just as a house, without a strong foundation or without the things that make a roof, is good for nothing, so likewise a phalanx is good for nothing, unless both front and rear are composed of valiant men.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you, therefore, take your positions as I direct, and you also, the officers of the light-armed troops, bring up your platoons immediately behind them, and you, the officers of the archery, fall in, in the same way, directly behind the light-armed troops.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now you, the commander of the rear-guard,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He gives his final directions</note> as you are behind all the rest with your men, issue orders to your own division that each man watch those immediately in front of him, encourage those who are doing their duty, threaten violently those who lag behind, and punish with death any one who turns his back with traitorous intent. For it is the duty of the men in the front ranks with word and deed to encourage those who follow them, while it is your business, who occupy the rear, to inspire the cowardly with greater fear than the enemy does.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That is what you have to attend to. Now you, Euphratas, who are commander of the division in charge of the engines, manage to have the teams that draw the towers follow as close as possible behind the phalanx.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>And you, Dau+chus, who have command of the baggage-train, bring up all your division of the army next after the towers, and let your adjutants punish severely those who advance or fall behind further than is expedient.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you, Carduchus, who have charge of the carriages which convey the women, bring them up in the rear next after the baggage-train. For, if all this follows, it will give an impression of numbers and will afford us an opportunity for an ambuscade; and if the enemy try to surround us, they will have to make a wider circuit; and the greater the circuit they have to make, the weaker they must necessarily make their line.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That is your course to pursue. But do you, Artaozus and Artagerses, have each of you a regiment of your infantry behind the carriages.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>And you, Pharnuchus and Asiadatas, keep each of you the regiment of cavalry under your command out of the main line and take your stand by yourselves behind the carriages, and then come to me with the rest of the officers. You must be just as fully ready, though in the rear, as if you were to be the first to have to join battle.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you, the commander of the men on camels, take your position also behind the women's carriages and do whatever Artagerses commands you.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And finally, do you officers of the chariot forces cast lots, and let the one to whose lot it falls bring up his hundred chariots in front of the main line; of the other two hundred, one shall take its place in line upon the right flank of the army, the other on the left, and follow the phalanx each in single file.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus did <persName>Cyrus</persName> plan his order of battle.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But Abradatas, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>, said: &ldquo;I will<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Abradatas asks for the post of danger</note> gladly volunteer to hold for you the post immediately in front of the enemy's phalanx, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, unless you have some better plan.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> admired his spirit and clasped his hand, and turning to the Persians in command of the other chariots he asked: &ldquo;Do you consent to this?&rdquo; But they answered that it was inconsistent with their idea of honour to yield the place to him; accordingly, he had them cast lots; and Abradatas was assigned by lot to the place for which he had volunteered, and took his place over against the Egyptians.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This done, they went away, and when they had attended to the details of all that I have mentioned, they went to dinner; and then they stationed their pickets and went to bed.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Early on the following day <persName>Cyrus</persName> was sacrificing,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">They prepare for battle</note> and the rest of the army, after breakfasting and pouring libations, proceeded to array themselves with many fine tunics and corselets and helms. And they armed their horses also with frontlets and breastplates; the saddle-horses also they armed with thigh-pieces and the chariot teams with side-armour. And so the whole army flashed with bronze and was resplendent in purple.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And Abradatas's chariot with its four poles and<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Panthea arrays Abradatas for the battle</note> eight horses was adorned most handsomely; and when he came to put on his linen corselet, such as they used in his country, Panthea brought him one of gold, also a helmet, arm-pieces, broad bracelets for his wrists&mdash;all of gold&mdash;and a purple tunic that hung down in folds to his feet, and a helmet-plume of hyacinth dye. All these she had had made without her husband's knowledge, taking the measure for them from his armour.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And when he saw them he was astonished and turning to Panthea, he asked: &ldquo;Tell me, wife, you did not break your own jewels to pieces, did you, to have this armour made for me?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; answered Panthea, &ldquo;at any rate, not my most precious jewel; for you, if you appear to others as you seem to me, shall be my noblest jewel.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With these words, she began to put the armour on him, and though she tried to conceal them, the tears stole down her cheeks.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when Abradatas was armed in his panoply he looked most handsome and noble, for he had been favoured by nature and, even unadorned, was well worth looking at; and taking the reins from his groom he was now making ready to mount his chariot.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But at this moment Panthea bade all who stood near to retire and then she said: &ldquo;Abradatas, if ever any<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">She exhorts him to bravery</note> woman loved her husband more than her own life, I think you know that I, too, am such a one. Why, then, should I tell of these things one by one? For I think that my conduct has given you better proof of it than any words I now might say.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Still, with the affection that you know I have for you, I swear to you by my love for you and yours for me that, of a truth, I would far rather go down into the earth with you, if you approve yourself a gallant soldier, than live disgraced with one disgraced: so worthy of the noblest lot have I deemed both you and myself.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And to <persName>Cyrus</persName> I think we owe a very large debt of gratitude, because, when I was his prisoner and allotted to him, he did not choose to keep me either as his slave or as a freewoman under a dishonourable name, but took me and kept me for you as one would a brother's wife.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And then, too, when Araspas, who had been charged with my keeping, deserted him, I promised him that if he would let me send to you, a far better and truer friend than Araspas would come to him, in you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus she spoke; and Abradatas, touched by<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The parting</note> her words, laid his hand upon her head and lifting up his eyes toward heaven prayed, saying: &ldquo;Grant me, I pray, almighty Zeus, that I may show myself a husband worthy of Panthea and a friend worthy of <persName>Cyrus</persName>, who has shown us honour.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As he said this, he mounted his car by the doors in the chariot-box.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And when he had entered and the groom closed the box, Panthea, not knowing how else she could now kiss him good-bye, touched her lips to the chariot-box. And then at once his chariot rolled away, but she followed after, unknown to him, until Abradatas turned round and saw her and said: &ldquo;Have a brave heart, Panthea, and farewell! And now go back.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the eunuchs and maid-servants took her and conducted her to her carriage, where they bade her recline, and hid her completely from view with the hood of the carriage. And the people, beautiful as was the sight of Abradatas and his chariat, had no eyes for him, until Panthea was gone.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when <persName>Cyrus</persName> found the omens from his sacrifice favourable, and when his army was arranged as he had instructed, he had posts of observation occupied, one in advance of another, and then called his generals together and addressed them as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>&ldquo;Friends and allies, the gods have sent us omens<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> analyses the situation</note> from the sacrifice just like those we had when they gave the former victory into our hands. So I wish to remind you of some things which, if you will remember them, I think will make you go into battle with much stouter hearts.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>On the one hand, you have received much better training in the arts of war than the enemy, you have lived together and drilled together in the same place for a much longer time now than they, and together you have won a victory; most of the enemy, on the other hand, have together suffered defeat. Some on both sides, however, were not in the battle; among these our enemies know that they have traitors by their sides, while you who are with us know that you are doing battle in company with those who are glad to stand by their comrades.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And it is a matter of course that those who trust one another will stand their ground and fight with one heart and mind, and that those who distrust each other will necessarily be scheming, each how he may get out of the way as quickly as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Therefore, my men, let us go against the enemy, to fight in a hand-to-hand encounter, with our chariots armed, against theirs unarmed; and our horses and riders in like manner armed, against theirs unarmed.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>The infantry that you will fight against, you have fought before&mdash;all but the Egyptians; and they are armed and drawn up alike badly; for with those big shields which they have they cannot do anything or see anything; and drawn up a hundred deep, it is clear that they will hinder one another from fighting&mdash;all except a few.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>But if they believe that by rushing they will rush us off the field, they will first have to sustain the charge of horses and of steel driven upon them by the force of horses; and if any of them should hold his ground, how will he be able to fight at the same time against cavalry and phalanxes and towers? And that he will have to do, for those upon our towers will come to our aid and raining their missiles upon the enemy will drive them to distraction rather than to fighting.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Still, if you think we need anything more, tell me; for with the help of the gods, we shall lack for nothing. So, if any one wishes to make any remarks, let him speak. If not, do you go to the place of sacrifice and pray to the gods to whom we have sacrificed and then go back to your posts.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And each one of you remind his own men of what I have called to your attention, and let each man prove to those whom he commands that he is himself worthy of command, by showing himself fearless in his bearing, in his countenance, and in his words.&rdquo;</p></div1>
<div1 type="Book" n="7"><p>
<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So when they had prayed to the gods they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> makes ready for the advance</note> went back to their posts; and while <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his staff were still engaged with the sacrifice, their attendants brought them meat and drink. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> remained standing just as he was and first offered to the gods a part and then began his breakfast, and kept giving a share of it also from time to time to any one who most needed it. And when he had poured a libation and prayed, he drank; and the rest, his staff-officers, followed his example. After that, he prayed to ancestral Zeus to be their guide and helper and then mounted his horse and bade his staff do the same.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now all <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s staff were panoplied in armour the same as his: purple tunics, bronze corselets, bronze helmets with white plumes, and sabres; and each had a single spear with a shaft of cornel wood. Their horses were armed with frontlets, breast-pieces, and thigh-pieces of bronze; these served to protect the thighs of the rider as well. The arms of <persName>Cyrus</persName> differed from those of the rest in this only, that while the rest were overlaid with the ordinary gold colour, <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s arms flashed like a mirror.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, when he had mounted his horse and sat<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His army moves forward</note> looking off in the direction he was to take, there was a clap of thunder on the right. &ldquo;Almighty Zeus, we will follow thee,&rdquo; he cried, and started, with Chrysantas, the master of the horse, and the cavalry on the right, and on the left Arsamas and the infantry.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And he gave orders to keep an eye upon his ensign and advance in even step. Now his ensign was a golden eagle with outspread wings mounted upon a long shaft. And this continues even unto this day as the ensign of the Persian king.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Before they came in sight of the enemy, he halted the army as many as three times.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But when they had advanced about twenty stadia, then they began to get sight of the enemy's army coming on to meet them. And when they were all in sight of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Croesus begins his flanking movement</note> one another and the enemy became aware that they greatly outflanked the Persians on both sides, Croesus halted his centre&mdash;for otherwise it is impossible to execute a surrounding manoeuvre&mdash;and began to wheel the wings around to encompass the Persians, thus making his own lines on either flank in form like a gamma, so as to close in and attack on all three sides at once.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But <persName>Cyrus</persName>, although he saw this movement, did not any the more recede but led on just as before.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you observe, Chrysantas, where the wings are drawing off to form their angle with the centre?&rdquo; he asked, as he noticed at what a distance from the centre column on both sides they made their turning point, and how far they were pushing forward their wings in executing their flanking movement.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; answered Chrysantas, &ldquo;and I am surprised, too; for it strikes me that they are drawing their wings a long way off from their centre.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;and from ours, too.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What, pray, is the reason for that?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Evidently because they are afraid their wings will get too close to us while their centre is still far away and that we shall thus close with them.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Chrysantas, &ldquo;how will the one division be able to support the other, when they are so far apart?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;it is obvious that just as soon as the wings now advancing in column get directly opposite the flanks of our army, they will face about so as to form front and then advance upon us from all three sides simultaneously; for it is their intention to close in on us on all sides at once.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Chrysantas, &ldquo;do you then think their plan a good one?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes; to meet what they see. But in the face of what they do not see, it is even worse than if they were coming on in column. But do you, Arsamas,&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> gives orders how to meet it</note> said he, &ldquo;lead on your infantry slowly, just as you see me moving; and you, Chrysantas, follow along with the cavalry in an even line with him; meanwhile I shall go to the point where it seems to me most advantageous to open the battle; and at the same time, as I pass along, I will take observations and see how everything is with our side.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But when I reach the spot, and as soon as in our advance we are near enough together, I will begin the paean, and then do you press on. And the moment we come to close quarters with the enemy, you will perceive it, for there will be no little noise, I presume; and at the same moment Abradatas will charge with his chariots upon the enemy's lines&mdash;for so he will be instructed to do&mdash;and you must follow him, keeping as close as possible behind the chariots. For in this way we shall best throw the enemy into confusion and then fall upon them. And I also shall be there as soon as I can, please God, to join in the pursuit.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had spoken these words, he passed<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He encourages his men</note> along the lines the watchword, Zeus our Saviour and Guide, and rode on. And as he passed between the lines of chariots and heavy-armed infantry and bestowed a glance upon some of those in the lines, he would say: &ldquo;What a pleasure it is, my friends, to look into your faces.&rdquo; And then again in the presence of others he would say: &ldquo;I trust you remember, men, that in the present battle not only is to-day's victory at stake, but also the first victory you won and all our future success.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Before still others, as he passed along, he would remark: &ldquo;For all time to come, my men, we shall never have any more fault to find with the gods; for they have given us the opportunity of winning many blessings. So let us prove ourselves valiant men.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Passing still others he said: &ldquo;To what fairer common feast<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">A &ldquo;common feast,&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">e)/ranos,</foreign> was a feast where all the participants contributed an equal share&mdash;a picnic. The <foreign lang="greek">e)/ranos</foreign> might also be a society or club in which all the members contributed equally to some public cause.</note> could we ever invite each other, my men, than to this one? For now by showing ourselves brave men we may each contribute many good things for our mutual benefit.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Passing others he would say: &ldquo;I suppose that you understand, men, that pursuing, dealing blows and death, plunder, fame, freedom, power&mdash;all these are now held up as prizes for the victors; the cowardly, of course, have the reverse of all this. Whoever, therefore, cares for himself, let him fight with me; for I will never bring myself to do anything base or cowardly, if I can help it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But whenever he came past any of those who had fought under him before, he would say: &ldquo;What need to say anything to you, my men? For you know how the brave celebrate a day in battle, and how cowards.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as he passed along and came to Abradatas, he stopped; and Abradatas, handing the reins to his groom, came toward him, and others also of those whose positions were near, both foot and chariot-drivers, ran up. And then to the company gathered about him <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;Abradatas, God has approved<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His last interview with Abradatas</note> your request that you and your men should take the front ranks among the allies. So now remember this, when presently it becomes necessary for you to enter the conflict, that Persians will not only be your witnesses but will also follow you and will not let you go into the conflict unsupported.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Abradatas, &ldquo;to me at least our part of the army seems to be all right; but I am anxious for the flanks; for I see the enemy's wings stretching out strong with chariots and troops of every description, while in the centre there is nothing opposed to our side except chariots; and so if I had not obtained this position by lot, I should, for my part, be ashamed of being here, so much the safest position do I think I occupy.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;if your part is all right,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His confidence in the outcome</note> never fear for the others; for with the help of the gods I will clear those flanks of enemies for you. And do not you hurl yourself upon the opposing ranks, I adjure you, until you see in flight those whom you now fear.&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> indulged in such boastful speech only on the eve of battle; at other times he was never boastful at all; and he went on: &ldquo;But when you see them in flight, then be sure that I am already at hand, and charge upon those fellows; for at that moment you will find your opponents most cowardly and your own men valiant.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But now, Abradatas, while you have time, by all means ride along your line of chariots and exhort your men to the charge, cheering them by your own looks and buoying them up with hopes. Furthermore, inspire them with a spirit of rivalry that you and your division may prove yourselves the best of the charioteers. And that will be worth while; for be assured that if we are successful to-day, all men in future will say that nothing is more profitable than valour.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Abradatas accordingly mounted and drove along and did as <persName>Cyrus</persName> had suggested.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as <persName>Cyrus</persName> passed along again, he came to<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He exhorts other officers: (1) Hystaspas,</note> the left wing, where Hystaspas was with half the Persian cavalry; he called him and said: &ldquo;Now, Hystaspas, you see some use for your speed; for now, if we can kill the enemy before they kill us, not one of us will perish.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hystaspas laughing, &ldquo;we will take care of those opposite us; assign those on the flank to another division, so that they also may have something to do.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;I am going on to them myself. But remember this, Hystaspas, no matter to which of us God gives the victory first, if afterwards anything is left of any part of the enemy, let us all engage any force that still continues the fight.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke and passed on. And as he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(2) the commander of the chariots,</note> went along the flank, he came to the general in command of the chariots there and to him he said: &ldquo;Yes, I am coming to help you; but when you see us charging on the extremity of the enemy's wing, then do you try at the same time to break through their lines; for you will be in a much securer position if you get clear through than if you are enclosed within their line.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as he passed on again and came behind<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(3) Pheraulas and Artagerses</note> the women's carriages, he ordered Artagerses and Pharnuchus with their respective regiments of infantry and cavalry to stay there. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when you see me charging against those opposite our right wing, do you also attack those opposite you. And you will be in a phalanx&mdash;the formation in which you would be strongest&mdash;and take the enemy on their flank, the position in which an army is weakest. And, as you see, their cavalry stands furthest out; so by all means send against them the brigade of camels, and be assured that even before the battle begins you will see the enemy in a ridiculous plight.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> had completed his round of the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Croesus orders his attack;</note> troops, he passed on to the right wing. And Croesus, thinking that the centre, which he commanded in person, was already nearer to the enemy than the wings that were spreading out beyond, gave a signal to his wings not to go out any further but to halt and face about. And when they had halted, and stood facing <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army, Croesus gave them the signal to advance against the foe.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And so the three phalanxes advanced upon the army of <persName>Cyrus</persName>, one from in front, the other two against his wings, one from the right, the other from the left; in consequence, great fear came upon all his army. For just like a little tile set inside a large one,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The point of Xenophon's simile is clear, when we recall the marble tiling of the temple roofs of his time.</note> <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s army was encompassed by the enemy on every side, except the rear, with horsemen and hoplites, with targeteers and bowmen and chariots.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Still, when <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave the command, they all turned and faced the enemy. And deep silence reigned on every hand because of their apprehension as to what was coming. Then, when it seemed to <persName>Cyrus</persName> to be just the right time, he began the paean and all the army joined in the chant.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>After it was finished, together they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">but <persName>Cyrus</persName> anticipates him on the right,</note> raised the battle-shout to Enyalius, and in that instant <persName>Cyrus</persName> dashed forward; and at once he hurled his cavalry upon the enemy's flank and in a moment he was engaged with them hand to hand. With a rapid movement the infantry followed him in good order and began to envelop the enemy on this side and on that, so that he had them at a great disadvantage; for he clashed with a phalanx against their flank; and as a result, the enemy soon were in headlong flight.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As soon as Artagerses saw <persName>Cyrus</persName> in action,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Artagerses on the left</note> he delivered his attack on the enemy's left, putting forward the camels, as <persName>Cyrus</persName> had directed. But while the camels were still a great way off, the horses gave way before them; some took fright and ran away, others began to rear, while others plunged into one another; for such is the usual effect that camels produce upon horses.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>And Artagerses, with his men in order, fell upon them in their confusion; and at the same moment the chariots also charged on both the right and the left. And many in their flight from the chariots were slain by the cavalry following up their attack upon the flank, and many also trying to escape from the cavalry were caught by the chariots.
    <milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And Abradatas also lost no more time, but<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Abradatas charges to his death</note> shouting, &ldquo;Now, friends, follow me,&rdquo; he swept forward, showing no mercy to his horses but drawing blood from them in streams with every stroke of the lash. And the rest of the chariot-drivers also rushed forward with him. And the opposing chariots at once broke into flight before them; some, as they fled, took up their dismounted<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Compare <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 3.3.60">Xen. Cyrop. 3.3.60</bibl>; <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 6.1.27">Xen. Cyrop. 6.1.27</bibl></note> fighting men, others left theirs behind.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But Abradatas plunged directly through them and hurled himself upon the Egyptian phalanx; and the nearest of those who were arrayed with him also joined in the charge. Now, it has been demonstrated on many other occasions that there is no stronger phalanx than that which is composed of comrades that are close friends; and it was shown to be true on this occasion. For it was only the personal friends and mess-mates of Abradatas who pressed home the charge with him, while the rest of the charioteers, when they saw that the Egyptians with their dense throng withstood them, turned aside after the fleeing chariots and pursued them.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>But in the place where Abradatas and his companions charged, the Egyptians could not make an opening for them because the men on either side of them stood firm; consequently, those of the enemy who stood upright were struck in the furious charge of the horses and overthrown, and those who fell were crushed to pieces by the horses and the wheels, they and their arms; and whatever was caught in the scythes&mdash;everything, arms and men, was horribly mangled.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As in this indescribable confusion the wheels bounded over the heaps of every sort, Abradatas and others of those who went with him into the charge were thrown to the ground, and there, though they proved themselves men of valour, they were cut down and slain.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the Persians, following up the attack at the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persians charge the Egyptian phalanx</note> point where Abradatas and his men had made their charge, made havoc of the enemy in their confusion; but where the Egyptians were still unharmed&mdash;and there were many such&mdash;they advanced to oppose the Persians.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>Here, then, was a dreadful conflict with spears and lances and swords. The Egyptians, however, had the advantage both in numbers and in weapons; for the spears that they use even unto this day are long and powerful, and their shields cover their bodies much more effectually than corselets and targets, and as they rest against the shoulder they are a help in shoving. So, locking their shields Together, they advanced and showed.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>And because the Persians had to hold out their little shields clutched in their hands, they were unable to hold the line, but were forced back foot by foot, giving and taking blows, until they came up under cover of the moving towers. When they reached that point, the Egyptians in turn received a volley from the towers; and the forces in the extreme rear would not allow any retreat on the part of either archers or lancers, but with drawn swords they compelled them to shoot and hurl.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>Then there was a dreadful carnage, an awful din of arms and missiles of every sort, and a great tumult of men, as they called to one another for aid, or exhorted one another, or invoked the gods.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this juncture <persName>Cyrus</persName> came up in pursuit of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> falls upon their rear</note> the part that had been opposed to him; and when he saw that the Persians had been forced from their position, he was grieved; but as he realized that he could in no way check the enemy's progress more quickly than by marching around behind them, he ordered his men to follow him and rode around to the rear. There he fell upon the enemy as they faced the other way and smote them and slew many of them.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>And when the Egyptians became aware of their position they shouted out that the enemy was in their rear, and amidst the blows they faced about. And then they fought promiscuously both foot and horse; and a certain man, who had fallen under <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s horse and was under the animal's heels, struck the horse in the belly with his sword. And the horse thus wounded plunged convulsively and threw <persName>Cyrus</persName> off.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>Then one might have realized how much it is worth to an officer to be loved by his men; for they all at once cried out and leaping forward they fought, shoved and were shoved, gave and received blows. And one of his aides-de-camp leaped down from his own horse and helped him mount upon it;
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>and when <persName>Cyrus</persName> had mounted he saw that the Egyptians were now assailed on every side; for Hystaspas also and Chrysantas had now come up with the Persian cavalry. But he did not permit them yet to charge into the Egyptian phalanx, but bade them shoot and hurl from a distance.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when, as he rode round, he came to the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> surveys the field from a movable tower</note> engines, he decided to ascend one of the towers and take a view to see if anywhere any part of the enemy's forces were making a stand to fight.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>And when he had ascended the tower, he looked down upon the field full of horses and men and chariots, some fleeing, some pursuing, some victorious, other vanquished; but nowhere could he discover any division that was still standing its ground, except that of the Egyptians; and they, inasmuch as they found themselves in a desperate condition, formed in a complete circle and crouched behind their shields, so that only their weapons were visible; but they were no longer accomplishing anything, but were suffering very heavy loss.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName>, filled with admiration for their<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He spares the Egyptians</note> conduct and moved to pity for them that men as brave as they were should be slain, drew off all those who were fighting around the ring and allowed no one to fight any more. Then he sent a herald to them to ask whether they all wished to die for those who had treacherously deserted them or to save their lives and at the same time be accounted brave men.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How could we save our lives,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;and at the same time be accounted brave men?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> replied, &ldquo;because we are witnesses that you are the only ones who stood your ground and were willing to fight.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered the Egyptians, &ldquo;granting that, what can we do consistently with honour to save our lives?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You could surrender your arms,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered again, &ldquo;and become friends of those who choose to save you, when it is in their power to destroy you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And if we become your friends,&rdquo; they asked on hearing that, &ldquo;how will you see fit to deal with us?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I will do you favours and expect favours from you,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What sort of favours?&rdquo; asked the Egyptians in turn.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As long as the war continues,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> made<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">and wins their allegiance</note> answer to this, &ldquo;I would give you larger pay than you were now receiving; and when peace is made, to those of you who care to stay with me I will give lands and cities and wives and servants.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On hearing this, the Egyptians begged to be excused from taking part in any campaign against Croesus, for with him alone, they said, they were acquainted; all other stipulations they accepted, and gave and received pledges of good faith.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And the Egyptians who then stayed in the country have continued loyal subjects to the king even unto this day; and <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave them cities, some in the interior, which even to this day are called Egyptian cities, and besides these Larissa and Cyllene near Cyme on the coast; and their descendants dwell there even unto this day.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had accomplished this, it was already dark; and <persName>Cyrus</persName> led back his forces and encamped in Thymbrara.
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Egyptians were the only ones of all the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Observations on the battle</note> enemy that distinguished themselves in the battle, while of those under <persName>Cyrus</persName> the Persian cavalry seemed to be the most efficient. And therefore the equipment which <persName>Cyrus</persName> had then provided for his cavalry continues in use even to our own times.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The scythe-bearing chariots also won extraordinary distinction, so that this military device also has been retained even to our day by each successive king.
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The camels, however, did nothing more than frighten the horses; their riders could neither kill any one nor be killed by any of the enemy's cavalry, for not a horse would come near them.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What they did do seemed useful enough; but be that as it may, no gentleman is willing to keep a camel for riding or to practise for fighting in war upon one. And so they have again taken their proper position and do service among the pack-animals.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> and his men had finished dinner and stationed guards, as was necessary, they went to rest. As for Croesus and his army, they fled straight towards <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>, while the other contingents got away, each man as far as he could under cover of the night on his way toward home.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When daylight came, <persName>Cyrus</persName> led his army<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The capture of <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></note> straight on against <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>. And as soon as he came up to the walls of the city, he set up his engines as if intending to assault it and made ready his scaling ladders.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But though he did this, in the course of the following night he sent some Chaldaeans and Persians to climb up by what was considered the most precipitous side of the Sardian citadel. The way was shown them by a Persian who had been the slave of one of the guards of the acropolis and had discovered a way down to the river and up again by the same route.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When it became known that the citadel was taken, all the Lydians immediately fled from the walls to whatever part of the city they could. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> at daybreak entered the city and gave orders that not a man of his should stir from his post.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But Croesus shut himself up in his palace and called for <persName>Cyrus</persName>. <persName>Cyrus</persName>, however, left behind a guard to watch Croesus, while he himself drew off his army to the citadel now in his possession; for he saw that the Persians were holding guard over it, as it was<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Chaldaeans' breach of discipline</note> their duty to do, but that the quarters of the Chaldaeans were deserted, for they had run down into the city to get plunder from the houses. He at once called their officers together and told them to leave his army with all speed.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could not endure to see men who are guilty of insubordination better off than others. And let me tell you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that I was getting ready to make you Chaldaeans who have been helping in my campaigns objects of envy in the eyes of all other Chaldaeans; but, as it is, you need not be surprised if some one who is your superior in strength should fall in with you, even as you go away.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they heard this, the Chaldaeans were afraid; they besought him to lay aside his wrath and promised to give up their plunder. But he said he did not want it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you wish<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Good discipline rewarded</note> me to forget my displeasure, surrender all that you have taken to those who have not relaxed their guard of the citadel. For if the rest of the soldiers find out that those who have been obedient to orders are better off than the rest, everything will be as I wish.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Chaldaeans, accordingly, did as <persName>Cyrus</persName> bade; and the obedient received a large amount of spoil of every description. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> encamped his men in that part of the city where he deemed it most convenient, ordering them to stay in their quarters and take luncheon there.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had attended to this, he ordered<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Croesus before <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> Croesus to be brought before him. And when Croesus saw <persName>Cyrus</persName>, he said: &ldquo;I salute you, my sovereign lord; for fortune grants that henceforth you should bear this title and I address you by it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And I you, Croesus; for we are both men. But, Croesus,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;would you be willing to give me a bit of advice?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I wish I could find something of practical value to say to you. For that, I think, would prove good for me as well.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Listen, then, Croesus,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I observe that my soldiers have gone through many toils and dangers and now are thinking that they are in possession of the richest city in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, next to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>; and I think that they deserve some reward. For I know that if they do not reap some fruit of their labours, I shall not be able to keep them in obedience very long. Now, I do not wish to abandon the city<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> proposes to spare <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></note> to them to plunder; for I believe that then the city would be destroyed, and I am sure that in the pillaging the worst men would get the largest share.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Croesus on hearing these words, &ldquo;permit me to say to any Lydians that I meet that I have secured from you the promise not to permit any pillaging nor to allow the women and children to be carried off, and that I, in return for that, have given you my solemn promise that you should get from the Lydians of their own free will everything there is of beauty or value in <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>For when they hear this, I am sure that whatever fair possession man or woman has will to come to you; and next year you will again find the city just as full of wealth as it is now; whereas, if you pillage it completely, you will find even the industrial arts utterly ruined; and they say that these are the fountain of wealth.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But when you have seen what is brought in, you will still have the privilege of deciding about plundering the city. And first of all,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;send to my treasuries and let your guards obtain from my guards what is there.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>All this, accordingly, <persName>Cyrus</persName> agreed to have done as Croesus suggested.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But pray tell me, Croesus,&rdquo; he resumed,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Croesus and the Pythian oracle</note> &ldquo;what has come of your responses from the oracle at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>?

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I would it were so, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But as it is; I have from the very beginning behaved toward Apollo in a way contrary to all that he has advised.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;please explain; for your statement sounds very strange.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;At first,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;instead of asking the god for the particular favour I needed, I proceeded to put him to the test to see if he could tell the truth. And when even men, if they are gentlemen&mdash;to say nothing of a god&mdash;discover that they are mistrusted, they have no love for those who mistrust them.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>However, as he knew even about the gross absurdities I was engaged in, far as I was from <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See Index, s.v. Croesus, note.</note> I then sent to him to inquire if I should have male issue.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>And at first he did not even answer me; but when I had at last propitiated him, as I thought, by sending many offerings of gold and many of silver and by sacrificing very many victims, then he did answer my question as to what I should do to have sons; and he said that I should have them.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And I had; for not even in this did he speak falsely; but those that were born to me have been no joy to me. For the one has continued dumb until now, and the other, the better of the two, was killed in the flower of his youth. Then, overwhelmed by the afflictions I suffered in connection with my sons, I sent again and inquired of the god what I should do to pass the rest<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The secret of a happy life</note> of my life most happily; and he answered me:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&lsquo;Knowing thyself, O Croesus&mdash;thus shalt thou live and be happy.&rsquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">There is a reference to the famous inscription on the temple at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">gnw=qi seauto/n.</foreign></note>
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when I heard this response, I was glad; for I thought that it was the easiest task in the world that he was laying upon me as the condition to happiness. For in the case of others, it is possible to know some; and some, one cannot know; but I thought that everybody knows who and what he himself is.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;For the succeeding years, as long as I lived at peace, I had no complaint to make of my fortunes after the death of my son. But when I was persuaded by the Assyrian king to take the field against you, I fell into every sort of danger. However, I was saved without having suffered any harm. Here again I have no fault to find with the god. For when I recognized that I was not your match in battle, with his help I got off in safety, both I and my men.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And lately again, spoiled by the wealth I had and by those who were begging me to become their leader, by the gifts they gave me and by the people who flattered me, saying that if I would consent to take command they would all obey me and I should be the greatest of men&mdash;puffed up by such words, when all the princes round about chose me to be their leader in the war, I accepted the command, deeming myself fit to be the greatest; but, as it seems, I did not know myself.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>For I thought I was capable of carrying on war against you; but I was no match for you; for you are in the first place a scion of the gods and in the second place the descendant of an unbroken line of kings, and finally you have been practising virtue from your childhood on, while the first of my ancestors to wear a crown, I am told, was at the same time king and freedman.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Gyges, the shepherd king of <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>.</note> Therefore, as I was thus without knowledge, I have my just deserts.

<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the name of Zeus,&rdquo; said Croesus, &ldquo;pray do not trouble yourself further to answer me in regard to my happiness; for I assure you even now that if you do for me what you say you will, I, too, shall have and enjoy that life which others have always considered most blissful; and I have agreed with them.&rdquo;

<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At hearing these words <persName>Cyrus</persName> wondered at his good spirits, and after that he always used to take Croesus with him wherever he went, whether, as may well have been, because he thought Croesus was of some service to him, or whether he considered that this was the safer course.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was their interview, and then they went<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> takes the Lydian treasures</note> to rest. And on the following day <persName>Cyrus</persName> summoned his friends and the general officers of his army.

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The officers, accordingly, proceeded to follow his instructions.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he had called to him certain of his aides who were present, <persName>Cyrus</persName> said: &ldquo;Tell me, has any one of you seen Abradatas?

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And even now his wife, I am told, has taken up his body for burial, placed it in the carriage in which she herself used to ride, and brought it to some place here by the River Pactolus.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And his eunuchs and servants, so they say, are digging a grave upon a certain hill for his dead body. But his wife, they say, has decked her husband with what she possessed and now sits upon the ground, holding his head in her lap.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon hearing this, <persName>Cyrus</persName> smote his thigh, mounted his horse at once, and rode with a regiment of cavalry to the scene of sorrow.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>He left orders for Gadatas and Gobryas to follow him with the most beautiful ornaments they could get for the man, who had fallen beloved and brave. And he ordered those who had in charge the herds that were taken with the army to bring both cattle and horses and many sheep besides to the place where they should hear that he was, that he might sacrifice them in honour of Abradatas.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he saw the lady sitting upon the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Panthea mourns over her dead</note> ground and the corpse lying there, he wept over his loss and said: &ldquo;Alas, O brave and faithful soul, hast thou then gone and left us?&rdquo; And with the words he clasped his hand, and the dead man's hand came away in his grasp; for the wrist had been severed by a sabre in the hands of an Egyptian.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> was still more deeply moved at seeing this; and the wife wept aloud; but taking the hand from <persName>Cyrus</persName>, she kissed it and fitted it on again as best she could and said:
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>&ldquo;The rest of his limbs also you will find in the same condition, <persName>Cyrus</persName>; but why should you see it? And I am in no small degree to blame that he has suffered so, and you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, perhaps not less than I. For it was I that, in my folly, urged him to do his best to show himself a worthy friend to you; and as for him, I know that he never had a thought of what might happen to him, but only of what he could do to please you. And so,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he has indeed died a blameless death, while I who urged him to it sit here alive!&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For some time <persName>Cyrus</persName> wept in silence and then<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> tries to comfort her</note> he said aloud: &ldquo;Well, lady, he indeed has met the fairest of ends, for he has died in the very hour of victory; but do you accept these gifts from me&rdquo;&mdash;for Gobryas and Gadatas had come with many beautiful ornaments&mdash;&ldquo;and deck him with them. And then, let me assure you that in other ways also he shall not want for honours, but many hands shall rear to him a monument worthy of us, and sacrifice shall be made over it, such as will befit a man so valiant.

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Ah, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; Panthea answered, &ldquo;do not fear; I shall never hide from you who it is to whom I wish to go.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had said this, <persName>Cyrus</persName> went away, his heart full of pity for the woman, as he thought what a husband she had lost, and for the man, that he must leave such a wife and never see her more. The lady then desired the eunuchs to retire, &ldquo;until,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have bewailed my husband here, as I desire.&rdquo; But her nurse she told to stay with her,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Panthea's death</note> and she charged her to cover her and her husband, when she, too, was dead, with the same cloak. The nurse, however, pleaded earnestly with her not to do so; but when her prayers proved of no avail and she saw her mistress becoming angered, she sat down and burst into tears. Panthea then drew out a dagger, with which she had provided herself long before, and plunged it into her heart, and laying her head upon her husband's bosom she breathed her last.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the nurse wailed aloud and covered them both, even as Panthea had directed.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard what the woman had done, he was filled with dismay and hastened to the place to see if he could bring any help. And when the eunuchs, three in number, beheld what had occurred, they also, standing in the spot where she had ordered them to stand, drew their daggers and drove them into their own breasts.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&lt;And now even to this day, it is said, the monument<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Their monument</note> of the eunuchs is still standing; and they say that the names of the husband and wife are inscribed in Assyrian letters upon the slab above; and below, it is said, are three slabs with the inscription the mace-bearers.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Staff-bearers&mdash;apparently court officials, bearing a &ldquo;staff&rdquo; of office; mentioned again 8.1.38; 8.3.15; <title>Anab.</title> 1.6.11.</note>&gt;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> drew near to the place of sorrow he marvelled at the woman; and having made lament over her, he went his way. He also took care that they should find all due honours, and the monument reared over them was, as they say, exceeding great.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the Carians fell into strife and civil war<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Adusius settles a civil war in <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName></note> with one another; they were intrenched in strongholds, and both sides called upon <persName>Cyrus</persName> for assistance. So while <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself stayed in <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> to make siege-engines and battering rams to demolish the walls of such as should refuse to submit, he entrusted an army to Adusius, a Persian who was not lacking in judgment generally and not unskilled in war, and who was besides a very courteous gentleman, and sent him into <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName>; and the Cilicians and Cyprians also joined most heartily in this expedition.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Because of their enthusiastic allegiance he never sent a Persian satrap to govern either the Cilicians or the Cyprians, but was always satisfied with their native princes. Tribute, however, he did receive from them, and whenever he needed forces he made a requisition upon them for troops.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Adusius now set out for <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName> at the head of his army; and there came to him representatives from both parties of the Carians, ready to receive him into their walls to the injury of the rival faction. But Adusius treated both sides alike: with whichever party he conferred, he said they were more in the right, but they must not let their opponents know that he and they had become friends, alleging that he would thus be more likely to fall upon those opponents unprepared. Moreover, he demanded from the Carians pledges of good faith and made them swear to receive him without treachery within their walls to the advantage of <persName>Cyrus</persName> and the Persians, and he himself consented to give his oath that he would without treachery enter their walls for the advantage of those who admitted him.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And when he had done this, he made appointments with both parties for the same night&mdash;each party without the other's knowledge&mdash;and on that night he marched inside the walls and took possession of the strongholds of both. At day-break he took his stand with his army between the two and summoned the leaders of the two factions. And when they saw one another they were indignant, for they both thought they had been duped.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Adusius, however, addressed them as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I gave you my oath that I would<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Peace is established between the factions</note> without treachery enter your walls for the advantage of those who admitted me. If, therefore, I destroy either party of you, I think that I have come in to the injury of the Carians; whereas, if I can secure peace for you and security for all to till the fields, I think I am here for your advantage. Now, therefore, from this day you must live together like friends, till your lands without fear of one another, and intermarry your children one party with the other; and if any one in defiance of these regulations attempts to make trouble, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, and we with him, will be that man's enemies.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After that, the gates of the city were opened, the streets filled up with people passing to and fro, and the farms with labourers; they celebrated their festivals together, and peace and joy reigned everywhere.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this juncture messengers came to him from <persName>Cyrus</persName> to ask if he needed any more troops or engines; but Adusius answered that even the army he had with him was at the disposal of <persName>Cyrus</persName> to employ elsewhere. And with those words he started to lead back his army, leaving only garrisons upon the citadels. But the Carians pleaded with him to stay; and when he refused, they sent to <persName>Cyrus</persName> to petition him to send Adusius to be their satrap.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> had meanwhile sent off Hystaspas in<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The conquest of the lesser <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName></note> command of an expedition against the <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> that lies along the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>. So when Adusius returned, he directed him to march on in the direction Hystaspas had taken, that they might submit to Hystaspas more readily when they heard that another army was on the way.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the Greeks who dwelt by the sea gave many gifts and secured an agreement to the effect that while they should not receive the barbarians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Barbarians,&rdquo; from the Greek point of view,; that is, Persians.</note> within their walls, they would yet pay tribute and serve under him in the field wherever <persName>Cyrus</persName> should direct.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But the king of <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> made preparations to keep possession of his forts and not to submit, and he gave orders to that effect. When, however, his subordinate officers deserted and he was left alone, he finally surrendered to Hystaspas on condition that <persName>Cyrus</persName> should be his judge and arbiter. And Hystaspas, leaving strong garrisons of Persians upon the citadels, went back with his own army reinforced with many Phrygian horsemen and peltasts.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Besides, <persName>Cyrus</persName> had given Adusius instructions to join Hystaspas and bring with them armed those Phrygians who had voluntarily taken their side, but to take their horses and arms away from those who had shown fight, and to make all such follow, armed with nothing but slings.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Accordingly, they were thus engaged in executing these orders.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But <persName>Cyrus</persName>, leaving behind a large garrison of foot-soldiers,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> starts from <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></note> started from <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> in company with Croesus; and he took with him many wagons loaded with valuables of every sort. And Croesus also had come with an accurate inventory of what was in each wagon; and as he handed the lists to <persName>Cyrus</persName> he said: &ldquo;From this, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, you may know who renders to you in full that of which he has charge and who does not.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, Croesus,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;you do well to take this precaution. As far as I am concerned, however, those shall have charge of the valuables who also deserve to own them; so that if they embezzle anything, they will be embezzling from what is their own.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With these words, he gave the inventories to his friends and officers, that they might be able to tell who of the overseers delivered everything safe and who of them failed.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He took with him also such of the Lydians as he saw taking a pride in the fine appearance of their arms and horses and chariots and trying to do everything that they thought would please him; these he permitted to retain their arms. But if he saw any following with bad grace, he turned their horses over to those Persians who had been the first to engage in his service; he had their arms burned, and these men, too, he required to follow with nothing but slings.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And of those who had been made subjects he required all who were unarmed to practise with the sling, for he considered this weapon to be the one most fitting for a slave. For in conjunction with other forces there are occasions when the presence of slingers is of very effective assistance, but by themselves alone not all the slingers in the world could stand against a very few men who came into a hand-to-hand encounter with them with weapons suited for close combat.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the way to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> he subdued Greater<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He marches still conquering to <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></note> <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName> and reduced the Arabians to submission. From all these he secured armour for not less than forty thousand Persian horsemen, and many horses taken from the prisoners he distributed among all the divisions of his allies. And thus he arrived before <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> with a great host of cavalry, and a great host of bowmen and spearmen, and a multitude of slingers that was beyond number.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> appeared before <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> surrounds <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName></note> stationed his whole force about the city and then rode around it himself in company with his friends and the staff-officers of the allies;
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>but when he had taken a survey of the walls, he prepared to draw off his army from the city. But a deserter came out and told him that they were going to attack him as soon as he began to draw his army off. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; the man went on, &ldquo;your lines looked weak to those who observed them from the walls.&rdquo; And it was no wonder that they appeared so; for, encompassing walls of such extent,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See Index, s.v. <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, note.</note> the lines necessarily had but little depth.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On hearing this, therefore, <persName>Cyrus</persName> took his place<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He retires from the wall</note> with his body-guard in the centre of his army and gave orders that the hoplites should fold back the phalanx from the extremity of either wing and move toward each other behind the main body, which had been halted, until each of the extreme wings should meet in a line with him, that is, in the centre.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">See Appendix I.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>By this manoeuvre the men that remained standing in their places were at once given more courage, for the depth of the line was thus doubled; and those who had fallen back were likewise rendered more courageous, for thus those troops which had been kept standing had now come to face the enemy, and not they. But when, as they marched in from both sides, the ends came together, they stood thus mutually strengthened&mdash;those who had shifted their position were supported by those in front of them, those in front by the men behind them.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And when the phalanx was thus folded back, the front ranks and the rear were of necessity composed of the most valiant men and the poorest were drawn up between them. And this arrangement of the lines seemed well adapted both for fighting and for keeping the men from flight; and the cavalry and the light-armed troops upon the wings were in each case brought as much nearer to the commander as the phalanx was shorter when doubled.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And when they had thus closed up, they retired backward as long as they were within range of the missiles from the wall; but when they were out of range, they would face about and go forward at first only a few steps and wheel to the left and stand facing the wall; and the further off they got, the less often did they thus wheel around; and when they seemed to be out of all danger, they marched off without stopping until they arrived at their tents.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they had encamped, <persName>Cyrus</persName> called together<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> plans for a siege</note> his staff-officers and said: &ldquo;Friends and allies, we have viewed the city on every side. But I am sure I cannot see how any one could take by storm walls so massive and so high; but the more men there are in the city, the sooner they can, I think, be brought by famine to capitulate, seeing that they will not come out and fight. Therefore, unless you have some other method to suggest, I propose that we use this method of laying siege to those gentlemen.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Chrysantas, &ldquo;does not this river flow through the midst of the city? And it is more than two stadia in width.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; said Gobryas, &ldquo;and its depth is such that two men, one standing on the other's shoulders, would not reach the surface of the water, so that the city is better defended by the river than by its walls.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Chrysantas,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered, &ldquo;let us not<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He proposes to divert the <placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName></note> trouble ourselves with that which is beyond our powers; but we must apportion the work among ourselves as quickly as possible, to each contingent its proper share, and dig a ditch as wide and as deep as possible, so that we may require only as many men on guard as are absolutely indispensable.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, he took measurements in a circle round about the city, leaving just enough room by the river for the erection of large towers, and began on either side of the city to dig an immense trench; and the earth from it they threw up on their own side of the ditch.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>First of all, he began to build towers by the river, laying his foundations with the trunks of date-palms not less than a hundred feet long&mdash;and they grow even taller than that. And they were good material for this purpose, for it is a well known fact that date-palms, when under heavy pressure, bend upward like the backs of pack-asses.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>These he used as &ldquo;mud-sills,&rdquo; in order that, even if the river should break into his trench above, it might not carry his towers away. And he erected many other towers besides upon the breast-works of earth, so that he might have as many watch-towers as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, his men were employed, while the enemy upon the walls laughed his siege-works to scorn, in the belief that they had provisions enough for more than twenty years.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon hearing of this, <persName>Cyrus</persName> divided his army into twelve parts as if intending each part to be responsible for sentry duty during one month of each year;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>but the Babylonians, in their turn, when they heard of that, laughed much more scornfully still, at the thought of Phrygians and Lydians and Arabians and Cappadocians keeping guard against them, for they considered all these to be more friendly to them than to the Persians.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At last the ditches were completed. Then,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The river is turned</note> when he heard that a certain festival had come round in <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, during which all <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> was accustomed to drink and revel all night long, <persName>Cyrus</persName> took a large number of men, just as soon as it was dark, and opened up the heads of the trenches at the river.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>As soon as that was done, the water flowed down through the ditches in the night, and the bed of the river, where it traversed the city, became passable for men.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the problem of the river was thus solved, <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave orders to his Persian colonels, infantry and cavalry, to marshal their regiments two abreast and come to him, and the rest, the allies, to follow in their rear, drawn up as before.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>They came, according to orders, and he bade his aides, both foot and horse, get into the dry channel of the river and see if it was possible to march in the bed of the river.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>And when they brought back word that it was, he called together the generals of both infantry and cavalry and spoke as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the river has made<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> issues instructions for entering the city</note>&rdquo; way for us and given us an entrance into the city. Let us, therefore, enter in with dauntless hearts, fearing nothing and remembering that those against whom we are now to march are the same men that we have repeatedly defeated, and that, too, when they were all drawn up in battle line with their allies at their side, and when they were all wide awake and sober and fully armed;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> whereas now we are going to fall upon them at a time when many of them are asleep, many drunk, and none of them in battle array. And when they find out that we are inside the walls, in their panic fright they will be much more helpless still than they are now.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But if any one is apprehensive of that which is said to be a source of terror to those invading a city&mdash;namely, that the people may go up&rdquo; on the house-tops and hurl down missiles right and left, you need not be in the least afraid of that; for if any do go up upon their houses, we have a god on our side, Hephaestus. And their porticoes are very inflammable, for the doors are made of palm-wood and covered with bituminous varnish which will burn like tinder;
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>while we, on our side, have plenty of pine-wood for torches, which will quickly produce a mighty conflagration; we have also plenty of pitch and tow, which will quickly spread the flames everywhere, so that those upon the house-tops must either quickly leave their posts or quickly be consumed.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But come, to arms! and with the help of the gods I will lead you on. And do you, Gadatas and Gobryas, show the streets, for you are familiar with them. And when we get inside the walls, lead us by the quickest route to the royal palace.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; answered Gobryas and his staff, &ldquo;in view of the revelry, it would not be at all surprising if the gates leading to the palace were open, for all the city is feasting this night. Still, we shall find a guard before the gates, for one is always posted there.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;We must lose no time, then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>. &ldquo;Forward, that we may catch the men as unprepared as we can.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When these words were spoken, they advanced.<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> falls</note> And of those they met on the way, some fell by their swords, some fled back into their houses, some shouted to them; and Gobryas and his men shouted back to them, as if they were fellow-revellers. They advanced as fast as they could and were soon at the palace.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>And Gobryas and Gadatas and their troops found the gates leading to the palace locked, and those who had been appointed to attack the guard fell upon them as they were drinking by a blazing fire, and without waiting they dealt with them as with foes.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>But, as a noise and tumult ensued, those within heard the uproar, and at the king's command to see what the matter was, some of them opened the gates and ran out.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>And when Gadatas<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Gobryas and Gadatas avenge their wrongs</note> and his men saw the gates open they dashed in in pursuit of the others as they fled back into the palace, and dealing blows right and left they came into the presence of the king; and they found him already risen with his dagger in his hand.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>And Gadatas and Gobryas and their followers overpowered him; and those about the king perished also, one where he had sought some shelter, another while running away, another while actually trying to defend himself with whatever he could.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> then sent the companies of cavalry around through the streets and gave them orders to cut down all whom they found out of doors, while he directed those who understood Assyrian to proclaim to those in their houses that they should stay there, for if any one should be caught outside, he would be put to death.
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While they were thus occupied, Gadatas and Gobryas came up; and first of all they did homage to the gods, seeing that they had avenged themselves upon the wicked king, and then they kissed <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s hands and his feet with many tears of joy.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when day dawned and those in possession<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The entire city yields to <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> of the citadels discovered that the city was taken and the king slain, they surrendered the citadels, too.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> at once took possession of the citadels and sent up to them guards and officers of the guards. As for the dead, he gave their relatives permission to bury them. He furthermore ordered the heralds to make proclamation that all Babylonians deliver up their arms; and he ordered that wherever arms should be found in any house, all the occupants should be put to the sword. So they delivered up their arms and <persName>Cyrus</persName> stored them in the citadels, so that they might be ready if he ever needed them for use.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When all this was finished, he first called the magi and requested them, inasmuch as the city had been taken by the sword, to select sanctuaries and the first fruits of the booty for the gods. Next he distributed the private houses and official residences among those whom he considered to have had a share in what had been achieved; and he made the division in the way that had been decided upon&mdash;the best to the most meritorious. And if any one thought he had less than he should, he bade him come and explain his reasons for thinking so.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He ordered the Babylonians, moreover, to go on tilling their lands, to pay their tribute, and to serve those to whom they had severally been assigned; and he directed the Persians who had shared in the expedition and as many of the allies as chose to remain with him to address those who had fallen to their share as a master would his servants.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this, <persName>Cyrus</persName> conceived a desire to establish<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> holds court</note> himself as he thought became a king, but he decided to do it with the approval of his friends, in such a way that his public appearances should be rare and solemn and yet excite as little jealousy as possible. So he adopted the following plan: at day-break he would take his station in a place that seemed to him to be adapted to the purpose and there receive all who had any matter to bring before him, give them an answer, and send them away.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>But when people learned that he was holding audience, they came in an unmanageable throng, and as they crowded up to get in there was no end of trickery and contention.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>And his attendants would admit them, making the best discrimination they could.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But whenever any of his personal friends managed<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His personal friends are crowded out</note> to push their way through the throng and catch his eye, <persName>Cyrus</persName> would stretch out his hand, draw them up to him, and say: &ldquo;Just wait, friends, until we get rid of the crowd, and then we will enjoy each other's company quietly.&rdquo; So his friends would wait, but the throng would stream in greater and greater, so that evening would set in before he had leisure to share his friends' company.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>So <persName>Cyrus</persName> would say: &ldquo;Gentlemen, it is now time to separate; come tomorrow morning; for I, too, have something to talk over with you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon hearing this, his friends gladly departed, running from his presence, for they had paid the penalty for ignoring all the wants of nature. Thus then they went to rest.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the following day, <persName>Cyrus</persName> went to the same place and long before his friends came, there was a much greater crowd of people standing there desiring audience with him. So <persName>Cyrus</persName> stationed a large circle of Persian lancers about him and gave orders that no one should be admitted except his friends and the officers of the Persians and the allies.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/> And when they had come together, <persName>Cyrus</persName> addressed them as follows: &ldquo;Friends and allies, we cannot<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He discusses organization of his court</note> possibly find any fault with the gods that all that we wished for so far has not been fulfilled. However, if great success is to have such consequences that a man is not to be able to have some leisure for himself nor time to enjoy himself with his friends, I am ready to bid farewell to that sort of happiness.
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>For yesterday, too, you saw, of course, that although we began at dawn to give audience to those who came to see us, we did not get through before evening; and now you see that these others, who are here in greater numbers than came yesterday, will give us even more trouble.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>If, therefore, one is to sacrifice oneself to such affairs, I reckon that you will have but a small part in my society or I in yours; while in myself I know that I shall certainly have no part at all.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I see also,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;still another absurd feature in all this: while my affection for you is, as you know, what it naturally ought to be, of these who stand about here I know few or none; and yet all these have made up their minds that if they can get ahead of you in crowding in, they will obtain what they wish from me before you can. Now what I expected all such to do, if any one wanted anything from me, was to get into favour with you as my friends and ask you for an introduction.
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Perhaps some one may ask why I did not adopt this arrangement in the beginning instead of making myself accessible to all. It was, I answer, because I realized that the demands of war made it necessary for a commander not to be behind others in finding out what he ought to know nor in doing what it is expedient that he should do. And I thought generals who were seldom to be seen often neglected much that needed to be done.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But now that this most toilsome war is really over, it seems to me that I, too, am entitled to find some relaxation of spirit. So, while I am in doubt as to what I could do to harmonize our interests and those of the others for whom we must care, let any one who sees what is to the best advantage give me a word of counsel.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> spoke. After him Artabazus arose<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Artabazus reviews his own relations with <persName>Cyrus</persName></note>&mdash;the man who had once claimed to be his kinsman&mdash;and said: &ldquo;I am very glad, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, that you have opened this discussion. For when you were still a lad, I was very anxious even from the first to be a friend of yours; but when I saw that I could be of no use to you, I shrank from approaching you.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>But when you once happened to need even my<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">IV. i. 21-24</note> services to publish among the Medes the concession obtained from Cyaxares, I reasoned that, if I gave you my earnest support in this, I then might be your intimate friend and talk with you as much as I pleased. Now that particular commission was executed in such a way as to call for your approval.
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;After that, the Hyrcanians were the first to become our friends, and at a time, too, when we were very hungry for allies, so that in our affection for them we all but carried them around in our arms. And after that, when the enemy's camp was taken, you did not have any time to concern yourself about me, I suppose, and I did not blame you.
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>Next, Gobryas became our friend, and I was glad; and then Gadatas; and then it was hard work to get any share of your attention. When, however, both the Sacians and the Cadusians had become our allies, you must needs show them proper attention, for they also were attentive to you.
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;When we came back to the place from which<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His hopes too long deferred</note> we had started, I saw you busy with horses and chariots and engines, but I thought that as soon as you had leisure from these distractions you would have some time to think of me. Still, when the terrible news came that the whole world was assembling against us, I realized that that was a matter of paramount importance; but if it should turn out successfully, then at last I thought I might be sure that the intercourse between me and you would be unstinted.
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And now we have won the great battle and have <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> and Croesus in subjection; we have taken <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> and subjugated everything; and yet yesterday, by Mithras, if I had not fought my way through the crowd with my fists, I vow I could not have got near you. However, when you took me by the hand and bade me stay by you, I was the object of all envious eyes, for having spent a whole day with you&mdash;without a thing to eat or drink.
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>If, therefore, it can now be so arranged that we, who have proved ourselves most deserving, shall have the largest share of your company, well and good; if not, I am ready once again to make a proclamation in your name to the effect that all shall keep away from you, except us who have been your friends from the beginning.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this <persName>Cyrus</persName> laughed as did many others.<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chrysantas proposes a royal home for <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> Then Chrysantas, the Persian, rose and spoke as follows: &ldquo;Well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, it was hitherto quite proper for you to make yourself approachable, for the reasons you have yourself assigned and also because we were not the ones whose favour you most needed to win; for we were with you for our own sakes. But it was imperative for you in every way to win the affections of the multitude, so that they might consent to toil and risk their lives with us as gladly as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>But now, seeing that you do not hold your power by this method alone but are in a position in still other ways to win the hearts of those whom it is of advantage for you to win, it is meet that you should now have a home. Else what enjoyment would you have of your power, if you alone were to have no hearth and home of your own? For there is no spot on earth more sacred, more sweet, or more dear than that. And finally,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you not think that we also should be ashamed to see you living in discomfort, out of doors, while we ourselves lived in houses and seemed to be better off than you?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Chrysantas had finished his speech,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> moves into the palace</note> many supported him in the same tenor. After that, <persName>Cyrus</persName> moved into the royal palace, and those who had charge of the treasures brought from <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> delivered them there. And after he took possession, <persName>Cyrus</persName> sacrificed first to Hestia, then to sovereign Zeus, and then to any other god that the magi suggested.
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This done, he began at once to organize the rest of his court. And as he considered his own situation, that he was undertaking to hold sway over many people, and preparing to dwell in the greatest of all famous cities, and that that city was as hostile to him as a city could be to any man&mdash;as he reflected on this, he decided that he needed a body-guard.
<milestone unit="section" n="59"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as he realized that men are nowhere an easier<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He selects his bodyguard</note> prey to violence than when at meals or at wine, in the bath, or in bed and asleep, he looked around to see who were the most faithful men that he could have around him at such times; and he held that no man was ever faithful who loved any one else better than the one who needed his protection.
<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>Those, therefore, who had children or congenial wives or sweethearts, such he believed were by nature constrained to love them best. But as he observed that eunuchs were not susceptible to any such affections, he thought that they would esteem most highly those who were in the best position to make them rich and to stand by them, if ever they were wronged, and to place them in offices of honour; and no one, he thought, could surpass him in bestowing favours of that kind.
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>Besides, inasmuch as eunuchs are objects of contempt to the rest of mankind, for this reason, if for no other, they need a master who will be their patron; for there is no man who would not think that he had a right to take advantage of a eunuch at every opportunity unless there were some higher power to prevent his doing so; but there is no reason why even a eunuch should not be superior to all others in fidelity to his master.
<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>But he did not admit what many might very easily be inclined to suppose, that eunuchs are weaklings; and he drew this conclusion also from the case of other animals: for instance, vicious horses, when gelded, stop biting and prancing about, to be sure, but are none the less fit for service in war; and bulls, when castrated, lose somewhat of their high spirit and unruliness but are not deprived of their strength or capacity for work. And in the same way dogs, when castrated, stop running away from their masters, but are no less useful for watching or hunting.
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>And men, too, in the same way, become gentler when deprived of this desire, but not less careful of that which is entrusted to them; they are not made any less efficient horsemen, or any less skilful lancers, or less ambitious men.
<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>On the contrary, they showed both in times of war and in hunting that they still preserved in their souls a spirit of rivalry; and of their fidelity they gave the best proof upon the fall of their masters, for no one ever performed acts of greater fidelity in his master's misfortunes than eunuchs do.
<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>And if it is thought with some justice that they are inferior in bodily strength, yet on the field of battle steel makes the weak equal to the strong. Recognizing these facts, he selected eunuchs for every post of personal service to him, from the door-keepers up.
<milestone unit="section" n="66"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But, as he deemed this guard insufficient in<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The palace guard</note> view of the multitude of those who bore him ill-will, he looked around to see whom he could find among the rest who would be the most trustworthy guards about the palace.
<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>Now he knew that the Persians on account of their poverty lived in the greatest privation at home and were accustomed to a life of the hardest toil, because their country was rugged and they had to work with their own hands; so he believed that they would especially welcome life with him.
<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>Accordingly, he took from among them ten thousand spearmen, who kept guard about the palace day and night, whenever he was in residence; but whenever he went away anywhere, they went along drawn up in order on either side of him.
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since he considered that all <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, too,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The city guards</note> stood in need of adequate protection, whether he himself happened to be at home or abroad, he stationed there also an adequate garrison, and he arranged that the Babylonians should furnish the money for their wages, for it was his aim that this people should be as destitute of resources as possible, so that they might be as submissive and as easily restrained as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="70"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This guard that he then established about himself and in the city of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> is maintained on the same footing even to this day. And as he studied how his whole empire might be held together and at the same time enlarged, he reflected that these mercenaries were not so much better men than those he had made subject as they were inferior in number; and he realized that the brave men, who with the aid of the gods had brought him victory, must be kept together and that care must be exercised that they should not abandon their practice of virtue.
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>But in order that he might not seem to be issuing orders to them, but that they also might of themselves recognize that this was the best course for them and so abide in virtue and cultivate it, he collected the peers and all who were men of influence, together with such as seemed to him most worthy sharers of his toil and its rewards;
<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>and when they had come together he addressed them as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Friends and allies, thanks be above all to the gods<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> advocates the old morals for his new empire</note> that they have vouchsafed to us to obtain all that we thought we deserved. For now we are in possession of broad and fertile lands and of subjects to support us by tilling them; we have houses also and furniture in them.
<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>And let not one of you think that in having these things he has what does not belong to him; for it is a law established for all time among all men that when a city is taken in war, the persons and the property of the inhabitants thereof belong to the captors. It will, therefore, be no injustice for you to keep what you have, but if you let them keep anything, it will be only out of generosity that you do not take it away.
<milestone unit="section" n="74"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As for the future, however, it is my judgment that if we turn to idleness and the luxurious self-indulgence of men of coarse natures, who count toil misery and living without toil happiness, we shall soon be of little account in our own eyes and shall soon lose all the blessings that we have.
<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>For, to have quitted yourselves once like valiant men does not, we know, assure the perpetuity of valour, unless you devote yourselves to it to the end; but, just as skill in other arts retrogrades if neglected, and as bodies, too, that were once in good condition change and deteriorate as soon as the owners relax into idleness, so also self-control and temperance and strength will take a backward turn to vice as soon as one ceases to cultivate them.
<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>Therefore, we dare not become careless nor give ourselves up to the enjoyment of the present moment; for, while I think it is a great thing to have won an empire, it is a still greater thing to preserve it after it has been won. For to win falls often to the lot of one who has shown nothing but daring; but to win and hold&mdash;that is no longer a possibility without the exercise of self-control, temperance, and unflagging care.
<milestone unit="section" n="77"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Recognizing all this, we ought to practise<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He emphasizes the Persians' need</note> virtue even more than we did before we secured these advantages, for we may be sure that the more a man has, the more people will envy him and plot against him and become his enemies, particularly if, as in our case, he draws his wealth and service from unwilling hands.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;We must, therefore, believe that the gods will be on our side; for we have not come unjustly into our possessions through plotting against others, but plotted against we have avenged ourselves.
<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>But that which is next in importance after the favour of the gods we must get for ourselves&mdash;namely, we must claim the right to rule over our subjects only on the ground that we are their betters. Now the conditions of heat and cold, food and drink, toil and rest, we must share even with our slaves. But though we share with them, we must above all try to show ourselves their betters in such matters;
<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>but the science and practice of war we need not share at all with those whom we wish to put in the position of workmen or tributaries to us, but we must maintain our superiority in these accomplishments, as we recognize in these the means to liberty and happiness that the gods have given to men. And just as we have taken their arms away from them, so surely must we never be without our own, for we know that the nearer to their arms men constantly are, the more completely at their command is their every wish.
<milestone unit="section" n="80"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But if any one is revolving in his mind any<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The secret of happiness</note> such questions as this&mdash;&lsquo;of what earthly use it is to us to have attained to the goal of our ambitions if we still have to endure hunger and thirst, toil and care&rsquo;&mdash;he must take this lesson to heart: that good things bring the greater pleasure, in proportion to the toil one undergoes beforehand to attain them; for toil gives a relish to good things; and nothing, however sumptuously prepared, could give pleasure unless a man get it when he needs it.
<milestone unit="section" n="81"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now if God has helped us to obtain that which men most desire, and if any one will so order these results for himself that they shall give as great pleasure as possible, such a man will have this advantage over those who are not so well supplied with the means of living: when hungry he will enjoy the most dainty food, and when thirsty he will enjoy the finest drinks, and when in need of rest he will find it most refreshing.
<milestone unit="section" n="82"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Wherefore I maintain that we should now strain every nerve after manliness, so that we may enjoy our success in the best and most delightful manner and have no experience in that which is hardest of all. For failure to obtain good things is not so hard as the loss of them, when once obtained, is painful.
<milestone unit="section" n="83"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And think of this also: what excuse should we offer for allowing ourselves to become less deserving than before? That we are rulers? But, you know, it is not proper for the ruler to be worse than his subjects. Or that we seem to be more fortunate than before? Will any one then maintain that vice is the proper ornament for good fortune? Or shall we plead that since we have slaves, we will punish them, if they are bad?
<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>Why, what propriety is there in any one's punishing others for viciousness or indolence, when he himself is bad?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And think also on this: we have made arrangements<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Virtue the strongest safeguard</note> to keep many men to guard our homes and our lives; and how would it be otherwise than base in us to think that we have a right to enjoy security protected by other men's spears, while we ourselves do not take up the spear for our own defence? And yet we must be fully aware that there is no such safeguard as for a man to be good and brave himself; this guard must be ever at our side. But if a man lack virtue, neither is it fitting that aught else be well with him.
    <milestone unit="section" n="85"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What, then, do I propose that we should do, wherein practise virtue, and where apply the practice? I have nothing new to tell you, my men; but<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The Persian discipline in <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 1.2.4">Xen.

<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>And as for our boys, as many as shall be born to us, let us educate them here. For we ourselves shall be better, if we aim to set before the boys as good examples as we can in ourselves; and the boys could not easily turn out bad, even if they should wish to, if they neither see nor hear anything vicious but spend their days in good and noble pursuits.&rdquo;</p></div1>
<div1 type="Book" n="8"><p>
<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s address; and after him<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Chrysantas emphasizes the importance of discipline</note> Chrysantas rose and spoke as follows: &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, I have noticed often enough before now that a good ruler is not at all different from a good father. For as fathers provide for their children so that they may never be in want of the good things of life, so <persName>Cyrus</persName> seems to me now to be giving us counsel how we may best continue in prosperity. But there is one thing that he has not stated so clearly, it seems to me, as he should have done, and that I will try to present to any who do not know about it.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Bethink you, then, of this: what city that is hostile could be taken or what city that is friendly could be preserved by soldiers who are insubordinate? What army of disobedient men could gain a victory? How could men be more easily defeated in battle than when they begin to think each of his own individual safety? And what possible success could be achieved by such as do not obey their superiors? What state could be administered according to its laws, or what private establishments could be maintained, and how could ships arrive at their destination?
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And as for us, how have we secured the good things we now have, except by obedience to our commander? For by that course we always quickly reached our required destination, whether by day or by night, and following our commander in close array we were invincible, and we left half done none of the tasks committed to us. If, therefore, obedience to one's commander is, as it seems, the first essential to achieving success, then you may be sure that this same course is the first essential to ensuring its permanence.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Heretofore, you know, many of us had no<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">and the need of obedience to <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> command but were under command; but now all of you here are so situated that you have command, some of larger, some of smaller divisions. Therefore, as you yourselves will expect to exercise authority over those under your command, so let us also give our obedience to those whom it is our duty to obey. And we must distinguish ourselves from slaves in this way, that, whereas slaves serve their masters against their wills, we, if indeed we claim to be free, must do of our own free will all that seems to be of the first importance. And you will find that among states, even when the government is not a monarchy, that state which most readily obeys its officers is least likely to be compelled to submit to its enemies.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Let us, therefore, present ourselves before<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Duty of attendance at court</note> our ruler's headquarters yonder, as <persName>Cyrus</persName> bids; let us devote ourselves to those pursuits by which we shall best be able to hold fast to that which we ought, and let us offer ourselves for whatever service <persName>Cyrus</persName> may need us for. And this trust will not be abused, for we may be sure that <persName>Cyrus</persName> will never be able to find anything in which he can employ us for his own advantage and not equally for ours; for we have common interests and we have common enemies.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Chrysantas had finished this address,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Policies adopted</note> many others also both of the Persians and the allies rose to support him. They passed a resolution that the nobles should always be in attendance at court and be in readiness for whatever service <persName>Cyrus</persName> wished until he should dismiss them. And as they then resolved, so even unto this day those who are the subjects of the great king in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> continue to do&mdash;they are constantly in attendance at the court of their princes.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And the institutions which <persName>Cyrus</persName> inaugurated as a means of securing the kingdom permanently to himself and the/ Persians, as has been set forth in the foregoing narrative, these the succeeding kings have preserved unchanged even to this day.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And it is the same with these as with everything else: whenever the officer in charge is better, the administration of the institution is purer; but when he is worse, the administration is more corrupt.Accordingly, the nobles came to <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s court with their horses and their spears, for so it had been decreed by the best of those who with him had made the conquest of the kingdom.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> next appointed officers to have charge of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> appoints many officers</note> the various departments; for example, tax-collectors, paymasters, boards of public works, keepers of his estates, and stewards of his commissary department. He appointed also as superintendents of his horses and hounds those who he thought would keep these creatures in a condition most efficient for his use.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But he did not in the same way leave to others the precaution of seeing that those whom he thought he ought to have as his associates in establishing the permanence of his success should be the ablest men available, but he considered that this responsibility was his own. For he knew that if ever there should be occasion for fighting, he would then have to select from their number men to stand beside and behind him, men in whose company also he would have to meet the greatest dangers; from their number likewise he knew that he would have to appoint his captains both of foot and of horse.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Besides, if generals should be needed where he himself could not be, he knew that they would have to be commissioned from among that same number. And he knew that he must employ some of these to be governors and satraps of cities or of whole nations, and that he must send others on embassies&mdash;an office which he considered of the very first importance for obtaining without war whatever he might want.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>If, therefore, those by whom the most<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The importance of wise appointments</note> numerous and most important affairs of state were to be transacted were not what they ought to be, he thought that his government would be a failure. But if they were all that they ought to be, he believed that everything would succeed. In this conviction, therefore, he took upon himself this charge; and he determined that the same practice of virtue should be his as well. For he thought that it was not possible for him to incite others to good and noble deeds, if he were not himself such as he ought to be.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had arrived at this conclusion, he thought, first of all, that he needed leisure if he were to be able to confine his attention to affairs of paramount importance. He decided, then, that it was out of the question for him to neglect the revenues, for he foresaw that there would necessarily be enormous expenses connected with a vast empire; and on the other hand, he knew that for him to be constantly engaged in giving his personal attention to his manifold possessions would leave him with no time to care for the welfare of the whole realm.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As he thus pondered how the business of<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He models his civil service after the army</note> administration might be successfully conducted and how he still might have the desired leisure, he somehow happened to think of his military organization: in general, the sergeants care for the ten men under them, the lieutenants for the sergeants, the colonels for the lieutenants, the generals for the colonels, and thus no one is uncared for, even though there be many brigades; and when the commander-in-chief wishes to do anything with his army, it is sufficient for him to issue his commands only to his brigadier-generals.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>On this same model, then, <persName>Cyrus</persName> centralized the administrative functions also. And so it was possible for him, by communicating with only a few officers, to have no part of his administration uncared for. In this way he now enjoyed more leisure than one who has care of a single household or a single ship.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had thus organized his own functions in the government, he instructed those about him to follow the same plan of organization.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this way, then, he secured leisure for himself and for his ministers; and then he began to take measures that his associates in power should be such as they ought to be. In the first place, if any of those who were able to live by the labours of others failed to attend at court, he made inquiry after them; for he thought that those who came would not be willing to do anything dishonourable or immoral, partly because they were in the presence of their sovereign and partly also because they knew that, whatever they did, they would be under the eyes of the best men there; whereas, in the case of those who did not, come he believed that they absented themselves because they were guilty of some form of intemperance or injustice or neglect of duty.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We will describe first, therefore, the manner<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How he enforced the discipline</note> in which he obliged all such to come; he would direct some one of the best friends he had at court to seize some of the property of the man who did not present himself and to declare that he was taking only what was his own. So, whenever this happened, those who lost their effects would come to him to complain that they had been wronged.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <persName>Cyrus</persName>, however, would not be at leisure for a long time to give such men a hearing, and when he did give them a hearing he would postpone the trial for a long time. By so doing he thought he would accustom them to pay their court and that he would thus excite less ill-feeling than he would if he compelled them to come by imposing penalties.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That was one of his methods of training them to attend. Another was to give those who did attend the easiest and the most profitable employment; and another was never to distribute any favours among those who failed to attend.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>But the surest way of compulsion was this: if a man paid no attention to any of these three methods, he would take away all that he had and give it to some one else who he thought would present himself when he was wanted; and thus he would get a useful friend in exchange for a useless one. And the king to-day likewise makes inquiries if any one absents himself whose duty it is to be present.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, he dealt with those who failed<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> resolves to be a model in</note> to attend at court. But in those who did present themselves he believed that he could in no way more effectively inspire a desire for the beautiful and the good than by endeavouring, as their sovereign, to set before his subjects a perfect model of virtue in his own person.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>For he thought he perceived that men are made better through even the written law, while the good ruler he regarded as a law with eyes for men, because he is able not only to give commandments but also to see the transgressor and punish him.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this conviction, he showed himself in the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(1) religion,</note> first place more devout in his worship of the gods, now that he was more fortunate; and then for the first time the college of magi was instituted... and he never failed to sing hymns to the gods at daybreak and to sacrifice daily to whatsoever deities the magi directed.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Thus the institutions established by him at that time have continued in force with each successive king even to this day. In this respect, therefore, the rest of the Persians also imitated him from the first; for they believed that they would be more sure of good fortune if they revered the gods just as he did who was their sovereign and the most fortunate of all; and they thought also that in doing this they would please <persName>Cyrus</persName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> considered that the piety of his friends was a good thing for him, too; for he reasoned as they do who prefer, when embarking on a voyage, to set sail with pious companions rather than with those who are believed to have committed some impiety. And besides, he reasoned that if all his associates were god-fearing men, they would be less inclined to commit crime against one another or against himself, for he considered himself their benefactor;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>and if he made it plain how important he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(2) uprightness,</note> held it to be to wrong no one of his friends or allies, and if he always paid scrupulous regard to what was upright, others also, he thought, would be more likely to abstain from improper gains and to endeavour to make their way by upright methods.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>And he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(3) considerateness,</note> thought that he should be more likely to inspire in all respect for others, if he himself were seen to show such respect for all as not to say or do anything improper.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>And that this would be the result he concluded from the following observation: people have more respect for those who have such respect for others than they have for those who have not; they show it toward even those whom they do not fear&mdash;to say nothing of what they would show toward their kings; and women also whom they see showing respect for others they are more inclined to look upon in turn with respect.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And again, obedience he thought would be<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(4) obedience,</note> most deeply impressed upon his attendants, if he showed that he honoured those who unhesitatingly obeyed more than those who thought they exhibited the greatest and most elaborate virtues. And thus he continued throughout to judge and to act.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And by making his own self-control an example,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(5) temperance</note> he disposed all to practise that virtue more diligently. For when the weaker members of society see that one who is in a position where he may indulge himself to excess is still under self-control, they naturally strive all the more not to be found guilty of any excessive indulgence.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>&lt;Moreover, he distinguished between considerateness and self-control in this way: the considerate are those who avoid what is offensive when seen; the self-controlled avoid that which is offensive, even when unseen.&gt;
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>And he thought that temperance could be best inculcated, if he showed that he himself was never carried away from the pursuit of the good by any pleasures of the moment, but that he was willing to labour first for the attainment of refined pleasures.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To sum up, then, by setting such an example <persName>Cyrus</persName> secured at court great correctness of conduct on the part of his subordinates, who gave precedence to their superiors; and thus he also secured from them a great degree of respect and politeness toward one another. And among them you would never have detected any one raising his voice in anger or giving vent to his delight in boisterous laughter; but on seeing them you would have judged that they were in truth making a noble life their aim.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was what they did and such what they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The chase as a means of discipline</note> witnessed day by day at court. With a view to training in the arts of war, <persName>Cyrus</persName> used to take out hunting those who he thought ought to have such practice, for he held that this was altogether the best training in military science and also the truest in horsemanship.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>For it is the exercise best adapted to give riders a firm seat in all sorts of places, because they have to pursue the animals wherever they may run; and it is also the best exercise to make them active on horseback because of their rivalry and eagerness to get the game.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>By this same exercise, too, he was best able to accustom his associates to temperance and the endurance of hardship, to heat and cold, to hunger and thirst. And even to this day the king and the rest that make up his retinue continue to engage in the same sport.
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From all that has been said, therefore, it is evident that he believed that no one had any right to rule who was not better than his subjects; and it is evident, too, that in thus drilling those about him he himself got his own best training both in temperance and in the arts and pursuits of war.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>For he not only used to take the others out hunting, whenever there was no need of his staying at home, but even when there was some need of his staying at home, he would himself hunt the animals that were kept in the parks. And he never dined without first having got himself into a sweat, nor would he have any food given to his horses without their having first been duly exercised; and to these hunts he would invite also the mace-bearers in attendance upon him.
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>The result of all this constant training was that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Excellence encouraged</note> he and his associates greatly excelled in all manly exercises. Such an example did he furnish by his own personal conduct.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And besides this, he used to reward with gifts and positions of authority and seats of honour and all sorts of preferment others whom he saw devoting themselves most eagerly to the attainment of excellence; and thus he inspired in all an earnest ambition, each striving to appear as deserving as he could in the eyes of <persName>Cyrus</persName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We think, furthermore, that we have observed<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He adopts the Median costume</note> in <persName>Cyrus</persName> that he held the opinion that a ruler ought to excel his subjects not only in point of being actually better than they, but that he ought also to cast a sort of spell upon them. At any rate, he chose to wear the Median dress himself and persuaded his associates also to adopt it; for he thought that if any one had any personal defect, that dress would help to conceal it, and that it made the wearer look very tall and very handsome.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>For they have shoes of such a form that without being detected the wearer can easily put something into the soles so as to make him look taller than he is. He encouraged also the fashion of pencilling the eyes, that they might seem more lustrous than they are, and of using cosmetics to make the complexion look better than nature made it.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He trained his associates also not to spit or to wipe the nose in public, and not to turn round to look at anything, as being men who wondered at nothing. All this he thought contributed, in some measure, to their appearing to their subjects men who could not lightly be despised.
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Those, therefore, who he thought ought to be<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His policy toward the servant class</note> in authority he thus prepared in his own school by careful training as well as by the respect which he commanded as their leader; those, on the other hand, whom he was training to be servants he did not encourage to practise any of the exercises of freemen; neither did he allow them to own weapons; but he took care that they should not suffer any deprivation in food or drink on account of the exercises in which they served the freemen.
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>And he managed it in this way: whenever they were to drive the animals down into the plains for the horsemen, he allowed those of the lower classes, but none of the freemen, to take food with them on the hunt; and whenever there was an expedition to make, he would lead the serving men to water, just as he did the beasts of burden. And again, when it was time for luncheon, he would wait for them until they could get something to eat, so that they should not get so ravenously hungry. And so this class also called him &ldquo;father,&rdquo; just as the nobles did, for he provided for them well &lt;so that they might spend all their lives as slaves, without a protest&gt;.
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he secured for the whole Persian empire<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His personal security</note> the necessary stability; and as for himself, he was perfectly confident that there was no danger of his suffering aught at the hands of those whom he had subdued. And the ground of his confidence was this&mdash;that he believed them to be powerless and he saw that they were unorganized; and besides that, not one of them came near him either by night or by day.
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>But there were some whom he considered very powerful and whom he saw well armed and well organized; and some of them, he knew, had cavalry under their command, others infantry; and he was aware that many of them had the assurance to think that they were competent to rule; and these not only came in very close touch with his guards but many of them came frequently in contact with <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself, and this was unavoidable if he was to make any use of them&mdash;this, then, was the quarter from which there was the greatest danger that something might happen to him in any one of many ways.
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So, as he cast about in his mind how to remove any danger that might arise from them also, he rejected the thought of disarming them and making them incapable of war; for he decided that that would be unjust, and besides he thought that this would be destruction to his empire. On the other hand, he believed that to refuse to admit them to his presence or to show that he mistrusted them would lead at once to hostilities.
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>But better than any of these ways, he recognized that there was one course that would be at once the most honourable and the most conducive to his own personal security, and that was, if possible, to make those powerful nobles better friends to himself than to one another. We shall, therefore, attempt to explain the method that he seems to have taken to gain their friendship.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the first place, then, he showed at all times<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How <persName>Cyrus</persName> made himself popular</note> as great kindness of heart as he could; for he believed that just as it is not easy to love those who seem to hate us, or to cherish good-will toward those who bear us ill-will, in the same way those who are known to love and to cherish good-will could not be hated by those who believe themselves loved.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>During the time, therefore, when he was not yet quite able to do favours through gifts of money, he tried to win the love of those about him by taking forethought for them and labouring for them and showing that he rejoiced with them in their good fortune and sympathized with them in their mishaps; and after he found himself in a position to do favours with money, he seems to us to have recognized<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The nearest way to a man's heart</note> from the start that there is no kindness which men can show one another, with the same amount of expenditure, more acceptable than sharing meat and drink with them.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In this belief, he first of all arranged that there should be placed upon his own table a quantity of food, like that of which he himself regularly partook, sufficient for a very large number of people; and all of that which was served to him, except what he and his companions at table consumed, he distributed among those of his friends to whom he wished to send remembrances or good wishes. And he used to send such presents around to those also whose services on garrison duty or in attendance upon him or in any other way met with his approval; in this way he let them see that he did not fail to observe their wish to please him.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He used also to honour with presents from his table any one of his servants whom he took occasion to commend; and he had all of his servants' food served from his own table, for he thought that this would implant in them a certain amount of good-will, just as it does in dogs. And if he wished to have any one of his friends courted by the multitude, to such a one he would send presents from his table. And that device proved effective; for even to this day everybody pays more diligent court to those to whom they see things sent from the royal table; for they think that such persons must be in high favour and in a position to secure for them anything they may want. Moreover, it is not for these reasons only that that which is sent by the king gives delight, but the food that is sent from the king's board really is much superior in the gratification also that it gives.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>That this, however, should<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Specialization desirable even in the kitchen</note> be so is no marvel. For just as all other arts are developed to superior excellence in large cities, in that same way the food at the king's palace is also elaborately prepared with superior excellence. For in small towns the same workman makes chairs and doors and plows and tables, and often this same artisan builds houses, and even so he is thankful if he can only find employment enough to support him. And it is, of course, impossible for a man of many trades to be proficient in all of them. In large cities, on the other hand, inasmuch as many people have demands to make upon each branch of industry, one trade alone, and very often even less than a whole trade, is enough to support a man: one man, for instance, makes shoes for men, and another for women; and there are places even where one man earns a living by only stitching shoes, another by cutting them out, another by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but only assembles the parts. It follows, therefore, as a matter of course, that he who devotes himself to a very highly specialized line of work is bound to do it in the best possible manner.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Exactly the same thing holds true also in reference to the kitchen: in any establishment where one and the same man arranges the dining couches, lays the table, bakes the bread, prepares now one sort of dish and now another, he must necessarily have things go as they may; but where it is all one man can do to stew meats and another to roast them, for one man to boil fish and another to bake them, for another to make bread and not every sort at that, but where it suffices if he makes one kind that has a high reputation&mdash;everything that is prepared in such a kitchen will, I think, necessarily be worked out with superior excellence.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, <persName>Cyrus</persName> far surpassed all others in<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> lavish in his gifts</note> the art of making much of his friends by gifts of food. And how he far surpassed in every other way of courting favour, I will now explain. Though he far exceeded all other men in the amount of the revenues he received, yet he excelled still more in the quantity of presents he made. It was <persName>Cyrus</persName>, therefore, who began the practice of lavish giving, and among the kings it continues even to this day.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>For who has richer friends to show than the Persian king? Who is there that is known to adorn his friends with more beautiful robes than does the king? Whose gifts are so readily recognized as some of those which the king gives, such as bracelets, necklaces, and horses with gold-studded bridles? For, as everybody knows, no one over there is allowed to have such things except those to whom the king has given them.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And of whom else is it said that by the munificence of his gifts he makes himself preferred above even brothers and parents and children? Who else was ever in a position like the Persian king to punish enemies who were distant a journey of many months? And who, besides <persName>Cyrus</persName>, ever gained an empire by conquest and even to his death was called &ldquo;father&rdquo; by the people he had subdued? For that name obviously belongs to a benefactor rather than to a despoiler.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Moreover,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The &ldquo;king's eyes&rsquo; and &ldquo;king's ears&rdquo;</note> we have discovered that he acquired the so-called &ldquo;king's eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;king's ears&rdquo; in no other way than by bestowing presents and honours; for by rewarding liberally those who reported to him whatever it was to his interest to hear, he prompted many men to make it their business to use their eyes and ears to spy out what they could report to the king to his advantage.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>As a natural result of this, many &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; and many &ldquo;ears&rdquo; were ascribed to the king. But if any one thinks that the king<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Hdt. i. 114; Aesch. <title>Pers.</title> 980</note> selected one man to be his &ldquo;eye,&rdquo; he is wrong; for one only would see and one would hear but little; and it would have amounted to ordering all the rest to pay no attention, if one only had been appointed to see and hear. Besides, if people knew that a certain man was the &ldquo;eye,&rdquo; they would know that they must beware of him. But such is not the case; for the king listens to anybody who may claim to have heard or seen anything worthy of attention.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>And thus the saying comes about, &ldquo;The king has many ears and many eyes&rdquo;; and people are everywhere afraid to say anything to the discredit of the king, just as if he himself were listening; or to do anything to harm him, just as if he were present. Not only, therefore, would no one have ventured to say anything derogatory of <persName>Cyrus</persName> to any one else, but every one conducted himself at all times just as if those who were within hearing were so many eyes and ears of the king. I do not know what better reason any one could assign for this attitude toward him on the part of people generally than that it was his policy to do large favours in return for small ones.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That he, the richest man of all, should excel<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> excelled in generosity</note> in the munificence of his presents is not surprising; but for him, the king, to exceed all others in thoughtful attention to his friends and in care for them, that is more remarkable; and it is said to have been no secret that there was nothing wherein he would have been so much ashamed of being outdone as in attention to his friends.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>People quote a remark of his to the effect that the duties of a good shepherd and of a good king were very much alike; a good shepherd ought, while deriving benefit from his flocks, to make them happy (so far as sheep can be said to have happiness), and in the same way a king ought to make his people and his cities happy, if he would derive benefits from them. Seeing that he held this theory, it is not at all surprising that he was ambitious to surpass all other men in attention to his friends.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And, among other proofs, <persName>Cyrus</persName> is said to have<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s theory of wealth <title>vs.</title> that of Croesus</note> given Croesus one splendid practical demonstration of the correctness of this theory, when the latter warned him that by giving so much away he would make himself poor, whereas he was in a position to lay up in his house more treasures of gold than any other man.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And how much gold, pray,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> is said to have asked, &ldquo;do you think I should have by this time, if I had been amassing it, as you propose, ever since I have been in power?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Croesus named some large sum.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, then, Croesus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName> in reply, &ldquo;send along with Hystaspas here a man in whom you have most confidence. And you, Hystaspas,&rdquo; said he to him, &ldquo;go the round of my friends and tell them that I need money for a certain enterprise; for, in truth, I do need more. And bid them write down the amount they could each let me have, and affix their seals to each subscription, and give it to Croesus's messenger to deliver here.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he had written down what he had said, he sealed the letter and gave it to Hystaspas to carry to his friends. And he included in it also a request that they all receive Hystaspas as his friend.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he had made the round and Croesus's messenger had brought in the subscriptions, Hystaspas said: &ldquo;King <persName>Cyrus</persName>, you should treat me also henceforth as a rich man; for, thanks to your letter, I have come back with a great number of presents.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Even in this man, Croesus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;we have one treasure-house already. But as for the rest of my friends, look over the list, and add up the amounts, and see how much money is ready for me, if I need any for my use.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Croesus is said to have added it up and to have found that there was many times as much subscribed as he had told <persName>Cyrus</persName> he should have in his treasury by this time, if he had been amassing it.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>And when this became apparent, <persName>Cyrus</persName> is said to have remarked: &ldquo;Do you observe, Croesus,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> also has his treasures</note> that I, too, have my treasures? But you are proposing to me to get them together and hoard them in my palace, to put hired watchmen in charge of everything and to trust to them, and on account of those hoards to be envied and hated. I, on the other hand, believe that if I make my friends rich I shall have treasures in them and at the same time more trusty watchers both of my person and of our common fortunes than any hired guards I could put in charge.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And one more thing I must tell<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Why <persName>Cyrus</persName> wanted wealth</note> you: even I cannot eradicate from myself that passion for wealth which the gods have put into the human soul and by which they have made us all poor alike, but I, too, am as insatiate of wealth as other people are.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>However, I think I am different from most people, in that others, when they have acquired more than a sufficiency, bury some of their treasure and allow some to decay, and some they weary themselves with counting, measuring, weighing, airing, and watching; and though they have so much at home, they never eat more than they can hold, for they would burst if they did, and they never wear more than they can carry, for they would be suffocated if they did; they only find their superfluous treasure a burden.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>But I follow the leading of the gods and am always grasping after more. But when I have obtained what I see is more than enough for my needs, I use it to satisfy the wants of my friends; and by enriching men and doing them kindnesses I win with my superfluous wealth their friendship and loyalty, and from that I reap as my reward security and good fame&mdash;possessions that never decay or do injury from overloading the recipient; but the more one has of good fame, the greater and more attractive and lighter to bear it becomes, and often, too, it makes those who bear it lighter of heart.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And let me tell you, Croesus,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I do not consider those the happiest who have the most and keep guard of the most; for if that were so, those would be the happiest who keep guard on the city walls, for they keep guard of everything in the city. But the one who can honestly acquire the most and use the most to noble ends, him I count most happy.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And it was evident that he practised what he preached.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Besides this, he had observed that most people<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> establishes a board of health and a medical dispensary</note> in days of health and strength make preparations that they may have the necessaries of life, and they lay up for themselves what will serve to supply the wants of healthy people; but he saw that they made no provision at all for such things as would be serviceable in case of sickness. He resolved, therefore, to work out these problems, and to that end he spared no expense to collect about him the very best physicians and surgeons and all the instruments and drugs and articles of food and drink that any one of them said would be useful&mdash;there were none of these things that he did not procure and keep in store at his palace.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And whenever any one fell sick in whose recovery he was interested, he would visit him and provide for him whatever was needed. And he was grateful to the physicians also, whenever any of them took any of his medical stores and with them effected a cure.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These and many other such arts he employed in order to hold the first place in the affections of those by whom he wished to be beloved.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And the games, in which <persName>Cyrus</persName> used to announce contests and to offer prizes from a desire to inspire in his people a spirit of emulation in what was beautiful and good&mdash;these games also brought him praise, because his aim was to secure practice in excellence. But these contests also stirred up contentions and jealousies among the nobles.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Besides this, <persName>Cyrus</persName> had made a regulation that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How <persName>Cyrus</persName> guarded against coalitions</note> was practically a law, that, in any matter that required adjudication, whether it was a civil action or a contest for a prize, those who asked for such adjudication must concur in the choice of judges. It was, therefore, a matter of course that each of the contestants aimed to secure the most influential men as judges and such as were most friendly to himself. The one who did not win was always jealous of those who did, and disliked those of the judges who did not vote in his favour; on the other hand, the one who did win claimed that he had won by virtue of the justice of his cause, and so he thought he owed no thanks to anybody.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And those also who wished to hold the first place in the affections of <persName>Cyrus</persName> were jealous of one another, just like other people (even in republics), so that in most cases the one would have wished to get the other out of the way sooner than to join with him in any work to their mutual interest.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus it has been shown how he contrived that the most influential citizens should love him more than they did each other.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next we shall describe how <persName>Cyrus</persName> for the first<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> plans to appear in state</note> time drove forth in state from his palace; and that is in place here, for the magnificence of his appearance in state seems to us to have been one of the arts that he devised to make his government command respect. Accordingly, before he started out, he called to him those of the Persians and of the allies who held office, and distributed Median robes among them (and this was the first time that the Persians put on the Median robe); and as he distributed them he said that he wished to proceed in state to the sanctuaries that had been selected for the gods, and to offer sacrifice there with his friends.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>&ldquo;Come, therefore, to court before sunrise, dressed in these robes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and form in line as Pheraulas, the Persian, shall direct in my name; and when I lead the way, follow me in the order assigned to you. But if any one of you thinks that some other way would be better than that in which we shall now proceed, let him inform me as soon as we return, for everything must be arranged as you think best and most becoming.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when he had distributed among the noblest the most beautiful garments, he brought out other Median robes, for he had had a great many made, with no stint of purple or sable or red or scarlet or crimson cloaks. He apportioned to each one of his officers his proper share of them, and he bade them adorn their friends with them, &ldquo;just as I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have been adorning you.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; asked one of those present, &ldquo;when will you adorn yourself?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, do I not seem to you to be adorned myself when I adorn you?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Be sure that if I can treat you, my friends, properly, I shall look well, no matter what sort of dress I happen to have on.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So they went away, sent for their friends, and adorned them with the robes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now <persName>Cyrus</persName> believed Pheraulas, that man of the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Pheraulas is made grand marshal II. iii. 7 ff.</note> common people, to be intelligent, to have an eye for beauty and order, and to be not indisposed to please him; (this was the same Pheraulas who had once supported his proposal that each man should be honoured in accordance with his merit;) so he called him in and with him planned how to arrange the procession in a manner that should prove most splendid in the eyes of his loyal friends and most intimidating to those who were disaffected.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And when after careful study they agreed on the arrangement, he bade Pheraulas see that the procession take place on the morrow exactly as they had decided was best. &ldquo;And I have issued orders,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that everybody shall obey you in regard to the ordering of the procession; but, in order that they may the more readily follow your directions, take these tunics here and give them to the officers of the lancers, and these cavalry mantles here to the commanders of the horse; and give the officers of the chariot forces also these other tunics.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So he took them and carried them away.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And when the officers one after another saw him, they would say: &ldquo;You must be a great man, Pheraulas, seeing that you are to command even us what we must do.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No, by Zeus,&rdquo; Pheraulas would answer; &ldquo;not only not that, so it seems, but I am even to be one of the porters; at any rate, I am now carrying these two mantles here, the one for you, the other for some one else. You, however, shall have your choice.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With that, of course, the man who was receiving the mantle would at once forget about his jealousy and presently be asking his advice which one to choose. And he would give his advice as to which one was better and say: &ldquo;If you betray that I have given you your choice, you will find me a different sort of servant the next time I come to serve.&rdquo; And when Pheraulas had distributed everything as he had been instructed to do, he at once began to arrange for the procession that it might be as splendid as possible in every detail.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the next day dawned, everything was in<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The formation of the line of the procession</note> order before sunrise; rows of soldiers stood on this side of the street and on that, just as even to this day the Persians stand, where the king is to pass; and within these lines no one may enter except those who hold positions of honour. And policemen with whips in their hands were stationed there, who struck any one who tried to crowd in.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First in order, in front of the gates stood about four thousand lancers, four deep, and two thousand on either side the gates.
    <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And all the cavalry-men had alighted and stood there beside their horses, and they all had their hands thrust through the sleeves of their doublets,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Persians were obliged, in the presence of the king, to thrust their hands inside the sleeves of their doublets in token of their submission to royalty: moreover, with the hands thus withdrawn, no act of violence was possible. <persName>Cyrus</persName>, the Younger, is said to have had two of his kinsmen executed for their failure to observe this regulation. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 2.1.8">Xen. Hell. 2.1.8</bibl></note> just as they do even to this day when the king sees them. The Persians stood on the right side of the street, the others, the allies, on the left, and the chariots were arranged in the same way, half on either side.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, when the palace gates were thrown open, there were led out at the head of the procession four abreast some exceptionally handsome bulls for Zeus and for the other gods as the magi directed; for the Persians think that they ought much more scrupulously to be guided by those whose profession is with things divine than they are by those in other professions.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Next after the bulls came horses, a sacrifice for the Sun; and after them came a chariot sacred to Zeus; it was drawn by white horses and with a yoke of gold and wreathed with garlands; and next, for the Sun, a chariot drawn by white horses and wreathed with garlands like the other. After that came a third chariot with horses covered with purple trappings, and behind it followed men carrying fire on a great altar.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next after these <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself upon a chariot<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> appears in the procession</note> appeared in the gates wearing his tiara upright, a purple tunic shot with white (no one but the king may wear such a one), trousers of scarlet dye about his legs, and a mantle all of purple. He had also a fillet about his tiara, and his kinsmen also had the same mark of distinction, and they retain it even now.
    <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>His hands he kept outside his sleeves.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Persians were obliged, in the presence of the king, to thrust their hands inside the sleeves of their doublets in token of their submission to royalty: moreover, with the hands thus withdrawn, no act of violence was possible. <persName>Cyrus</persName>, the Younger, is said to have had two of his kinsmen executed for their failure to observe this regulation. <bibl n="Xen.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, when <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s chariot had come forth,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The procession itself</note> the four thousand lancers took the lead, and the two thousand fell in line on either side of his chariot; and his mace-bearers, about three hundred in number, followed next in gala attire, mounted, and equipped with their customary javelins.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Next-came <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s private stud of horses, about two hundred in all, led along with gold-mounted bridles and covered over with embroidered housings. Behind these came two thousand spearmen, and after them the original ten thousand Persian cavalry, drawn up in a square with a hundred on each side; and Chrysantas was in command of them.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Behind them came ten thousand other Persian horsemen arranged in the same way with Hystaspas in command, and after them ten thousand more in the same formation with Datamas as their commander; following them, as many more with Gadatas in command.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>And then followed in succession the cavalry of the Medes, Armenians, Hyrcanians, Cadusians, and Sacians; and behind the cavalry came the chariots ranged four abreast, and Artabatas, a Persian, had command of them.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as he proceeded, a great throng of people<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">How <persName>Cyrus</persName> received petitions</note> followed outside the lines with petitions to present to <persName>Cyrus</persName>, one about one matter, another about another. So he sent to them some of his mace-bearers, who followed, three on either side of his chariot, for the express purpose of carrying messages for him; and he bade them say that if any one wanted anything of him, he should make his wish known to some one of his cavalry officers and they, he said, would inform him. So the people at once fell back and made their way along the lines of cavalry, each considering what officer he should approach.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From time to time <persName>Cyrus</persName> would send some one to call to him one by one those of his friends whom he wished to have most courted by the people, and would say to them: &ldquo;If any one of the people following the procession tries to bring anything to your attention, if you do not think he has anything worth while to say, pay no attention to him; but if any one seems to you to ask what is fair, come and tell me, so that we may consult together and grant the petition.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And whenever he sent such summons, the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Discourtesy toward the king rebuked</note> men would ride up at full speed to answer it, thereby magnifying the majesty of <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s authority and at the same time showing their eagerness to obey. There was but one exception: a certain Dai+phernes, a fellow rather boorish in his manners, though that he would show more independence if he did not obey at once.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> noticed this; and so, before Dai+phernes came and talked with him, he sent one of his mace-bearers privately to say that he had no more need of him; and he did not send for him again.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>But when a man who was summoned later than Dai+phernes rode up to him sooner than he, <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave him one of the horses that were being led in the procession and gave orders to one of the macebearers to have it led away for him wherever he should direct. And to those who saw it it seemed to be a mark of great honour, and as a consequence of that event many more people paid court to that man.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So, when they came to the sanctuaries, they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The sacrifice and the races</note> performed the sacrifice to Zeus and made a holocaust of the bulls; then they gave the horses to the flames in honour of the Sun; next they did sacrifice to the Earth, as the magi directed, and lastly to the tutelary heroes of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And after that, as the locality seemed adapted to the purpose, he pointed out a goal about five stadia distant and commanded the riders, nation by nation, to put their horses at full speed toward it. Accordingly, he himself rode with the Persians and came in far ahead of the rest, for he had given especial attention to horsemanship. Among the Medes, Artabazus won the race, for the horse he had was a gift from <persName>Cyrus</persName>; among the Assyrians who had revolted to him, Gadatas secured the first place; among the Armenians, Tigranes; and among the Hyrcanians, the son of the master of the horse; but among the Sacians a certain private soldier with his horse actually outdistanced the rest by nearly half the course.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Thereupon <persName>Cyrus</persName> is said to have asked the young man if he would take a kingdom for his horse.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;I would not take a kingdom for him, but I would take the chance of laying up a store of gratitude with a brave man.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;and I will show you<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Pheraulas gets a blow and a horse</note> where you could not fail to hit a brave man, even if you throw with your eyes shut.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; said the Sacian; &ldquo;show me; and I will throw this clod here.&rdquo; And with that he picked one up.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> pointed out to him the place where most of his friends were. And the other, shutting his eyes, let fly with the clod and hit Pheraulas as he was riding by; for Pheraulas happened to be carrying some message under orders from <persName>Cyrus</persName>. But though he was hit, he did not so much as turn around but went on to attend to his commission.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Sacian opened his eyes and asked whom he had hit.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;None of those here, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, surely it was not one of those who are not here,&rdquo; said the youth.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;it was; you hit that man who is riding so fast along the line of chariots yonder.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And why does he not even turn around?&rdquo; said the youth.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because he is crazy, I should think,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On hearing this, the young man went to find out who it was. And he found Pheraulas with his chin covered with dirt and blood, for the blood had flowed from his nose where he had been struck; and when he came up to him he asked him if he had been hit.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; he answered.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I will make you a present of this horse.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Pheraulas.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the Sacian related the circumstances and finally said: &ldquo;And in my opinion, at least, I have not failed to hit a brave man.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But you would give him to a richer man than I, if you were wise,&rdquo; answered Pheraulas. &ldquo;Still, even as it is, I will accept him. And I pray the gods, who have caused me to receive your blow, to grant me to see that you never regret your gift to me. And now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;mount my horse and ride away; I will join you presently.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus they made the exchange.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of the Cadusians, Rhathines was the winner.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The chariots also he allowed to race by<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The chariot race</note> divisions; to all the winners he gave cups and cattle, so that they might sacrifice and have a banquet. He himself, then, took the ox as his prize, but his share of the cups he gave to Pheraulas because he thought that that officer, as grand marshal, had managed the procession from the palace admirably.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The procession of the king, therefore, as thus instituted by <persName>Cyrus</persName>, continues even so unto this day, except that the victims are omitted when the king does not offer sacrifice.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When it was all over, they went back to the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The procession comes to an end</note> city to their lodgings&mdash;those to whom houses had been given, to their homes; those who had none, to their company's quarters.
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Pheraulas invited to his house the Sacian<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Pheraulas entertains the Sacian</note> also, who had given him his horse, and entertained his new friend there and made bountiful provision for him in every way; and when they had dined, he filled up the cups that he had received from <persName>Cyrus</persName>, drank to his health, and then gave him the cups.
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the Sacian saw the many beautiful coverlets, the many beautiful pieces of furniture, and the large number of servants, he said: &ldquo;Pray tell me, Pheraulas, were you a rich man at home, too?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Rich, indeed!&rdquo; answered Pheraulas; &ldquo;nay rather, as everybody knows, one of those who lived by the labour of their hands. To be sure, my father, who supported us by hard labour and close economy on his own part, managed to give me the education of the boys; but when I became a young man, he could not support me in idleness, and so he took me off to the farm and put me to work.
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>And there, as long as he lived, I, in turn, supported him by digging and planting a very little plot of ground. It was really not such a very bad plot of ground, but, on the contrary, the most honest; for all the seed that<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cf. Vergil, <title>Georgics</title> i. 4 Menander, <title>Georgos</title> 35</note> it received it returned fairly and honestly, and yet with no very great amount of interest. And sometimes, in a fit of generosity, it would even return to me twice as much as it received. Thus, then, I used to live at home; but now everything that you see has been given to me by <persName>Cyrus</persName>.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;What a happy fellow you must be,&rdquo; said the Sacian, &ldquo;for every reason, but particularly because from being poor you have become rich. For you must enjoy your riches much more, I think, for the very reason that it was only after being hungry for wealth that you became rich.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, do you actually suppose, my Sacian<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He complains of the burden of riches</note> friend,&rdquo; answered Pheraulas, &ldquo;that the more I own, the more happily I live? You are not aware,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that it gives me not one whit more pleasure to eat and drink and sleep now than it did when I was poor. My only gain from having so much is that I am obliged to take care of more, distribute more to others, and have the trouble of looking after more than I used to have.
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>For now many domestics look to me for food, many for drink, and many for clothes, while some need doctors; and one comes to me with a tale about sheep attacked by wolves, or of oxen killed by falling over a precipice, or to say that some disease has broken out among the cattle. And so it looks to me,&rdquo; said Pheraulas, &ldquo;as if I had more trouble now through possessing much than I used to have from possessing little.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But still, by Zeus,&rdquo; said the Sacian, &ldquo;when everything is going well, you must at the sight of so many blessings be many times as happy as I.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;The pleasure that the possession of wealth gives, my good Sacian,&rdquo; said Pheraulas, &ldquo;is not nearly so great as the pain that is caused by its loss. And you shall be convinced that what I say is true: for not one of those who are rich is made sleepless for joy, but of those who lose anything you will not see one who is able to sleep for grief.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Not so, by Zeus,&rdquo; said the Sacian; &ldquo;but of those who get anything not one could you see who gets a wink of sleep for very joy.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;for, you see, if having were as pleasant as getting, the rich would be incomparably happier than the poor. But, you see, my good Sacian, it is also a matter of course that he who has much should also spend much both in the service of the gods and for his friends and for the strangers within his gates. Let me assure you, therefore, that any one who takes inordinate pleasure in the possession of money is also inordinately distressed at having to part with it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; answered the Sacian; &ldquo;but I am not one of that sort; my idea of happiness is both to have much and also to spend much.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the name of the gods, then,&rdquo; said<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Pheraulas gets rid of his burden of wealth</note> Pheraulas, &ldquo;please make yourself happy at once and make me happy, too! Take all this and own it and use it as you wish. And as for me, you need do no more than keep me as a guest&mdash;aye, even more sparingly than a guest, for I shall be content to share whatever you have.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You are joking,&rdquo; said the Sacian.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But Pheraulas assured him with an oath that he was really in earnest in what he proposed. &ldquo;And I will get you other favours besides from <persName>Cyrus</persName>, my Sacian&mdash;exemption from attending at court and from serving in the field; you may just stay at home with your wealth. I will attend to those other duties for you as well as for myself; and if I secure anything more of value either through my attendance upon <persName>Cyrus</persName> or from some campaign, I will bring it to you, so that you may have still more wealth at your command. Only deliver me from this care. For if you will relieve me of its burden, I think you will do a great service also to <persName>Cyrus</persName> as well as to myself.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they had thus talked things over together, they came to an agreement according to this last suggestion and proceeded to act upon it. And the one thought that he had been made a happy man because he had command of great riches, while the other considered himself most blessed because he was to have a steward who would give him leisure to do only whatever was pleasant to him.
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, Pheraulas was naturally a &ldquo;good fellow,&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He delights to serve others</note> and nothing seemed to him so pleasant or so useful as to serve other people. For he held man to be the best and most grateful of all creatures, since he saw that when people are praised by any one they are very glad to praise him in turn; and when any one does them a favour, they try to do him one in return; when they recognize that any one is kindly disposed toward them they return his good-will; and when they know that any one loves them they cannot dislike him; and he noticed especially that they strive more earnestly than any other creature to return the loving care of parents both during their parents' lifetime and after their death; whereas all other creatures, he knew, were both more thankless and more unfeeling than man.
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so Pheraulas was<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">An unusual partnership</note> greatly delighted to think that he could be rid of the care of all his worldly goods and devote himself to his friends; and the Sacian, on his part, was delighted to think that he was to have much and enjoy much. And the Sacian loved Pheraulas because he was always bringing him something more; and Pheraulas loved the Sacian because he was willing to take charge of everything; and though the Sacian had continually more in his charge, none the more did he trouble Pheraulas about it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus these two continued to live.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When <persName>Cyrus</persName> had sacrificed and was celebrating<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">A royal banquet</note> his victory with a banquet, he invited in those of his friends who showed that they were most desirous of magnifying his rule and of honouring him most loyally. He invited with them Artabazus the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName>, Tigranes the Armenian, Gobryas, and the commander of the Hyrcanian horse.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now Gadatas was the chief of the mace-bearers, and the whole household was managed as he directed. Whenever guests dined with <persName>Cyrus</persName>, Gadatas did not even take his seat, but attended upon them. But when they were by themselves, he would dine with <persName>Cyrus</persName>, for <persName>Cyrus</persName> enjoyed his company. And in return for his services he received many valuable presents from <persName>Cyrus</persName> himself and, through <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s influence, from others also.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So when invited guests came to dinner, he did<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Order of preferment at <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s dinners</note> not assign them their seats at random, but he seated on <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s left the one for whom he had the highest regard, for the left side was more readily exposed to treacherous designs than the right; and the one who was second in esteem he seated on his right, the third again on the left, the fourth on the right, and so on, if there were more.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For he thought it a good plan to show publicly how much regard he had for each one, because where people feel that the one who merits most will neither have his praise proclaimed nor receive a prize, there is no emulation among them; but where the most deserving is seen to receive the most preferment, there all are seen to contend most eagerly for the first place.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, <persName>Cyrus</persName> thus made public recognition of those who stood first in his esteem, beginning even with the places they took when sitting or standing in his company. He did not, however, assign the appointed place permanently, but he made it a rule that by noble deeds any one might advance to a more honoured seat, and that if any one should conduct himself ill he should go back to one less honoured. And <persName>Cyrus</persName> felt it a discredit to himself, if the one who sat in the seat of highest honour was not also seen to receive the greatest number of good things at his hands. And we observe, furthermore, that this custom introduced in the time of <persName>Cyrus</persName> continues in force even to our own times.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, when they were at dinner, it struck<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s generosity</note> Gobryas as not at all surprising that there was a great abundance of everything upon the table of a man who ruled over wide domains; but what did excite his wonder was that <persName>Cyrus</persName>, who enjoyed so great good fortune, should never consume by himself any delicacy that he might receive, but took pains to ask his guests to share it, and that he often saw him send even to some of his friends who were not there something that he happened to like very much himself.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And so when the dinner was over and <persName>Cyrus</persName> had sent around to others all that was left from the meal&mdash;and there was a great deal left&mdash;Gobryas could not help remarking: &ldquo;Well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, I used to think that you surpassed all other men in that you were the greatest general; and now, I swear by the gods, you seem actually to excel even more in kindness than in generalship.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;and what is more, I assure you that I take much more pleasure in showing forth my deeds of kindness than ever I did in my deeds of generalship.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Gobryas.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the one field, one must necessarily do harm to men; in the other, only good.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Later, when they were drinking after their<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Why Hystaspas felt slighted</note> meal, Hystaspas asked: &ldquo;Pray, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, would you be displeased with me, if I were to ask you something that I wish to know from you?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, no; by the gods, no,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;on the contrary, I should be displeased with you if I found that you refrained from asking something that you wished to ask.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;did I ever fail to come when you sent for me?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Greek says: &ldquo;Speak words of good omen&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., preserve auspicious silence.</note> said <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Or, obeying, did I ever obey reluctantly?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;No; nor that.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Or did I ever fail to do your bidding in anything?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I make no such accusation,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And is there anything I did that you found me doing otherwise than eagerly or cheerfully?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;That, least of all,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then why, in heaven's name, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did you put Chrysantas down for a more honourable place than mine?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Am I really to tell you?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; answered Hystaspas.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And you, on your part, will not be angry with me when you hear the truth?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Nay rather,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall be more than glad, if I find that I am not being slighted.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;in the first place,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Why <persName>Cyrus</persName> preferred Chrysantas</note> Chrysantas here did not wait to be sent for, but presented himself for our service even before he was called; and in the second place, he has always done not only what was ordered but all that he himself saw was better for us to have done. Again, whenever it was necessary to send some communication to the allies, he would give me advice as to what he thought proper for me to say; and whenever he saw that I wished the allies to know about something, but that I felt some hesitation in saying anything about myself, he would always make it known to them, giving it as his own opinion. And so, in these matters at least, what reason is there why he should not be of more use to me even than I am myself? And finally, he always insists that what he has is enough for him, while he is manifestly always on the lookout for some new acquisition that would be of advantage to me, and takes much more pleasure and joy in my good fortune than I do myself.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By Hera,&rdquo; said Hystaspas in reply, &ldquo;I am glad at any rate that I asked you this question, <persName>Cyrus</persName>.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why so, pray?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because I too shall try to do as he does,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Only I am not sure about one thing&mdash;I do not know how I could show that I rejoice at your good fortune.

At all events, Artabazus introduces his jest about the dance only to cut short the maudlin talk of Hystaspas.</note> suggested Artabazus.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this, of course, there was a laugh.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>But, as<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Hystaspas asks for the daughter of Gobryas</note> the banquet proceeded, <persName>Cyrus</persName> put this question to Gobryas: &ldquo;Tell me, Gobryas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would you be more ready to consent now to give your daughter to one of my friends here than you were when first you joined us?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Gobryas, &ldquo;shall I also tell the truth?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;surely no question calls for a falsehood.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I should consent much more readily now, I assure you.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And would you mind telling us why?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Tell us, then,&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because, while at that time I saw them bear toils and dangers with cheerfulness, now I see them bear their good fortune with self-control.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Hystaspas, did you hear that saying of Gobryas?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and if he has many such things to say, he will find me a suitor for his daughter's hand much sooner than he would if he should exhibit to me a great number of goblets.&rdquo;

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And in the next place,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> went on, &ldquo;a snub-nosed woman would suit you admirably.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;your own nose is so hooked; and hookedness, I assure you, would be the very proper mate for snubbiness.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Do you mean to say also,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;that a supperless wife would suit one who has had a good dinner, like me now?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Aye, by Zeus,&rdquo; answered <persName>Cyrus</persName>; &ldquo;for the stomach of one who has eaten heartily bows out, but that of one who has not eaten bows in.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Then, in heaven's name,&rdquo; said Chrysantas,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s &ldquo;frigid&rdquo; jokes</note> &ldquo;could you tell us what sort of wife would suit a frigid king?&rdquo;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">On the principle of opposites just described, the man who is <foreign lang="greek">yuxro/s</foreign> &ldquo;frigid,&rdquo; &ldquo;cold-blooded&rdquo; should have a wife who is <foreign lang="greek">qermh/</foreign>.

<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I envy you for that, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; said Hystaspas while they were still laughing, &ldquo;more than for anything else in your kingdom.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Envy me for what?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Why, that, frigid as you are, you can still make us laugh.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said <persName>Cyrus</persName>, &ldquo;and would you not give a great deal to have made these jokes and to have them reported to the lady with whom you wish to have the reputation of being a witty fellow?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, then, these pleasantries were exchanged.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this he brought out some articles of feminine adornment for Tigranes and bade him give them to his wife, because she had so bravely accompanied her husband throughout the campaigns; to Artabazus he gave a golden goblet and to the Hyrcanian a horse and many other beautiful presents. &ldquo;And you, Gobryas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will present with a husband for your daughter.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;You will please present him with me, then,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Hystaspas receives the hand of Gobryas's daughter</note> will you not,&rdquo; said Hystaspas, &ldquo;that so I may get the collection of proverbs?&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Ah, but have you property enough to match the girl's fortune?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and several times over.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And where is this property of yours?&rdquo; asked <persName>Cyrus</persName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Right there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in your chair; for you are a friend of mine.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; said Gobryas; and at once stretching out his right hand he added: &ldquo;Give him to me, <persName>Cyrus</persName>; I will accept him.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And <persName>Cyrus</persName> took Hystaspas by the right hand and placed it in the hand of Gobryas, and he received it. And then <persName>Cyrus</persName> gave Hystaspas many splendid gifts to send to the young lady. But Chrysantas he drew to himself and kissed him.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;By Zeus, <persName>Cyrus</persName>,&rdquo; cried Artabazus, &ldquo;the cup which you have given me is not of the same gold as the present you have given Chrysantas!&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will give you the same gift.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the other.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Thirty years from now,&rdquo; was the answer.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;I shall wait for it, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and not die before I get it; so be getting ready.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And thus that banquet came to an end. And as they rose to depart, <persName>Cyrus</persName> also rose and escorted them to the doors.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the following day he dismissed to their<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> and the allies</note> several homes all those who had volunteered to be his allies, except such as wished to settle near him. To those who stayed he gave houses and lands which even to this day are in the possession of their descendants; these, moreover, were mostly Medes and Hyrcanians. And to those who went home he gave many presents and sent both officers and privates well contented on their way.
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Next he divided also among his own soldiers<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He divides the Lydian spoils</note> the spoil that he had obtained at <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>. To the generals and to his own aides-de-camp he gave the choicest portions&mdash;to each, according to his merit&mdash;and then distributed the rest; and in assigning to the generals their proper portions he left it to their discretion to distribute it as he had distributed to them.
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>And they apportioned all the rest, each officer examining into the merits of his subordinate officers; and what was left to the last, the corporals, inquiring into the merits of the private soldiers under their command, gave to each according to his deserts. And so all were in receipt of their fair share.
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they had received what was then given them, some spoke concerning <persName>Cyrus</persName> in this vein: &ldquo;He must be keeping an abundance himself, one would think, seeing that he has given so much to each one of us.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Abundance, indeed!&rdquo; some others would say; &ldquo;<persName>Cyrus</persName> is not of the sort to make money for himself; he takes more pleasure in giving than in keeping.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when <persName>Cyrus</persName> heard of these remarks and opinions about himself, he called together his friends and all his staff-officers and addressed them as follows: &ldquo;My friends, I have in my time seen fellows<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The use <title>vs.</title> the abuse of wealth</note> who wished to have the reputation of possessing more than they had, for they supposed that they would thus be thought fine gentlemen; but to me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it seems that such persons bring upon themselves the very reverse of what they wish. For if any man enjoy the reputation of having great wealth and do not appear to help his friends in a manner worthy of his abundance&mdash;that, it seems to me at least, fixes upon him the stigma of being a mean sort.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)leuqe/rios</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)neleuqeri/a</foreign> have both a double meaning: (1) of free or mean extraction, and (2) of free (liberal) or miserly character.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there are some who wish to keep it a secret how much they do possess. It seems to me, then, that these also are mean toward their friends. For oftentimes their friends are in need and, because they are ignorant of the truth, they say nothing to their comrades about their difficulties, and really suffer want.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;To me, however,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it seems the most straightforward way for a man to let the extent of his means be known and to strive in proportion to them to show himself a gentleman. And so I wish to show you all that I have, as far as it is possible for you to see, and to give you an account of it, in so far as it is impossible for you to see it.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With these words, he showed them many<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> exhibits his possessions</note> splendid possessions and gave them an account of those that were so stored away as not to be easily viewed. And in conclusion he said:
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>&ldquo;All this, my friends, you must consider mine no more than your own; for I have been collecting it, not that I might spend it all myself or use it up all alone (for I could not), but that I might on every occasion be able to reward any one of you who does something meritorious, and also that, if any one of you thinks he needs something, he might come to me and get whatever he happens to want.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was his speech.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When it seemed to him that affairs in <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName><note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> goes to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName></note> were sufficiently well organized for him to absent himself from the city, he began to make preparations for his journey to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> and issued instructions to the others accordingly. And as soon as he had got together in sufficient quantity, as he believed, everything that he thought he should need, he started at once.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We will relate here in how orderly a manner<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">An oriental camp</note> his train packed up, large though it was, and how quickly they reached the place where they were due. For wherever the great king encamps, all his retinue follow him to the field with their tents, whether in summer or in winter.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the very beginning <persName>Cyrus</persName> made this rule, that his tent should be pitched facing the east; and then he determined, first, how far from the royal pavilion the spearmen of his guard should have their tent; next he assigned a place on the right for the bakers, on the left for the cooks, on the right for the horses, and on the left for the rest of the pack-animals And everything else was so organized that every one knew his own place in camp&mdash;both its size and its location.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when they come to pack up again, every one gets together the things that it is his business to use and others in turn pack them upon the animals, so that the baggage-men all come at the same time to the things they were appointed to transport, and all at the same time pack the things upon their several animals. Thus the amount of time needed for striking a single tent suffices for all.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The unpacking also is managed in this same manner; and in order to have all the necessaries ready at the right time, each one has assigned to him likewise the part that he is to do. In this way the time required for doing any one part is sufficient for getting all the provisions ready.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And just as the servants in charge of the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName>'s perfect organization</note> provisions had each his proper place, so also his soldiers had when they encamped the places suitable to each sort of troops; they knew their places, too, and so all found them without the slightest friction.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For <persName>Cyrus</persName> considered orderliness to be a good thing to practise in the management of a household also; for whenever any one wants a thing, he then knows where he must go to find it; but he believed that orderliness in all the departments of an army was a much better thing, inasmuch as the chances of a successful stroke in war come and go more quickly and the losses occasioned by those who are behindhand in military matters are more serious. He also saw that the advantages gained in war by prompt attention to duty were most important. It was for this reason, therefore, that he took especial pains to secure this sort of orderliness.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Accordingly, he himself first took up his<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The arrangement of his camp</note> position in the middle of the camp in the belief that this situation was the most secure. Then came his most trusty followers, just as he was accustomed to have them about him at home, and next to them in a circle he had his horsemen and charioteers;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>for those troops also, he thought, need a secure position, because when they are in camp they do not have ready at hand any of the arms with which they fight, but need considerable time to arm, if they are to render effective service.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To the right and left from him and the cavalry was the place for the targeteers; before and behind him and the cavalry, the place for the bowmen.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The hoplites and those armed with the large shields he arranged around all the rest like a wall, so that those who could best hold their ground might, by being in front of them, make it possible for the cavalry to arm in safety, if it should be necessary.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Moreover, he had the peltasts and the bowmen sleep on their arms, like the hoplites, in order that, if there should be occasion to go into action even at night, they might be ready for it. And just as the hoplites were prepared to do battle if any one came within arm's reach of them, so these troops also were to be ready to let fly their lances and arrows over the heads of the hoplites, if any one attacked.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And all the officers had banners over their tents; and just as in the cities well-informed officials know the residences of most of the inhabitants and especially those of the most prominent citizens, so also in camp the aides under <persName>Cyrus</persName> were acquainted with the location of the various officers and were familiar with the banner of each one; and so if <persName>Cyrus</persName> wanted one of his officers, they did not have to search for him but would run to him by the shortest way.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And as every division was so well distinguished, it was much more easy to see where good order prevailed and where commands were not being executed. Therefore, as things were arranged, he believed that if any enemy were to attack him either by night or by day, the attacking party would fall into his camp as into an ambuscade.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He believed also that tactics did not consist<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> as a tactician</note> solely in being able easily to extend one's line or increase its depth, or to change it from a long column into a phalanx, or without error to change the front by a counter march according as the enemy came up on the right or the left or behind;<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">&ldquo;We learn from Aelian (<title>Tact.</title> 27) that this was either a countermarch by files (<foreign lang="greek">kata\ cula/</foreign>), in which the wings only changed places, or a countermarch by companies (<foreign lang="greek">kata\ lo/xous</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">sti/xous</foreign>) when the whole line turned and the rearguard marched in front, so that there was a change of front as well as of wings. The object of the last-named movement was to put <foreign lang="greek">tou\s krati/stous</foreign> &lsqb;the best men&rsqb; forward.&rdquo; (Holden.)</note> but he considered it also a part of good tactics to break up one's army into several divisions whenever occasion demanded, and to place each division, too, where it would do the most good, and to make speed when it was necessary to reach a place before the enemy&mdash;all these and other such qualifications were essential, he believed, to a skilful tactician, and he devoted himself to them all alike.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so on his marches he always proceeded giving out his orders with a view to existing circumstances; but in camp his arrangements were made, for the most part, as has been described.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As they continued their march and came near<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> visits his uncle</note> to Media, <persName>Cyrus</persName> turned aside to visit Cyaxares. And when they had exchanged greetings, the first thing <persName>Cyrus</persName> told Cyaxares was that a palace had been selected for him in <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, and official headquarters, so that he might occupy a residence of his own whenever he came there; and then he also gave him many splendid presents.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Cyaxares accepted them and then introduced to him his daughter, who brought him a golden crown and bracelets and a necklace and the most beautiful Median robe that could be found.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>As the princess placed the crown on<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cyaxares offers him his daughter's hand and all Media</note> <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s head, Cyaxares said, &ldquo;And the maiden herself, my own daughter, I offer you as well, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, to be your wife. Your father married my father's daughter, whose son you are. This is she whom you used often to pet when you came to visit us when you were a boy. And whenever anybody asked her whom she was going to marry, she would say &lsquo;<persName>Cyrus</persName>.&rsquo; And with her I offer you all Media as a dowry, for I have no legitimate male issue.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke, and <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered: &ldquo;Well, Cyaxares, I heartily approve of your family and your daughter and your gifts. And I desire, with the approval of my father and mother, to accept your offer.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus <persName>Cyrus</persName> answered; but still he made the young lady presents of everything that he thought would please Cyaxares as well as herself. And when he had done so, he proceeded on his way to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when, as he continued his journey, he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> arrives in <placeName key="tgn,7002205">Persepolis</placeName></note> came to the boundaries of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, he left the main body of his army there, while he went on with his friends to the capital; and he took along animals enough for all the Persians to sacrifice and make a feast, and brought with him such gifts as were appropriate for his father and mother and his friends besides and such as were suitable for the authorities and the elders and all the peers. And he gave presents also to all the Persians, men and women, such as even to this day the great king bestows whenever he comes to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Cambyses assembled the Persian elders<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Cambyses's address to his people</note> and the highest of the chief magistrates; he called in <persName>Cyrus</persName> also and then addressed them as follows: &ldquo;Toward you, my Persian friends, I cherish, as is natural, feelings of good-will, for I am your king; and no less toward you, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, for you are my son. It is right, therefore, that I should declare frankly to you what I think I recognize to be for the good of both.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;In the past you advanced the fortunes of <persName>Cyrus</persName> by giving him an army and placing him in command of it. And at its head <persName>Cyrus</persName> has with the help of the gods given you, Persians, a good report among all men and made you honoured throughout all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Of those who went with him on his campaigns he has enriched the most deserving and to the commoners he has given wages and support; and by establishing a Persian cavalry force he has made the Persians masters also of the plains.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;If, therefore, you continue to be of the same mind also in the future, you will be the cause of much good to each other. But, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, if you on your part become puffed up by your present successes and attempt to govern the Persians as you do those other nations, with a view to self-aggrandizement, or if you, fellow-citizens, become jealous of his power and attempt to depose him from his sovereignty, be sure that you will hinder one another from receiving much good.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And that this may not befall you, but the good, it seems best to me for you to perform a common sacrifice and to make a covenant, first calling the gods to witness. You, <persName>Cyrus</persName>, on your part, must covenant that if any one sets hostile foot in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> or attempts to subvert the Persian constitution, you will come to her aid with all your strength; and you, Persians, on your part, are to covenant that if any one attempts to put an end to <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s sovereignty or if any one of his subjects attempts to revolt, you will come to your own rescue as well as <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s in whatsoever way he may call upon you.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As long as I live, the Persian throne continues to be mine own. But when I am dead, it will, of course, pass to <persName>Cyrus</persName> if he survives me. And as often as he comes to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, it should be a sacred custom with you that he sacrifice on your behalf even as I do now. And when he is away, it might be well for you, I think, that that one of our family who seems to you the most worthy should perform that sacred office.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Cambyses had finished speaking, <persName>Cyrus</persName> and the Persian magistrates accepted his proposal. And as they then covenanted, with the gods as their witnesses, so the Persians and their king still continue to this day to act toward one another. And when this had all been completed, <persName>Cyrus</persName> took his departure.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When, on his way back, he came to Media,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> marries his cousin</note> <persName>Cyrus</persName> wedded the daughter of Cyaxares, for he had obtained the consent of his father and mother. And to this day people still tell of her wonderful beauty. &lt;But some historians say that he married his mother's sister. But that maid must certainly have been a very old maid.&gt; And when he was married he at once departed with his bride for <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, he decided to send<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> institutes satrapies</note> out satraps to govern the nations he had subdued. But the commanders of the garrisons in the citadels and the colonels in command of the guards throughout the country he wished to be responsible to no one but himself. This provision he made with the purpose that if any of the satraps, on the strength of the wealth or the men at their command, should break out into open insolence or attempt to refuse obedience, they might at once find opposition in their province.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In the wish, therefore, to secure this result, he resolved first to call together his chief officers and inform them in advance, so that when they went they might know on what understanding they were going; for he believed that if he did so, they would take it more kindly; whereas he thought that they might take it ill, if any of them discovered the conditions after being installed as satraps, for then they would think that this policy had been adopted from distrust of them personally.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And so he called them together and spoke as follows:<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My friends, we have in the subjugated states garrisons with their officers, whom we left behind there at the time; and when I came away I left them with orders not to trouble themselves with any business other than to hold the forts. These, therefore, I will not remove from their positions, for they have carried out my instructions faithfully; but I have decided to send satraps there, besides, to govern the people, receive the tribute, pay the militia, and attend to any other business that needs attention.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>I have further decided that any of you<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The duties and privileges of satraps</note> who remain here, and to whom I may occasionally give the trouble of going on business for me to those nations, shall have lands and houses there; so that they may have tribute paid to them here and, whenever they go there, they may lodge in residences of their own.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus he spoke, and to many of his friends he gave houses and servants in the various states which he had subdued. And even to this day those properties, some in one land, some in another, continue in the possession of the descendants of those who then received them, while the owners themselves reside at court.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; <persName>Cyrus</persName> resumed, &ldquo;we must take care that those who go as satraps to such countries shall be men of the right sort, who will bear in mind to send back here what there is good and desirable in their several provinces, in order that we also who remain here may have a share of the good things that are to be found everywhere. And that will be no more than fair; for if any danger threatens anywhere, it is we who shall have to ward it off.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With these words he concluded his address on<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> appoints the satraps</note> that occasion; and then he chose out from the number of his friends those whom he saw eager to go on the conditions named and who seemed to him best qualified, and sent them as satraps to the following countries: Megabyzus to <placeName key="tgn,1012700">Arabia</placeName>, Artabatas to <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, Artacamas to Phrygia Major, Chrysantas to <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>, Adusius to <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName> (it was he for whom the Carians had petitioned), and Pharnuchus to <placeName key="tgn,5004216">Aeolia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> on the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>.

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as <persName>Cyrus</persName> then effected his organization, even so unto this day all the garrisons under the king are kept up, and all the courts of the governors are attended with service in the same way; so all households, great and small, are managed; and by all men in authority the most deserving of their guests are given preference with seats of honour; all the official journeying are conducted on the same plan and all the political business is centralized in a few heads of departments.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he had told them how they should proceed to carry out his instructions, he gave each one a force of soldiers and sent them off; and he directed them all to make preparations, with the expectation that there would be an expedition the next year and a review of the men, arms, horses, and chariots.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We have noticed also that this regulation is<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Plans adopted for the visitation of the provinces</note> still in force, whether it was instituted by <persName>Cyrus</persName>, as they affirm, or not: year by year a man makes the circuit of the provinces with an army, to help any satrap that may need help, to humble any one that may be growing rebellious, and to adjust matters if any one is careless about seeing the taxes paid or protecting the inhabitants, or to see that the land is kept under cultivation, or if any one is neglectful of anything else that he has been ordered to attend to; but if he cannot set it right, it is his business to report it to the king, and he, when he hears of it, takes measures in regard to the offender. And those of whom the report often goes out that &ldquo;the king's son is coming,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the king's brother&rdquo; or &ldquo;the king's eye,&rdquo; these belong to the circuit commissioners; though sometimes they do not put in an appearance at all, for each of them turns back, wherever he may be, when the king commands.

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>They say, moreover, that sometimes this express does not stop all night, but the night-messengers succeed the day-messengers in relays, and when that is the case, this express, some say, gets over the ground faster than the cranes. If their story is not literally true, it is at all events undeniable that this is the fastest overland travelling on earth; and it is a fine thing to have immediate intelligence of everything, in order to attend to it as quickly as possible.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, when the year had gone round, he<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> completes his conquests</note> collected his army together at <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, containing, it is said, about one hundred and twenty thousand horse, about two thousand scythe-bearing chariots and about six hundred thousand foot.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And when these had been made ready for him, he started out on that expedition on which he is said to have subjugated all the nations that fill the earth from where one leaves <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> even to the <placeName key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName>.

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>From that time on his empire was bounded on the east by the <placeName key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName>, on the north by the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName>, on the west by <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and on the south by <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName>. The extremes of his empire are uninhabitable, on the one side because of the heat, on another because of the cold, on another because of too much water, and on the fourth because of too little.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><persName>Cyrus</persName> himself made his home in the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He locates his residences</note> centre of his domain, and in the winter season he spent seven months in <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, for there the climate is warm; in the spring he spent three months in <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>, and in the height of summer two months in <placeName key="tgn,7002115">Ecbatana</placeName>. By so doing, they say, he enjoyed the warmth and coolness of perpetual spring-time.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>People, moreover, were so devoted to him<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His personal popularity</note> that those of every nation thought they did themselves an injury if they did not send to <persName>Cyrus</persName> the most valuable productions of their country, whether the fruits of the earth, or animals bred there, or manufactures of their own arts; and every city did the same. And every private individual thought he should become a rich man if he should do something to please <persName>Cyrus</persName>. And his theory was correct; for <persName>Cyrus</persName> would always accept that of which the givers had an abundance, and he would give in return that of which he saw that they were in want.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When his life was far spent amid such achievements<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The passing of <persName>Cyrus</persName></note> and <persName>Cyrus</persName> was now a very old man, he came back for the seventh time in his reign to <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. His father and his mother were in the course of nature long since dead; so <persName>Cyrus</persName> performed the customary sacrifice and led the Persians in their national dance and distributed presents among them all, as had been his custom.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As he slept in the palace, he saw a vision: a<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He is warned in a vision</note> figure of more than human majesty appeared to him in a dream and said: &ldquo;Make ready,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Literally &ldquo;Be packing up&rdquo;; cf.

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Accordingly, he at once took victims and offered sacrifice in the high places to ancestral Zeus, to Helius, and to the rest of the gods, even as the Persians are wont to make sacrifice; and as he sacrificed, he prayed, saying: &ldquo;O<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His prayer</note> ancestral Zeus and Helius and all the gods, accept these offerings as tokens of gratitude for help in achieving many glorious enterprises; for in omens in the sacrifice, in signs from heaven, in the flight of birds, and in ominous words, ye ever showed me what I ought to do and what I ought not to do. And I render heartfelt thanks to you that I have never failed to recognize your fostering care and never in my successes entertained proud thoughts transcending human bounds. And I beseech of you that ye will now also grant prosperity and happiness to my children, my wife, my friends, and my country, and to me myself an end befitting the life that ye have given me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then after he had concluded his rites and come home, he thought he would be glad to rest and so lay down; and when the hour came, those whose office it was came in and bade him go to his bath. But he told them that he was resting happily. And then again, when the hour came, those whose office it was set dinner before him. But his soul had no desire for food, but he seemed thirsty and drank with pleasure.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And when the same thing befell him on the next day and the day after that, he summoned his sons; for they had accompanied him, as it chanced, and were still in <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. He summoned also his friends and the Persian magistrates; and when they were all come, he began to speak as follows:
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;My sons, and all you my friends about me,<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His last words</note> the end of my life is now at hand; I am quite sure of this for many reasons; and when I am dead, you must always speak and act in regard to me as of one blessed of fortune. For when I was a boy, I think I<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He reviews his life</note> plucked all the fruits that among boys count for the best; when I became a youth, I enjoyed what is accounted best among young men; and when I became a mature man, I had the best that men can have. And as time went on, it seemed to me that I recognized that my own strength was always increasing with my years, so that I never found my old age growing any more feeble than my youth had been; and, so far as I know, there is nothing that I ever attempted or desired and yet failed to secure.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Moreover, I have lived to see my friends made<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His services</note> prosperous and happy through my efforts and my enemies reduced by me to subjection; and my country, which once played no great part in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, I now leave honoured above all. Of all my conquests, there is not once that I have not maintained. Throughout the past I have fared even as I have wished; but a fear that was ever at my side, lest in the time to come I might see or hear or experience something unpleasant, would not let me become overweeningly proud or extravagantly happy.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But now, if I die, I leave you, my sons, whom the gods have given me, to survive me, and I leave my friends and country happy;
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>and so why should I not be justly accounted blessed and enjoy an immortality of fame?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But I must also declare my will about the disposition<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He defines the succession</note> of my throne, that the succession may not become a matter of dispute and cause you trouble. Now, I love you both alike, my sons; but precedence in counsel and leadership in everything that may be thought expedient, that I commit to the first born, who naturally has a wider experience.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>I, too, was thus trained by my country and yours to give precedence to my elders&mdash;not merely to brothers but to all fellow-citizens&mdash;on the street, in the matter of seats, and in speaking; and so from the beginning, my children, I have been training you also to honour your elders above yourselves and to be honoured above those who are younger. Take what I say, therefore, as that which is approved by time, by custom, and by the law.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>So you, Cambyses, shall have the throne, the gift of the gods and of myself, in so far as it is mine to give.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;To you, Tanaoxares, I give the satrapy of Media, <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, and, in addition to those two, Cadusia. And in giving you this office, I consider that I leave to your older brother greater power and the title of king, while to you I leave a happiness disturbed by fewer cares;
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>for I cannot see what human pleasure you will lack; on the contrary, everything that is thought to bring pleasure to man will be yours. But to set one's heart on more difficult undertakings, to be cumbered with many cares, and to be able to find no rest, because spurred on by emulation of what I have done, to lay plots and to be plotted against, all that must necessarily go hand in hand with royal power more than with your station; and, let me assure you, it brings many interruptions to happiness.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;As for you, Cambyses, you must also know<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">His words of counsel&mdash;(1) to Cambyses;</note> that it is not this golden sceptre that maintains your empire; but faithful friends are a monarch's truest and surest sceptre. But do not think that man is naturally faithful; else all men would find the same persons faithful, just as all find the other properties of nature the same. But every one must create for himself faithfulness in his friends; and the winning of such friends comes in no wise by compulsion, but by kindness.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>If, then, you shall endeavour to make others also fellow-guardians of your sovereignty, make a beginning nowhere sooner than with him who is of the same blood with yourself. Fellow-citizens, you know, stand nearer than foreigners do, and messmates nearer than those who eat elsewhere; but those who are sprung from the same seed, nursed by the same mother, reared in the same home, loved by the same parents, and who address the same persons as father and mother, how are they not the closest of all?
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Do not you two, therefore, ever make of no effect those blessings whereby the gods have led the way to knitting close the bonds between brothers, but do you build at once upon that foundation still other works of love; and thus the love between you will always be a love that no other men can ever surpass. Surely he that has forethought for his brother is taking care for himself; for to whom else is a brother's greatness more of an honour than to a brother? And who else will be honoured by the power of a great man so much as that man's brother? And if a man's brother is a great man, whom will any one so much fear to injure as that man's brother?
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Therefore, Tanaoxares, let no one more<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">(2) to Tanaoxares</note> readily than yourself yield obedience to your brother or more zealously support him. For his fortunes, good or ill, will touch no one more closely than yourself. And bear this also in mind: whom could you favour in the hope of getting more from him than from your brother? Where could you lend help and get in return a surer ally than you would find in him? Whom would it be a more shameful thing for you not to love than your own brother? And who is there in all the world whom it would be a more noble thing to prefer in honour than your brother? It is only a brother, you know, Cambyses, whom, if he holds the first place of love in his brother's heart, the envy of others cannot reach.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Nay by our fathers' gods I implore you, my sons, honour one another, if you care at all to give me pleasure. For assuredly, this one thing, so it<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes"><persName>Cyrus</persName> on the immortality of the soul</note> seems to me, you do not know clearly, that I shall have no further being when I have finished this earthly life; for not even in this life have you seen my soul, but you have detected its existence by what it accomplished.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Have you never yet observed what terror the souls of those who have been foully dealt with strike into the hearts of those who have shed their blood, and what avenging deities they send upon the track of the wicked? And do you think that the honours paid to the dead would continue, if their souls had no part in any of them?
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>I am sure I do not; nor yet, my sons, have I ever convinced myself of this&mdash;that only as long as it is contained in a mortal body is the soul alive, but when it has been freed from it, is dead; for I see that it is the soul that endues mortal bodies with life, as long as it is in them.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>Neither have I been able to convince myself of this&mdash;that the soul will want intelligence just when it is separated from this unintelligent body; but when the spirit is set free, pure and untrammelled by matter, then it is likely to be most intelligent. And when man is resolved into his primal elements, it is clear that every part returns to kindred matter, except the soul; that alone cannot be seen, either when present or when departing.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Consider again,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that there is nothing in the world more nearly akin to death than is sleep; and the soul of man at just such times is revealed in its most divine aspect and at such times, too, it looks forward into the future; for then, it seems, it is most untrammelled by the bonds of the flesh.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now if this is true, as I think it is, and if the<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He preaches the doctrine of reverence</note> soul does leave the body, then do what I request of you and show reverence for my soul. But if it is not so, and if the soul remains in the body and dies with it, then at least fear the gods, eternal, all-seeing, omnipotent, who keep this ordered universe together, unimpaired, ageless, unerring, indescribable in its beauty and its grandeur; and never allow yourselves to do or purpose anything wicked or unholy.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Next to the gods, however, show respect also to all the race of men as they continue in perpetual succession; for the gods, do not hide you away in darkness, but your works must ever live on in the sight of all men; and if they are pure and untainted with unrighteousness, they will make your power manifest among all mankind. But if you conceive any unrighteous schemes against each other, you will forfeit in the eyes of all men your right to be trusted. For no one would be able any longer to trust you&mdash;not even if he very much desired to do so&mdash;if he saw either of you wronging that one who has the first claim to the other's love.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now, if I am giving you sufficient instructions as to what manner of men you ought to be one towards the other&mdash;well and good; if not, then you must learn it from the history of the past, for this is the best source of instruction. For, as a rule, parents have always been friends to their children, brothers to their brothers; but ere now some of them have been at enmity one with another. Whichever, therefore, of these two courses you shall find to have been profitable, choose that, and you would counsel well.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But of this, perhaps, enough.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Now as to my body, when I am dead, my<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">He gives directions for his burial</note> sons, lay it away neither in gold nor in silver nor in anything else, but commit it to the earth as soon as may be. For what is more blessed than to be united with the earth, which brings forth and nourishes all things beautiful and all things good? I have always been a friend to man, and I think I should gladly now become a part of that which does him so much good.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;But I must conclude,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for my soul seems to me to be slipping away from those parts of my body, from which, as it appears, it is wont to begin its departure. So if any one wishes to take my hand or desires to look into my face while I yet live, let him come near; but after I have covered myself over, I beg of you, my children, let no one look upon my body, not even yourselves.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Invite, however, all the Persians and our allies to my burial, to joy with me in that I shall henceforth be in security such that no evil can ever again come nigh me, whether I shall be in the divine presence or whether I shall no longer have any being; and to all those who come show all the courtesies that are usual in honour of a man that has been blessed of fortune, and then dismiss them.
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>&ldquo;Remember also this last word of mine,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;if you do good to your friends, you will also be able to punish your enemies. And now farewell, my children, and say farewell to your mother as from me. And to all my friends, both present and absent, I bid farewell.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After these words, he shook hands with them all, covered himself over, and so died.&lt;
<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s empire was the greatest and most<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The empire and its disintegration</note> glorious of all the kingdoms in Asia&mdash;of that it may be its own witness. For it was bounded on the east by the <placeName key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName>, on the north by the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName>, on the west by <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and on the south by <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName>. And although it was of such magnitude, it was governed by the single will of <persName>Cyrus</persName>; and he honoured his subjects and cared for them as if they were his own children; and they, on their part, reverenced <persName>Cyrus</persName> as a father.
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Still, as soon as <persName>Cyrus</persName> was dead, his children at once fell into dissension, states and nations began to revolt, and everything began to deteriorate. And that what I say is the truth, I will prove, beginning with the Persians' attitude toward religion.lgt;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I know, for example, that in early times the kings and their officers, in their dealings with even the worst offenders, would abide by an oath that they might have given, and be true to any pledge they might have made.
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For had they not had such a<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The decline in moral standards</note> character for honour, and had they not been true to their reputation, not a man would have trusted them, just as not a single person any longer trusts them, now that their lack of character is notorious; and the generals of the Greeks who joined the expedition of <persName>Cyrus</persName> the Younger would not have had such confidence in them even on that occasion. But, as it was, trusting in the previous reputation of the Persian kings, they placed themselves in the king's power, were led into his presence, and had their heads cut off. And many also of the barbarians who joined that expedition went to their doom, some deluded by one promise, others by another.
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But at the present time they are still worse, as the following will show: if, for example, any one in the olden times risked his life for the king, or if any one reduced a state or a nation to submission to him, or effected anything else of good or glory for him, such an one received honour and preferment; now, on the other hand, if any one seems to bring some advantage to the king by evil-doing, whether as Mithradates did, by betraying his own father Ariobarzanes, or as a certain Rheomithres did, in violating his most sacred oaths and leaving his wife and children and the children of his friends behind as hostages in the power of the king of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName><note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Tachos; see Index, s.v. Ariobarzanes.</note>&mdash;such are the ones who now have the highest honours heaped upon them.
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Witnessing such a state of morality, all the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> have been turned to wickedness and wrong-doing. For, whatever the character of the rulers is, such also that of the people under them for the most part becomes. In this respect they are now even more unprincipled than before.
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In money matters, too, they are more dishonest<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Financial dishonesty</note> in this particular: they arrest not merely those who have committed many offences, but even those who have done no wrong, and against all justice compel them to pay fines; and so those who are supposed to be rich are kept in a state of terror no less than those who have committed many crimes, and they are no more willing than malefactors are to come into close relations with their superiors in power; in fact, they do not even venture to enlist in the royal army.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Accordingly, owing to their impiety toward the gods and their iniquity toward man, any one who is engaged in war with them can, if he desire, range up and down their country without having to strike a blow. Their principles in so far, therefore, are in every respect worse now than they were in antiquity.
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the next place, as I will now show, they do<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Physical deterioration</note> not care for their physical strength as they used to do/. For example, it used to be their custom neither to spit nor to blow the nose. It is obvious that they observed this custom not for the sake of saving the moisture in the body, but from the wish to harden the body by labour and perspiration. But now the custom of refraining from spitting or blowing the nose still continues, but they never give themselves the trouble to work off the moisture in some other direction.
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In former times it was their custom also to eat but once in the day, so that they might devote the whole day to business and hard work. Now, to be sure, the custom of eating but once a day still prevails, but they begin to eat at the hour when those who breakfast earliest begin their morning meal, and they keep on eating and drinking until the hour when those who stay up latest go to bed.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They had also the custom of not bringing pots into their banquets, evidently because they thought that if one did not drink to excess, both mind and body would be less uncertain. So even now the custom of not bringing in the pots still obtains, but they drink so much that, instead of carrying anything in, they are themselves carried out when they are no longer able to stand straight enough to walk out.
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, this also was a native custom of theirs, neither to eat nor drink while on a march, nor yet to be seen doing any of the necessary consequences of eating or drinking. Even yet that same abstinence prevails, but they make their journeys so short that no one would be surprised at their ability to resist those calls of nature.
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, in times past they used to go out<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Decline of the old disciplines</note> hunting so often that the hunts afforded sufficient exercise for both men and horses. But since Artaxerxes and his court became the victims of wine, they have neither gone out themselves in the old way nor taken the others out hunting; on the contrary, if any one often went hunting with his friends out of sheer love for physical exertion, the courtiers would not hide their jealousy and would hate him as presuming to be a better man than they.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, it is still the custom for the boys to be educated at court; but instruction and practice in horsemanship have died out, because there are no occasions on which they may give an exhibition and win distinction for skill. And while anciently the boys used there to hear cases at law justly decided and so to learn justice, as they believed&mdash;that also has been entirely reversed; for now they see all too clearly that whichever party gives the larger bribe wins the case.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The boys of that time used also to learn the properties of the products of the earth, so as to avail themselves of the useful ones and keep away from those that were harmful. But now it looks as if they learned them only in order to do as much harm as possible; at any rate, there is no place where more people die or lose their lives from poisons than there.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Furthermore, they are much more effeminate now than they were in <persName>Cyrus</persName>'s day. For at that time they still adhered to the old discipline and the old abstinence that they received from the Persians, but adopted the Median garb and Median luxury; now, on the contrary, they are allowing the rigour of the Persians to die out, while they keep up the effeminacy of the Medes.
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I should like to explain their effeminacy more<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The effeminacy of the orientals</note> in detail. In the first place, they are not satisfied with only having their couches upholstered with down, but they actually set the posts of their beds upon carpets, so that the floor may offer no resistance, but that the carpets may yield. Again, whatever sorts of bread and pastry for the table had been discovered before, none of all those have fallen into disuse, but they keep on always inventing something new besides; and it is the same way with meats; for in both branches of cookery they actually have artists to invent new dishes.
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, in winter they are not satisfied with having clothing on their heads and bodies and legs, but they must have also sleeves thickly lined to the very tips of their fingers, and gloves besides. In summer, on the other hand, they are not satisfied with the shade afforded by the trees and rocks, but amid these they have people stand by them to provide artificial shade.
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They take great pride also in having as many cups as possible; but they are not ashamed if it transpire that they came by them by dishonest means, for dishonesty and sordid love of gain have greatly increased among them.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Furthermore, it was of old a national custom<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The modern knighthood</note> not to be seen going anywhere on foot; and that was for no other purpose than to make themselves as knightly as possible. But now they have more coverings upon their horses than upon their beds, for they do not care so much for knighthood as for a soft seat.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And so is it not to be expected that in military prowess they should be wholly inferior to what they used to be? In times past it was their national custom that those who held lands should furnish cavalrymen from their possessions and that these, in case of war, should also take the field, while those who performed outpost duty in defence of the country received pay for their services. But now the rulers make knights out of their porters, bakers, cooks, cup-bearers, bath-room attendants, butlers, waiters, chamberlains who assist them in retiring at night and in rising in the morning, and beauty-doctors who pencil their eyes and rouge their cheeks for them and otherwise beautify them; these are the sort that they make into knights to serve for pay for them.
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>From such recruits, therefore, a host is obtained, but they are of no use in war; and that is clear from actual occurrences: for enemies may range up and down their land with less hindrance than friends.
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> For <persName>Cyrus</persName> had abolished skirmishing at a distance, had armed both horses and men with breastplates, had put a javelin into each man's hand, and had introduced the method of fighting hand to hand. But now they neither skirmish at a distance any longer, nor yet do they fight in a hand-to-hand engagement.
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>The infantry still have their wicker<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Inefficiency of infantry and chariots</note> shields and bills and sabres, just as those had who set the battle in array in the times of <persName>Cyrus</persName>; but not even they are willing to come into a hand-to-hand conflict.
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Neither do they employ the scythed chariot any longer for the purpose for which <persName>Cyrus</persName> had it made. For he advanced the charioteers to honour and made them objects of admiration and so had men who were ready to hurl themselves against even a heavy-armed line. The officers of the present day, however, do not so much as know the men in the chariots, and they think that untrained drivers will be just as serviceable to them as trained charioteers.
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Such untrained men do indeed charge, but before they penetrate the enemy's lines some of them are unintentionally thrown out, some of them jump out on purpose, and so the teams without drivers often create more havoc on their own side than on the enemy's.
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>However, inasmuch as even they<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">The barbarian helpless without Greek soldiers</note> understand what sort of material for war they have, they abandon the effort; and no one ever goes to war any more without the help of Greek mercenaries, be it when they are at war with one another or when the Greeks make war upon them; but even against Greeks they recognize that they can conduct their wars only with the assistance of Greeks.
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think now that I have accomplished the task<note resp="Loeb" type="Com" anchored="yes">Conclusion</note> that I set before myself. For I maintain that I have proved that the Persians of the present day and those living in their dependencies are less reverent toward the gods, less dutiful to their relatives, less upright in their dealings with all men, and less brave in war than they were of old. But if any one should entertain an opinion contrary to my own, let him examine their deeds and he will find that these testify to the truth of my statements. &gt;</p></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
