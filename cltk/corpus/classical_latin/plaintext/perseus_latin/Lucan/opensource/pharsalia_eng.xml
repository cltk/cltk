Probably the five years known as the Golden Era of Nero had passed when they were written: yet the text itself does not aid such a suggestion; and the view generally taken, namely that Lucan was in earnest, appears preferable. There were many who dreamed at the time that the disasters of the Civil War were being compensated by the wealth and prosperity of the empire under Nero; and the assurance of universal peace, then almost realised, which is expressed in lines 69-71, seems inconsistent with the idea that this passage was written in irony. Lecky ('European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne,' vol. i. p. 240) describes these latter verses as written 'with all the fervour of a <placeName key="tgn,2000780">Christian</placeName> poet.' See also Merivale's ' Roman Empire,'chapter liv.</note></l>

<l n="tr">Such were the hidden motives of the chiefs;</l>

<l n="tr">Scarce fitly fashioned; poverty was scorned,</l>
<l n="tr">Fruitful of warriors; and from all the world</l>
<l n="tr">Came that which ruins nations; while the fields</l>
<l n="tr">Furrowed of yore by great <placeName key="tgn,2068320">Camillus</placeName>' plough,</l>
<l n="tr">Or by the mattock which a Curius held,</l>
<l n="tr">Lost their once narrow bounds, and widening tracts</l>
<l n="tr">By hinds unknown were tilled. No nation this</l>

<l n="tr">Then covetous usury rose, and interest</l>

<l n="tr">Caesar has crossed the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName>, his mighty soul</l>

<l n="tr">Now on the marge of <placeName key="tgn,1129218">Rubicon</placeName>, he saw,</l>
<l n="tr">In face most sorrowful and ghostly guise,</l>
<l n="tr">His trembling country's image; huge it seemed</l>
<l n="tr">Through mists of night obscure; and hoary hair</l>
<l n="tr">Streamed from the lofty front with turrets crowned:</l>
<l n="tr">Torn were her locks and naked were her arms.</l>
<l n="tr">Then thus, with broken sighs the Vision spake:</l>

<l n="tr">No further dare.' But Caesar's hair was stiff</l>
<l n="tr">With horror as he gazed, and ghastly dread</l>
<l n="tr">Restrained his footsteps on the further bank.</l>
<l n="tr">Then spake he, ' Thunderer, who from the rock</l>

Dean Merivale remarks (chapter li.) on this passage, that in the despair of another life which pervaded Paganism at the time, the Roman was exasperated at the Druids' assertion of the transmigration ofsouls. But the passage seems also to betray a lingering suspicion that the doctrine may in some shape be true, however horrible were the rites and sacrifices. The reality of a future life was a part of Lucan's belief, as a state of reward for heroes. (See the passage at the beginning of Book IX.)  But all was vague and uncertain, and he appears to have viewed the Druidical transmigration rather with doubt and unbelief, as a possible form of future or recurring life, than with scorn as an absurdity.</note>  when the war was done,</l>

<l n="tr">To risk his life, his all, as not for self</l>

<l n="tr">Such was his creed. To him a sumptuous feast</l>

<l n="tr">While aught remained to do. Now in his grasp</l>
<l n="tr">Lay all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>;-but while Magnus stayed</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the utmost shore, his grieving soul</l>
<l n="tr">Deemed all was shared with him. Yet he essayed</l>
<l n="tr">Escape to hinder, and with labour vain</l>
<l n="tr">Piled in the greedy main gigantic rocks:</l>
<l n="tr">Mountains of earth down to the sandy depths</l>
<l n="tr">Were swallowed by the vortex of the sea;</l>
<l n="tr">Just as if <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> and its lofty top</l>
<l n="tr">Were cast into the deep, yet not a speck</l>
<l n="tr">Should mark the watery plain; or Gaurus huge</l>
<l n="tr">Split from his summit to his base, were plunged</l>
<l n="tr">In fathomless Avernus' stagnant pool.</l>
<l n="tr">The billows thus unstemmed, 'twas Caesar's will</l>
<l n="tr">To hew the stately forests and with trees</l>
<l n="tr">Enchained to form a rampart. Thus of old</l>
<l n="tr">(If fame be true) the boastful Persian king</l>
<l n="tr">Prepared a way across the rapid strait</l>
<l n="tr">'Twixt Sestos and <placeName key="tgn,6000030">Abydos</placeName>, and made one</l>
<l n="tr">The European and the Trojan shores;</l>
<l n="tr">And marched upon the waters, wind and storm</l>
<l n="tr">Counting as nought, but trusting his emprise</l>
<l n="tr">To one frail bridge, so that his ships might pass</l>
<l n="tr">Through middle <placeName key="tgn,7002722">Athos</placeName>. Thus a mighty mole</l>
<l n="tr">Of fallen forests grew upon the waves,</l>
<l n="tr">Free until then, and lofty turrets rose,</l>
<l n="tr">And land usurped the entrance to the main.</l>
<l n="tr">This when Pompeius saw, with anxious care</l>
<l n="tr">His soul was filled; yet hoping to regain</l>
<l n="tr">The exit lost, and win a wider world</l>
<l n="tr">Wherein to wage the war, on chosen ships</l>
<l n="tr">He hoists the sails; these, driven by the wind</l>
<l n="tr">Which filled the bellying sails, not once nor twice</l>
<l n="tr">Scattered the beams asunder; and at night</l>
<l n="tr">Not seldom engines, worked by stalwart arms,</l>
<l n="tr">Flung flaming torches forth. But when the time</l>
<l n="tr">For secret flight was come, no sailor shout</l>
<l n="tr">Rang on the shore, no trumpet marked the hour,</l>
<l n="tr">No clarion called the armament to sea.</l>
<l n="tr">Already shone the Virgin in the sky</l>
<l n="tr">Leading the Scorpion in her course, whose claws</l>
<l n="tr">Foretell the rising Sun, when noiseless all</l>
<l n="tr">They cast the vessels loose; no song was heard</l>
<l n="tr">To greet the anchor wrenched from stubborn sand;</l>
<l n="tr">No captain's order, when the lofty mast</l>
<l n="tr">Was raised, or yards were bent; a silent crew</l>
<l n="tr">Drew down the sails which hung upon the ropes,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor shook the mighty cables, lest the wind</l>
<l n="tr">Should sound upon them. But the chief, in prayer,</l>
<l n="tr">Thus spake to Fortune: ' Thou whose high decree</l>
<l n="tr">Has made us exiles from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>'s shores,</l>
<l n="tr">Grant us at least to leave them.' Yet the fates</l>
<l n="tr">Hardly permitted, for a murmur vast</l>
<l n="tr">Came from the ocean, as the countless keels</l>
<l n="tr">Furrowed the waters, and with ceaseless splash</l>
<l n="tr">The parted billows rose again and fell.</l>
<l n="tr">Then were the gates thrown wide; for with the fates</l>
<l n="tr">The city turned to Caesar: and the foe,</l>
<l n="tr">Seizing the town, rushed onward by the pier</l>
<l n="tr">That circled in the harbour; then they knew</l>
<l n="tr">With shame and sorrow that the fleet was gone</l>
<l n="tr">And held the open: and Pompeius' flight</l>
<l n="tr">Gave a poor triumph.    Yet was narrower far</l>
<l n="tr">The channel which gave access to the sea</l>
<l n="tr">Than that Euboean strait <note anchored="yes">It seems that the Euripus was bridged over. (Mr. Haskins' note.)</note>  whose waters lave</l>
<l n="tr">The shore by <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>. Here two ships stuck fast</l>
<l n="tr">Alone, of all the fleet; the fatal hook</l>
<l n="tr">Grappled their decks and drew them to the land,</l>
<l n="tr">And the first bloodshed of the civil war</l>
<l n="tr">Here left a blush upon the ocean wave.</l>
<l n="tr">As when the famous ship <note anchored="yes">The '<placeName key="tgn,1094163">Argo</placeName>.'</note>  sought <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName>' stream</l>
<l n="tr">The rocky gates closed in and hardly gripped</l>
<l n="tr">Her flying stern; then from the empty sea</l>
<l n="tr">The cliffs rebounding to their ancient seat</l>
<l n="tr">Were fixed to move no more. But now the steps</l>
<l n="tr">Of morn approaching tinged the eastern sky</l>
<l n="tr">With roseate hues: the Pleiades were dim,</l>
<l n="tr">The wagon of the Charioteer grew pale,</l>
<l n="tr">The planets faded, and the silvery star</l>
<l n="tr">Which ushers in the day, was lost in light.</l>
<l n="tr">Thou, Magnus, hold'st the deep; yet not the same</l>
<l n="tr">Now are thy fates, as when from every sea</l>
<l n="tr">Thy fleet triumphant swept the pirate pest.</l>
<l n="tr">Tired of thy conquests, Fortune now no more</l>
<l n="tr">Shall smile upon thee. With thy spouse and sons,</l>
<l n="tr">Thy household gods, and peoples in thy train,</l>
<l n="tr">Still great in exile, in a distant land</l>
<l n="tr">Thou seek'st thy fated fall; not that the gods,</l>
<l n="tr">Wishing to rob thee of a Roman grave,</l>
<l n="tr">Decreed the strands of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> for thy tomb:</l>
<l n="tr">'Twas Italy they spared, that far away</l>
<l n="tr">Fortune on shores remote might hide her crime,</l>
<l n="tr">And Roman soil be pure of Magnus' blood.

<l n="tr">Yet in one breast the spirit of Freedom rose</l>

<l n="tr">With rapid step burst in between the ranks</l>

It is not unlikely that they piled their weapons before being so measured, and Lucan's account would then be made to agree with that of Herodotus.

<l n="tr">Of all their giant trunks: for as the mound</l>
<l n="tr">On earth and brushwood stood, a timber frame</l>
<l n="tr">Held firm the soil, lest pressed beneath its towers</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">The mass might topple down.
<milestone n="399" unit="card"/></l>
<l part="F" n="tr">There stood a grove</l>
<l n="tr">Which from the earliest time no hand of man</l>
<l n="tr">Had dared to violate; hidden from the sun<note anchored="yes">See note to Book I., 508.</note></l>
<l n="tr">Its chill recesses; matted boughs entwined</l>
<l n="tr">Prisoned the air within. No sylvan nymphs</l>
<l n="tr">Here found a home, nor Pan, but savage rites</l>
<l n="tr">And barbarous worship, altars horrible</l>
<l n="tr">On massive stones upreared; sacred with blood</l>
<l n="tr">Of men was every tree. If faith be given</l>
<l n="tr">To ancient myth, no fowl has ever dared</l>
<l n="tr">To rest upon those branches, and no beast</l>
<l n="tr">Has made his lair beneath: no tempest falls,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor lightnings flash upon it from the cloud.</l>
<l n="tr">Stagnant the air, unmoving, yet the leaves</l>
<l n="tr">Filled with mysterious trembling; dripped the streams</l>
<l n="tr">From coal-black fountains; effigies of gods</l>
<l n="tr">Rude, scarcely fashioned from some fallen trunk</l>
<l n="tr">Held the mid space: and, pallid with decay,</l>
<l n="tr">Their rotting shapes struck terror. Thus do men</l>
<l n="tr">Dread most the god unknown. 'Twas said that caves</l>
<l n="tr">Rumbled with earthquakes, that the prostrate yew</l>
<l n="tr">Rose up again; that fiery tongues of flame</l>
<l n="tr">Gleamed in the forest depths, yet were the trees</l>
<l n="tr">Unkindled; and that snakes in frequent folds</l>
<l n="tr">Were coiled around the trunks. Men flee the spot</l>
<l n="tr">Nor dare to worship near: and e'en the priest</l>
<l n="tr">Or when bright Phoebus holds the height, or when</l>
<l n="tr">Dark night controls the heavens, in anxious dread</l>
<l n="tr">Draws near the grove and fears to find its lord.</l>
<l n="tr">Spared in the former war, still dense it rose</l>
<l n="tr">Where all the hills were bare, and Caesar now</l>
<l n="tr">Its fall commanded. But the brawny arms</l>
<l n="tr">Which swayed the axes trembled, and the men,</l>
<l n="tr">Awed by the sacred grove's dark majesty,</l>
<l n="tr">Held back the blow they thought would be returned.</l>
<l n="tr">This Caesar saw, and swift within his grasp</l>
<l n="tr">Uprose a ponderous axe, which downward fell</l>
<l n="tr">Cleaving a mighty oak that towered to heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">While thus he spake: ' Henceforth let no man dread</l>
<l n="tr">'To fell this forest : all the crime is mine.</l>
<l n="tr">'This be your creed.' He spake, and all obeyed,</l>
<l n="tr">For Caesar's ire weighed down the wrath of Heaven.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet ceased they not to fear. Then first the oak,</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>'s ancient boast; the knotty holm;</l>
<l n="tr">The cypress, witness of patrician grief,</l>
<l n="tr">The buoyant alder, laid their foliage low</l>
<l n="tr">Admitting day; though scarcely through the stems</l>
<l n="tr">Their fall found passage. At the sight the Gauls</l>
<l n="tr">Grieved; but the garrison within the walls</l>
<l n="tr">Rejoiced: for thus shall men insult the gods</l>
<l n="tr">And find no punishment?  Yet fortune oft</l>
<l n="tr">Protects the guilty; on the poor alone</l>
<l n="tr">The gods can vent their ire. Enough hewn down,</l>
<l n="tr">They seize the country wagons; and the hind,</l>
<l n="tr">His oxen gone which else had drawn the plough,</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Mourns for his harvest.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">But the eager chief</l>
<l n="tr">Impatient of the combat by the walls</l>
<l n="tr">Carries the warfare to the furthest west.</l>
<l n="tr">Meanwhile a giant mound, on star-shaped wheels</l>
<l n="tr">Concealed, they fashion, crowned with double towers</l>
<l n="tr">High as the battlements, by cause unseen</l>
<l n="tr">Slow creeping onwards; while amazed the foe</l>
<l n="tr">Beheld, and thought some subterranean gust</l>
<l n="tr">Had burst the caverns of the earth and forced</l>
<l n="tr">The nodding pile aloft, and wondered sore</l>
<l n="tr">Their walls should stand unshaken. From its height</l>
<l n="tr">Hissed down the weapons; but the Grecian bolts</l>
<l n="tr">WVith greater force were on the Romans hurled;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor by the arm unaided, for the lance</l>
<l n="tr">Urged by the catapult resistless rushed</l>
<l n="tr">Through arms and shield and flesh, and left a death</l>
<l n="tr">Behind, nor stayed its course : and massive stones</l>
<l n="tr">Cast by the beams of mighty engines fell;</l>
<l n="tr">As from the mountain top some time-worn rock</l>
<l n="tr">At length by winds dislodged, in all its track</l>
<l n="tr">Spreads ruin vast: nor crushed the life alone</l>
<l n="tr">Forth from the body, but dispersed the limbs</l>
<l n="tr">In fragments undistinguished and in blood.</l>
<l n="tr">But as protected by the armour shield</l>
<l n="tr">The might of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> drew nigh beneath the wall</l>
<l n="tr">(The front rank with their bucklers interlaced</l>

<l n="tr">Behind their backs, nor could the toiling Greeks</l>
<l n="tr">Deflect their engines, throwing still the bolts</l>
<l n="tr">Far into space; but from the rampart top</l>
<l n="tr">Flung ponderous masses down. Long as the shields</l>
<l n="tr">Held firm together, like to hail that falls</l>
<l n="tr">Harmless upon a roof, so long the stones</l>
<l n="tr">Crushed down innocuous; but as the blows</l>
<l n="tr">Rained fierce and ceaseless and the Romans tired,</l>
<l n="tr">Some here and there sank fainting. Next the roof</l>
<l n="tr">Moves on with earth besprinkled: underneath</l>
<l n="tr">The ram conceals his head, which, poised and swung,</l>
<l n="tr">They dash with mighty force upon the wall,</l>
<l n="tr">Covered themselves with mantlets. Though the head</l>
<l n="tr">Light on the lower stones, yet as the shock</l>
<l n="tr">Falls and refalls, from battlement to base</l>
<l n="tr">The rampart soon shall topple. But by balks</l>
<l n="tr">And rocky fragments overwhelmed, and flames,</l>
<l n="tr">The roof at length gives way; and worn with toil</l>
<l n="tr">All spent in vain, the wearied troops withdraw</l>
<l n="tr">And seek the shelter of their tents again.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus far to hold their battlements was all</l>
<l n="tr">The Greeks had hoped; now, venturing attack,</l>
<l n="tr">With glittering torches for their arms, by night</l>
<l n="tr">Fearless they sallied forth: nor lance they bear</l>
<l n="tr">Nor deadly bow, nor shaft;  for fire alone</l>
<l n="tr">Is now their weapon. Through the Roman works</l>
<l n="tr">Driven by the wind the conflagration spread:</l>
<l n="tr">Nor did the newness of the wood make pause</l>
<l n="tr">The fury of the flames, which, fed afresh</l>
<l n="tr">By living torches, 'neath a smoky pall</l>
<l n="tr">Leaped on in fiery tongues. Not wood alone</l>
<l n="tr">But stones gigantic crumbling into dust</l>
<l n="tr">Dissolved beneath the heat; the mighty mound</l>
<l n="tr">Lay prone, yet in its ruin larger seemed.
<milestone n="509" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="tr">Next, conquered on the land, upon the main</l>
<l n="tr">They try their fortunes. On their simple craft</l>
<l n="tr">No painted figure-head adorned the bows</l>
<l n="tr">Nor claimed protection from the gods; but rude,</l>
<l n="tr">Just as they fell upon their mountain homes,</l>
<l n="tr">The trees were knit together, and the deck</l>
<l n="tr">Gave steady foot-hold for an ocean fight.</l>

<l n="tr">Boys not yet grown to war, and aged men,</l>
<l n="tr">Armed for the conflict, with their all at stake.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor only did they marshal for the fight</l>
<l n="tr">Ships meet for service; but their ancient keels</l>
<l n="tr">Brought from the dockyards. When the morning rays</l>
<l n="tr">Broke from the waters, and the sky was clear,</l>
<l n="tr">And all the winds were still upon the deep,</l>
<l n="tr">Smoothed for the battle, swift on either part</l>
<l n="tr">The fleets essay the open;  and the ships</l>
<l n="tr">Tremble beneath the oars that urge them on,</l>
<l n="tr">By sinewy arms impelled. Upon the wings</l>
<l n="tr">That bound the Roman fleet, the larger craft</l>
<l n="tr">With triple and quadruple banks of oars</l>
<l n="tr">Gird in the lesser: so they front the sea;</l>
<l n="tr">While in their rear, shaped as a crescent moon,</l>
<l n="tr">Liburnian galleys follow. Over all</l>
<l n="tr">Towers Brutus' deck praetorian. Oars on oars</l>
<l n="tr">Propel the bulky vessel through the main,</l>
<l n="tr">Six ranks; the topmost strike the waves afar.</l>
<l n="tr">When such a space remained between the fleets</l>
<l n="tr">As could be covered by a single stroke,</l>
<l n="tr">Innumerable voices rise in air</l>
<l n="tr">Drowning with resonant din the beat of oars</l>
<l n="tr">And note of trumpet summoning: and all</l>
<l n="tr">Sit on the benches and with mighty stroke</l>
<l n="tr">Sweep o'er the sea and gain the space between.</l>
<l n="tr">Then crashed the prows together, and the keels</l>
<l n="tr">Rebounded backwards, and unnumbered darts</l>
<l n="tr">Or darkened all the sky or, in their fall,</l>
<l n="tr">The vacant ocean. As the wings grew wide,</l>
<l n="tr">Less densely packed the fleet, some Grecian ships</l>
<l n="tr">Pressed in between; as when with west and east</l>
<l n="tr">The tide contends, this way the waves are driven</l>
<l n="tr">And that the sea; so as they plough the deep</l>
<l n="tr">In various lines converging, what the prow</l>
<l n="tr">Throws up advancing, from the foemen's oars</l>
<l n="tr">Falls back repelled. But soon the Grecian fleet</l>
<l n="tr">Was handier found in battle, and in flight</l>
<l n="tr">Pretended, and in shorter curves could round;</l>
<l n="tr">More deftly governed by the guiding helm :</l>
<l n="tr">While on the Roman side their steadier keels</l>
<l n="tr">Gave vantage, as to men who fight on land.</l>
<l n="tr">Then Brutus to the pilot of his ship:</l>
<l n="tr">' Dost suffer them to range the wider deep,</l>
<l n="tr">'Contending with the foe in naval skill?</l>
<l n="tr">' Draw close the war and drive us on the prows</l>
<l n="tr">'Of these Phocaeans.' Him the pilot heard;</l>
<l n="tr">And turned his vessel slantwise to the foe.</l>
<l n="tr">Then was the sea all covered with the war:</l>
<l n="tr">Then Grecian ships attacking Brutus found</l>
<l n="tr">Their ruin in the stroke, and vanquished lay</l>
<l n="tr">Beside his bulwarks; with curved hooks and chains</l>
<l n="tr">The foe they grapple, by entangled oars</l>
<l n="tr">Themselves held back. And now no outstretched arm</l>
<l n="tr">Hurls forth the javelin, but sword in hand</l>
<l n="tr">They wage a naval fight: each from his ship</l>
<l n="tr">Leans forward to the stroke, and falls when slain</l>
<l n="tr">Upon a foeman's deck. Deep flows the stream</l>
<l n="tr">Of purple slaughter to the foamy main :</l>
<l n="tr">By piles of floating corpses are the sides,</l>
<l n="tr">Though grappled, kept asunder. Some, half dead,</l>
<l n="tr">Plunge in the ocean, gulping down the brine</l>
<l n="tr">Encrimsoned with their blood; some lingering still</l>
<l n="tr">Draw their last struggling breath amid the wreck</l>
<l n="tr">Of broken navies: weapons which have missed</l>
<l n="tr">Find yet their victims, and the falling steel</l>
<l n="tr">Fails not in middle deep to deal the wound.</l>
<l n="tr">One vessel circled by Phocaean keels</l>
<l n="tr">Divides her strength, and on the right and left</l>
<l n="tr">On either side with equal war contends;</l>
<l n="tr">On whose high poop while <placeName key="tgn,7016546">Tagus</placeName> fighting gripped</l>
<l n="tr">The stern Phocaean, pierced his back and breast</l>
<l n="tr">Two fatal weapons; in the midst the steel</l>
<l n="tr">Met, and the blood, uncertain whence to flow,</l>
<l n="tr">Stood still, arrested, till with double course</l>
<l n="tr">Forth by a sudden gush it drove each dart,</l>
<l n="tr">And sent the life abroad through either wound.</l>
<l n="tr">Here fated Telon also steered his ship:</l>
<l n="tr">No pilot's hand upon an angry sea</l>
<l n="tr">More deftly ruled a vessel. Well he knew,</l>
<l n="tr">Or by the sun or crescent moon, how best</l>
<l n="tr">To set his canvas fitted for the breeze</l>
<l n="tr">The coming hours would bring. His rushing stem</l>
<l n="tr">Shattered a Roman vessel: but a dart</l>
<l n="tr">Hurled at the moment quivered in his breast.</l>
<l n="tr">He falls, and in the fall his dying hand</l>
<l n="tr">Diverts the prow. Then Gyareus, in act</l>
<l n="tr">To climb the friendly deck, by javelin pierced,</l>
<l n="tr">Still as he hung, by the retaining steel</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Fast to the side was nailed.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Twin brethren stand</l>
<l n="tr">A fruitful mother's pride; with different fates,</l>
<l n="tr">But ne'er distinguished till death's savage hand</l>
<l n="tr">Struck once, and ended error: he that lived,</l>
<l n="tr">Cause of fresh anguish to their sorrowing souls,</l>
<l n="tr">Called ever to the weeping parents back</l>
<l n="tr">The image of the lost: who, as the oars</l>
<l n="tr">Grecian and Roman mixed their teeth oblique,</l>
<l n="tr">Grasped with his dexter hand the Roman ship;</l>
<l n="tr">When fell a blow that shore his arm away.</l>
<l n="tr">So died, upon the side it held, the hand,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor loosed its grasp in death. Yet with the wound</l>
<l n="tr">His noble courage rose, and maimed he dared</l>
<l n="tr">Renew the fray, and stretched across the sea</l>
<l n="tr">To grasp the lost-in vain! another blow</l>
<l n="tr">Lopped arm and hand alike. Nor shield nor sword</l>
<l n="tr">Henceforth are his. Yet even now he seeks</l>
<l n="tr">No sheltering hold, but with his chest advanced</l>
<l n="tr">Before his brother armed, he claims the fight,</l>
<l n="tr">And holding in his breast the darts which else</l>
<l n="tr">Had slain his comrades, pierced with countless spears,</l>
<l n="tr">He falls in death well earned; yet ere his end</l>
<l n="tr">Collects his parting life, and all his strength</l>
<l n="tr">Strains to the utmost and with failing limbs</l>
<l n="tr">Leaps on the foeman's deck; by weight alone</l>
<l n="tr">Injurious; for streaming down with gore</l>
<l n="tr">And piled on high with corpses, while her sides</l>
<l n="tr">Sounded to ceaseless blows, the fated ship</l>
<l n="tr">Let in the greedy brine until her ways</l>
<l n="tr">Were level with the waters-then she plunged</l>
<l n="tr">In whirling eddies downwards-and the main</l>
<l n="tr">First parted, then closed in upon its prey.</l>
<l n="tr">Full many wondrous deaths, with fates diverse,</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the sea in that day's fight befell.

<l n="tr">Had Lycidas been whelmed in middle deep;</l>
<l n="tr">But by his feet his comrades dragged him back,</l>
<l n="tr">And rent in twain he hung; nor slowly flowed</l>
<l n="tr">As from a wound the blood; but all his veins <note anchored="yes">According to some these were the lines which Lucan recited while bleeding to death; according to others, those at Book ix., line 948.</note></l>
<l n="tr">Were torn asunder and the stream of life</l>
<l n="tr">Gushed o'er his limbs till lost amid the waves.</l>
<l n="tr">From no man dying has the vital breath</l>
<l n="tr">Rushed by so wide a path; the lower trunk</l>
<l n="tr">Succumbed to death, but with the lungs and heart</l>
<l n="tr">Long strove the fates, and hardly won the whole.</l>
<l n="tr">While, bent upon the fight, an eager crew</l>
<l n="tr">Were gathered to the margin of their deck</l>
<l n="tr">(Leaving the upper side as bare of foes),</l>
<l n="tr">Their ship was overset. Beneath the keel</l>
<l n="tr">Which floated upwards, prisoned in the sea,</l>
<l n="tr">And powerless by spread of arms to float</l>
<l n="tr">The main, they perished. One who haply swam</l>
<l n="tr">Amid the battle, chanced upon a death</l>
<l n="tr">Strange and unheard of; for two meeting prows</l>
<l n="tr">Transfixed his body. At the double stroke</l>
<l n="tr">Wide yawns his chest; blood issues from his mouth</l>
<l n="tr">With flesh commingled; and the brazen beaks</l>
<l n="tr">Resounding clash together, by the bones</l>
<l n="tr">Unhindered: now they part and through the gap</l>
<l n="tr">Swift pours the sea and drags the corse below.</l>
<l n="tr">Next, of a shipwrecked crew, the larger part</l>
<l n="tr">Struggling with death upon the waters, reached</l>
<l n="tr">A comrade bark; but when with elbows raised</l>
<l n="tr">They seized upon the bulwarks and the ship</l>
<l n="tr">Rolled, nor could bear their weight, the ruthless crew</l>
<l n="tr">Hacked off their straining arms; then maimed they sank</l>
<l n="tr">Below the seething waves, to rise no more.</l>
<l n="tr">Now every dart was hurled and every spear,</l>
<l n="tr">The soldier weaponless; yet their rage found arms:</l>
<l n="tr">One hurls an oar; another's brawny arm</l>
<l n="tr">Tugs at the twisted stern; or from the seats</l>
<l n="tr">The oarsmen driving, swings a bench in air.</l>
<l n="tr">The ships are broken for the fight. They seize</l>
<l n="tr">The fallen dead and snatch the sword that slew.</l>
<l n="tr">Nay, many from their wounds, frenzied for arms,</l>
<l n="tr">Pluck forth the deadly steel, and pressing still</l>
<l n="tr">Upon their yawning sides, hurl forth the spear</l>
<l n="tr">Back to the hostile ranks from which it came;</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Then ebbs their life blood forth.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">But deadlier yet</l>
<l n="tr">Was that fell force most hostile to the sea;</l>
<l n="tr">For, thrown in torches and in sulphurous bolts</l>
<l n="tr">Fire all-consuming ran among the ships,</l>
<l n="tr">Whose oily timbers soaked in pitch and wax</l>
<l n="tr">Inflammable, gave welcome to the flames.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor could the waves prevail against the blaze</l>
<l n="tr">Which claimed as for its own the fragments borne</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the waters. Lo! on burning plank</l>
<l n="tr">One hardly 'scapes destruction; one to save</l>
<l n="tr">His flaming ship, gives entrance to the main.</l>
<l n="tr">Of all the forms of death each fears the one</l>
<l n="tr">That brings immediate dying: yet quail not</l>
<l n="tr">Their hearts in shipwreck : from the waves they pluck</l>
<l n="tr">The fallen darts and furnishing the ships</l>
<l n="tr">Essay the feeble stroke; and should that hope</l>
<l n="tr">Still fail their hand, they call the sea to aid</l>
<l n="tr">And seizing in their grasp some floating foe</l>
<l n="tr">Drag him to mutual death.   But on that day</l>
<l n="tr">Phoceus above all others proved his skill.</l>
<l n="tr">Well trained was he to dive beneath the main</l>
<l n="tr">And search the waters with unfailing eye;</l>
<l n="tr">And should an anchor 'gainst the straining rope</l>
<l n="tr">Too firmly bite the sands, to wrench it free.</l>
<l n="tr">Oft in his fatal grasp he seized a foe</l>
<l n="tr">Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone.</l>
<l n="tr">Such was his frequent deed; but this his fate:</l>
<l n="tr">For rising, victor (as he thought), to air,</l>
<l n="tr">Full on a keel he struck and found his death.</l>
<l n="tr">Some, drowning, seized a hostile oar and checked</l>
<l n="tr">The flying vessel; not to die in vain,</l>
<l n="tr">Their single care; some on their vessel's side</l>
<l n="tr">Hanging, in death, with wounded frame essayed</l>
<l n="tr">To check the charging prow.   Tyrrhenus high</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the bulwarks of his ship was struck</l>
<l n="tr">By leaden bolt from Balearic sling</l>
<l n="tr">Of Lygdamus; straight through his temples passed</l>
<l n="tr">The fated missile; and in streams of blood</l>
<l n="tr">Forced from their seats his trembling eyeballs fell.</l>
<l n="tr">Plunged in a darkness as of night, he thought</l>
<l n="tr">That life had left him; yet ere long he knew</l>
<l n="tr">The living vigour of his limbs; and cried,</l>
<l n="tr">'Place me, O friends, as some machine of war</l>
<l n="tr">Straight facing towards the foe; then shall my darts</l>
<l n="tr">Strike as of old; and thou, Tyrrhenus, spend</l>
<l n="tr">Thy latest breath, still left, upon the fight:</l>
<l n="tr">So shalt thou play, not wholly dead, the part</l>
<l n="tr">That fits a soldier, and the spear that strikes</l>
<l n="tr">Thy frame, shall miss the living.' Thus he spake,</l>
<l n="tr">And hurled his javelin, blind, but not in vain;</l>
<l n="tr">For Argus, generous youth of noble blood,</l>
<l n="tr">Below the middle waist received the spear</l>
<l n="tr">And falling drave it home. His aged sire</l>
<l n="tr">From furthest portion of the conquered ship</l>
<l n="tr">Beheld; than whom in pride of manhood none</l>
<l n="tr">More brave in battle: now no more he fought,</l>
<l n="tr">Yet did the memory of his prowess stir</l>
<l n="tr">Phocaean youths to emulate his fame.</l>
<l n="tr">Oft stumbling o'er the benches the old man hastes</l>
<l n="tr">To reach his boy, and finds him breathing still.</l>
<l n="tr">No tear bedewed his cheek; upon his breast</l>
<l n="tr">No blow he struck;  but all his frame was stiff,</l>
<l n="tr">His hands outspread : and o'er his eyes there fell</l>
<l n="tr">A dark impenetrable veil of mist</l>
<l n="tr">That blotted out the day; nor could he more</l>
<l n="tr">Discern his luckless Argus. He, who saw</l>
<l n="tr">His parent, raising up his drooping head</l>
<l n="tr">With parted lips and silent features asks</l>
<l n="tr">A father's latest kiss, a father's hand</l>
<l n="tr">To close his dying eyes. But soon his sire,</l>
<l n="tr">Recovering from his swoon, when ruthless grief</l>
<l n="tr">Possessed his spirit, 'This short space,' he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">' I lose not, which the cruel gods have given,</l>
<l n="tr">' But die before thee. Grant thy sorrowing sire</l>
<l n="tr">' Forgiveness that he fled thy last embrace.</l>
<l n="tr">Not yet has passed thy life blood from the wound</l>

<l n="tr">Drew round a hasty trench; his foremost rank</l>
<l n="tr">With close array concealing those who wrought.</l>
<l n="tr">Then with the morn he bids them seize the hill</l>
<l n="tr">Which parted from the camp <placeName key="tgn,7007789">Ilerda</placeName>'s walls,</l>
<l n="tr">And gave them safety. But in fear and shame</l>
<l n="tr">On rushed the foe and seized the vantage ground,</l>
<l n="tr">First in the onset. From the height they held</l>
<l n="tr">Their hopes of conquest; but to Caesar's men</l>
<l n="tr">Their hearts by courage stirred, and their good swords</l>
<l n="tr">Promised the victory. Burdened up the ridge</l>

<l n="tr">The failing foothold, and the falchion's edge</l>
<l n="tr">Hewed out their upward path. But Caesar saw</l>
<l n="tr">Ruin impending, and he bade his horse</l>
<l n="tr">By circuit to the left, with shielded flank,</l>
<l n="tr">Hold back the foe. Thus gained his troops retreat,</l>
<l n="tr">For none pressed on them; and the victor chiefs,</l>
<l n="tr">Forced to withdrawal, gained the day in vain.</l>
<l n="tr">Henceforth the fitful changes of the year</l>

<l n="tr">In masses huge convolved; the widest breadth</l>

<l n="tr">Earth from the heavens; till pressed by weight of sky</l>
<l n="tr">In densest volume to the earth they pour</l>
<l n="tr">Their cataracts; no lightning could endure</l>

<l n="tr">Find not discharge; and from the very banks</l>
<l n="tr">Each stream receives a torrent.  Caesar's arms</l>
<l n="tr">Are shipwrecked on the field, his tottering camp</l>
<l n="tr">Swims on the rising flood; the trench is filled</l>
<l n="tr">With whirling waters; and the plain no more</l>

<l n="tr">Fierce at the door; and while no foe blockades</l>
<l n="tr">The soldier hungers; fortunes buy not now</l>
<l n="tr">The meanest measure; yet, alas!  is found</l>
<l n="tr">The fasting peasant, who, in gain of gold,</l>
<l n="tr">Will sell his little all!  And now the hills</l>
<l n="tr">Are seen no more; rivers in one vast sea</l>
<l n="tr">Of whirlpools overwhelmed; beasts borne away</l>
<l n="tr">And sucked beneath the stream; their rocky dens</l>
<l n="tr">Sweep onwards; and the torrent's raging force</l>
<l n="tr">Bears back the inflowing ocean. Nor does night</l>
<l n="tr">Acknowledge Phoebus' rise, for all the sky</l>
<l n="tr">Feels her dominion and obscures its face,</l>
<l n="tr">And darkness joins with darkness. Thus doth lie</l>
<l n="tr">The lowest earth beneath the snowy zone</l>
<l n="tr">And never-ending winters, where the sky</l>
<l n="tr">Is starless ever, and no growth of herb</l>

<l n="tr">Second in place, Neptunus, load the air</l>
<l n="tr">With clouds continual; forbid the tide,</l>
<l n="tr">Once risen, to return : forced by thy waves</l>
<l n="tr">Let rivers backward run in different course,</l>

<l n="tr">Unmeasured waters: melt Rhipaean snows:</l>
<l n="tr">Spread lakes upon the land, and seas profound,</l>
<l n="tr">And snatch the groaning world from civil war.

<l n="tr">Thus for a little moment Fortune tried</l>
<l n="tr">Her darling son; then smiling to his part</l>
<l n="tr">Returned; and gained her pardon for the past</l>
<l n="tr">By greater gifts to come. For now the air</l>
<l n="tr">Had grown more clear, and Phoebus' warmer rays</l>
<l n="tr">Coped with the flood and scattered all the clouds</l>
<l n="tr">In fleecy masses; and the reddening east</l>
<l n="tr">Proclaimed the coming day; the land resumed</l>
<l n="tr">Its ancient marks; no more in middle air</l>
<l n="tr">The moisture hung, but from about the stars</l>
<l n="tr">Sank to the depths; the forest glad upreared</l>
<l n="tr">Its foliage; hills again emerged to view</l>
<l n="tr">And 'neath the warmth of day the plains grew firm.</l>
<l n="tr">When Sicoris kept his banks, the shallop light</l>
<l n="tr">Of hoary willow bark they build, which bent</l>
<l n="tr">On hides of oxen, bears the weight of man</l>
<l n="tr">And swims the torrent.  Thus on sluggish Po</l>
<l n="tr">Venetians float; and on th' encircling sea <note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Fuso</foreign>: either spacious, outspread; or, poured into the land (referring to the estuaries) as Mr. Haskins prefers; or, poured round the island.  Portable leathern skiffs seem to have been in common use in Caesar's time in the <placeName key="tgn,7005239">English Channel</placeName>. These were the rowing boats of the Gauls.(Mommsen, vol. iv., 219.)</note></l>
<l n="tr">Are borne <placeName key="tgn,7008591">Britannia</placeName>'s nations; and when <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">Fills all the land, are <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName>' thirsty reeds</l>
<l n="tr">Shaped into fragile boats that swim his waves.</l>
<l n="tr">The further bank thus gained, they haste to curve</l>
<l n="tr">The fallen forest, and to form the arch</l>
<l n="tr">By which imperious Sicoris shall be spanned.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet fearing he might rise in wrath anew,</l>
<l n="tr">Not on the nearest marge they place the beams,</l>
<l n="tr">But in mid-field.  Thus the presumptuous stream</l>
<l n="tr">They tame with chastisement, parting his flood</l>
<l n="tr">In devious channels out; and curb his pride.</l>
<l n="tr">Petreius, seeing that all things gave way</l>
<l n="tr">To Caesar's destiny, leaves <placeName key="tgn,7007789">Ilerda</placeName>'s steep,</l>
<l n="tr">His trust no longer in the Roman world;</l>
<l n="tr">And seeks for strength amid those distant tribes,</l>
<l n="tr">Who, loving death, rush in upon the foe,<note anchored="yes">Compare Book I., 520.</note></l>
<l n="tr">And win their conquests at the point of sword.</l>
<l n="tr">But in the dawn, when Caesar saw the camp</l>
<l n="tr">Stand empty on the hill, ' To arms! ' he cries:</l>
<l n="tr">' No bridge nor ford; but stem with brawny arms</l>
<l n="tr">' The foaming river.' Rushing to the fray</l>
<l n="tr">They dare the torrent they had feared in flight.</l>
<l n="tr">Their arms regained, they race until the blood</l>
<l n="tr">Throbs in their veins anew, and their wet limbs</l>
<l n="tr">Are warm again. At length the shadows fall</l>
<l n="tr">Short on the sward, and day is at the height.</l>
<l n="tr">Then dash the horsemen on, and hold the foe</l>
<l n="tr">'Twixt flight and battle. In the plain arose</l>
<l n="tr">Two rocky heights: from each a loftier ridge</l>
<l n="tr">Of hills ranged onwards, sheltering in their midst</l>
<l n="tr">A hollow vale, whose deep and winding paths</l>
<l n="tr">Were safe from warfare; which, when Caesar saw</l>
<l n="tr">That if Petreius held, the war must pass</l>
<l n="tr">To lands remote by savage tribes possessed;</l>
<l n="tr">'Speed on,' he cries, ' and meet their flight in front;</l>
<l n="tr">'Fierce be your frown and battle in your glance:</l>
<l n="tr">' No coward's death be theirs; but as they flee</l>
<l n="tr">'Plunge in their breasts the sword.' They seize the pass</l>
<l n="tr">And place their camp. Short was the span between</l>
<l n="tr">Th' opposing sentinels; with eager eyes</l>
<l n="tr">Undimmed by space, they gazed on brothers, sons,</l>
<l n="tr">Or friends and fathers; and within their souls</l>
<l n="tr">They grasped the impious horror of the war.<note anchored="yes">Compare the passage in Tacitus, 'Hist.,' ii., 45, in which the historian
describes how the troops of Otho and Vitellius wept over each other after
the battle and deplored the miseries of a civil war. <quote lang="la">'Victi victoresque in
lacrumas effusi, sortem civilium armorum misera latitia detestantes.'</quote></note></l>
<l n="tr">Yet for a little while no voice was heard,</l>
<l n="tr">For fear restrained; by waving blade alone</l>
<l n="tr">Or gesture, spake they; but their passion grew,</l>
<l n="tr">And broke all discipline; and soon they leap</l>
<l n="tr">The hostile rampart; every hand outstretched</l>
<l n="tr">Embraces hand of foeman, palm in palm;</l>
<l n="tr">One calls by name his neighbour, one his host,</l>
<l n="tr">Another with his schoolmate talks again</l>
<l n="tr">Of olden studies: he who in the camp</l>
<l n="tr">Found not a comrade, was no son of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">Wet are their arms with tears, and sobs break in</l>
<l n="tr">Upon their kisses; each, unstained by blood,</l>
<l n="tr">Dreads what he might have done. Why beat thy breast?</l>
<l n="tr">Why, madman, weep?  The guilt is thine alone</l>
<l n="tr">To do or to abstain. Dost fear the man</l>
<l n="tr">Who takes his title to be feared from thee?</l>
<l n="tr">When Caesar's trumpets sound the call to arms</l>
<l n="tr">Heed not the summons; when thou seest advance</l>
<l n="tr">His standards, halt. The civil Fury thus</l>
<l n="tr">Shall fold her wings; and in a private robe</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Caesar shall love his kinsman.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Holy Love</l>
<l n="tr">Who sway'st the universe, whose firm embrace</l>
<l n="tr">Binds the compacted fabric of the world;</l>
<l n="tr">Come, gentle Concord! these our times <note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Saecula nostra</foreign> may refer either to Lucan's own time or to the moment arrived at in the poem; or it may, as Francken suggests, have a more general meaning.</note>  do now</l>
<l n="tr">For good or evil destiny control</l>
<l n="tr">The coming centuries!  Ah, cruel fate!</l>
<l n="tr">Now have the people lost their cloak for crime:</l>
<l n="tr">Their hope of pardon. They have known their kin.</l>
<l n="tr">Woe for the respite given by the gods</l>
<l n="tr">Making more black the hideous guilt to come!</l>
<l n="tr">Now all was peaceful, and in either camp</l>
<l n="tr">Sweet converse held the soldiers; on the grass</l>
<l n="tr">They place the meal, and pour the mingled cup;</l>
<l n="tr">Bright glows the turf upon the friendly fire;</l>
<l n="tr">On mutual couch with stories of their fights,</l>
<l n="tr">They while the sleepless hours in talk away;</l>
<l n="tr">'Where stood the ranks arrayed, from whose right hand</l>
<l n="tr">The quivering lance was sped:' and while they boast,</l>
<l n="tr">Or challenge, deeds of prowess in the war,</l>
<l n="tr">Faith is renewed and trust. Thus envious fate</l>
<l n="tr">Made worse their doom, and all the crimes to be</l>
<l n="tr">Grew with their love.   For when Petreius knew</l>
<l n="tr">The treaties made, himself and all his camp</l>
<l n="tr">Sold to the foe, he stirred his guard to work</l>
<l n="tr">An impious slaughter: the defenceless foe</l>
<l n="tr">Flung headlong forth: and parted fond embrace</l>
<l n="tr">By stroke of weapon and in streams of blood.</l>
<l n="tr">And thus in words of wrath, to stir the war:</l>
<l n="tr">'Of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> forgetful, to your faith forsworn!</l>
<l n="tr">'And could ye not with victory gained return,</l>
<l n="tr">'Restorers of her liberty, to Rome?</l>
<l n="tr">'Lose then! but losing call not Caesar lord.</l>
<l n="tr">'While still your swords are yours, with blood to shed</l>
<l n="tr">'In doubtful battle, while the fates are hid,</l>
<l n="tr">'Will you like cravens to your master bear</l>
<l n="tr">'Doomed eagles?  Will you ask upon your knees</l>
<l n="tr">'That Caesar deign to treat his slaves alike,</l>
<l n="tr">'And spare, forsooth, like yours, your leaders' lives?<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Petenda est?</foreign> -- is it fit that you should beg for the lives of your leaders?  Mr. Haskins says, 'shall you have to beg for them?' But it means that to do so is the height of disgrace.</note></l>
<l n="tr">'Nay! never shall our safety be the price</l>
<l n="tr">'Of base betrayal! Not for boon of life</l>
<l n="tr">'We wage a civil war. This name of peace</l>
<l n="tr">'Drags us to slavery. Ne'er from depths of earth,</l>
<l n="tr">'Fain to withdraw her wealth, should toiling men</l>
<l n="tr">'Draw store of iron; ne'er entrench a town;</l>
<l n="tr">'Ne'er should the war-horse dash into the fray</l>
<l n="tr">'Nor fleet with turret bulwarks breast the main,</l>
<l n="tr">If freedom ever could for peace be sold,</l>
<l n="tr">And fame unsoiled: 'tis true our foes are sworn</l>
<l n="tr">To cursed crime; should you whose cause is just,</l>
<l n="tr">And who may hope for pardon in defeat,</l>
<l n="tr">Hold cheap your honour? Shame upon your peace!</l>
<l n="tr">Thou callest, Magnus, ignorant of fate,</l>
<l n="tr">From all the world thy powers, and dost entreat</l>
<l n="tr">Monarchs of distant realms, while haply here</l>
<l n="tr">We in our treaties bargain for thy-life!  '</l>
<l n="tr">Thus did he stir their minds and rouse anew</l>
<l n="tr">The love of impious battle. So when beasts</l>
<l n="tr">Grown strange to forests, long confined in dens,</l>
<l n="tr">Their fierceness lose, and learn to bear with man;</l>
<l n="tr">Once should they taste of blood, their thirsty jaws</l>
<l n="tr">Swell at the touch, and all the ancient rage</l>
<l n="tr">Comes back upon them till they hardly spare</l>
<l n="tr">Their keeper. Thus they rush on every crime:</l>
<l n="tr">And blows which dealt in blindness of affray</l>
<l n="tr">Might seem the crimes of chance, or of the gods</l>
<l n="tr">Wreaking their hate, such recent vows of love</l>
<l n="tr">Made monstrous, horrid. Where they lately spread</l>
<l n="tr">The mutual couch and banquet, and embraced</l>
<l n="tr">Some new-found friend, now falls the fatal blow</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the self-same breast; and though at first</l>
<l n="tr">Groaning at the fell chance, they drew the sword;</l>
<l n="tr">Hate rises as they strike, the murderous arm</l>
<l n="tr">Confirms the doubtful will: in dreadful joy</l>
<l n="tr">Through the wild camp they smote their kinsmen down;</l>
<l n="tr">And carnage raged unchecked; and each man strove,</l>
<l n="tr">Proud of his crime, before his leader's face</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">To prove his shamelessness of guilt.
<milestone n="254" unit="card"/></l>
<l part="F" n="tr">But thou,</l>
<l n="tr">Caesar, though losing of thy best, dost know</l>
<l n="tr">The gods do favour thee. Thessalian fields</l>
<l n="tr">Gave thee no better fortune, nor the waves</l>
<l n="tr">That lave <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Massilia</placeName>; nor on Pharos' main</l>
<l n="tr">Didst thou so triumph. By this crime alone</l>
<l n="tr">Thou from this moment of the better cause</l>
<l n="tr">Shalt be the Captain.</l>
<l n="tr">Since the troops were stained</l>
<l n="tr">With foulest slaughter thus, their leaders shunned</l>
<l n="tr">All camps with Caesar's joined, and sought again</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,7007789">Ilerda</placeName>'s lofty walls; but Caesar's horse</l>
<l n="tr">Seized on the plain and forced them to the hills</l>
<l n="tr">Reluctant. There by steepest trench shut in,</l>
<l n="tr">He cuts them from the river, nor permits</l>
<l n="tr">Their circling ramparts to enclose a spring.</l>
<l n="tr">By this dread path Death trapped his captive prey.</l>
<l n="tr">Which when they knew, fierce anger filled their souls,</l>
<l n="tr">And took the place of fear. They slew the steeds</l>
<l n="tr">Now useless grown, and rushed upon their fate;</l>
<l n="tr">Hopeless of life and flight. But Caesar cried:</l>
<l n="tr">Hold back your weapons, soldiers, from the foe,</l>
<l n="tr">Strike not the breast advancing; let the war</l>
<l n="tr">' Cost me no blood; he falls not without price</l>
<l n="tr">' Who with his life-blood challenges the fray.</l>
<l n="tr">Scorning their own base lives and hating light,</l>
<l n="tr">To Caesar's loss they rush upon their death,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor heed our blows. But let this frenzy pass,</l>
<l n="tr">This madman onset; let the wish for death</l>
<l n="tr">Die in their souls.' Thus to its embers shrank</l>
<l n="tr">The fire within, when battle was denied,</l>
<l n="tr">And fainter grew their rage until the night</l>
<l n="tr">Drew down her starry veil and sank the sun.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus keener fights the gladiator whose wound</l>
<l n="tr">Is recent, while the blood within the veins</l>
<l n="tr">Still gives the sinews motion, ere the skin</l>
<l n="tr">Shrinks on the bones: but as the victor stands</l>
<l n="tr">His fatal thrust achieved, and points the blade</l>
<l n="tr">Unfaltering, watching for the end, there creeps</l>
<l n="tr">Torpor upon the limbs, the blood congeals</l>
<l n="tr">About the gash, more faintly throbs the heart,</l>
<l n="tr">And slowly fading, ebbs the life away.</l>
<l n="tr">Raving for water now they dig the plain</l>
<l n="tr">Seeking for hidden fountains, not with spade</l>
<l n="tr">And mattock only searching out the depths,</l>
<l n="tr">But with the sword; they hack the stony heights,</l>
<l n="tr">In shafts that reach the level of the plain.</l>
<l n="tr">No further flees from light the pallid wretch</l>
<l n="tr">Who tears the bowels of the earth for gold.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet neither riven stones revealed a spring,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor streamlet whispered from its hidden source;</l>
<l n="tr">No water trickled on the gravel bed,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor dripped within the cavern. Worn at length</l>
<l n="tr">With labour huge, they crawl to light again,</l>
<l n="tr">After such toil to fall to thirst and heat</l>
<l n="tr">The readier victims: this was all they won.</l>
<l n="tr">All food they loathe; and 'gainst their deadly thirst</l>
<l n="tr">Call famine to their aid. Damp clods of earth</l>
<l n="tr">They squeeze upon their mouths with straining hands.</l>
<l n="tr">Wherever on foulest mud some stagnant slime</l>
<l n="tr">Or moisture lies, each dying soldier strives</l>
<l n="tr">With dying comrade first to lap the draught,</l>
<l n="tr">Loathsome had life been his. Like beasts they drain</l>
<l n="tr">The swollen udder, and where milk was not,</l>
<l n="tr">They suck the life-blood forth. From herbs and boughs</l>
<l n="tr">Dripping with dew, from tender shoots they press,</l>
<l n="tr">Nay, from the pith of trees, the juice within.</l>
<l n="tr">Happy the host that onward marching finds</l>
<l n="tr">Its savage enemy has fouled the wells</l>
<l n="tr">With murderous venom; hadst thou, Caesar, cast</l>
<l n="tr">The reeking filth of shambles in the stream,</l>
<l n="tr">And henbane dire and all the poisonous herbs</l>
<l n="tr">That lurk on Cretan slopes, still had they drunk</l>
<l n="tr">The fatal waters, rather than endure</l>
<l n="tr">Such lingering agony. Their bowels racked</l>
<l n="tr">With torments as of flame; the swollen tongue</l>
<l n="tr">And jaws now parched and rigid, and the veins;</l>
<l n="tr">Each laboured breath with anguish from the lungs</l>
<l n="tr">Enfeebled, moistureless, is scarcely drawn,</l>
<l n="tr">And scarce again returned; and yet agape,</l>
<l n="tr">Their panting mouths suck in the nightly dew;</l>
<l n="tr">They watch for showers from heaven, and in despair</l>
<l n="tr">Gaze on the clouds, whence lately poured a flood.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor were their tortures less that <placeName key="tgn,7000856">Meroe</placeName></l>

<l n="tr">But now their leaders yield; Afranius,</l>
<l n="tr">Vanquished, throws down his arms, and leads his troops,</l>
<l n="tr">Now hardly living, to the hostile camp</l>
<l n="tr">Before the victor's feet, and sues for peace.</l>
<l n="tr">Proud is his bearing, and despite of ills,</l>
<l n="tr">His mien majestic, of his triumphs past</l>
<l n="tr">Still mindful in disaster thus he stands,</l>
<l n="tr">Though suppliant for grace, a leader yet;</l>
<l n="tr">From fearless heart thus speaking: 'Had the fates</l>
<l n="tr">Thrown me before some base ignoble foe,</l>
<l n="tr">Not, Caesar, thee; still had this arm fought on</l>
<l n="tr">And snatched my death. Now if I suppliant ask,</l>
<l n="tr">'Tis that I value still the boon of life</l>
<l n="tr">Given by a worthy hand. No party ties</l>
<l n="tr">'Roused us to arms against thee; when the war,</l>
<l n="tr">'This civil war, broke out, it found us chiefs;</l>
<l n="tr">And with our former cause we kept the faith,</l>
<l n="tr">So long as brave men should. The fates' decree</l>
<l n="tr">'No longer we withstand. Unto thy will</l>
<l n="tr">We yield the western tribes: the east is thine</l>
<l n="tr">'And all the world lies open to thy march.</l>
<l n="tr">'Be generous! blood nor sword nor wearied arm</l>
<l n="tr">'Thy conquests bought. Thou hast not to forgive</l>
<l n="tr">Aught but thy victory won. Nor ask we much.</l>
<l n="tr">'Give us repose; to lead in peace the life</l>
<l n="tr">'Thou shalt bestow; suppose these armed lines</l>
<l n="tr">'Are corpses prostrate on the field of war,</l>
<l n="tr">'Ne'er were it meet that thy victorious ranks</l>
<l n="tr">Should mix with ours, the vanquished. Destiny</l>
<l n="tr">'Has run for us its course: one boon I beg;</l>
<l n="tr">'Bid not the conquered conquer in thy train.'</l>
<l n="tr">Such were his words, and Caesar's gracious smile</l>
<l n="tr">Granted his prayer, remitting rights that war</l>
<l n="tr">Gives to the victor. To th' unguarded stream</l>
<l n="tr">The soldiers speed: prone on the bank they lie</l>
<l n="tr">And lap the flood or foul the crowded waves.</l>
<l n="tr">In many a burning throat the sudden draught</l>
<l n="tr">Poured in too copious, filled the empty veins</l>
<l n="tr">And choked the breath within: yet left unquenched</l>
<l n="tr">The burning pest which, though their frames were full,</l>
<l n="tr">Craved water for itself. Then, nerved once more,</l>
<l n="tr">Their strength returned. Oh, lavish luxury,</l>
<l n="tr">Contented never with the frugal meal!</l>
<l n="tr">Oh, greed that searchest over land and sea</l>

<l n="tr">With gold and jewels wrought, restores the spark,</l>
<l n="tr">The failing spark, of life; but water pure</l>
<l n="tr">And simplest fruits of earth. The flood, the field</l>
<l n="tr">Suffice for nature. Ah! the weary lot</l>
<l n="tr">Of those who war!  But these, their armour laid</l>

<l n="tr">What priceless gift in peace had they secured!</l>
<l n="tr">How grieved it now their souls to have poised the dart</l>

<l n="tr">And prayed the gods for victory in vain!</l>
<l n="tr">Nay, hard they think the victor's lot, for whom</l>
<l n="tr">A thousand risks and battles still remain;</l>
<l n="tr">If fortune never is to leave his side,</l>
<l n="tr">How often must he triumph! and how oft</l>
<l n="tr">Pour out his blood where'er great Caesar leads!</l>
<l n="tr">Happy, thrice happy, he who, when the world</l>

<l n="tr">No trumpet call shall break his sleep again:</l>

<l n="tr">Not thus did Fortune upon Caesar smile</l>
<l n="tr">In all the parts of earth;<note anchored="yes">The scene is the Dalmatian coast of the Adriatic. Here was Diocletian's palace.</note>   but 'gainst his arms</l>

<l n="tr">Is laved by <placeName key="perseus,Hadria">Hadria</placeName>, and Iadar warm</l>

<l n="tr">There brave Curectae dwell, whose island home</l>

<l n="tr">Antonius, and, beleaguered by the foe,</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the furthest margin of the shore</l>
<l n="tr">(Safe from all ills but famine) placed his camp.</l>
<l n="tr">But for his steeds the earth no forage gave,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor golden <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName> harvest; and his troops</l>
<l n="tr">Gnawed the dry herbage of the scanty turf</l>
<l n="tr">Within their rampart lines. But when they knew</l>
<l n="tr">That Basilus was on th' opposing shore</l>
<l n="tr">With friendly force, by novel mode of flight</l>
<l n="tr">They aim to reach him. Not the accustomed keel</l>
<l n="tr">They lay, nor build the ship, but shapeless rafts</l>
<l n="tr">Of timbers knit together, strong to bear</l>
<l n="tr">All ponderous weight; on empty casks beneath</l>
<l n="tr">By tightened chains made firm, in double rows</l>
<l n="tr">Supported; nor upon the deck were placed</l>
<l n="tr">The oarsmen, to the hostile dart exposed,</l>
<l n="tr">But in a hidden space, by beams concealed.</l>
<l n="tr">And thus the eye amazed beheld the mass</l>
<l n="tr">Move silent on its path across the sea,</l>
<l n="tr">By neither sail nor stalwart arm propelled.</l>
<l n="tr">They watch the main until the refluent waves</l>
<l n="tr">Ebb from the growing sands; then, on the tide</l>
<l n="tr">Receding, launch their vessel; thus she floats</l>
<l n="tr">With comrades twin: and rises over each</l>
<l n="tr">With quivering battlements a lofty tower.</l>
<l n="tr">Octavius, guardian of Illyrian seas,</l>
<l n="tr">Restrained his swifter keels, and left the rafts</l>
<l n="tr">Free from attack, in hope of larger spoil</l>
<l n="tr">From fresh adventures; for the peaceful sea</l>
<l n="tr">Might tempt them, and their goal in safety reached,</l>
<l n="tr">To dare a second voyage. Round the stag</l>
<l n="tr">Thus will the cunning hunter draw a line</l>
<l n="tr">Of tainted feathers poisoning the air;</l>
<l n="tr">Or spread the mesh, and muzzle in his grasp</l>
<l n="tr">The straining jaws of the Molossian hound,</l>
<l n="tr">And leash the Spartan pack; nor is the brake</l>
<l n="tr">Trusted to any dog but such as tracks</l>
<l n="tr">The scent with lowered nostrils, and refrains</l>
<l n="tr">From giving tongue the while; content to mark</l>
<l n="tr">By shaking cord the covert of the prey.</l>
<l n="tr">Ere long they manned the rafts in eager wish</l>
<l n="tr">To quit the island, when the latest glow</l>
<l n="tr">Still parted day from night. But Magnus' troops,</l>
<l n="tr">Cilician once, taught by their ancient art,</l>
<l n="tr">In fraudulent deceit had left the sea</l>
<l n="tr">To view unguarded; but with chains unseen</l>
<l n="tr">Fast to Illyrian shores, and hanging loose,</l>
<l n="tr">They blocked the outlet in the waves beneath.</l>
<l n="tr">The leading rafts passed safely, but the third,</l>
<l n="tr">Caught by the rope, was drawn beneath the rocks.</l>
<l n="tr">These, hollowed by the sea, in ponderous mass</l>
<l n="tr">O'erhanging, seemed upon the point to fall;</l>
<l n="tr">And trees made dark the wave. Here oft the main</l>
<l n="tr">Within the deep recess sweeps broken wrecks</l>
<l n="tr">And bodies of the drowned, till ebbing tides</l>
<l n="tr">Return the spoil. Then from the cavernous arch</l>
<l n="tr">Is belched the ocean forth in such turmoil</l>
<l n="tr">Of swirling billows, as excels the rage</l>
<l n="tr">Of that famed whirlpool on Sicilian shores.</l>
<l n="tr">Here, with Venetian settlers for its load,</l>
<l n="tr">Stood motionless the raft. Octavius' ships</l>
<l n="tr">Gathered around, while foemen on the land</l>
<l n="tr">Filled all the shore. But well the captain knew,</l>
<l n="tr">Volteius, how the secret fraud was planned,</l>
<l n="tr">And tried in vain with sword and steel to burst</l>
<l n="tr">The chains that held them; without hope he fights,</l>
<l n="tr">Uncertain where to avoid or front the foe.</l>
<l n="tr">Caught in the strait they strove as brave men should</l>
<l n="tr">Against opposing hosts; nor long the fight,</l>
<l n="tr">For fallen darkness brought a truce to arms.</l>
<l n="tr">Then to his men disheartened and in fear</l>
<l n="tr">Of coming fate Volteius, great of soul,</l>
<l n="tr">Thus spake in tones commanding: ' Free no more,</l>
<l n="tr">'Save for this little night, consult ye now</l>
<l n="tr">'In this last moment, soldiers, how to face</l>
<l n="tr">'Your final fortunes. No man's life is short</l>
<l n="tr">' Who can take thought for death, nor is your fame</l>
<l n="tr">' Less than a conqueror's, if with breast advanced</l>
<l n="tr">'Ye meet your destined doom. None know how long</l>
<l n="tr">'The life that waits them. Summon your own fate,</l>
<l n="tr">'And equal is your praise, whether the hand</l>
<l n="tr">'Quench the last flicker of departing light,</l>
<l n="tr">' Or shear the hope of years. But choice to die</l>
<l n="tr">'Is thrust not on the mind-we cannot flee;</l>
<l n="tr">'See at our throats, e'en now, our kinsmen's swords.</l>
<l n="tr">' Then choose for death; desire what fate decrees.</l>
<l n="tr">'At least in war's blind cloud we shall not fall;</l>
<l n="tr">' Nor when the flying weapons hide the day,</l>
<l n="tr">'And slaughtered heaps of foemen load the field,</l>
<l n="tr">'And death is common, and the brave man sinks</l>
<l n="tr">'Unknown, inglorious. Us within this ship,</l>
<l n="tr">'Seen of both friends and foes, the gods have placed;</l>
<l n="tr">'Both land and sea and island cliffs shall bear,</l>
<l n="tr">'From either shore, their witness to our death,</l>
<l n="tr">'In which some great and memorable fame</l>
<l n="tr">'Thou, Fortune, dost prepare. What glorious deeds</l>
<l n="tr">' Of warlike heroism, of noble faith,</l>
<l n="tr">'Time's annals show! All these shall we surpass.</l>
<l n="tr">'True, Caesar, that to fall upon our swords</l>
<l n="tr">'For thee is little; yet beleaguered thus,</l>
<l n="tr">'With neither sons nor parents at our sides,</l>
<l n="tr">'Shorn of the glory that we might have earned,</l>
<l n="tr">'We give thee here the only pledge we may.</l>
<l n="tr">'Yet let these hostile thousands fear the souls</l>
<l n="tr">'That rage for battle and that welcome death,</l>
<l n="tr">'And know us for invincible, and joy</l>
<l n="tr">'That no more rafts were stayed. They'll offer terms,</l>
<l n="tr">'And tempt us with a base unhonoured life.</l>
<l n="tr">'Would that, to give that death which shall be ours</l>
<l n="tr">'The greater glory, they may bid us hope</l>
<l n="tr">'For pardon and for life! lest when our swords</l>
<l n="tr">'Are reeking with our hearts'-blood, they may say</l>
<l n="tr">'This was despair of living. Great must be</l>
<l n="tr">'The prowess of our end, if in the hosts</l>
<l n="tr">'That fight his battles, Caesar is to mourn</l>
<l n="tr">'This little handful lost. For me, should fate</l>
<l n="tr">'Grant us retreat-myself would scorn to shun</l>
<l n="tr">'The coming onset. Life I cast away,</l>
<l n="tr">'The frenzy of the death that comes apace</l>
<l n="tr">'Controls my being. Those whose end is near</l>

<l n="tr">Swarmed with the galleys and their Grecian fleet</l>
<l n="tr">All armed for fight: but first the war was stayed</l>
<l n="tr">And terms proposed: life to the foe they thought</l>
<l n="tr">Would seem the sweeter, by delay of death</l>
<l n="tr">Thus granted. But the band devoted stood,</l>
<l n="tr">Proud of their promised end, life all forsworn,</l>
<l n="tr">And careless of the fight: no jarring note</l>
<l n="tr">Opposed their high resolve. In numbers few</l>
<l n="tr">'Gainst foemen numberless by land and sea,</l>
<l n="tr">They wage the desperate war; then satiate</l>
<l n="tr">Turn from the foe. And first demanding death</l>
<l n="tr">Volteius bared his throat. ' What youth,' he cries,</l>
<l n="tr">' Dares strike me down, and through his captain's wounds</l>
<l n="tr">'Attest his love for death?  ' Then through his side</l>
<l n="tr">Plunge blades uncounted on the moment drawn.</l>
<l n="tr">He praises all : but him who struck the first</l>
<l n="tr">Grateful, with dying strength, he does to death.</l>
<l n="tr">They rush together, and without a foe</l>
<l n="tr">Work all the guilt of battle. Thus of yore,</l>
<l n="tr">Rose up the glittering Dircaean band</l>
<l n="tr">From seed by Cadmus sown, and fought and died,</l>
<l n="tr">Dire omen for the brother kings of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">And so in <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName>' fields the sons of earth,</l>
<l n="tr">Born of the sleepless dragon, all inflamed</l>
<l n="tr">By magic incantations, with their blood</l>
<l n="tr">Deluged the monstrous furrow, while the Queen</l>
<l n="tr">Feared at the spells she wrought. Devoted thus</l>
<l n="tr">To death, they fall, yet in their death itself</l>
<l n="tr">Less valour show than in the fatal wounds</l>
<l n="tr">They take and give; for e'en the dying hand</l>
<l n="tr">Missed not a blow  nor did the stroke alone</l>
<l n="tr">Inflict the wound, but rushing on the sword</l>
<l n="tr">Their throat or breast received it to the hilt;</l>
<l n="tr">And when by fatal chance or sire with son,</l>
<l n="tr">Or brothers met, yet with unfaltering weight</l>
<l n="tr">Down flashed the pitiless sword: this proved their love,</l>
<l n="tr">To give no second blow. Half living now</l>
<l n="tr">They dragged their mangled bodies to the side,</l>
<l n="tr">Whence flowed into the sea a crimson stream</l>
<l n="tr">Of slaughter. 'Twas their pleasure yet to see</l>
<l n="tr">The light they scorned; with haughty looks to scan</l>
<l n="tr">The faces of their victors, and to feel</l>
<l n="tr">The death approaching. But the raft was now</l>
<l n="tr">Piled up with dead; which, when the foemen saw,</l>
<l n="tr">Wondering at such a chief and such a deed,</l>
<l n="tr">They gave them burial. Never through the world</l>
<l n="tr">Of any brave achievement was the fame</l>
<l n="tr">More widely blazed. Yet meaner men, untaught</l>
<l n="tr">By such examples, see not that the hand</l>
<l n="tr">Which frees from slavery needs no valiant mind</l>
<l n="tr">To guide the stroke. But tyranny is feared</l>
<l n="tr">As dealing death; and Freedom's self is galled</l>
<l n="tr">By ruthless arms; and knows not that the sword</l>
<l n="tr">Was given for this, that none need live a slave.</l>
<l n="tr">Ah Death! wouldst thou but let the coward live</l>

<l n="tr">'Earth still another monster brought to birth,</l>
<l n="tr">'In <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>'s caverns: huger far was he,</l>
<l n="tr">'More justly far her pride, than Briareus</l>

<quote lang="en"><l>'Phlegra, the field where all the sons of earth</l>
<l>Mustered against the gods, did ne'er acknowledge</l>
<l>So proud and huge a monster.'</l></quote></note>  fields Antaeus grew,</l>
<l n="tr">'But here in Libya; to her offspring's strength,</l>
<l n="tr">'Unmeasured, vast, she added yet this boon,</l>
<l n="tr">'That when in weariness and labour spent</l>
<l n="tr">'He touched his parent, fresh from her embrace</l>
<l n="tr">'Renewed in vigour he should rise again.</l>
<l n="tr">'In yonder cave he dwelt, 'neath yonder rock</l>
<l n="tr">'He made his feast on lions slain in chase:</l>
<l n="tr">'There slept he; not on skins of beasts, or leaves,</l>
<l n="tr">'But fed his strength upon the naked earth.</l>
<l n="tr">Perished the Libyan hinds and those who came,</l>
<l n="tr">'Brought here in ships, until he scorned at length</l>
<l n="tr">'The earth that gave him strength, and on his feet</l>
<l n="tr">'Invincible and with unaided might</l>
<l n="tr">'Made all his victims. Last to Afric shores,</l>
<l n="tr">' Drawn by the rumour of such carnage, came</l>
<l n="tr">' Magnanimous Alcides, he who freed</l>
<l n="tr">'Both land and sea of monsters. Down on earth</l>
<l n="tr">'He threw his mantle of the lion's skin</l>
<l n="tr">' Slain in Cleone; nor Antaeus less</l>
<l n="tr">'Cast down the hide he wore. With shining oil,</l>
<l n="tr">'As one who wrestles at <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>'s feast,</l>
<l n="tr">'The hero rubbed his limbs: the giant feared</l>
<l n="tr">' Lest standing only on his parent earth</l>
<l n="tr">'His strength might fail; and cast o'er all his bulk</l>
<l n="tr">' Hot sand in handfuls. Thus with arms entwined</l>
<l n="tr">'And grappling hands each seizes on his foe;</l>
<l n="tr">'With hardened muscles straining at the neck</l>
<l n="tr">'Long time in vain; for firm the sinewy throat</l>
<l n="tr">' Stood column-like, nor yielded; so that each</l>
<l n="tr">' Wondered to find his peer. Nor at the first</l>
<l n="tr">'Divine Alcides put forth all his strength,</l>
<l n="tr">' By lengthy struggle wearing out his foe,</l>
<l n="tr">'Till chilly drops stood on Antaeus' limbs,</l>
<l n="tr">'And toppled to its fall the stately throat,</l>
<l n="tr">'And smitten by the hero's blows, the legs</l>
<l n="tr">' Began to totter. Breast to breast they strive</l>
<l n="tr">'To gain the vantage, till the victor's arms</l>
<l n="tr">'Gird in the giant's yielding back and sides,</l>
<l n="tr">'And squeeze his middle part: next 'twixt the thighs</l>
<l n="tr">' He puts his feet, and forcing them apart,</l>
<l n="tr">'Lays low the mighty monster limb by limb.</l>
<l n="tr">'The dry earth drank his sweat, while in his veins</l>
<l n="tr">'Warm ran the life-blood, and with strength refreshed,</l>
<l n="tr">'The muscles swelled and all the joints grew firm,</l>
<l n="tr">'And with his might restored, he breaks his bonds</l>
<l n="tr">'And rives the arms of Hercules away.</l>
<l n="tr">'Amazed the hero stood at such a strength.</l>
<l n="tr">'Not thus he feared, though then unused to war,</l>
<l n="tr">'That hydra fierce which, smitten in the marsh</l>
<l n="tr">'Of Inachus, renewed its severed heads.</l>
<l n="tr">'They fought as peers, the giant with the powers</l>
<l n="tr">'Which earth bestowed, the hero with his own:</l>
<l n="tr">' Nor did the hatred of his step-dame<note anchored="yes">Juno.</note> find</l>
<l n="tr">'In all his conflicts greater room for hope.</l>
<l n="tr">' She sees bedewed in sweat the neck and limbs</l>
<l n="tr">'Which once had borne the burden of the heavens</l>
<l n="tr">' Nor knew the toil: and when Antaeus felt</l>
<l n="tr">' His foeman's arms close round him once again,</l>
<l n="tr">' He flung his wearying limbs upon the sand</l>
<l n="tr">' To rise with strength renewed; all that the earth,</l>
<l n="tr">'Though labouring sore, could breathe into her son</l>
<l n="tr">'She gave his frame. But Hercules at last</l>
<l n="tr">' Saw how his parent gave the giant strength.</l>
<l n="tr">'" Stand thou," he cried; "no more upon the ground</l>
<l n="tr">' "Thou liest at thy will-here must thou stay</l>
<l n="tr">'" Within mine arms constrained; against this breast,</l>
<l n="tr">'" Antaeus, shalt thou fall." He lifted up</l>
<l n="tr">' And held by middle girth the giant form,</l>
<l n="tr">'Still struggling for the soil: but she no more</l>
<l n="tr">'Could give her offspring vigour. Slowly came</l>
<l n="tr">'The chill of death upon him, and 'twas long</l>
<l n="tr">'Before the hero, of his victory sure,</l>

<l n="tr">And furthest regions, summons to his aid</l>
<l n="tr">The nations who confessed King Juba's rule.</l>
<l n="tr">Not any monarch over wider tracts</l>
<l n="tr">Held the dominion. From the western belt<note anchored="yes">See line 82.</note></l>
<l n="tr">Near <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, Atlas parts their furthest bounds;</l>

<l n="tr">Hard by the whirlpools; and their burning plains</l>
<l n="tr">Stretch forth unending 'neath the torrid zone,</l>
<l n="tr">In breadth its equal, till they reach at length</l>
<l n="tr">The shore of ocean upon either hand.</l>
<l n="tr">From all these regions tribes unnumbered flock</l>
<l n="tr">To Juba's standard: Moors of swarthy hue</l>
<l n="tr">As though from Ind; Numidian nomads there</l>
<l n="tr">And Nasamon's needy hordes; and those whose darts</l>
<l n="tr">Rival the flying arrows of the <placeName key="tgn,1045322">Mede</placeName>:</l>
<l n="tr">Dark Garamantians leave their fervid home;</l>

<l n="tr">Who wanders forth, his home a fragile hut,</l>
<l n="tr">And blinds with flowing robe (if spear should fail)</l>
<l n="tr">The angry lion, monarch of the steppe.</l>
<l n="tr">Not eagerness alone to save the state</l>
<l n="tr">Stirred Juba's spirit: private hatred too</l>
<l n="tr">Roused him to war. For in the former year,</l>
<l n="tr">When Curio all things human and the gods<note anchored="yes">Curio was tribune in B.C. <date value="-50">50</date>. His earlier years are stated to have been stained with vice.</note></l>
<l n="tr">Polluted, he by tribune law essayed</l>
<l n="tr">To ravish <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> from the tyrant's sway,</l>
<l n="tr">And drive the monarch from his father's throne,</l>
<l n="tr">While giving <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> a king. To Juba thus,</l>
<l n="tr">Still smarting at the insult, came the war,</l>
<l n="tr">A welcome harvest for his crown retained.</l>
<l n="tr">These rumours Curio feared: nor had his troops</l>
<l n="tr">(Ta'en in <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>'s hold) <note anchored="yes">Book II., 535.</note>  in waves of <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">Been tested, nor to Caesar in the wars</l>
<l n="tr">Had learned devotion: wavering in their faith,</l>
<l n="tr">Their second chief they doubt, their first betrayed.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet when the general saw the spirit of fear</l>
<l n="tr">Creep through his camp, and discipline to fail,</l>
<l n="tr">And sentinels desert their guard at night,</l>
<l n="tr">Thus in his fear he spake : ' By daring much</l>
<l n="tr">' Fear is disguised; let me be first in arms,</l>
<l n="tr">'And bid my soldiers to the plain descend,</l>
<l n="tr">While still my soldiers.  Idle days breed doubt.</l>
<l n="tr">' By fight forestall the plot.<note anchored="yes">Preferring the reading <foreign lang="la">praeripe</foreign> with Francken.</note>  Soon as the thirst</l>
<l n="tr">'Of bloodshed fills the mind, and eager hands</l>
<l n="tr">' Grip firm the sword, and pressed upon the brow</l>
<l n="tr">' The helm brings valour to the failing heart-</l>
<l n="tr">' Who cares to measure leaders' merits then?</l>
<l n="tr">' Who weighs the cause?  With whom the soldier stands,</l>
<l n="tr">'For him he fights; as at the fatal show</l>
<l n="tr">No ancient grudge the gladiator's arm</l>
<l n="tr">' Nerves for the combat, yet as he shall strike</l>
<l n="tr">' He hates his rival.' Thinking thus he led</l>
<l n="tr">His troops in battle order to the plain.</l>
<l n="tr">Then victory on his arms deceptive shone</l>
<l n="tr">Hiding the ills to come: for from the field</l>
<l n="tr">Driving the hostile host with sword and spear,</l>
<l n="tr">He smote them till their camp opposed his way.
<milestone n="715" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="tr">But after Varus' rout, unseen till then,</l>
<l n="tr">All eager for the glory to be his,</l>
<l n="tr">By stealth came Juba: silent was his march;</l>
<l n="tr">His only fear lest rumour should forestall</l>
<l n="tr">His coming victory. In pretended war</l>
<l n="tr">He sends Sabura forth with scanty force</l>
<l n="tr">To tempt the enemy, while in hollow vale</l>
<l n="tr">He holds the armies of his realm unseen.</l>
<l n="tr">'Tis thus the sly ichneumon <note anchored="yes">Bewick ('Quadrupeds,' p. 238) tells the following anecdote of a tame ichneumon which had never seen a serpent, and to which he brought a small one. 'Its first emotion seemed to be astonishment mixed with anger; its hair became erect; in an instant it slipped behind the reptile, and with remarkable swiftness and agility leaped upon its head, seized it and crushed it with its teeth.'</note>  with his tail</l>
<l n="tr">Waving, allures the serpent of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">Drawn to the moving shadow: he, with head</l>
<l n="tr">Turned sideways, watches till the victim glides</l>
<l n="tr">Within his reach, then seizes by the throat</l>
<l n="tr">Behind the deadly fangs: forth from its seat</l>
<l n="tr">Balked of its purpose, through the brimming jaws</l>
<l n="tr">Gushes a tide of poison. Fortune smiled</l>
<l n="tr">On Juba's stratagem; for Curio</l>
<l n="tr">(The hidden forces of the foe unknown)</l>
<l n="tr">Sent forth his horse by night without the camp</l>
<l n="tr">To scour more distant regions. He himself</l>
<l n="tr">At earliest peep of dawn bids carry forth</l>
<l n="tr">His standards; heeding not his captains' prayer</l>
<l n="tr">Urged on his ears: ' Beware of Punic fraud,</l>
<l n="tr">' The craft that taints a Carthaginian war.'</l>
<l n="tr">Hung over him the doom of coming death</l>
<l n="tr">And gave the youth to fate; and civil strife</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Dragged down its author.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">On the lofty tops</l>
<l n="tr">Where broke the hills abruptly to their fall</l>
<l n="tr">He ranks his troops and sees the foe afar:</l>
<l n="tr">Who still deceiving, simulated flight,</l>
<l n="tr">Till from the height in loose unordered lines</l>
<l n="tr">The Roman forces streamed upon the plain,</l>
<l n="tr">In thought that Juba fled. Then first was known</l>
<l n="tr">The treacherous fraud: for swift Numidian horse</l>
<l n="tr">On every side surround them: leader, men-</l>
<l n="tr">All see their fate in one dread moment come.</l>
<l n="tr">No coward flees, no warrior bravely strides</l>
<l n="tr">To meet the battle: nay, the trumpet call</l>
<l n="tr">Stirs not the charger with resounding hoof</l>
<l n="tr">To spurn the rock, nor galling bit compels</l>
<l n="tr">To champ in eagerness; nor toss his mane</l>
<l n="tr">And prick the ear, nor prancing with his feet</l>
<l n="tr">To claim his share of combat. Tired, the neck</l>
<l n="tr">Droops downwards: smoking sweat bedews the limbs:</l>
<l n="tr">Dry from the squalid mouth protrudes the tongue,</l>
<l n="tr">Hoarse, raucous panting issues from their chests;</l>
<l n="tr">Their flanks distended: and on every curb</l>
<l n="tr">Dry foam of blood; the ruthless sword alone</l>
<l n="tr">Could move them onward, powerless even then</l>
<l n="tr">To charge; but giving to the hostile dart</l>
<l n="tr">A nearer victim. But when the Afric horse</l>
<l n="tr">First made their onset, loud beneath their hoofs</l>
<l n="tr">Rang the wide plain, and rose the dust in air</l>
<l n="tr">As by some Thracian whirlwind stirred; and veiled</l>
<l n="tr">The heavens in darkness. When on Curio's host</l>
<l n="tr">The tempest burst, each footman in the rank</l>
<l n="tr">Stood there to meet his fate-no doubtful end</l>
<l n="tr">Hung in the balance: destiny proclaimed</l>
<l n="tr">Death to them all. No conflict hand to hand</l>
<l n="tr">Was granted them, by lances thrown from far</l>
<l n="tr">And sidelong sword-thrusts slain: nor wounds alone,</l>
<l n="tr">But clouds of weapons falling from the air</l>
<l n="tr">By weight of iron o'erwhelmed them. Still drew in</l>
<l n="tr">The straightening circle, for the first pressed back</l>
<l n="tr">On those behind; did any shun the foe,</l>
<l n="tr">Seeking the inner safety of the ring,</l>
<l n="tr">He needs must perish by his comrades' swords.</l>
<l n="tr">And as the front rank fell, still narrower grew</l>
<l n="tr">The close crushed phalanx, till to raise their swords</l>
<l n="tr">Space was denied. Still close and closer forced</l>
<l n="tr">The armed breasts against each other driven</l>
<l n="tr">Pressed out the life. Thus not upon a scene</l>
<l n="tr">Such as their fortune promised, gazed the foe.</l>
<l n="tr">No tide of blood was there to glut their eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">No members lopped asunder, though the earth</l>
<l n="tr">Was piled with corpses; for each Roman stood</l>
<l n="tr">In death upright against his comrade dead.</l>
<l n="tr">Let cruel <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> rouse her hated ghosts</l>
<l n="tr">By this fell offering; let the Punic shades,</l>
<l n="tr">And bloody Hannibal, from this defeat</l>
<l n="tr">Receive atonement: yet 'twas shame, ye gods,</l>
<l n="tr">That <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> gained not for herself the day;</l>
<l n="tr">And that our Romans on that field should die</l>
<l n="tr">To save Pompeius and the Senate's cause.</l>
<l n="tr">Now was the dust laid low by streams of blood,</l>
<l n="tr">And Curio, knowing that his host was slain,</l>
<l n="tr">Chose not to live; and, as a brave man should,</l>
<l n="tr">He rushed upon the heap, and fighting fell.</l>
<l n="tr">In vain with turbid speech hast thou profaned</l>
<l n="tr">The pulpit of the forum; waved in vain</l>
<l n="tr">From that proud <note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="la">'arce,'</foreign> not <foreign lang="la">'arte.'</foreign> The word <foreign lang="la">'signifer'</foreign> seems to favour the reading I have preferred; and Dean Merivale, Hosius, and Francken adopt it.</note>  citadel the tribune flag:</l>
<l n="tr">And armed the people, and the Senate's rights</l>
<l n="tr">Betraying, hast compelled this impious war</l>
<l n="tr">Betwixt the rival kinsmen.    Low thou liest</l>
<l n="tr">Before <placeName key="tgn,7010797">Pharsalus</placeName>' fight, and from thine eyes</l>

<l n="tr">Ye mighty make atonement with your blood.</l>
<l n="tr">Happy were <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and all her sons indeed,</l>
<l n="tr">Did but the gods as rigidly protect</l>
<l n="tr">As they avenge, her violated laws!</l>
<l n="tr">There Curio lies; untombed his noble corpse,</l>
<l n="tr">Torn by the vultures of the Libyan wastes.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet shall we, since such merit, though unsung,</l>
<l n="tr">Lives by its own imperishable fame,</l>
<l n="tr">Give thee thy meed of praise. <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> never bore</l>
<l n="tr">Another son, who, had he right pursued,</l>
<l n="tr">Had so adorned her laws; but soon the times,</l>
<l n="tr">Their luxury, corruption, and the curse</l>
<l n="tr">Of copious wealth swept o'er his wavering mind</l>
<l n="tr">In stream transverse; and, bribed by spoils of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">And golden gifts of Caesar, Curio changed</l>
<l n="tr">Turned with his change the scale of human things.</l>
<l n="tr">True, mighty Sulla, cruel Marius,</l>
<l n="tr">And bloody Cinna, and the long descent</l>
<l n="tr">Of Caesar and of Caesar's house became</l>
<l n="tr">Lords of our lives. But who had power like him?</l>
<l n="tr">All others bought the state: he sold alone.<note anchored="yes">For the character and career of Curio, see Merivale's 'History of the Roman Empire,' chapter xvi. He was of profligate character, but a friend and pupil of Cicero;  at first a rabid partisan of the oligarchy, he had, about the period of his tribuneship (B.C. <dateRange from="-50" to="-49">50-49</dateRange>), become a supporter of Caesar.  How far Gaulish gold was the cause of this conversion we cannot tell. It is in allusion to this change that he was termed the prime mover of the civil war. His arrival in Caesar's camp is described in Book I., line 306.  He became Caesar's chief lieutenant in place of the deserter Labienus;  and, as described in Book III., was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, whence he expelled the senatorial forces. His final expedition to <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, defeat, and death, form the subject of the latter part of this book. Mommsen describes him as a man of talent, and finds a resemblance between him and Caesar.  (Vol. iv., p. 393.)</note>

<l n="tr">The keeper calls Phemonoe;<note anchored="yes">This name is one of those given to the Cumaean Sibyl mentioned at line 216. She was said to have been the daughter of Apollo.</note>  whose steps</l>
<l n="tr">Round the Castalian fount and in the grove</l>
<l n="tr">Were wandering careless; her he bids to pass</l>

<l n="tr">Sought to dissuade the chieftain from his zeal</l>

<l n="tr">'Since wicked steps are banished from the fane,</l>
<l n="tr">'In this our impious age the god finds none</l>
<l n="tr">'Whom he may answer.' But the maiden's guile</l>
<l n="tr">Was known, for though she would deny the gods</l>
<l n="tr">Her fears approved them. On her front she binds</l>
<l n="tr">A twisted fillet, while a shining wreath</l>
<l n="tr">Of Phocian laurels crowns the locks that flow</l>
<l n="tr">Upon her shoulders. Hesitating yet,</l>
<l n="tr">The priest compelled her, and she passed within.</l>
<l n="tr">But horror filled her of the holiest depths</l>
<l n="tr">From which the mystic oracle proceeds;</l>
<l n="tr">And resting near the doors, in breast unmoved</l>
<l n="tr">She dares invent the god in words confused,</l>
<l n="tr">Which proved no mind possessed with fire divine;</l>
<l n="tr">By such false chant less injuring the chief</l>
<l n="tr">Than faith in Phoebus and the sacred fane.</l>
<l n="tr">No burst of words with tremor in their tones,</l>
<l n="tr">No voice re-echoing through the spacious vault</l>
<l n="tr">Proclaimed the deity, no bristling locks</l>
<l n="tr">Shook off the laurel chaplet; but the grove</l>
<l n="tr">Unshaken, and the summits of the shrine,</l>
<l n="tr">Gave proof she shunned the god. The Roman knew</l>
<l n="tr">The tripods yet were idle, and in rage,</l>
<l n="tr">'Wretch,' he exclaimed, 'to us and to the gods,</l>
<l n="tr">'Whose presence thou pretendest, thou shalt pay</l>
<l n="tr">'The punishment; unless thou enter the recess,</l>
<l n="tr">'And cease to speak in phrases of thine own</l>
<l n="tr">Of this vast conflict, of a world by war</l>
<l n="tr">'Convulsed and shaken.' Then by fear compelled,</l>
<l n="tr">At length the priestess sought the furthest depths,</l>
<l n="tr">And stayed beside the tripods; and there came</l>
<l n="tr">Into her unaccustomed breast the god,</l>
<l n="tr">Breathed from the living rock for centuries</l>
<l n="tr">Untouched; nor ever with a mightier power</l>
<l n="tr">Did Paean's inspiration seize the frame</l>
<l n="tr">Of Delphic priestess; his pervading touch</l>
<l n="tr">Expelled the mortal, and her former mind,</l>
<l n="tr">And made her wholly his. In maddened trance</l>
<l n="tr">She whirled throughout the cave, her locks erect</l>
<l n="tr">With horror, and the fillets of the god</l>
<l n="tr">Dashed to the ground; her steps unguided turned</l>
<l n="tr">To this side and to that; the tripods fell</l>
<l n="tr">O'erturned; within her seethed the mighty fire</l>
<l n="tr">Of angry Phoebus; nor with whip alone</l>
<l n="tr">He urged her onwards, but with curb restrained;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor was it given her by the god to speak</l>
<l n="tr">All that she knew; for into one vast mass <note anchored="yes">These lines form the Latin motto prefixed to Shelley's poem, 'The Demon of the World.'</note></l>
<l n="tr">All time was gathered, and her panting chest</l>
<l n="tr">Groaned 'neath the centuries. In order long</l>
<l n="tr">All things lay bare: the future yet unveiled</l>
<l n="tr">Struggled for light; each fate required a voice;</l>
<l n="tr">The compass of the seas, Creation's birth,</l>
<l n="tr">Creation's death, the number of the sands,</l>
<l n="tr">All these she knew. Thus on a former day</l>

<l n="tr">Chose out with pride of hand the fates of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">E'en so Phemonoe, for a time oppressed</l>
<l n="tr">With fates unnumbered, laboured ere she found,</l>
<l n="tr">Beneath such mighty destinies concealed,</l>
<l n="tr">Thine, Appius, who alone hadst sought the god</l>
<l n="tr">In land Castalian; then from foaming lips</l>
<l n="tr">First rushed the madness forth, and murmurs loud</l>
<l n="tr">Uttered with panting breath and blent with groans;</l>
<l n="tr">Till through the spacious vault a voice at length</l>
<l n="tr">Broke from the virgin conquered by the god:</l>
<l n="tr">'From this great struggle thou, O Roman, free</l>
<l n="tr">'Escap'st the threats of war : alive, in peace,</l>
<l n="tr">'Thou shalt possess the hollow in the coast</l>
<l n="tr">'Of vast <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>.' Thus she spake, no more.</l>
<l n="tr">Ye mystic tripods, guardians of the fates</l>
<l n="tr">And Paean, thou, from whom no day is hid</l>
<l n="tr">By heaven's high rulers, Master of the truth,</l>
<l n="tr">Why fear'st thou to reveal the deaths of kings,</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>'s murdered princes, and the latest doom</l>
<l n="tr">Of her great Empire tottering to its fall,</l>
<l n="tr">And all the bloodshed of that western land?</l>
<l n="tr">Were yet the stars in doubt on Magnus' fate</l>
<l n="tr">Not yet decreed, and did the gods yet shrink</l>
<l n="tr">From that, the greatest crime?  Or wert thou dumb</l>
<l n="tr">That Fortune's sword for civil strife might wreak</l>
<l n="tr">Just vengeance, and a Brutus' arm once more</l>
<l n="tr">Strike down the tyrant?</l>
<l n="tr">From the temple doors</l>
<l n="tr">Rushed forth the prophetess in frenzy driven,</l>
<l n="tr">Not all her knowledge uttered; and her eyes,</l>
<l n="tr">Still troubled by the god who reigned within,</l>
<l n="tr">Or filled with wild affright, or fired with rage</l>
<l n="tr">Gaze on the wide expanse: still works her face</l>
<l n="tr">Convulsive; on her cheeks a crimson blush</l>
<l n="tr">With ghastly pallor blent, though not of fear.</l>
<l n="tr">Her weary heart throbs ever; and as seas</l>
<l n="tr">Boom swollen by northern winds, she finds in sighs,</l>
<l n="tr">All inarticulate, relief. But while</l>
<l n="tr">She hastes from that dread light in which she saw</l>
<l n="tr">The fates, to common day, lo! on her path</l>
<l n="tr">The darkness fell. Then by a Stygian draught</l>
<l n="tr">Of the forgetful river, Phoebus snatched</l>
<l n="tr">Back from her soul his secrets;  and she fell</l>
<l n="tr">Yet hardly living.   Nor did Appius dread</l>
<l n="tr">Approaching death, but by dark oracles</l>
<l n="tr">Baffled, while yet the Empire of the world</l>
<l n="tr">Hung in the balance, sought his promised realm</l>

<l n="tr">For on the solitary shore a grave</l>
<l n="tr">Awaits thee, where Carystos' marble crags<note anchored="yes">Appius was seized with fever as soon as he reached the spot; and there he died and was buried, thus fulfilling the oracle.</note></l>

<l n="tr">But Caesar carried from the conquered west</l>
<l n="tr">His eagles to another world of war;</l>
<l n="tr">When envying his victorious course the gods</l>
<l n="tr">Almost turned back the prosperous tide of fate.</l>
<l n="tr">Not on the battle-field borne down by arms,</l>
<l n="tr">But in his tents, within the rampart lines,</l>
<l n="tr">The hoped-for prize of this unholy war</l>
<l n="tr">Seemed for a moment gone. That faithful host,</l>
<l n="tr">His comrades trusted in a hundred fields,</l>
<l n="tr">Almost forsook him. The sad trump perchance</l>
<l n="tr">Mute for a moment, and the blade in sheath</l>
<l n="tr">Grown cold, had tamed their frenzy for the war;</l>
<l n="tr">Or else in hope of greater gifts, their cause</l>
<l n="tr">And leader they betrayed, and sold the sword</l>
<l n="tr">Still soiled with murder. By no other risk</l>
<l n="tr">Caesar more surely learned how as he looked</l>
<l n="tr">O'er all things else, the height on which he stood</l>
<l n="tr">Trembled beneath him. But a moment since</l>
<l n="tr">His high behest drew nations to the war;</l>
<l n="tr">Now, maimed of all who smote, no weapon left</l>
<l n="tr">Saving his own, he knows that swords unsheathed</l>

<l n="tr">No timorous voice was there; no silent wrath</l>
<l n="tr">Concealed; nor doubting mind, as though alone</l>
<l n="tr">Indignant at the wrong, and in distrust</l>
<l n="tr">Of those in turn distrusting. Fear in each</l>
<l n="tr">Had fled before the boldness of the host:</l>
<l n="tr">The crime is free where thousands bear the guilt.</l>
<l n="tr">They hurled their menace: 'Caesar, give us leave</l>

<l n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>'s winding ramparts, built of old</l>
<l n="tr">By Cretan colonists. There icy winds</l>
<l n="tr">Constrained the billows, and his trembling fleet</l>
<l n="tr">Feared for the winter storms nor dared the main.</l>
<l n="tr">But Caesar's soul burned at the moments lost</l>
<l n="tr">For speedy battle, nor could brook delay</l>
<l n="tr">Within the port, indignant that the sea</l>
<l n="tr">Should give safe passage to his routed foe:</l>
<l n="tr">And thus he stirred his troops, in seas unskilled,</l>
<l n="tr">With words of courage: 'When the winter wind</l>
<l n="tr">'Has seized on sky and ocean, firm its hold;</l>
<l n="tr">But the inconstancy of cloudy spring</l>
<l n="tr">'Permits no certain breezes to prevail</l>
<l n="tr">'Upon the billows. Straight shall be our course.</l>
<l n="tr">'No winding nooks of coast, but open seas</l>
<l n="tr">Struck by the northern wind alone we plough,</l>
<l n="tr">'And may he bend the spars, and bear us swift</l>

<l n="tr">'From our victorious prows. Too long we waste</l>
<l n="tr">'Tempests that blow to bear us to our goal.'</l>
<l n="tr">Now sank the sun to rest; the evening star</l>
<l n="tr">Shone on the darkening heaven, and the moon</l>
<l n="tr">Reigned with her paler light, when all the fleet</l>
<l n="tr">Freed from retaining cables seized the main.</l>
<l n="tr">With slackened sheet the canvas wooed the breeze,</l>
<l n="tr">Which rose and fell and fitful died away,</l>
<l n="tr">Till motionless the sails, and all the waves</l>
<l n="tr">Were still as deepest pool, where never wind</l>
<l n="tr">Ripples the surface. Thus in Scythian climes</l>

<l n="tr">No more impel the main, and ships constrained</l>
<l n="tr">Stand fast in ice; and while in depths below</l>
<l n="tr">The waves still murmur, loud the charger's hoof</l>
<l n="tr">Sounds on the surface, and the travelling wheel</l>
<l n="tr">Furrows a track upon the frozen marsh.</l>
<l n="tr">Cruel as tempest was the calm that lay</l>
<l n="tr">In stagnant pools upon the mournful deep:</l>
<l n="tr">Against the course of nature lay outstretched</l>
<l n="tr">A rigid ocean: 'twas as if the sea</l>
<l n="tr">Forgat its ancient ways and knew no more</l>
<l n="tr">The ceaseless tides, nor any breeze of heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor quivered at the image of the sun,</l>
<l n="tr">Mirrored upon its wave. For while the fleet</l>
<l n="tr">Hung in mid passage motionless, the foe</l>
<l n="tr">Might hurry to attack, with sturdy stroke</l>
<l n="tr">Churning the deep; or famine's deadly grip</l>
<l n="tr">Might seize the ships becalmed. For dangers new</l>
<l n="tr">New vows they found: for tempests was their prayer,</l>
<l n="tr">To rouse the billows till the watery plain</l>
<l n="tr">Freed from its torpor should be sea once more.</l>
<l n="tr">But cloudless was the sky and calm the deep,</l>
<l n="tr">All hope of shipwreck gone, till night was fled,</l>
<l n="tr">And marred by gathering mist the day arose</l>
<l n="tr">And stirred the depths, and moved the fleet along</l>
<l n="tr">Towards the Ceraunian headland; and the waves</l>
<l n="tr">And favouring breezes followed on the ships,</l>
<l n="tr">Now speeding faster, till (their goal attained)</l>
<l n="tr">They cast their anchors on Palaeste's <note anchored="yes">At the foot of the Acroceraunian range.</note>  shore.</l>
<l n="tr">This land first saw the chiefs in neighbouring camps</l>
<l n="tr">Confronted, which the streams of Apsus bound</l>
<l n="tr">And swifter Genusus; a lengthy course</l>
<l n="tr">Is run by neither, but on Apsus' waves</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce flowing from a marsh, the frequent boat</l>
<l n="tr">Finds room to swim; while on the foamy bed</l>

<l n="tr">But Caesar's mind though frenzied for the fight</l>
<l n="tr">Was forced to pause until Antonius brought</l>
<l n="tr">The rearward troops; Antonius even now</l>
<l n="tr">Rehearsing <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>' fight. With prayers and threats</l>
<l n="tr">Caesar exhorts him. ' Why delay the fates,</l>
<l n="tr">Thou cause of evil to the suffering world?</l>
<l n="tr">My speed hath won the major part: from thee</l>
<l n="tr">Fortune demands the final stroke alone.</l>
<l n="tr">Do Libyan whirlpools with deceitful tides</l>
<l n="tr">Uncertain separate us?  Is the deep</l>
<l n="tr">Untried to which I call?  To unknown risks</l>
<l n="tr">Art thou commanded? Caesar bids thee come,</l>
<l n="tr">Thou sluggard, not to leave him. Long ago</l>
<l n="tr">I ran my ships midway through sands and shoals</l>
<l n="tr">To harbours held by foes; and dost thou fear</l>
<l n="tr">My friendly camp? I mourn the waste of days</l>
<l n="tr">'Which fate allotted us. Upon the waves</l>
<l n="tr">And winds I call unceasing: hold not back</l>
<l n="tr">Thy willing troops, but let them dare the sea;</l>
<l n="tr">Here gladly shall they come to join my camp,</l>
<l n="tr">Though risking shipwreck: with indignant voice</l>
<l n="tr">I call upon thee. Not in equal shares</l>
<l n="tr">'The world has fallen between us: thou alone</l>
<l n="tr">Dost hold <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>, but <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> I</l>
<l n="tr">And all the lords of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.' Twice called and thrice</l>
<l n="tr">Antonius lingered still: but Caesar's mind</l>
<l n="tr">Was that he failed the gods, not they his cause.</l>
<l n="tr">By night he braved the strait which others feared</l>
<l n="tr">Though bidden: for he knew that daring deeds</l>
<l n="tr">Are safely wrought beneath the smile of heaven:</l>
<l n="tr">And thus he hoped in fragile boat to cross</l>
<l n="tr">The stormy billows fearful to a fleet.</l>
<l n="tr">Now gentle night had brought repose from arms;</l>
<l n="tr">And sleep, blest guardian of the poor man's couch,</l>
<l n="tr">Restored the weary; and the camp was still.</l>
<l n="tr">The hour was come that called the second watch</l>
<l n="tr">When mighty Caesar, in the silence vast</l>
<l n="tr">With cautious tread advanced to such a deed <note anchored="yes">Caesar himself says nothing of this adventure. But it is mentioned by <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>, Appian and Plutarch ('Caesar,' 38). Dean Merivale thinks the story may have been invented to introduce the apophthegm used by Caesar to the sailor, 'Fear nothing: you carry Caesar and his fortunes' (line 665 post). Mommsen accepts the story, as of an attempt which was only abandoned because no mariner could be induced to undertake it. Lucan colours it with his wildest and most exaggerated hyperbole.</note></l>
<l n="tr">As slaves should dare not. Fortune for his guide,</l>
<l n="tr">Alone he passes on, and o'er the guard</l>
<l n="tr">Stretched in repose he leaps, in secret wrath</l>
<l n="tr">At such a sleep. Pacing the winding beach,</l>
<l n="tr">Fast to a sea-worn rock he finds a boat</l>
<l n="tr">On ocean's marge afloat. Hard by on shore</l>
<l n="tr">Its master dwelt within his humble home.</l>
<l n="tr">No solid front it reared, for sterile rush</l>
<l n="tr">And marshy reed enwoven formed the walls,</l>
<l n="tr">Propped by a shallop with its bending sides</l>
<l n="tr">Turned upwards. Caesar's hand upon the door</l>
<l n="tr">Knocks twice and thrice until the fabric shakes.</l>
<l n="tr">Amyclas from his couch of soft seaweed</l>
<l n="tr">Arising, calls: ' What shipwrecked sailor seeks</l>
<l n="tr">'My humble home?      Who hopes for aid from me,</l>
<l n="tr">' By fates adverse compelled? ' He stirs the heap</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the hearth, until a tiny spark</l>
<l n="tr">Glows in the darkness, and throws wide the door.</l>
<l n="tr">Careless of war, he knew that civil strife</l>
<l n="tr">Stoops not to cottages. O!  happy life</l>
<l n="tr">That poverty affords!  great gift of heaven</l>
<l n="tr">Too little understood! what mansion wall,</l>
<l n="tr">What temple of the gods, would feel no fear</l>
<l n="tr">When Caesar called for entrance?  Then the chief:</l>
<l n="tr">' Enlarge thine hopes and look for better things.</l>
<l n="tr">' Do but my bidding, and on yonder shore</l>
<l n="tr">' Place me, and thou shalt cease from one poor boat</l>
<l n="tr">' To earn thy living; and in years to come</l>
<l n="tr">' Look for a rich old age: and trust thy fates</l>
<l n="tr">' To those high gods whose wont it is to bless</l>
<l n="tr">' The poor with sudden plenty.' So he spake</l>
<l n="tr">E'en at such time in accents of command,</l>
<l n="tr">For how could Caesar else?  Amyclas said,</l>
<l n="tr">''Twere dangerous to brave the deep to-night.</l>
<l n="tr">' The sun descended not in ruddy clouds</l>
<l n="tr">' Or peaceful rays to rest; part of his beams</l>
<l n="tr">' Presaged a southern gale, the rest proclaimed</l>
<l n="tr">' A northern tempest; and his middle orb,</l>
<l n="tr">' Shorn of its strength, permitted human eyes</l>
<l n="tr">' To gaze upon his grandeur; and the moon</l>
<l n="tr">' Rose not with silver horns upon the night</l>
<l n="tr">' Nor pure in middle space; her slender points</l>
<l n="tr">'Not drawn aright, but blushing with the track</l>
<l n="tr">' Of raging tempests, till her lurid light</l>
<l n="tr">'Was sadly veiled within the clouds. Again</l>
<l n="tr">' The forest sounds; the surf upon the shore;</l>
<l n="tr">' The dolphin's mood, uncertain where to play;</l>
<l n="tr">' The sea-mew on the land; the heron used</l>
<l n="tr">' To wade among the shallows, borne aloft</l>
<l n="tr">' And soaring on his wings-all these alarm;</l>
<l n="tr">' The raven, too, who plunged his head in spray,</l>
<l n="tr">' As if to anticipate the coming rain,</l>
<l n="tr">And trod the margin with unsteady gait.</l>
<l n="tr">But if the cause demands, behold me thine.</l>
<l n="tr">'Either we reach the bidden shore, or else</l>
<l n="tr">'Storm and the deep forbid-we can no more.'</l>
<l n="tr">Thus said he loosed the boat and raised the sail.</l>
<l n="tr">No sooner done than stars were seen to fall</l>
<l n="tr">In flaming furrows from the sky: nay, more;</l>
<l n="tr">The pole star trembled in its place on high:</l>
<l n="tr">Black horror marked the surging of the sea;</l>
<l n="tr">The main was boiling in long tracts of foam,</l>
<l n="tr">Uncertain of the wind, yet seized with storm.</l>
<l n="tr">Then spake the captain of the trembling bark:</l>
<l n="tr">See what remorseless ocean has in store!</l>
<l n="tr">Whether from east or west the storm may come</l>
<l n="tr">Is still uncertain, for as yet confused</l>
<l n="tr">'The billows tumble. Judged by clouds and sky</l>
<l n="tr">'A western tempest: by the murmuring deep</l>
<l n="tr">'A wild south-eastern gale shall sweep the sea.</l>
<l n="tr">'Nor bark nor man shall reach Hesperia's shore</l>
<l n="tr">In this wild rage of waters. To return</l>
<l n="tr">'Back on our course forbidden by the gods,</l>
<l n="tr">'Is our one refuge, and with labouring boat</l>
<l n="tr">'To reach the shore ere yet the nearest land</l>
<l n="tr">'May be too distant.'</l>
<l n="tr">But great Caesar's trust</l>
<l n="tr">Was in himself, to make all dangers yield.</l>
<l n="tr">And thus he answered: ' Scorn the threatening sea,</l>
<l n="tr">Spread out thy canvas to the raging wind;</l>
<l n="tr">If for thy pilot thou refusest heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">'Me in its stead receive. Alone in thee</l>
<l n="tr">One cause of terror just-thou dost not know</l>
<l n="tr">'Thy comrade, ne'er deserted by the gods,</l>
<l n="tr">'Whom fortune blesses e'en without a prayer.</l>
<l n="tr">'Break through the middle storm and trust in me.</l>
<l n="tr">'The burden of this fight falls not on us</l>
<l n="tr">But on the sky and ocean; and our bark</l>
<l n="tr">Shall swim the billows safe in him it bears.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor shall the wind rage long: the boat itself</l>
<l n="tr">Shall calm the waters. Flee the nearest shore,</l>
<l n="tr">Steer for the ocean with unswerving hand:</l>
<l n="tr">Then in the deep, when to our ship and us</l>
<l n="tr">No other port is given, believe thou hast</l>
<l n="tr">'<placeName key="tgn,7007850">Calabria</placeName>'s harbours. And dost thou not know</l>

<l n="tr">Swooped on the boat and tore away the sheet:</l>

<l n="tr">First Corus<note anchored="yes">Book I., 464.</note>  raised his head, and stirred the depths</l>
<l n="tr">To fury, and had forced upon the rocks</l>
<l n="tr">Whole seas and oceans; but the chilly north</l>
<l n="tr">Drove back the deep that doubted which was lord.</l>
<l n="tr">But Scythian Aquilo prevailed, whose blast</l>
<l n="tr">Tossed up the main and showed as shallow pools</l>
<l n="tr">Each deep abyss; and yet was not the sea</l>
<l n="tr">Heaped on the crags, for Corus' billows met</l>
<l n="tr">The waves of Boreas: such seas had clashed</l>
<l n="tr">Even were the winds withdrawn; Eurus enraged</l>
<l n="tr">Burst from the cave, and Notus black with rain,</l>
<l n="tr">And all the winds from every part of heaven</l>
<l n="tr">Strove for their own; and thus the ocean stayed</l>
<l n="tr">Within his boundaries. No petty seas</l>

<l n="tr">What lofty peaks did vanquished earth resign!</l>
<l n="tr">And yet on yonder coast such mighty waves</l>
<l n="tr">Took not their rise; from distant regions came</l>
<l n="tr">Those monster billows, driven on their course</l>
<l n="tr">By that great current which surrounds the world.<note anchored="yes">The ocean current, which, according to Hecataeus, surrounded the world. But Herodotus of this theory says, 'For my part I know of no river called Ocean, and I think that Homer or one of the earlier poets invented the name and introduced it into his poetry.' (Book II., 23, and Book IV., 36.) In 'Oceanus' Eschylus seems to have intended to personify the great surrounding stream. ('Prom. Vinc.,' lines 291, 308.)</note></l>
<l n="tr">Thus did the King of Heaven, when length of years</l>
<l n="tr">Wore out the forces of his thunder, call</l>
<l n="tr">His brother's trident to his help, what time</l>
<l n="tr">The earth and sea one second kingdom formed</l>
<l n="tr">And ocean knew no limit but the sky.</l>
<l n="tr">Now, too, the sea had risen to the stars</l>

<l n="tr">Came not, as others; but the murky air</l>
<l n="tr">Was dim with pallor of the realms below; <note anchored="yes">Comp. VI., 615.</note></l>
<l n="tr">The sky lay on the deep; within the clouds</l>
<l n="tr">The waves received the rain : the lightning flash</l>
<l n="tr">Clove through the parted air a path obscured</l>
<l n="tr">By mist and darkness: and the heavenly vaults</l>
<l n="tr">Re-echoed to the tumult, and the frame</l>
<l n="tr">That holds the sky was shaken. Nature feared</l>
<l n="tr">Chaos returned, as though the elements</l>
<l n="tr">Had burst their bonds, and night had come to mix</l>
<l n="tr">Th' infernal shades with heaven.</l>
<l n="tr">In such turmoil</l>
<l n="tr">Not to have perished was their only hope.</l>
<l n="tr">Far as from <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName> point the placid main</l>
<l n="tr">Spreads to the horizon, from the billow's crest</l>
<l n="tr">They viewed the dashing of th' infuriate sea;</l>
<l n="tr">Thence sinking to the middle trough, their mast</l>

<l n="tr">Their sails in clouds, their keel upon the ground.</l>
<l n="tr">For all the sea was piled into the waves,</l>
<l n="tr">And drawn from depths between laid bare the sand.</l>
<l n="tr">The master of the boat forgot his art,</l>
<l n="tr">For fear o'ercame; he knew not where to yield</l>
<l n="tr">Or where to meet the wave: but safety came</l>
<l n="tr">From ocean's self at war: one billow forced</l>
<l n="tr">The vessel under, but a huger wave</l>
<l n="tr">Repelled it upwards, and she rode the storm</l>

<l n="tr">Thinking the peril worthy of his fates:</l>
<l n="tr">Are such the labours of the gods? ' exclaimed,</l>
<l n="tr">Bent on my downfall have they sought me thus,</l>
<l n="tr">Here in this puny skiff in such a sea?</l>
<l n="tr">If to the deep the glory of my fall</l>
<l n="tr">Is due, and not to war, intrepid still</l>
<l n="tr">Whatever death they send shall strike me down.</l>
<l n="tr">Let fate cut short the deeds that I would do</l>
<l n="tr">And hasten on the end: the past is mine.</l>
<l n="tr">The northern nations fell beneath my sword;</l>
<l n="tr">'My dreaded name compels the foe to flee.</l>
<l n="tr">'Pompeius yields me place; the people's voice</l>
<l n="tr">Gave at my order what the wars denied.</l>
<l n="tr">And all the titles which denote the powers</l>
<l n="tr">Known to the Roman state my name shall bear.</l>
<l n="tr">Let none know this but thou who hear'st my prayers,</l>
<l n="tr">Fortune! that Caesar summoned to the shades,</l>
<l n="tr">Dictator, Consul, full of honours, died</l>
<l n="tr">Ere his last prize was won. I ask no pyre</l>
<l n="tr">Or tomb, ye gods! wherein my dust may rest:</l>
<l n="tr">Nay! plunge in middle deep this battered frame!</l>
<l n="tr">All earth shall look for me, nor shall men cease</l>
<l n="tr">At Caesar's name to fear.' Such words he spake,</l>
<l n="tr">When lo! a tenth gigantic billow raised</l>
<l n="tr">The feeble keel, and where between the rocks</l>
<l n="tr">A cleft gave safety, placed it on the shore.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus in a moment fortune, kingdoms, lands,</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Once more were Caesar's.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">But on his return</l>
<l n="tr">When daylight came, he entered not the camp</l>
<l n="tr">Silent as when he parted; for his friends</l>
<l n="tr">Soon pressed around him, and with weeping eyes</l>
<l n="tr">In accents welcome to his ears began:</l>
<l n="tr">'Whither in reckless daring hast thou gone,</l>
<l n="tr">Unpitying Caesar?  Were these humble lives</l>
<l n="tr">Left here unguarded while thy limbs were given,</l>
<l n="tr">Unsought for, to be scattered by the storm?</l>
<l n="tr">'When on thy breath so many nations hang</l>
<l n="tr">For life and safety, and so great a world</l>
<l n="tr">Calls thee its master, to have courted death</l>
<l n="tr">Proves want of heart. Were none of all thy friends</l>
<l n="tr">Deserving held to join their fate with thine?</l>
<l n="tr">'When thou wast tossed upon the stormy main</l>
<l n="tr">We lay in slumber! Shame upon such sleep!</l>
<l n="tr">'And why thyself didst seek <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italia</placeName>'s shores?</l>
<l n="tr">'"Twere cruel (such thy thought) to speak the word</l>
<l n="tr">That bade another dare the furious sea.</l>
<l n="tr">All men must bear what chance or fate may bring,</l>
<l n="tr">The sudden peril and the stroke of death;</l>
<l n="tr">But shall the ruler of the world attempt</l>
<l n="tr">'The raging ocean?  With incessant prayers</l>
<l n="tr">Why weary heaven?  is it indeed enough</l>
<l n="tr">To crown the war, that Fortune and the deep</l>
<l n="tr">'Have cast thee on our shores?  And wouldst thou use</l>
<l n="tr">'The grace of favouring deities, to gain</l>
<l n="tr">Not lordship, not the empire of the world,</l>
<l n="tr">'But lucky shipwreck! ' Night dispersed, and soon</l>
<l n="tr">The sun beamed on them, and the wearied deep,</l>
<l n="tr">The winds permitting, lulled its waves to rest.</l>
<l n="tr">And when Antonius saw a breeze arise</l>
<l n="tr">Fresh from a cloudless heaven, to break the sea,</l>
<l n="tr">He loosed his ships which, by the pilots' hands</l>
<l n="tr">And by the wind in equal order held,</l>
<l n="tr">Swept as a marching host across the main.</l>
<l n="tr">But night unfriendly from the seamen snatched</l>
<l n="tr">All governance of sail, parting the ships</l>
<l n="tr">In divers paths asunder.  Like as cranes</l>

<l n="tr">Strikes on their pinions tense, in loose array</l>
<l n="tr">Dispersed at large, in flight irregular,</l>
<l n="tr">They wing their journey onwards.  Stronger winds</l>
<l n="tr">With day returning blew the navy on,</l>
<l n="tr">Past <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>' shelter which they vainly sought,</l>

<l n="tr">When Caesar's troops were gathered in their strength</l>
<l n="tr">And Magnus saw the battle day was near</l>
<l n="tr">Before his camp, Cornelia he resolved</l>
<l n="tr">To send to <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>' shore, from rage of fight</l>
<l n="tr">Safe and apart: so lifting from his soul</l>
<l n="tr">The weight that burdened it. Thus, lawful Love,</l>
<l n="tr">Thus art thou tyrant o'er the mightiest mind!</l>
<l n="tr">His spouse was the one cause why Magnus stayed</l>
<l n="tr">Nor met his fortunes, though he staked the world</l>
<l n="tr">And all the destinies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The word</l>
<l n="tr">He speaks not though resolved; so sweet it seemed,</l>
<l n="tr">When on the future pondering, to gain</l>
<l n="tr">A pause from Fate!  But at the close of night,</l>
<l n="tr">When drowsy sleep had fled, Cornelia sought</l>
<l n="tr">To soothe the anxious bosom of her lord</l>
<l n="tr">And win his kisses; when amazed she saw</l>
<l n="tr">His cheek was tearful, and with boding soul</l>
<l n="tr">Shrank from the hidden wound, nor dared surprise</l>
<l n="tr">Magnus in tears. But sighing thus he spake:</l>
<l n="tr">' Dearer to me than life itself, when life</l>
<l n="tr">'Is happy (not at moments such as these);</l>
<l n="tr">'The day of sorrow comes, too long delayed,</l>
<l n="tr">'Nor long enough! With Caesar at our gates</l>
<l n="tr">' With all his forces, a secure retreat</l>
<l n="tr">'Shall Lesbos give thee. Try me not with prayers.</l>
<l n="tr">'This fatal boon I have denied myself.</l>
<l n="tr">'Thou wilt not long be absent from thy spouse.</l>
<l n="tr">'Disasters hasten, and things highest fall</l>
<l n="tr">With speediest ruin. 'Tis enough for thee</l>
<l n="tr">' To hear of Magnus' peril; and thy love</l>
<l n="tr">'Deceives thee with the thought that thou canst gaze</l>
<l n="tr">'Unmoved on civil strife. It shames my soul</l>
<l n="tr">'On the eve of war to slumber at thy side,</l>
<l n="tr">'And rise from thy dear breast when trumpets call</l>
<l n="tr">'A woeful world to misery and arms.</l>
<l n="tr">'I dread lest Magnus in this war endure</l>
<l n="tr">'Nor loss nor sorrow. But do thou lie hid</l>
<l n="tr">'Safer than kings or peoples, far removed;</l>
<l n="tr">'That so the grievous fortunes of thy lord</l>
<l n="tr">' May lighter fall on thee. If unkind heaven</l>
<l n="tr">' Our armies rout, still let my choicest part</l>
<l n="tr">' Survive in thee; if fated is my flight,</l>
<l n="tr">' Still leave me that whereto I fain would flee.'</l>
<l n="tr">Hardly at first her senses grasped the words</l>
<l n="tr">In their full misery; then her mind amazed</l>
<l n="tr">Could scarce find utterance for the grief that pressed.</l>
<l n="tr">Nought, Magnus, now is left wherewith to upbraid</l>
<l n="tr">'The gods and fates of marriage; 'tis not death</l>
<l n="tr">'That parts our love, nor yet the funeral pyre,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor that dread torch which marks the end of all.</l>
<l n="tr">I share the ignoble lot of vulgar lives:</l>
<l n="tr">'My spouse rejects me. Yes, the foe is come!</l>
<l n="tr">'Break we our bonds and Julia's sire appease! -</l>
<l n="tr">Is this thy consort, Magnus, this thy faith</l>
<l n="tr">'In her fond loving heart?  Can danger fright</l>
<l n="tr">'Her and not thee?  Long since our mutual fates</l>
<l n="tr">'Hang by one chain; and dost thou bid me now</l>
<l n="tr">'The thunder-bolts of ruin to withstand</l>
<l n="tr">Without thee?  Is it well that I should die</l>
<l n="tr">'Even while you pray for fortune?  And suppose</l>
<l n="tr">' I flee from evil and with death self-sought</l>
<l n="tr">' Follow thy footsteps to the realms below--</l>
<l n="tr">' Am I to live till to that distant isle</l>
<l n="tr">' Some tardy rumour of thy fall may come?</l>
<l n="tr">' And then thou say'st, unfeeling! that by use</l>
<l n="tr">' Strength shall be mine to bear such load of ills</l>
<l n="tr">' As fate reserves for us: but at such a strength</l>
<l n="tr">' My spirit trembles. Ah! forgive the truth.</l>
<l n="tr">' And if the favouring gods shall hear my prayers,</l>
<l n="tr">' I shall be last to hear the victory</l>
<l n="tr">' In that lone isle of rocks. When all are glad,</l>
<l n="tr">' My heart shall throb with anguish, and the sail</l>
<l n="tr">' Which brings the message I shall see with fear,</l>
<l n="tr">' Not safe e'en then: for Caesar in his flight</l>
<l n="tr">' Might seize me there, abandoned and alone</l>
<l n="tr">To be his hostage. If thou place me there,</l>
<l n="tr">The spouse of Magnus, shall not all the world</l>
<l n="tr">'Well know the secret <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName> holds?</l>
<l n="tr">This my last prayer: if all is lost but flight,</l>
<l n="tr">'And thou shalt seek the ocean, to my shores</l>
<l n="tr">'Turn not thy keel, ill-fated one: for there,</l>
<l n="tr">'There will they seek thee.' Thus she spoke distraught,</l>
<l n="tr">Leaped from the couch and rushed upon her fate;</l>
<l n="tr">No stop nor stay: she clung not to his neck</l>
<l n="tr">Nor threw her arms about him;  both forego</l>
<l n="tr">The last caress, the last fond pledge of love,</l>
<l n="tr">And grief rushed in unchecked upon their souls;</l>
<l n="tr">Still gazing as they part no final words</l>
<l n="tr">Could either utter, and the sweet Farewell</l>
<l n="tr">Remained unspoken. This the saddest day</l>
<l n="tr">Of all their lives: for other woes that came</l>
<l n="tr">More gently struck on hearts inured to grief.</l>
<l n="tr">Borne to the shore with failing limbs she fell</l>
<l n="tr">And grasped the sands, embracing, till at last</l>
<l n="tr">Her maidens placed her senseless in the ship.</l>
<l n="tr">Not in such grief she left her country's shores</l>
<l n="tr">When Caesar's host drew near; for now she leaves,</l>
<l n="tr">Though faithful to her lord, his side in flight</l>
<l n="tr">And flees her spouse. All that next night she waked;</l>
<l n="tr">Then first what means a widowed couch she knew,</l>
<l n="tr">Its cold, its solitude. When slumber found</l>
<l n="tr">Her eyelids, and forgetfulness her soul,</l>
<l n="tr">Seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved,</l>
<l n="tr">She grasps but air. Though tossed by restless love,</l>
<l n="tr">She leaves a place beside her as for him</l>
<l n="tr">Returning. Yet she feared Pompeius lost</l>
<l n="tr">To her for ever. Nay! such happy lot</l>
<l n="tr">The gods prepared not; for the hour drew near</l>
<l n="tr">Which gave her Magnus to her arms again.

<l n="tr">In all the parts of earth; the host foredoomed</l>
<l n="tr">To fall in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> or in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">Was here: in such small amphitheatre</l>
<l n="tr">The tide of civil passion rose and fell.</l>
<l n="tr">At first Pompeius knew not: so the hind</l>
<l n="tr">Who peaceful tills the mid-Sicilian fields</l>
<l n="tr">Hears not Pelorus <note anchored="yes">C. del <placeName key="tgn,1000852">Faro</placeName>, the N.E. point of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note>  sounding to the storm;</l>

<l n="tr">But when he saw the mighty barrier stretch</l>
<l n="tr">O'er hill and valley, and enclose the land,</l>
<l n="tr">He bade his columns leave their rocky hold</l>
<l n="tr">And seize on posts of vantage in the plain;</l>
<l n="tr">Thus forcing Caesar to extend his troops</l>
<l n="tr">On wider lines; and holding for his own</l>
<l n="tr">Such space encompassed as divides from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>

<l n="tr">Unless he deviate. No trumpet call</l>
<l n="tr">Commands an onset, and the darts that fly</l>
<l n="tr">Fly though forbidden; but the arm that flings</l>
<l n="tr">For proof the lance, at random, here and there</l>
<l n="tr">Deals impious slaughter. Weighty care compelled</l>
<l n="tr">Each leader to withhold his troops from fight;</l>
<l n="tr">For there the weary earth of produce failed</l>
<l n="tr">Pressed by Pompeius' steeds, whose horny hoofs</l>
<l n="tr">Rang in their gallop on the grassy fields</l>
<l n="tr">And killed the succulence. They strengthless lay</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the mown expanse, nor pile of straw,</l>
<l n="tr">Brought from full barns in place of living grass,</l>
<l n="tr">Relieved their craving; shook their panting flanks,</l>
<l n="tr">And as they wheeled Death struck his victim down.</l>
<l n="tr">Then foul contagion filled the murky air</l>
<l n="tr">Whose poisonous weight pressed on them in a cloud</l>
<l n="tr">Pestiferous; as in Nesis' isle <note anchored="yes">An island in the Bay of <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>.</note>  the breath</l>

<l n="tr">Then died the soldiers, for the streams they drank</l>
<l n="tr">Held yet more poison than the air: the skin</l>
<l n="tr">Was dark and rigid, and the fiery plague</l>
<l n="tr">Made hard their vitals, and with pitiless tooth</l>
<l n="tr">Gnawed at their wasted features, while their eyes</l>
<l n="tr">Started from out their sockets, and the head</l>
<l n="tr">Drooped from sheer weariness. So the disease</l>
<l n="tr">Grew swifter in its strides till scarce was room,</l>
<l n="tr">'Twixt life and death, for sickness, and the pest</l>
<l n="tr">Slew as it struck its victim, and the dead</l>
<l n="tr">Thrust from the tents (such all their burial) lay</l>
<l n="tr">Blent with the living. Yet their camp was pitched</l>
<l n="tr">Hard by the breezy sea by which might come</l>
<l n="tr">All nations' harvests, and the northern wind</l>
<l n="tr">Not seldom rolled the murky air away.</l>
<l n="tr">Their foe, not vexed with pestilential air</l>
<l n="tr">Nor stagnant waters, ample range enjoyed</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the spacious uplands: yet as though</l>
<l n="tr">In leaguer, famine seized them for its prey.</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce were the crops half grown when Caesar saw</l>
<l n="tr">How prone they seized upon the food of beasts,</l>
<l n="tr">And stripped of leaves the bushes and the groves,</l>
<l n="tr">And dragged from roots unknown the doubtful herb,</l>
<l n="tr">Which might be death: all things they ate that fire</l>
<l n="tr">May soften, or teeth may bite, or arid throat</l>
<l n="tr">May swallow; things that never heretofore</l>
<l n="tr">Were placed on tables-thus the host at large-</l>
<l n="tr">Yet was there plenty with the leaguered foe.
<milestone n="119" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="tr">When Magnus first was pleased to break his bonds,</l>
<l n="tr">No nightly dash he makes, by craft to seize</l>
<l n="tr">His sleeping foe unarmed: his soul had scorned</l>
<l n="tr">Such path obscure to victory. Twas his aim,</l>
<l n="tr">To lay the turrets low; to mark his track,</l>
<l n="tr">By ruin spread afar; and with the sword</l>
<l n="tr">To hew a path between his slaughtered foes.</l>
<l n="tr">Minucius'<note anchored="yes">This was Scaeva's name.</note>  turret was the chosen spot</l>
<l n="tr">Where groves of trees and thickets gave approach</l>
<l n="tr">Safe, unbetrayed by dust. Up from the fields</l>
<l n="tr">Flashed all at once his eagles into sight</l>
<l n="tr">And all his trumpets blared. But ere the sword</l>
<l n="tr">Could win the battle, on the hostile ranks</l>
<l n="tr">Dread panic fell; prone as in death they lay</l>
<l n="tr">Where else upright they should withstand the foe;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor more availed their valour, and in vain</l>
<l n="tr">The cloud of weapons flew, with none to slay.</l>
<l n="tr">Then blazing torches rolling pitchy flame</l>
<l n="tr">Are hurled, and shaken nod the lofty towers</l>
<l n="tr">And threaten ruin, and the bastions groan</l>
<l n="tr">Struck by the frequent engine, and the troops</l>
<l n="tr">Of Magnus by triumphant eagles led</l>
<l n="tr">Stride o'er the rampart, in their front the world.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet now that passage which not Caesar's self</l>
<l n="tr">Nor thousand valiant squadrons had availed</l>
<l n="tr">To rescue from their grasp, one man in arms</l>
<l n="tr">Steadfast till death refused them; Scaeva named</l>
<l n="tr">This hero soldier: long he served in fight</l>
<l n="tr">Waged 'gainst the savage on the banks of <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>;</l>
<l n="tr">And now centurion made, through deeds of blood,</l>
<l n="tr">He bore the staff<note anchored="yes">The vinewood staff was the badge of the centurion's office.</note>  before the marshalled line.</l>
<l n="tr">Prone to all wickedness, he little recked</l>
<l n="tr">How valourous deeds in civil war may be</l>
<l n="tr">Greatest of crimes; and when he saw how turned</l>
<l n="tr">His comrades fron the war and sought in flight</l>
<l n="tr">A refuge, ' Whence,' he cried, 'this impious fear</l>
<l n="tr">Unknown to Caesar's armies?  Do ye turn</l>
<l n="tr">'Your backs on death, and are ye not ashamed</l>
<l n="tr">Not to be found where slaughtered heroes lie?</l>
<l n="tr">'Is loyalty too weak?  Yet love of fight</l>
<l n="tr">'Might bid you stand. We are the chosen few</l>
<l n="tr">'Through whom the foe would break. Unbought by blood</l>
<l n="tr">'This day shall not be theirs. 'Neath Caesar's eye,</l>
<l n="tr">'True, death would be more happy; but this boon</l>
<l n="tr">'Fortune denies: at least my fall shall be</l>
<l n="tr">'Praised by Pompeius. Shatter with your breasts</l>
<l n="tr">' Their weapons; blunt the edges of their swords</l>
<l n="tr">' With throats unyielding. In the distant lines</l>
<l n="tr">' The dust is seen already, and the sound</l>
<l n="tr">' Of tumult and of ruin finds the ear</l>
<l n="tr">Of Caesar: strike; the victory is ours:</l>
<l n="tr">'For he shall come who while his soldiers die</l>
<l n="tr">Shall make the fortress his.' His voice calls forth</l>
<l n="tr">The courage that the trumpets failed to rouse</l>
<l n="tr">When first they rang: his comrades mustering come</l>
<l n="tr">To watch his deeds; and, wondering at the man,</l>
<l n="tr">To test if valour thus by foes oppressed,</l>
<l n="tr">In narrow space, could hope for aught but death.</l>
<l n="tr">But Scaeva standing on the tottering bank</l>
<l n="tr">Heaves from the brimming turret on the foe</l>
<l n="tr">The corpses of the fallen; the ruined mass</l>
<l n="tr">Gives weapons to his hands; with beams and poles</l>
<l n="tr">And ponderous stones, with his own breast he threats</l>
<l n="tr">His enemies; and thrusts with mighty stakes</l>
<l n="tr">The host advancing; when they grasp the wall</l>
<l n="tr">He lops the arm: rocks crush the foeman's skull</l>
<l n="tr">And rive the scalp asunder: fiery bolts</l>
<l n="tr">Dashed at another set his hair aflame,</l>
<l n="tr">Till rolls the greedy blaze about his eyes</l>
<l n="tr">With hideous crackle. As the pile of slain</l>
<l n="tr">Rose to the summit of the wall he sprang,</l>
<l n="tr">Swift as across the nets a hunted pard,</l>
<l n="tr">Above the swords upraised, till in mid throng</l>
<l n="tr">Of foes he stood, hemmed in by densest ranks</l>
<l n="tr">And ramparted by war; in front and rear,</l>
<l n="tr">Where'er he struck, the victor. Now his sword</l>
<l n="tr">Blunted with gore congealed no more could wound,</l>
<l n="tr">But brake the stricken limb; while every hand</l>
<l n="tr">Flung every quivering dart at him alone;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor missed their aim, for rang against his shield</l>
<l n="tr">Dart after dart unerring, and his helm</l>
<l n="tr">In broken fragments pressed upon his brow;</l>
<l n="tr">His vital parts were safeguarded by spears</l>
<l n="tr">That bristled in his body. Fortune saw</l>
<l n="tr">Thus waged a novel combat, for there warred</l>
<l n="tr">Against one man an army. Why with darts,</l>
<l n="tr">Madmen, assail him and with slender shafts,</l>
<l n="tr">'Gainst which his life is proof? Or ponderous stones</l>
<l n="tr">This warrior chief shall overwhelm, or bolts</l>
<l n="tr">Flung by the twisted thongs of mighty slings.</l>
<l n="tr">Let steel-shod ram or catapult remove</l>
<l n="tr">This champion of the gate. No fragile wall</l>
<l n="tr">Stands here for Caesar, blocking with its bulk</l>
<l n="tr">Pompeius' way to freedom. Now he trusts</l>
<l n="tr">His shield no more, lest his sinister hand,</l>
<l n="tr">Idle, give life by shame; and on his breast</l>
<l n="tr">Bearing a forest of spears, though spent with toil</l>
<l n="tr">And worn with onset, falls upon his foe</l>
<l n="tr">And braves alone the wounds of all the war.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus may an elephant in Afric wastes,</l>
<l n="tr">Oppressed by frequent darts, break those that fall</l>
<l n="tr">Rebounding from his horny hide, and shake</l>
<l n="tr">Those that find lodgment, while his life within</l>
<l n="tr">Lies safe, protected, nor does spear avail</l>
<l n="tr">To reach the fount of blood. Unnumbered wounds</l>
<l n="tr">By arrow dealt, or lance, thus fail to slay</l>
<l n="tr">This single warrior. But lo! from far</l>
<l n="tr">A Cretan archer's shaft, more sure of aim</l>
<l n="tr">Than vows could hope for, strikes on Scaeva's brow</l>
<l n="tr">To light within his eye: the hero tugs</l>
<l n="tr">Intrepid, bursts the nerves, and tears the shaft</l>
<l n="tr">Forth with the eyeball, and with dauntless heel</l>
<l n="tr">Treads them to dust. Not otherwise a bear</l>
<l n="tr">Pannonian, fiercer for the wound received,</l>
<l n="tr">Maddened by dart from Libyan thong propelled,</l>
<l n="tr">Turns circling on her wound, and still pursues</l>
<l n="tr">The weapon fleeing as she whirls around.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus, in his rage destroyed, his shapeless face</l>
<l n="tr">Stood foul with crimson flow. The victors' shout</l>
<l n="tr">Glad to the sky arose; no greater joy</l>
<l n="tr">A little blood could give them had they seen</l>
<l n="tr">That Caesar's self was wounded. Down he pressed</l>
<l n="tr">Deep in his soul the anguish, and, with mien</l>
<l n="tr">No longer bent on fight, submissive cried,</l>
<l n="tr">Spare me, ye citizens; remove the war</l>
<l n="tr">Far hence: no weapons now can haste my death;</l>
<l n="tr">Draw from my breast the darts, but add no more.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet raise me up to place me in the camp</l>
<l n="tr">Of Magnus, living: this your gift to him;</l>
<l n="tr">No brave man's death my title to renown,</l>
<l n="tr">But Caesar's flag deserted.' So he spake.</l>
<l n="tr">Unhappy Aulus thought his words were true,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor saw within his hand the ready sword;</l>
<l n="tr">And leaping forth in haste to make his own</l>
<l n="tr">The prisoner and his arms, in middle throat</l>
<l n="tr">Received the lightning blade. By this one death</l>
<l n="tr">Rose Scaeva's valour again; and thus he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">Such be the punishment of all who thought</l>
<l n="tr">Great Scaeva vanquished; if Pompeius seeks</l>
<l n="tr">Peace from this reeking sword, low let him lay</l>
<l n="tr">' At Caesar's feet his standards. Me do ye think</l>
<l n="tr">' Such as yourselves, and slow to meet the fates?</l>
<l n="tr">'Your love for Magnus and the Senate's cause</l>
<l n="tr">'Is less than mine for death.' These were his words;</l>
<l n="tr">And dust in columns proved that Caesar came.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus was Pompeius' glory spared the stain</l>
<l n="tr">Of flight compelled by Scava. He, when ceased</l>
<l n="tr">The battle, fell, no more by rage of fight,</l>
<l n="tr">Or sight of blood out-pouring from his wounds,</l>
<l n="tr">Roused to the combat. Fainting there he lay</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the shoulders of his comrades borne,</l>
<l n="tr">Who him adoring (as though deity</l>
<l n="tr">Dwelt in his bosom) for his matchless deeds,</l>
<l n="tr">Plucked forth the gory shafts and took his arms</l>
<l n="tr">To deck the gods and shield the breast of Mars.</l>
<l n="tr">Thrice happy thou with such a name achieved,</l>
<l n="tr">Had but the fierce Iberian from thy sword,</l>
<l n="tr">Or heavy shielded Teuton, or had fled</l>
<l n="tr">The light Cantabrian: now no spoils of thine</l>
<l n="tr">Shall deck the Thunderer's temple, nor upraise</l>
<l n="tr">The shout of triumph in the ways of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">For all thy prowess, all thy deeds of pride</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Do but prepare her lord.
<milestone n="263" unit="card"/></l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Nor on this hand</l>
<l n="tr">Repulsed, Pompeius idly ceased from war,</l>
<l n="tr">Content within his bars; but as the sea</l>
<l n="tr">Tireless, which tempests force upon the crag</l>
<l n="tr">That breaks it, or which gnaws a mountain side</l>
<l n="tr">Some day to fall in ruin on itself;</l>
<l n="tr">He sought the turrets nearest to the main,</l>
<l n="tr">On double onset bent; nor closely kept</l>
<l n="tr">His troops in hand, but on the spacious plain</l>
<l n="tr">Spread forth his camp. They joyful leave the tents</l>
<l n="tr">And wander at their will. Thus <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> flows</l>
<l n="tr">In brimming flood, and foaming at his bounds,</l>
<l n="tr">Making whole districts quake; and should the bank</l>
<l n="tr">Fail 'neath his swollen waters, all his stream</l>
<l n="tr">Breaks forth in swirling eddies over fields</l>
<l n="tr">Not his before; some lands are lost, the rest</l>
<l n="tr">Gain from his bounty.</l>
<l n="tr">Hardly from his tower</l>
<l n="tr">Had Caesar seen the fire or known the fight:</l>
<l n="tr">And coming found the rampart overthrown,</l>
<l n="tr">The dust no longer stirred, the ruins cold</l>
<l n="tr">As from a battle done. The peace that reigned</l>
<l n="tr">There and on Magnus' side, as though men slept,</l>
<l n="tr">Their victory won, aroused his angry soul.</l>
<l n="tr">Quick he prepares, so that he end their joy</l>
<l n="tr">Careless of slaughter or defeat, to rush</l>
<l n="tr">With threatening columns on Torquatus' post.</l>
<l n="tr">But swift as sailor, by his trembling mast</l>
<l n="tr">Warned of Circeian tempest, furls his sails,</l>
<l n="tr">So swift Torquatus saw, and prompt to wage</l>
<l n="tr">The war more closely, he withdrew his men</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Within a narrower wall.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Now past the trench</l>
<l n="tr">Were Caesar's companies, when from the hills</l>
<l n="tr">Pompeius hurled his host upon their ranks</l>
<l n="tr">Shut in, and hampered. Not so much o'erwhelmed</l>
<l n="tr">As Caesar's soldiers is the hind who dwells</l>
<l n="tr">On <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Etna</placeName>'s slopes, when blows the southern wind,</l>
<l n="tr">And all the mountain pours its cauldrons forth</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the vale; and huge Enceladus <note anchored="yes">This giant, like Typhon, was buried under <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Mount Etna</placeName>.</note></l>
<l n="tr">Writhing beneath his load spouts o'er the plains</l>
<l n="tr">A blazing torrent. Blinded by the dust,</l>
<l n="tr">Encircled, vanquished, ere the fight, they fled</l>
<l n="tr">In cloud of terror on their rearward foe,</l>
<l n="tr">So rushing on their fates. Thus had the war</l>
<l n="tr">Shed its last drop of blood and peace ensued,</l>
<l n="tr">But Magnus suffered not, and held his troops</l>
<l n="tr">Back from the battle.</l>
<l n="tr">Thou, O <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, hadst been</l>

<l n="tr">'Of all the Roman host on yonder plain</l>

<l n="tr">Extort the truth, or, if thou spare the gods,</l>
<l n="tr">Force it from hell itself. Fling back the gates</l>
<l n="tr">That bar th' Elysian fields; let Death confess</l>
<l n="tr">'Whom from our ranks he seeks. No humble task</l>
<l n="tr">I bring, but worthy of Erichtho's skill</l>
<l n="tr">Of such a struggle fought for such a prize</l>
<l n="tr">To search and tell the issue.'</l>
<l n="tr">Then the witch</l>
<l n="tr">Pleased that her impious fame was noised abroad</l>
<l n="tr">Thus made her answer : 'If some lesser fates</l>
<l n="tr">'Thy wish had been to change, against their wish</l>
<l n="tr">'It had been easy to compel the gods</l>
<l n="tr">'To its accomplishment. My art has power</l>
<l n="tr">When of one man the constellations press</l>
<l n="tr">The speedy death, to compass a delay;.</l>
<l n="tr">And mine it is, though every star decrees</l>
<l n="tr">A ripe old age, by mystic herbs to shear</l>
<l n="tr">The life midway. But should some purpose set</l>
<l n="tr">From the beginning of the universe,</l>
<l n="tr">And all the labouring fortunes of mankind,</l>
<l n="tr">'Be brought in question, then Thessalian art</l>
<l n="tr">'Bows to the power supreme. But if thou be</l>
<l n="tr">Content to know the issue pre-ordained,</l>
<l n="tr">'Simple the task and plain; for earth and air</l>
<l n="tr">And sea and space and Rhodopaean crags</l>
<l n="tr">'Shall speak the future. Yet it easiest seems</l>
<l n="tr">Where death in these Thessalian fields abounds <note anchored="yes">The poet fills the plain with dead before the battle is fought.</note></l>
<l n="tr">'To raise a single corpse. From dead men's lips</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce cold, in fuller accents falls the voice;</l>
<l n="tr">Not from some mummied frame in accents shrill</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Uncertain to the ear.'
<milestone n="624" unit="card"/></l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Thus spake the hag</l>
<l n="tr">And through redoubled night, a squalid veil</l>
<l n="tr">Swathing her pallid features, stole among</l>
<l n="tr">Unburied carcases. Fast fled the wolves,</l>
<l n="tr">The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied</l>
<l n="tr">Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step</l>
<l n="tr">She sought her prophet. Firm must be the flesh</l>
<l n="tr">As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs</l>
<l n="tr">Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung</l>
<l n="tr">The fates of slain unnumbered;  had she striven</l>
<l n="tr">Armies to raise and order back to life</l>
<l n="tr">Whole ranks of warriors, the laws had failed</l>
<l n="tr">Of Erebus; and, summoned up from <placeName key="tgn,1130355">Styx</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">Its ghostly tenants had obeyed her call,</l>
<l n="tr">And rising fought once more. At length the witch</l>
<l n="tr">Picks out her victim with pierced throat agape</l>
<l n="tr">Fit for her purpose. Gripped by pitiless hook</l>
<l n="tr">O'er rocks she drags him to the mountain cave</l>
<l n="tr">Accursed by her fell rites, that shall restore</l>
<l n="tr">The dead man's life. Close to the hidden brink</l>
<l n="tr">The land that girds the precipice of hell</l>
<l n="tr">Sinks towards the depths: with ever falling leaves</l>
<l n="tr">A wood o'ershadows, and a spreading yew</l>
<l n="tr">Casts shade impenetrable. Foul decay</l>
<l n="tr">Fills all the space, and in the deep recess</l>
<l n="tr">Darkness unbroken, save by chanted spells,</l>
<l n="tr">Reigns ever. Not where gape the misty jaws</l>
<l n="tr">Of caverned Taenarus, the gloomy bound</l>
<l n="tr">Of either world, through which the nether kings</l>
<l n="tr">Permit the passage of the dead to earth,</l>
<l n="tr">So poisonous, mephitic, hangs the air.</l>
<l n="tr">Nay, though the witch had power to call the shades</l>
<l n="tr">Forth from the depths, 'twas doubtful if the cave</l>
<l n="tr">Were not a part of hell. Discordant hues</l>
<l n="tr">Flamed on her garb as by a fury worn;</l>
<l n="tr">Bare was her visage, and upon her brow</l>
<l n="tr">Dread vipers hissed, beneath her streaming locks</l>
<l n="tr">In sable coils entwined. But when she saw</l>
<l n="tr">The youth's companions trembling, and himself</l>
<l n="tr">With eyes cast down, with visage as of death,</l>
<l n="tr">Thus spake the witch: ' Forbid your craven souls</l>
<l n="tr">'These fears to cherish: soon returning life</l>
<l n="tr">'This frame shall quicken, and in tones which reach</l>
<l n="tr">Even the timorous ear shall speak the man.</l>
<l n="tr">'If I have power the Stygian lakes to show,</l>
<l n="tr">The bank that sounds with fire, the fury band,</l>
<l n="tr">'And giants fettered, and the hound that shakes</l>
<l n="tr">'Bristling with heads of snakes his triple head,</l>
<l n="tr">What fear is this that cringes at the sight</l>
<l n="tr">Of timid shivering shades? '</l>
<l n="tr">Then to her prayer.</l>
<l n="tr">First through his gaping bosom blood she pours</l>
<l n="tr">Still fervent, washing from his wounds the gore.</l>
<l n="tr">Then copious poisons from the moon distils</l>
<l n="tr">Mixed with all monstrous things which Nature's pangs</l>
<l n="tr">Bring to untimely birth; the froth from dogs</l>
<l n="tr">Stricken with madness, foaming at the stream;</l>
<l n="tr">A lynx's entrails: and the knot that grows</l>

<l n="tr">Snatched from an altar where the Phoenix died.</l>
<l n="tr">And viler poisons many, which herself</l>

<l n="tr">More potent than all herbs to charm the gods</l>
<l n="tr">Who rule in Lethe. Dissonant murmurs first</l>
<l n="tr">And sounds discordant from the tongues of men</l>
<l n="tr">She utters, scarce articulate: the bay</l>
<l n="tr">Of wolves, and barking as of dogs, were mixed</l>
<l n="tr">With that fell chant; the screech of nightly owl</l>
<l n="tr">Raising her hoarse complaint; the howl of beast</l>
<l n="tr">And sibilant hiss of snake-all these were there;</l>
<l n="tr">And more-the wail of waters on the rock,</l>
<l n="tr">The sound of forests and the thunder peal.</l>
<l n="tr">Such was her voice; but soon in clearer tones</l>
<l n="tr">Reaching to Tartarus, she raised her song:</l>
<l n="tr">' Ye awful goddesses, avenging power</l>

<l n="tr">And peoples, eager for their distant homes,</l>
<l n="tr">Already murmured at the lengthy war.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus has it pleased the gods, when woe impends</l>

<l n="tr">But Caesar's reeked with slaughter and with guilt.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor Fortune lingered, but decreed the doom</l>
<l n="tr">Which swept the ruins of a world away.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon as withdrawn from all the spacious plain,</l>
<l n="tr">Pompeius' horse was ranged upon the flanks;</l>
<l n="tr">Passed through the outer files, the lighter armed</l>

<l n="tr">Behind the standards Caesar in reserve</l>

<l n="tr">The foremost ranks might waver. These at his word,</l>
<l n="tr">No trumpet sounding, break upon the ranks</l>
<l n="tr">Of Magnus' horsemen where they rode at large</l>
<l n="tr">Flanking the battle. They, unshamed of fear</l>
<l n="tr">And careless of the fray, when first a steed</l>
<l n="tr">Pierced through by javelin spurned with sounding hoof</l>
<l n="tr">The temples of his rider, turned the rein,</l>
<l n="tr">And through their comrades spurring from the field</l>
<l n="tr">In panic, proved that not with warring <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">Barbarians may grapple. Then arose</l>
<l n="tr">Immeasurable carnage: here the sword,</l>
<l n="tr">There stood the victim, and the victor's arm</l>

<l n="tr">Already flaming with the rage of war,</l>
<l n="tr">That each might bear his portion of the guilt</l>
<l n="tr">Which stained the host, unflinching through the ranks</l>
<l n="tr">Passed at his will. He looked upon the brands,</l>

<l n="tr">Caesar supplies the weapon and bids strike</l>

<l n="tr">Urges the flagging ranks and stirs the fight.</l>
<l n="tr">Where flows the nation's blood, where beats the heart,</l>
<l n="tr">Knowing, he bids them spare the common herd,</l>

<l n="tr">Where was thy sword?  <note anchored="yes">Plutarch states that Brutus after the battle escaped and made his way to Larissa, whence he wrote to Caesar. Caesar, pleased that he was alive, asked him to come to him; and it was on Brutus' opinion that Caesar determined to hurry to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> as the most probable refuge of Pompeius. Caesar entrusted Brutus with the command of Cisalpine Gaul when he was in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>.</note>  Veiled by a common helm</l>
<l n="tr">Unknown thou wanderest. Thy country's pride,</l>

<l part="F" n="tr">There upon the field</l>
<l n="tr">Lay all the honour of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; no common stream</l>
<l n="tr">Mixed with the purple tide.   And yet of all</l>
<l n="tr">Who noble fell, one only now I sing,</l>
<l n="tr">Thee, brave Domitius.<note anchored="yes">'He perished, after a career of furious partisanship, disgraced with cruelty and treachery, on the field of Pharsalia' (Merivale, 'Hist. Romans under the Empire,' chapter lii.). Unless this man had been an ancestor of Nero it is impossible to suppose that Lucan would have thus singled him out. But he appears to have been the only leader who fell. (Compare Book II., lines 534-590, for his conduct at <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>.)</note>  Whene'er the day</l>
<l n="tr">Was adverse to the fortunes of thy chief</l>
<l n="tr">Thine was the arm which vainly stayed the fight.</l>
<l n="tr">Vanquished so oft by Caesar, now 'twas thine</l>
<l n="tr">Yet free to perish. By a thousand wounds</l>
<l n="tr">Came welcome death, nor had thy conqueror power</l>
<l n="tr">Again to pardon. Caesar stood and saw</l>
<l n="tr">The dark blood welling forth and death at hand,</l>
<l n="tr">And thus in words of scorn: ' And dost thou lie,</l>
<l n="tr">'Domitius, there?  And did Pompeius name</l>
<l n="tr">'Thee his successor, thee?  Why leavest thou then</l>
<l n="tr">His standards helpless?' But the parting life</l>
<l n="tr">Still faintly throbbed within Domitius' breast,</l>
<l n="tr">Thus finding utterance: 'Yet thou hast not won</l>
<l n="tr">Thy hateful prize, for doubtful are the fates;</l>
<l n="tr">'Nor thou the master, Caesar; free as yet,</l>
<l n="tr">'With great Pompeius for my leader still,</l>
<l n="tr">' Warring no more, I seek the silent shades,</l>
<l n="tr">Yet with this hope in death, that thou subdued</l>
<l n="tr">'To Magnus and to me in grievous guise</l>
<l n="tr">'Mayst pay atonement.' So he spake: no more;</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Then closed his eyes in death.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">'Twere shame to shed,</l>
<l n="tr">When thus a world was perishing, the tear</l>
<l n="tr">Meet for each fate, or sing the wound that reft</l>
<l n="tr">Each life away. One spurned upon the soil</l>
<l n="tr">His vitals as they trailed; one faced the foe</l>
<l n="tr">And as the sword struck deep into his throat</l>
<l n="tr">Breathed forth his life: another fell to earth</l>
<l n="tr">Prone at the stroke; one stood though shorn of limb;</l>
<l n="tr">Glanced from this breast unharmed the quivering spear;</l>
<l n="tr">That it transfixed to earth. Here from the veins</l>
<l n="tr">Spouted the life-blood, till the foeman's arms</l>
<l n="tr">Were crimsoned. One his brother slew, nor dared</l>
<l n="tr">To spoil the corse, till severed from the neck</l>
<l n="tr">He flung the head afar. Another dashed</l>
<l n="tr">Full in his father's teeth the fatal sword,</l>
<l n="tr">By murderous frenzy striving to disprove</l>
<l n="tr">His kinship with the slain. Yet for each death</l>
<l n="tr">We find no separate dirge, nor weep for men</l>
<l n="tr">When peoples fell. Thus, <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, thy doom was wrought</l>
<l n="tr">At dread <placeName key="tgn,7010797">Pharsalus</placeName>. Not, as in other fields,</l>

<l n="tr">Gushing in torrents forth, forbade the rest</l>
<l n="tr">To stagnate on the plain. Nor life was reft,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor safety only then; but reeled the world</l>
<l n="tr">And all her manifold peoples at the blow</l>
<l n="tr">In that day's battle dealt; nor only then</l>
<l n="tr">Felt, but in all the times that were to come.</l>
<l n="tr">Those swords gave servitude to every age</l>
<l n="tr">That shall be slavish; by our sires was shaped</l>
<l n="tr">For us our destiny, the despot yoke.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet have we trembled not, nor feared to bare</l>
<l n="tr">Our throats to slaughter, nor to face the foe:</l>
<l n="tr">We bear the penalty for others' shame,</l>
<l n="tr">Such be our doom; yet, Fortune, sharing not</l>
<l n="tr">In that last battle, 'twas our right to strike</l>
<l n="tr">One blow for freedom ere we served our lord.

<l n="tr">Now saw Pompeius, grieving, that the gods</l>
<l n="tr">Had left his side, and knew the fates of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">Passed from his governance; yet all the blood</l>
<l n="tr">That filled the field scarce brought him to confess</l>
<l n="tr">His fortunes fled. A little hill he sought</l>
<l n="tr">Whence to descry the battle raging still</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the plain, which when he nearer stood</l>
<l n="tr">The warring ranks concealed. Thence did the chief</l>
<l n="tr">Gaze on unnumbered swords that flashed in air</l>
<l n="tr">And sought his ruin; and the tide of blood</l>
<l n="tr">In which his host had perished. Yet not as those</l>
<l n="tr">Who, prostrate fallen, would drag nations down</l>
<l n="tr">To share their evil fate, Pompeius did.</l>
<l n="tr">Still were the gods thought worthy of his prayers</l>
<l n="tr">To give him solace, in that after him</l>
<l n="tr">Might live his Romans.  'Spare, ye gods,' he said,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor lay whole peoples low; my fall attained,</l>
<l n="tr">The world and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> may stand. And if ye need</l>
<l n="tr">More bloodshed, here on me, my wife, and sons</l>
<l n="tr">'Wreak out your vengeance-pledges to the fates</l>
<l n="tr">Such have we given. Too little for the war</l>
<l n="tr">Is our destruction?  Doth the carnage fail,</l>
<l n="tr">The world escaping?  Magnus' fortunes lost,</l>
<l n="tr">Why doom all else beside him? ' Thus he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">And passed amid his standards, and recalled</l>
<l n="tr">His vanquished host that rushed on fate declared.</l>
<l n="tr">Not for his sake such carnage should be wrought.</l>
<l n="tr">So thought Pompeius; nor the foeman's sword</l>
<l n="tr">He feared, nor death; but lest upon his fall</l>
<l n="tr">To quit their chief his soldiers might refuse,</l>
<l n="tr">And o'er his prostrate corpse a world in arms</l>
<l n="tr">Might find its ruin: or perchance he wished</l>
<l n="tr">From Caesar's eager eyes to veil his death.</l>
<l n="tr">In vain, unhappy!  for the fates decree</l>
<l n="tr">He shall behold, shorn from the bleeding trunk,</l>
<l n="tr">Again thy visage. And thou, too, his spouse,</l>

<l n="tr">Thy longed-for features; yet he shall not die</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">When thou art present.<note anchored="yes">This appears to be the only possible meaning of the text. But in truth, although Cornelia was not by her husband's side at his murder, she was present at the scene.</note></l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Then upon his steed,</l>
<l n="tr">Though fearing not the weapons at his back,</l>
<l n="tr">Pompeius fled, his mighty soul prepared</l>
<l n="tr">To meet his final doom. He saw thy field,</l>

<l n="tr">No pride in him the day of victory found,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor rout shall find despair; alike in days</l>

<l n="tr">Hope now has fled; but in the fleeting past</l>
<l n="tr">How wast thou great! Seek thou the wars no more,</l>
<l n="tr">And call the gods to witness that for thee</l>
<l n="tr">Henceforth no man shall die. The fights to come</l>

<l n="tr">Of dire <placeName key="tgn,2578319">Pharsalia</placeName>'s battle are not thine.</l>
<l n="tr">Thy name no more shall stir the world to war,</l>
<l n="tr">But those great rivals biding with us yet,</l>
<l n="tr">Caesar and Liberty; and not for thee</l>
<l n="tr">When thou hadst fled the field, but for itself</l>
<l n="tr">The dying Senate still upheld the fight.</l>
<l n="tr">Find'st thou not solace thus to quit the field</l>
<l n="tr">Nor witness all the horrors of its close?</l>
<l n="tr">Look back upon the crimsoned ranks of war,</l>
<l n="tr">The rivers turbid with ensanguined stream;</l>
<l n="tr">Then pity thou thy kinsman. How shall he</l>
<l n="tr">Enter the city, who on such a field</l>
<l n="tr">Finds happiness?  Whate'er in lands unknown</l>
<l n="tr">Thine exiled lot, whate'er the Pharian king</l>
<l n="tr">May place upon thee, trust thou in the gods;</l>
<l n="tr">Trust the long story of the favouring fates:</l>
<l n="tr">'Twere worse to conquer. Then forbid the tear,</l>
<l n="tr">The nation's grief, the weeping of mankind,</l>
<l n="tr">And let the world adore thee in defeat</l>

<l n="tr">Larissa first was witness of thy fall,</l>

<l n="tr">Fit for a conqueror flung back her gates</l>

<l n="tr">Trod deep in piles of slaughter on the field,</l>
<l n="tr">His country's vitals, while his daughter's spouse</l>
<l n="tr">Thus gave him kingdoms. But Pompeius fled</l>

<milestone n="728" unit="card"/></l>
<l part="F" n="tr">When Italian blood</l>
<l n="tr">Flowed deep enough upon the fatal field,</l>
<l n="tr">Caesar gave mercy to the meaner crowd</l>
<l n="tr">Whose deaths were vain. But that the hostile camp</l>
<l n="tr">Might not recall the foe, nor calm of night</l>
<l n="tr">Banish their fears, he bids his cohorts dash,</l>
<l n="tr">While Fortune glowed and terror filled the plain,</l>
<l n="tr">Straight on the ramparts of the conquered foe.</l>
<l n="tr">Light was the task to urge them to the spoil</l>
<l n="tr">Though worn by battle, wearied with the fray:</l>
<l n="tr">Soldiers,' he said, ' the victory is ours,</l>
<l n="tr">Full and triumphant: there doth lie the prize</l>
<l n="tr">Which you have won, not Caesar; at your feet</l>

<l n="tr">E'en now the vanquished of <placeName key="tgn,2578319">Pharsalia</placeName>'s field</l>
<l n="tr">Anticipate your spoils.' No more he said,</l>
<l n="tr">But drave them, blind with frenzy for the gold,</l>
<l n="tr">To spurn the bodies of their fallen sires,</l>
<l n="tr">And trample chiefs in dashing on their prey.</l>
<l n="tr">What rampart had restrained them as they rushed</l>
<l n="tr">To seize the prize for wickedness and war</l>
<l n="tr">And learn the price of guilt? And though they found</l>
<l n="tr">In ponderous masses heaped for need of war</l>
<l n="tr">The trophies of a world, yet were their minds</l>
<l n="tr">Unsatisfied, that asked for all. Whate'er</l>

<l n="tr">Or Arimaspians from golden sands</l>

<l n="tr">Their guilt too cheaply sold. When pledged to them</l>
<l n="tr">Was the Tarpeian rock, for victory won,</l>
<l n="tr">And all the spoils of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, by Caesar's word,</l>
<l n="tr">Shall camps suffice them?  Then plebeian limbs</l>
<l n="tr">On senators' turf took rest, on kingly couch</l>
<l n="tr">The soldier wretch; and there the murderer lay</l>
<l n="tr">Where yesternight his brother or his sire.</l>
<l n="tr">In maddened dreams the fury of the fight</l>
<l n="tr">Still raged, and in their sleep the guilty hand</l>
<l n="tr">Still wrought its deed, of blood, and restless gripped</l>
<l n="tr">The phantom sword-hilt. Thou hadst said that groans</l>
<l n="tr">Issued from all the plain, that parted souls</l>
<l n="tr">Had breathed a life into the guilty soil,</l>
<l n="tr">That earthly darkness teemed with gibbering ghosts</l>
<l n="tr">And Stygian terrors. Victory foully won</l>
<l n="tr">Thus claimed its punishment. The slumbering sense</l>
<l n="tr">Already heard the hiss of vengeful flames:</l>
<l n="tr">There troop the ghostly slain: a slaughtered sire</l>
<l n="tr">Tortures the breast of one; a brother's shape</l>
<l n="tr">There haunts his murderer's couch: each sees the form</l>
<l n="tr">Of him whose life he took. But all the dead</l>

<l n="tr">Pompeius, aiming for Haemonian glens</l>
<l n="tr">And forests lone, urged on his wearied steed</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce heeding now the spur; by devious tracks</l>
<l n="tr">Seeking to veil the footsteps of his flight:</l>
<l n="tr">The rustle of the foliage, and the noise</l>
<l n="tr">Of following comrades filled his anxious soul</l>
<l n="tr">With terrors, as he fancied at his side</l>
<l n="tr">Some ambushed enemy. Fallen from the height</l>
<l n="tr">Of former fortunes, still the chieftain knew</l>
<l n="tr">His life not worthless; mindful of the fates:</l>
<l n="tr">And 'gainst the price he set on Caesar's head,</l>
<l n="tr">He measures Caesar's value of his own.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet, as he rode, the features of the chief</l>
<l n="tr">Made known his ruin. Many as they sought</l>
<l n="tr">The camp Pharsalian, ere yet was spread</l>
<l n="tr">News of the battle, met the chief, amazed,</l>
<l n="tr">And wondered at the whirl of human things:</l>
<l n="tr">Nor held disaster sure, though Magnus' self</l>
<l n="tr">Told of his ruin. Every witness seen</l>
<l n="tr">Brought peril on his flight: 'twere better far</l>

<l n="tr">Too long had great Pompeius from the height</l>
<l n="tr">Of human glory, envied of mankind,</l>
<l n="tr">Looked on all others; nor for him henceforth</l>
<l n="tr">Could life be lowly. The honours of his youth</l>
<l n="tr">Too early thrust upon him, and the deeds</l>
<l n="tr">Which brought him triumph in the Sullan days,</l>
<l n="tr">His conquering navy and the Pontic war,</l>
<l n="tr">Made heavier now the burden of defeat,</l>
<l n="tr">And crushed his pondering soul. So length of days</l>
<l n="tr">Drags down the haughty spirit, and life prolonged</l>
<l n="tr">When power has fled. Unless when honour fails</l>
<l n="tr">Comes end of life, and timely death forestalls</l>
<l n="tr">Ensuing woe, the glory of past years</l>
<l n="tr">Is present shame. Who'd venture on the sea</l>

<l n="tr">Pharsalia fills thy dreams and when the shades</l>
<l n="tr">Give place to dawn, with hasty step thou tread'st</l>
<l n="tr">Some cliff sea-beaten, and with gaze intent</l>
<l n="tr">To mark the sail of each approaching ship</l>
<l n="tr">Art first: yet dar'st not ask thy husband's fate.</l>
<l n="tr">Lo! the ship comes, her load of ills unknown,</l>
<l n="tr">Thy worst of fears some messenger of woe,</l>
<l n="tr">Some evil tidings of the battle day:</l>
<l n="tr">Nay! it is he, thy husband in defeat:</l>
<l n="tr">Fear then no more, but weep; nor waste the hour.</l>
<l n="tr">He leaps to land; she marks the cruel doom</l>
<l n="tr">Wrought by the gods upon him: pale and wan</l>
<l n="tr">His weary features, by the hoary locks</l>
<l n="tr">Shaded; the dust of travel on his garb.</l>
<l n="tr">Dark on her soul a night of anguish fell;</l>
<l n="tr">Her trembling limbs no longer bore her frame:</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce throbbed her heart, and prone on earth she lay</l>
<l n="tr">Deceived in hope of death. The boat made fast,</l>
<l n="tr">Pompeius treading the lone waste of sand</l>
<l n="tr">Drew near; whom when Cornelia's maidens saw,</l>
<l n="tr">They stayed their weeping, yet with sighs subdued,</l>
<l n="tr">Reproached the fates; and tried in vain to raise</l>
<l n="tr">Their mistress' form, till Magnus to his breast</l>
<l n="tr">Drew her with cherishing arms; and at the touch</l>
<l n="tr">Of soothing hands the life-blood to her veins</l>
<l n="tr">Returned once more, and she could bear to look</l>

<l n="tr">A ready welcome, blamed the double tides</l>
<l n="tr">Broken by shallows, and their scanty beach</l>
<l n="tr">Unfit for fleets; and bade him to their craft</l>
<l n="tr">Leaving his loftier ship. Had not the fates'</l>
<l n="tr">Eternal and unalterable laws</l>
<l n="tr">Called for their victim and decreed his end</l>
<l n="tr">Now near at hand, his comrades' warning voice</l>
<l n="tr">Yet might have stayed his course: for if the court</l>
<l n="tr">To Magnus, who bestowed the Pharian crown,</l>
<l n="tr">In truth were open, should not king and fleet</l>
<l n="tr">In pomp have come to greet him?  But he yields:</l>
<l n="tr">The fates compel. Welcome to him was death</l>
<l n="tr">Rather than fear. But, rushing to the side,</l>
<l n="tr">His spouse would follow, for she dared not stay,</l>
<l n="tr">Fearing the guile. Then he, ' Abide, my wife,</l>
<l n="tr">And son, I pray you; from the shore afar</l>
<l n="tr">' Await my fortunes; mine shall be the life</l>
<l n="tr">' To test their honour.' But Cornelia still</l>
<l n="tr">Withstood his bidding, and with arms outspread</l>
<l n="tr">Frenzied she cried: ' And whither without me,</l>

<l part="F" n="tr">As Magnus passed,</l>
<l n="tr">A Roman soldier from the Pharian boat,</l>
<l n="tr">Septimius, salutes him. Gods of heaven!</l>

<l n="tr">Nor bearing still the javelin of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>;</l>
<l n="tr">But vile in all his arms; giant in form</l>
<l n="tr">Fierce, brutal, thirsting as a beast may thirst</l>

<l n="tr">This savage monster's blows?  Or dost thou place</l>

<l n="tr">Some ministering swords for civil war?</l>
<l n="tr">Thus, to the shame of victors and of gods,</l>
<l n="tr">This story shall be told in days to come:</l>
<l n="tr">A Roman swordsman, once within thy ranks,</l>
<l n="tr">Slave to the orders of a puny prince,</l>
<l n="tr">Severed Pompeius' neck. And what shall be</l>
<l n="tr">Septimius' fame hereafter?  By what name</l>
<l n="tr">This deed be called, if Brutus wrought a crime?</l>
<l n="tr">Now came the end, the latest hour of all:</l>
<l n="tr">Rapt to the boat was Magnus, of himself</l>
<l n="tr">No longer master, and the miscreant crew</l>
<l n="tr">Unsheathed their swords; which when the chieftain saw</l>
<l n="tr">He swathed his visage, for he scorned unveiled</l>
<l n="tr">To yield his life to fortune;  closed his eyes</l>
<l n="tr">And held his breath within him, lest some word,</l>
<l n="tr">Or sob escaped, might mar the deathless fame</l>
<l n="tr">His deeds had won. And when within his side</l>
<l n="tr">Achillas plunged his blade, nor sound nor cry</l>
<l n="tr">He gave, but calm consented to the blow</l>
<l n="tr">And proved himself in dying; in his breast</l>
<l n="tr">These thoughts revolving: ' In the years to come</l>
<l n="tr">' Men shall make mention of our Roman toils,</l>
<l n="tr">' Gaze on this boat, ponder the Pharian faith;</l>
<l n="tr">' And think upon thy fame and all the years</l>
<l n="tr">' While Fortune smiled: but for the ills of life</l>
<l n="tr">' How thou couldst bear them, this men shall not know</l>
<l n="tr">' Save by thy death. Then weigh thou not the shame</l>
<l n="tr">' That waits on thine undoing. Whoso strikes,</l>
<l n="tr">' The blow is Caesar's. Men may tear this frame</l>
<l n="tr">'And cast it mangled to the winds of heaven;</l>
<l n="tr">'Yet have I prospered, nor can all the gods</l>

<l n="tr">'But death no misery. If my spouse and son</l>
<l n="tr">'Behold me murdered, silently the more</l>
<l n="tr">' I suffer: admiration at my death</l>
<l n="tr">'Shall prove their love.' So did Pompeius die,</l>
<l n="tr">And so kept guard upon his thoughts in death.
<milestone n="637" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="tr">His spouse, less patient to behold the crime</l>
<l n="tr">Than to endure it, filled the airs with cries;</l>
<l n="tr">'0, husband, whom my wicked self hath slain!</l>
<l n="tr">'That lonely isle apart thy bane hath been</l>

<l n="tr">'May do such work?  But whosoe'er thou art</l>
<l n="tr">'Sent from the gods with power, for Caesar's ire,</l>
<l n="tr">'Or thine own sake, to slay, thou dost not know</l>
<l n="tr">'Where lies the heart of Magnus. Thou dost haste</l>
<l n="tr">To deal the blow as he would have it fall.</l>
<l n="tr">'Let me die first, and let him seeing bear</l>
<l n="tr">'An agony no less than death can bring.</l>
<l n="tr">'No freedom mine from blame of war. Alone</l>
<l n="tr">Of Roman wives, through oceans and through camps,</l>
<l n="tr">Fearing no fates, I followed him afield;</l>
<l n="tr">And in defeat when even monarchs feared</l>
<l n="tr">Received my husband. Did I then deserve</l>
<l n="tr">Thus to be left of thee, and didst thou seek</l>
<l n="tr">To spare me? And when rushing on thine end</l>
<l n="tr">Was I to live?  Without the monarch's help</l>
<l n="tr">Death shall be mine, either by headlong leap</l>
<l n="tr">Beneath the waters; or some sailor's hand</l>
<l n="tr">Shall bind around this neck the fatal cord;</l>
<l n="tr">Or else some comrade, worthy of his chief,</l>
<l n="tr">Drive to my heart his blade for Magnus' sake,</l>
<l n="tr">And claim the service done to Caesar's arms.</l>
<l n="tr">What! does your cruelty withhold my fate?</l>
<l n="tr">Ah!  still he lives, nor is it mine as yet</l>
<l n="tr">To win this freedom; they forbid me death,</l>
<l n="tr">Kept for the victor's triumph.' Thus she spake,</l>
<l n="tr">While friendly hands upheld her fainting form;</l>
<l n="tr">And sped the trembling vessel from the shore.</l>
<l n="tr">Men say that Magnus, when the deadly blows</l>
<l n="tr">Fell thick upon him, lost nor form divine,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor venerated mien; and as they gazed</l>
<l n="tr">Upon his lacerated head they marked</l>
<l n="tr">Still on his features anger with the gods.</l>
<l n="tr">For fierce Septimius in the very blow</l>
<l n="tr">Made yet more black his crime-unwound the folds</l>
<l n="tr">That swathed the face, and seized the noble head</l>
<l n="tr">And drooping neck ere yet was fled the life:</l>
<l n="tr">Then placed upon the bench; and with his blade</l>
<l n="tr">Slow at its hideous task, and blows unskilled</l>
<l n="tr">Hacked through the flesh and brake the knotted bone;</l>
<l n="tr">For yet man had not learned by swoop of sword</l>
<l n="tr">Deftly to lop the neck. Achillas claimed</l>
<l n="tr">The gory head dissevered. What! shalt thou</l>
<l n="tr">A Roman soldier, while thy blade yet reeks</l>
<l n="tr">From Magnus' slaughter, play the second part</l>
<l n="tr">To this base varlet of the Pharian king?</l>
<l n="tr">Nor bear thyself the bleeding trophy home?</l>
<l n="tr">Then, that the impious boy (ah! shameful fate)</l>
<l n="tr">Might know the features of the hero slain,</l>
<l n="tr">Seized by the locks, the dread of kings, which waved</l>
<l n="tr">Upon his stately front, on Pharian pike</l>
<l n="tr">The head was lifted; while almost the life</l>
<l n="tr">Gave to the tongue its accents, and the eyes</l>
<l n="tr">Were yet scarce glazed: that head at whose command</l>
<l n="tr">Was peace or war, that tongue whose eloquent tones</l>
<l n="tr">Would move assemblies, and that noble brow</l>
<l n="tr">On which were showered the rewards of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor to the tyrant did the sight suffice</l>
<l n="tr">To prove the murder done. The perishing flesh,</l>
<l n="tr">The tissues, and the brain he bids remove</l>
<l n="tr">By art nefarious: the shrivelled skin</l>
<l n="tr">Draws tight upon the bone; and poisonous juice</l>
<l n="tr">Gives to the face its lineaments in death.</l>
<l n="tr">Last of thy race, thou base degenerate boy,</l>

<l n="tr">Of thine unworthy fathers mark the graves;</l>
<l n="tr">Shall Magnus' body hither and thither borne</l>
<l n="tr">Be battered, headless, by the ocean wave?</l>
<l n="tr">Too much it troubled thee to guard the corse</l>
<l n="tr">Unmutilated, for his kinsman's eye</l>
<l n="tr">To witness! Such the fate which Fortune kept</l>
<l n="tr">With prosperous Pompeius to the end.</l>
<l n="tr">'Twas not for him in evil days some ray</l>
<l n="tr">Of light to hope for. Shattered from the height</l>
<l n="tr">Of power in one short moment to his death!</l>
<l n="tr">Years of unbroken victories balanced down</l>
<l n="tr">By one day's carnage! In his happy time</l>
<l n="tr">Heaven did not harass him, nor did she spare</l>

<l n="tr">That dashed him down. Now beaten by the sands,</l>
<l n="tr">Torn upon rocks, the sport of ocean's waves</l>
<l n="tr">Poured through its wounds, his headless carcase lies,</l>
<l n="tr">Save by the lacerated trunk unknown.
<milestone n="712" unit="card"/></l>
<l n="tr">Yet ere the victor touched the Pharian sands</l>
<l n="tr">Some scanty rites to Magnus Fortune gave,</l>
<l n="tr">Lest he should want all burial. Pale with fear</l>
<l n="tr">Came Cordus, hasting from his hiding place;</l>
<l n="tr">Quaestor, he joined Pompeius on thy shore,</l>
<l n="tr">Idalian Cyprus, bringing in his train</l>
<l n="tr">A cloud of evils. Through the darkening shades</l>
<l n="tr">Love for the dead compelled his trembling steps,</l>
<l n="tr">Hard by the margin of the deep to search</l>
<l n="tr">And drag to land his master. Through the clouds</l>
<l n="tr">The moon shone sadly, and her rays were dim;</l>
<l n="tr">But by its hue upon the hoary main</l>
<l n="tr">He knew the body. In a fast embrace</l>
<l n="tr">He holds it, wrestling with the greedy sea,</l>
<l n="tr">And deftly watching for a refluent wave</l>
<l n="tr">Gains help to bring his burden to the land.</l>
<l n="tr">Then clinging to the loved remains, the wounds</l>
<l n="tr">Washed with his tears, thus to the gods he speaks,</l>
<l n="tr">And misty stars obscure: 'Here, Fortune, lies</l>
<l n="tr">Pompeius, thine: no costly incense rare</l>
<l n="tr">Or pomp of funeral he dares to ask;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor that the smoke rise heavenward from his pyre</l>
<l n="tr">With eastern odours rich; nor that the necks</l>
<l n="tr">Of pious Romans bear him to the tomb,</l>
<l n="tr">Their parent; while the forums shall resound</l>
<l n="tr">' With dirges; nor that triumphs won of yore</l>
<l n="tr">'Be borne before him; nor for sorrowing hosts</l>
<l n="tr">'To cast their weapons forth. Some little shell</l>
<l n="tr">He begs as for the meanest, laid in which</l>
<l n="tr">His mutilated corse may reach the flame.</l>
<l n="tr">Grudge not his misery the pile of wood</l>
<l n="tr">' Lit by this menial hand. Is't not enough</l>
<l n="tr">'That his Cornelia with dishevelled hair</l>
<l n="tr">' Weeps not beside him at his obsequies,</l>
<l n="tr">' Nor with a last embrace shall place the torch</l>
<l n="tr">' Beneath her husband dead, but on the deep</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">' Hard by still wanders? '</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Burning from afar</l>
<l n="tr">He sees the pyre of some ignoble youth</l>
<l n="tr">Deserted of his own, with none to guard:</l>
<l n="tr">And quickly drawing from beneath the limbs</l>
<l n="tr">Some glowing logs, ' Whoe'er thou art,' he said,</l>
<l n="tr">Neglected shade, uncared for, dear to none,</l>
<l n="tr">Yet happier than Pompeius in thy death,</l>
<l n="tr">Pardon I ask that this my stranger hand</l>
<l n="tr">' Should violate thy tomb. Yet if to shades</l>
<l n="tr">'Be sense or memory, gladly shalt thou yield</l>
<l n="tr">'This from thy pyre to Magnus. 'Twere thy shame,</l>
<l n="tr">'Blessed with due burial, if his remains</l>
<l n="tr">Were homeless.' Speaking thus, the wood aflame</l>
<l n="tr">Back to the headless trunk at speed he bore,</l>
<l n="tr">Which hanging on the margin of the deep,</l>
<l n="tr">Almost the sea had won. In sandy trench</l>
<l n="tr">The gathered fragments of a broken boat,</l>
<l n="tr">Trembling, he placed around the noble limbs.</l>
<l n="tr">No pile above the corse nor under lay,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor was the fire beneath. Then as he crouched</l>
<l n="tr">Beside the blaze, ' 0, greatest chief,' he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">Majestic champion of Hesperia's name,</l>
<l n="tr">'If to be tossed unburied on the deep</l>
<l n="tr">Rather than these poor rites thy shade prefer,</l>
<l n="tr">'From these mine offices thy mighty soul</l>
<l n="tr">Withdraw, Pompeius. Injuries dealt by fate</l>
<l n="tr">Command this duty, lest some bird or beast</l>
<l n="tr">'Or ocean monster, or fierce Caesar's wrath</l>
<l n="tr">'Should venture aught upon thee. Take the fire;</l>
<l n="tr">All that thou canst; by Roman hand at least</l>
<l n="tr">'Enkindled. And should Fortune grant return</l>
<l n="tr">'To loved Hesperia's land, not here shall rest</l>
<l n="tr">'Thy sacred ashes; but within an urn</l>
<l n="tr">Cornelia, from this humble hand received,</l>
<l n="tr">Shall place them. Here upon a meagre stone</l>
<l n="tr">We draw the characters to mark thy tomb.</l>
<l n="tr">These letters reading may some kindly friend</l>
<l n="tr">'Bring back thine head, dissevered, and may grant</l>
<l n="tr">'Full funeral honours to thine earthly frame.'</l>
<l n="tr">Then did he cherish the enfeebled fire</l>
<l n="tr">Till Magnus' body mingled with its flames.</l>
<l n="tr">But now the harbinger of coming dawn</l>
<l n="tr">Had paled the constellations: he in fear</l>
<l n="tr">Seeks for his hiding place. Whom dost thou dread,</l>
<l n="tr">Madman, what punishment for such a crime,</l>
<l n="tr">For which thy fame by rumour trumpet-tongued</l>
<l n="tr">Has been sent down to ages?  Praise is thine</l>
<l n="tr">For this thy work, at impious Caesar's hands;</l>
<l n="tr">Sure of a pardon, go; confess thy task,</l>
<l n="tr">And beg the head dissevered. But his work</l>
<l n="tr">Was still unfinished, and with pious hand</l>
<l n="tr">(Fearing some foe) he seizes on the bones</l>
<l n="tr">Now half consumed, and sinews; and the wave</l>
<l n="tr">Pours in upon them, and in shallow trench</l>
<l n="tr">Commits them to the earth; and lest some breeze</l>
<l n="tr">Might bear away the ashes, or by chance</l>
<l n="tr">Some sailor's anchor might disturb the tomb,</l>
<l n="tr">A stone he places, and with stick half burned</l>
<l n="tr">Traces the sacred name: Here Magnus lies.</l>
<l n="tr">And art thou, Fortune, pleased that such a spot</l>
<l n="tr">Should be his tomb which even Caesar's self</l>
<l n="tr">Had chosen, rather than permit his corse</l>
<l n="tr">To rest unburied?  Why, with thoughtless hand</l>
<l n="tr">Confine his shade within the narrow bounds</l>
<l n="tr">Of this poor sepulchre?  Where the furthest sand</l>

<l n="tr">Not all the lands of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> should suffice</l>

<l n="tr">No foot would tread. But if the stone deserves</l>
<l n="tr">So great a name, then add his mighty deeds:</l>

<l n="tr">To pass the Syrtes by a landward march,</l>
<l n="tr">And trusting to their swords, 'gainst tribes unknown</l>

<l n="tr">The desert path from which was no return:</l>

<l n="tr">Plunge him in <placeName key="tgn,1123466">Tanais</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName> and Po,</l>
<l n="tr">Pour on his burning tongue the flood of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">Yet were the fire unquenched. So fell the fang</l>
<l n="tr">Of Dipsas in the torrid Libyan lands;</l>
<l n="tr">In other climes less fatal. Next he seeks</l>
<l n="tr">Amid the sands, all barren to the depths,</l>
<l n="tr">For moisture: then returning to the shoals</l>
<l n="tr">Laps them with greed-in vain-the briny draught</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce quenched the thirst it made. Nor knowing yet</l>
<l n="tr">The poison in his frame, he steels himself</l>
<l n="tr">To rip his swollen veins and drink the gore.</l>
<l n="tr">Cato bids lift the standard, lest his troops</l>
<l n="tr">May find in thirst a pardon for the deed.</l>
<l n="tr">But on Sabellus' yet more piteous death</l>
<l n="tr">Their eyes were fastened. Clinging to his skin</l>
<l n="tr">A Seps with curving tooth, of little size,</l>
<l n="tr">He seized and tore away, and to the sands</l>
<l n="tr">Pierced with his javelin. Small the serpent's bulk;</l>
<l n="tr">None deals a death more horrible in form.</l>
<l n="tr">For swift the flesh dissolving round the wound</l>
<l n="tr">Bared the pale bone; swam all his limbs in blood;</l>
<l n="tr">Wasted the tissue of his calves and knees:</l>
<l n="tr">And all the muscles of his thighs were thawed</l>
<l n="tr">In black distilment, and the membrane sheath</l>
<l n="tr">Parted, that bound his vitals, which abroad</l>
<l n="tr">Flowed upon earth: yet seemed it not that all</l>
<l n="tr">His frame was loosed, for by the venomous drop</l>
<l n="tr">Were all the bands that held his muscles drawn</l>
<l n="tr">Down to a juice; the framework of his chest</l>
<l n="tr">Was bare, its cavity, and all the parts</l>
<l n="tr">Hid by the organs of life, that make the man.</l>
<l n="tr">So by unholy death there stood revealed</l>
<l n="tr">His inmost nature. Head and stalwart arms,</l>
<l n="tr">And neck and shoulders, from their solid mass</l>
<l n="tr">Melt in corruption. Not more swiftly flows</l>
<l n="tr">Wax at the sun's command, nor snow compelled</l>
<l n="tr">By southern breezes. Yet not all is said:</l>
<l n="tr">For so to noxious humours fire consumes</l>
<l n="tr">Our fleshly frame; but on the funeral pyre</l>
<l n="tr">What bones have perished? These dissolve no less</l>
<l n="tr">Than did the mouldered tissues, nor of death</l>
<l n="tr">Thus swift is left a trace. Of Afric pests</l>
<l n="tr">Thou bear'st the palm for hurtfulness: the life</l>
<l n="tr">They snatch away, thou only with the life</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">The clay that held it.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Lo! a different fate,</l>
<l n="tr">Not this by melting! for a Prester's fang</l>
<l n="tr">Nasidius struck, who erst in Marsian fields</l>
<l n="tr">Guided the plough. Upon his face there burns</l>
<l n="tr">A redness as of flame: swollen the skin,</l>
<l n="tr">His features hidden, swollen all his limbs</l>
<l n="tr">Till more than human: and his definite frame</l>
<l n="tr">One tumour huge conceals. A ghastly gore</l>
<l n="tr">Is puffed from inwards as the virulent juice</l>
<l n="tr">Courses through all his body; which, thus grown,</l>
<l n="tr">His corselet holds not. Not in caldron so</l>
<l n="tr">Boils up to mountainous height the steaming wave;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor in such bellying curves does canvas bend</l>
<l n="tr">To Eastern tempests. Now the ponderous bulk</l>
<l n="tr">Rejects the limbs, and as a shapeless trunk</l>
<l n="tr">Burdens the earth: and there, to beasts and birds</l>
<l n="tr">A fatal feast, his comrades leave the corse;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor dare to place, yet swelling, in the tomb.</l>
<l n="tr">But for their eyes the Libyan pests prepared</l>
<l n="tr">More dreadful sights. On Tullus great in heart,</l>
<l n="tr">And bound to Cato with admiring soul,</l>
<l n="tr">A fierce Haemorrhois fixed. From every limb,<note anchored="yes">See Book III., 709.</note></l>

<l n="tr">A sable poison: from the natural pores</l>
<l n="tr">Of moisture, gore profuse; his mouth was filled</l>
<l n="tr">And gaping nostrils, and his tears were blood.</l>
<l n="tr">Brimmed full his veins; his very sweat was red;</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">All was one wound.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Then piteous Levus next</l>
<l n="tr">In sleep was victim, for around his heart</l>
<l n="tr">Stood still the blood congealed: no pain he felt</l>
<l n="tr">Of venomous tooth, but swift upon him fell</l>
<l n="tr">Death, and he sought the shades; more swift to kill</l>
<l n="tr">No draught in poisonous cups from ripened plants</l>
<l n="tr">Of direst growth Sabaean wizards brew.</l>
<l n="tr">Lo! Upon branchless trunk a serpent, named</l>
<l n="tr">By Libyans Jaculus, rose in coils to dart</l>
<l n="tr">His venom from afar. Through Paullus' brain</l>
<l n="tr">It rushed, nor stayed; for in the wound itself</l>
<l n="tr">Was death. Then did they know how slowly flies,</l>
<l n="tr">Flung from a sling, the stone; how gently speed</l>
<l n="tr">Through air the shafts of <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName>.  What availed,</l>
<l n="tr">Murrus, the lance by which thou didst transfix</l>
<l n="tr">A Basilisk?  Swift through the weapon ran</l>
<l n="tr">The poison to his hand: he drew his sword</l>
<l n="tr">And severed arm and shoulder at a blow:</l>
<l n="tr">Then gazed secure upon his severed hand</l>
<l n="tr">Which perished as he looked. So hadst thou died,</l>

<l n="tr">Thus was their stubborn patience of its plaints</l>
<l n="tr">Disburdened. But the bravery of their chief</l>
<l n="tr">Forced them to bear their toils. Upon the sand,</l>
<l n="tr">All bare, he lies and dares at every hour</l>
<l n="tr">Fortune to strike: he only at the fate</l>
<l n="tr">Of each was present, flew to every call;</l>
<l n="tr">And roused their hearts to fight the poison germ.</l>
<l n="tr">Not life he brings them, but the strength in death</l>
<l n="tr">To die without a groan-to groan were shame</l>
<l n="tr">When he was witness-over him what power</l>
<l n="tr">Had plague or venom?  In a comrade's breast</l>
<l n="tr">They see him conquer anguish; and they learn,</l>
<l n="tr">Gazing on him, how weak the power of pain.</l>
<l n="tr">Some aid from Fortune, weary of their woes,</l>
<l n="tr">At length they gained. Of all who till the earth</l>
<l n="tr">The Psyllians only are by snakes unharmed.</l>
<l n="tr">Potent as herbs their song; safe is their blood,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor gives admission to the poison germ</l>
<l n="tr">E'en when the chant has ceased. Their home itself</l>
<l n="tr">Placed in such venomous tract and serpent-thronged</l>
<l n="tr">Gained them this vantage, and a truce with death,</l>
<l n="tr">Else could they not have lived. Such is their trust</l>
<l n="tr">In purity of blood, that newly born</l>
<l n="tr">Each babe they prove by test of deadly asp</l>
<l n="tr">For foreign lineage. So the bird of Jove</l>
<l n="tr">Turns his new fledglings to the rising sun</l>
<l n="tr">And such as gaze upon the beams of day</l>
<l n="tr">With eyes unwavering, for the use of heaven</l>
<l n="tr">He rears; but such as blink at Phoebus' rays</l>
<l n="tr">Casts from the nest. Thus of unmixed descent</l>
<l n="tr">The babe who, dreading not the serpent touch,</l>
<l n="tr">Plays in his cradle with the deadly snake.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor with their own immunity from harm</l>
<l n="tr">Contented do they rest, but watch for guests</l>
<l n="tr">Who need their help against the noisome plague.</l>
<l n="tr">Now to the Roman standards are they come,</l>
<l n="tr">And when the chieftain bade the tents be fixed,</l>
<l n="tr">First all the sandy space within the lines</l>

<l n="tr">Rise aromatic odours: danewort burns,</l>
<l n="tr">And juice distils from Syrian galbanum;</l>
<l n="tr">Then mournful tamarisk, costum from the East,</l>
<l n="tr">Strong panacea mixed with centaury</l>
<l n="tr">From <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, and leaves of fennel feed the flames,</l>
<l n="tr">And thapsus brought from <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>: and they burn</l>
<l n="tr">Larch, southern-wood and antlers of a deer</l>
<l n="tr">Which lived afar. From these in densest fumes,</l>
<l n="tr">Deadly to snakes, a pungent smoke arose;</l>
<l n="tr">And thus in safety passed the night away.</l>
<l n="tr">But should some victim feel the fatal fang</l>
<l n="tr">Upon the march, then of this magic race</l>
<l n="tr">Were seen the wonders; with saliva first</l>

<l n="tr">The venom in the wound. From foaming mouth</l>
<l n="tr">Next with continuous cadence would they pour</l>
<l n="tr">Unceasing chants-nor breathing space nor pause-</l>
<l n="tr">Else spreads the poison: nor does fate permit</l>
<l n="tr">A moment's silence. Oft from the black flesh</l>
<l n="tr">Flies forth the pest beneath the magic song:</l>
<l n="tr">But should it linger nor obey the voice,</l>
<l n="tr">Repugnant to the summons, on the wound</l>
<l n="tr">Prostrate they lay their lips and from the depths</l>
<l n="tr">Now paling draw the venom. In their mouths,</l>
<l n="tr">Sucked from the freezing flesh, they hold the death,</l>
<l n="tr">Then spew it forth; and from the taste shall know</l>

<l n="tr">Unveiled the head. Now had the hand of death</l>
<l n="tr">Passed with its changing touch upon the face:</l>
<l n="tr">Nor at first sight did Caesar on the gift</l>
<l n="tr">Pass condemnation; nor avert his gaze,</l>
<l n="tr">But dwelt upon the features till he knew</l>
<l n="tr">The crime accomplished. Then when truth was sure</l>
<l n="tr">The loving father rose, and tears he shed</l>
<l n="tr">Which flowed at his command, and glad in heart</l>
<l n="tr">Forced from his breast a groan : thus by the flow</l>
<l n="tr">Of feigned tears and grief he hoped to hide</l>
<l n="tr">His joy else manifest: and the ghastly boon</l>
<l n="tr">Sent by the king disparaging, professed</l>
<l n="tr">Rather to mourn his son's dissevered head,</l>
<l n="tr">Than count it for a debt. For thee alone,</l>
<l n="tr">Magnus, he durst not fail to find a tear:</l>
<l n="tr">He, Caesar, who with mien unaltered spurned</l>
<l n="tr">The Roman Senate, and with eyes undimmed</l>
<l n="tr">Looked on Pharsalia's field. O fate most hard!</l>
<l n="tr">Didst thou with impious war pursue the man</l>
<l n="tr">Whom 'twas thy lot to mourn?  No kindred ties,</l>
<l n="tr">No memory of thy daughter and her son</l>
<l n="tr">Touch on thy heart?  Didst think perchance that grief</l>
<l n="tr">Might help thy cause 'mid lovers of his name?</l>
<l n="tr">Or haply, moved by envy of the king,</l>
<l n="tr">Griev'st that to other hands than thine was given</l>
<l n="tr">To shed the captive's life-blood?  and complain'st</l>
<l n="tr">Thy vengeance perished and the conquered chief</l>
<l n="tr">Snatched from thy haughty hand? Whate'er the cause</l>
<l n="tr">That urged thy grief, 'twas far removed from love.</l>
<l n="tr">Was this forsooth the object of thy toil</l>
<l n="tr">O'er lands and oceans, that without thy ken</l>
<l n="tr">He should not perish?  Nay! but well was reft</l>
<l n="tr">From thine arbitrament his fate. What crime</l>
<l n="tr">Did cruel Fortune spare, what depth of shame</l>
<l n="tr">To Roman honour! since she suffered not,</l>
<l n="tr">Perfidious traitor, while yet Magnus lived,</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">That thou shouldst pity him!</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">Thus by words he dared</l>
<l n="tr">To gain their credence in his sembled grief:</l>
<l n="tr">Hence from my sight with his detested gift,</l>
<l n="tr">Thou minion, to thy king. Worse does your crime</l>
<l n="tr">Deserve from Caesar than from Magnus' hands.</l>
<l n="tr">The only prize that civil war affords</l>
<l n="tr">Thus have we lost-to bid the conquered live.</l>
<l n="tr">If but the sister of this Pharian king</l>
<l n="tr">Were not by him detested, by the head</l>
<l n="tr">Of Cleopatra had I paid this gift.</l>
<l n="tr">Such were the fit return. Why did he draw</l>
<l n="tr">His separate sword, and in the toil that's ours</l>
<l n="tr">Mingle his weapons?  In Thessalia's field</l>
<l n="tr">Gave we such right to the Pellaean blade?</l>
<l n="tr">Such licence did your mutual kingdom gain?</l>
<l n="tr">Magnus as partner in the rule of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">I had not brooked; and shall I tolerate</l>
<l n="tr">Thee, Ptolemaeus?  In vain with civil wars</l>
<l n="tr">Thus have we roused the nations, if there be</l>
<l n="tr">Now any might but Caesar's, if any land</l>
<l n="tr">Yet owns you masters. From your shore I'd turn</l>
<l n="tr">The prows of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>;  but fame forbids,</l>
<l n="tr">Lest men should whisper that I did not damn</l>
<l n="tr">This deed of blood, but feared the Pharian land.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor think ye to deceive; victorious here</l>
<l n="tr">I stand: else had my welcome at your hands</l>
<l n="tr">Been that of Magnus; and that neck were mine</l>
<l n="tr">But for Pharsalia's chance. At greater risk</l>
<l n="tr">So seems it, than we dreamed of, took we arms;</l>
<l n="tr">Exile, and Magnus' threats, and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> I knew,</l>
<l n="tr">Not Ptolemaeus. But we spare the boy:</l>
<l n="tr">Pass by the murder. Let the princeling know</l>
<l n="tr">We give no more than pardon for his crime.</l>
<l n="tr">And now in honour of the mighty dead,</l>

<l n="tr">' With proper sepulture appease his shade</l>
<l n="tr">'And place his scattered ashes in an urn.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus may he know my coming, and may hear</l>

<l n="tr">Me sought he not, but rather, for his life,</l>

<l n="tr">WHEN Caesar, following those who bore the head,</l>
<l n="tr">First trod the shore accursed, with <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>'s fates</l>
<l n="tr">His fortunes battled, whether <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> should pass</l>
<l n="tr">In crimson conquest o'er the guilty land,</l>

<l n="tr">By that dread crime assured, his standards borne</l>
<l n="tr">Before, he marched upon the Pharian town;</l>
<l n="tr">But when the people, jealous of their laws,</l>
<l n="tr">Murmured against the fasces, Caesar knew</l>
<l n="tr">Their minds were adverse, and that not for him</l>
<l n="tr">Was Magnus' murder wrought. And yet with brow</l>
<l n="tr">Dissembling fear, intrepid, through the shrines</l>
<l n="tr">Of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>'s gods he strode, and round the fane</l>

<l n="tr">Upon his victim slain, to prove his skill.</l>
<l n="tr">The Roman world but now did not suffice</l>
<l n="tr">To hold him, nor the realms from furthest Ind</l>
<l n="tr">To Tyrian Gades. Now, as puny boy,</l>
<l n="tr">Or woman, trembling when a town is sacked,</l>
<l n="tr">Within the narrow corners of a house</l>
<l n="tr">He seeks for safety; on the portals closed</l>
<l n="tr">His hope of life: and with uncertain gait</l>
<l n="tr">He treads the halls; yet not without the King;</l>
<l n="tr">In purpose, Ptolemaeus, that thy life</l>
<l n="tr">For his shall give atonement; and to hurl</l>
<l n="tr">Thy severed head among the servant throng</l>
<l n="tr">Should darts and torches fail. So story tells</l>
<l n="tr">The Colchian princess <note anchored="yes">Medea, who fled from <placeName key="tgn,7016642">Colchis</placeName> with her brother, Absyrtus. Pursued by her father AEetes, she killed her brother and strewed the parts of his body into the sea. The king paused to collect them.</note>  with sword in hand,</l>
<l n="tr">And with her brother's neck bared to the blow,</l>
<l n="tr">Waited her sire, avenger of his realm</l>
<l n="tr">Despoiled, and of her flight. In the imminent risk</l>
<l n="tr">Caesar, in hopes of peace, an envoy sent</l>
<l n="tr">To the fierce vassals, from their absent lord</l>
<l n="tr">Bearing a message, thus : ' At whose command</l>
<l n="tr">Wage ye the war?' But not the laws which bind</l>
<l n="tr">All nations upon earth, nor sacred rights,</l>
<l n="tr">Availed to save or messenger of peace,</l>
<l n="tr">Or King's ambassador; or thee from crime</l>
<l n="tr">Such as befitted thee, thou land of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName></l>
<l n="tr">Fruitful in monstrous deeds: not Juba's realm,</l>
<l n="tr">Vast though it be, nor <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, nor the land</l>
<l n="tr">Thessalian, nor the arms of Pharnaces,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor yet the tracts which chill <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName> girds,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor Libyan coasts such wickedness have dared,</l>
<l n="tr">As thou, and all thy minions. Closer now</l>
<l n="tr">War hemmed them in, and weapons in the courts,</l>
<l n="tr">Shaking the innermost recesses, fell.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet did no ram, fatal with single stroke,</l>
<l n="tr">Assail the portal, nor machine of war;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor flame they called in aid; but blind of plan</l>
<l n="tr">They wander purposeless, in separate bands</l>
<l n="tr">Around the circuit, nor at any spot</l>
<l n="tr">With strength combined attempt to breach the wall.</l>
<l n="tr">The fates forbad, and Fortune from their hands</l>
<l n="tr">Held fast the palace as a battlement.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor failed they to attack from ships of war</l>
<l n="tr">The regal dwelling, where its frontage bold</l>
<l n="tr">Made stand apart the waters of the deep :</l>
<l n="tr">There, too, was Caesar's all-protecting arm;</l>
<l n="tr">For these at point of sword, and those with fire</l>
<l n="tr">He forces back, and though besieged he dares</l>
<l n="tr">To storm th' assailants: and as lay the ships</l>
<l n="tr">Joined rank to rank, bids drop upon their sides</l>
<l n="tr">Lamps drenched with reeking tar. Nor slow the fire</l>
<l n="tr">To seize the hempen cables and the decks</l>
<l n="tr">Oozing with melting pitch; the oarsman's bench</l>
<l n="tr">All in one moment, and the topmost yards</l>
<l n="tr">Burst into flame: half merged the vessels lay</l>
<l n="tr">While swam the foemen, all in arms, the wave;</l>
<l n="tr">Nor fell the blaze upon the ships alone,</l>
<l n="tr">But seized with writhing tongues the neighbouring homes,<note anchored="yes">It was in this conflagration that a large part of the library of the Ptolemies was destroyed. 400,000 volumes are stated to have perished.</note></l>
<l n="tr">And fanned to fury by the Southern breeze</l>
<l n="tr">Tempestuous, it leaped from roof to roof;</l>
<l n="tr">Not otherwise than on its heavenly track,</l>
<l n="tr">Unfed by matter, glides the ball of light,</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">By air alone aflame.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">This pest recalled</l>
<l n="tr">Some of the forces to the city's aid</l>
<l n="tr">From the besieged halls. Nor Caesar gave</l>
<l n="tr">To sleep its season; swifter than all else</l>
<l n="tr">To seize the crucial moment of the war.</l>
<l n="tr">Quick in the darkest watches of the night</l>
<l n="tr">He leaped upon his ships, and Pharos <note anchored="yes">The island of Pharos, which lay over against the port of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, had been connected with the mainland in the middle by a narrow causeway. On it stood the lighthouse. (See Book IX., 1192.) Proteus, the old man of the sea, kept here his flock of seals, according to the Homeric story. ('Odyssey,' Book IV., 400.)</note>  seized,</l>
<l n="tr">Gate of the main; an island in the days</l>
<l n="tr">Of Proteus seer, now bordering the walls</l>
<l n="tr">Of Alexander's city. Thus he gained</l>
<l n="tr">A double vantage, for his foes were pent</l>
<l n="tr">Within the narrow entrance, which for him</l>
<l n="tr">And for his aids gave access to the sea.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor longer was Pothinus' doom delayed,</l>
<l n="tr">Yet not with cross or flame, nor with the wrath</l>
<l n="tr">His crime demanded; nor by savage beasts</l>
<l n="tr">Torn, did he suffer; but by Magnus' death,</l>
<l n="tr">Alas the shame! he fell; his head by sword</l>
<l n="tr">Hacked from his shoulders. Next by frauds prepared</l>
<l n="tr">By Ganymede her base attendant, fled</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,7016892">Arsinoe</placeName><note anchored="yes">Younger sister of Cleopatra.</note>   from the Court to Caesar's foes;</l>
<l n="tr">There in the absence of the King she ruled</l>
<l n="tr">As of Lagean blood: there at her hands,</l>
<l n="tr">The savage minion of the tyrant boy,</l>
<l n="tr">Achillas, fell by just avenging sword.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus did another victim to thy shade</l>
<l n="tr">Atone, Pompeius; but the gods forbid</l>
<l n="tr">That this be all thy vengeance! Not the King</l>
<l n="tr">Nor all the stock of <placeName key="tgn,7000497">Lagos</placeName> for thy death</l>
<l n="tr">Would make fit sacrifice! So Fortune deemed;</l>
<l n="tr">And not till patriot swords shall drink the blood</l>
<l n="tr">Of Caesar, Magnus, shalt thou be appeased.</l>
<l n="tr">Still, though was slain the author of the strife,</l>
<l n="tr">Sank not their rage: with Ganymede for chief</l>
<l n="tr">Again they rush to arms; in deeds of fight</l>
<l n="tr">Again they conquer. So might that one day</l>
<l n="tr">Have witnessed Caesar's fate; so might its fame</l>
<l part="I" n="tr">Have lived through ages.</l>
<l part="F" n="tr">As the Roman Chief,</l>
<l n="tr">Crushed on the narrow surface of the mole,</l>
<l n="tr">Prepared to throw his troops upon the ships,</l>
<l n="tr">Sudden upon him the surrounding foes</l>
<l n="tr">With all their terrors came. In dense array</l>
<l n="tr">Their navy lined the shores, while on the rear</l>
<l n="tr">The footmen ceaseless charged. No hope was left,</l>
<l n="tr">For flight was not, nor could the brave man's arm</l>
<l n="tr">Achieve or safety or a glorious death.</l>
<l n="tr">Not now were needed for great Caesar's fall,</l>
<l n="tr">Caught in the toils of nature, routed host</l>
<l n="tr">Or mighty heaps of slain: his only doubt</l>
<l n="tr">To fear or hope for death: while on his brain</l>
<l n="tr">Brave Scaeva's image flashed, now vainly sought,</l>
<l n="tr">Who on the wall by <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>' fields</l>
<l n="tr">Earned fame immortal, and with single arm</l>
<l n="tr">Drove back Pompeius as he trod the breach.</l></div1>
