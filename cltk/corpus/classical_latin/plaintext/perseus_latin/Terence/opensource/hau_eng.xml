                    <p>CHREMES commands his wife, when pregnant, if she is delivered of a girl
                        immediately to kill the child. Having given birth to a girl, Sostrata
                        delivers her to an old woman named Philtera to be exposed. Instead of doing
                        this, Philtera calls her Antiphila, and brings her up as her own. Clinia,
                        the son of Menedemus, falls in love with her, and treats her as though his
                        wife. Menedemus, on learning this, is very angry, and by his harsh language
                        drives away his son from home. Taking this to heart, and in order to punish
                        himself for his ill-timed severity, Menedemus, though now an aged man,
                        fatigues himself by laboring at agricultural pursuits from morning till
                        night. At the period when the Play commences, Clinia has just returned to
                            <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, but not daring to go to
                        his father's house, is entertained by Clitipho, the son of Chremes, who is
                        the neighbor of Menedemus. Clitipho then sends for Antiphila, whose supposed
                        mother has recently died, to come and meet her lover. On the same day,
                        Chremes learns from Menedemus how anxious he is for his son's return; and on
                        hearing from his son of the arrival of Clinia, he defers informing Menedemus
                        of it until the next day. Syrus, the servant who has been sent to fetch
                        Antiphila, also brings with him Bacchis, an extravagant Courtesan, the
                        mistress of Clitipho. To conceal the truth from Chremes, they represent to
                        him that Bacchis is the mistress of Clinia, and that Antiphila is one of her
                        maids. Next morning Chremes informs Menedemus of his son's arrival, and of
                        the extravagant conduct of his mistress, but begs that he will conceal from
                        Clinia his knowledge of this fact. Bacchis requiring ten minae, Syrus
                        devises a plan for obtaining the money from Chremes, while the latter is
                        encouraging him to think of a project against Menedemus. Syrus tells him a
                        story, that the mother of Antiphila had borrowed a thousand drachmae of
                        Bacchis, and being dead, the girl is left in her hands as a pledge for the
                        money. While these things are going on, Sostrata discovers in Antiphila her
                        own daughter. In order to obtain the money which Bacchis persists in
                        demanding, Syrus suggests to Chremes that it should be represented to
                        Menedemus that Bacchis is the mistress of Clitipho, and that he should be
                        requested to conceal her in his house for a few days; it is also arranged
                        that Clinia shall pretend to his father to be in love with Antiphila, and to
                        beg her as his wife. He is then to ask for money, as though for the wedding,
                        which is to be handed over to Bacchis. Chremes does not at first approve of
                        the plan suggested by Syrus; but he pays down the money for which he has
                        been informed' his daughter is a pledge in the hands of Bacchis. This, with
                        his knowledge, is given to Clitipho, who, as Syrus says, is to convey it to
                        Bacchis, who is now in the house of Menedemus, to make the latter more
                        readily believe that she is his mistress. Shortly after this, the plot is
                        discovered by Chremes, who threatens to punish Clitipho and Syrus. The Play
                        concludes with Chremes giving his consent to the marriage of Clinia with
                        Antiphila, and pardoning Clitipho, who promises to abandon the Courtesan,
                        and marry. Unlike the other Plays of Terence and Plautus, the Plot of this
                        Play extends over two days. </p>

                    <p>A SEVERE father compels his son Clinia, in love with Antiphila, to go abroad
                        to the wars; and repenting of what has been done, torments himself in mind.
                        Afterward, when he has returned, unknown to his father, he is entertained at
                        the house of Clitipho. The latter is in love with Bacchis, a Courtesan. When
                        Clinia sends for his much-loved Antiphila, Bacchis comes, as though his
                        mistress, and Antiphila, wearing the garb of her servant; this is done in
                        order that Clitipho may conceal it from his father. He, through the
                        stratagems of Syrus, gets ten minae from the old man for the Courtesan.
                        Antiphila is discovered to be the sister of Clitipho. Clinia receives her,
                        and Clitipho, another woman, for his wife. </p>

                                of this line is, that though it is but one Play, it has a two-fold
                                plot--the intrigues of two young men with two mistresses, and the
                                follies of two old men. As this Play is supposed to represent the
                                events of two successive days, the night intervening, it has been
                                suggested that the reading is "duplex--ex argumento--simplici;" the
                                Play is "two-fold, with but one plot," as extending to two
                                successive days. The Play derives its name from the Greek words,
                                    <foreign lang="greek">e(auto\n,</foreign> "himself," and

                                the background, and Chremes is brought forward as the principal
                                object; or, to vary: the allusion a little, the Menedemus of Terence
                                seems to be a drawing in miniature copied from a full length, as

                                three other instances. In the Mercator, Acanthio runs to his master

                                "Stataria" was a Comedy which was calm and peaceable, such as the

                                passage, in the Spectator, No. 502, are worthy to be transcribed at
                                length. "The Play was the Self-Tormentor. It is from the beginning
                                to the end a perfect picture of human life, but I did not observe in
                                the whole one passage that could raise a laugh. How well-disposed
                                must that people be, who could be entertained with satisfaction by
                                so sober and polite mirth! In the first Scene of the Comedy, when
                                one of the old men accuses the other of impertinence for interposing
                                in his affairs, he answers, 'I am a man, and can not help feeling
                                any sorrow that can arrive at man.' It is said this sentence was
                                received with an universal applause. There can not be a greater
                                argument of the general good understanding of a people, than their
                                sudden consent to give their approbation of a sentiment which has no
                                emotion in it. If it were spoken with ever so great skill in the
                                actor, the manner of uttering that sentence could have nothing in it
                                which could strike any but people of the greatest humanity--nay,
                                people elegant and skillful in observation upon it. It is possible
                                that he may have laid his hand on his heart, and with a winning
                                insinuation in his countenance, expressed to his neighbor that he
                                was a man who made his case his own; yet I will engage, a player in

                        <p> You shall know:--There is a poor old woman here, a stranger from
                                <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>:--her daughter, a
                            young woman, he fell in love with, insomuch that he almost regarded her
                            as his wife; all this took place unknown to me. When I discovered the
                            matter, I began to reprove him, not with gentleness, nor in the way
                            suited to the love-sick mind of a youth, but with violence, and after
                            the usual method of fathers. I was daily reproaching him,--"Look you, do
                            you expect to be allowed any longer to act thus, myself, your father,
                            being alive; to be keeping a mistress pretty much as though your wife?
                            You are mistaken, Clinia, and you don't know me, if you fancy that. I am
                            willing that you should be called my son, just as long as you do what
                            becomes you; but if you do not do so, I shall find out how it becomes me
                            to act toward you. This arises from nothing, in fact, but too much
                            idleness. At your time of life, I did not devote my time to dalliance,
                            but, in consequence of my poverty, departed. hence for <placeName
                                key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and there acquired in arms both
                            riches and military glory." At length the matter came to this,--the
                            youth, from hearing the same things so often, and with such severity,
                            was overcome. He supposed that I, through age and affection, had more
                            judgment and foresight for him than him-self. He went off to <placeName
                                key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, Chremes, to serve under the

                                reference is also made to the "coena," or dinner," and other meals

                            When I observed this, I began to reflect thus:--"What! are so many
                            persons anxious for my sake alone, to pleasure myself only? Are so many
                            female servants to provide me with dress?<milestone n="130"

                                Thus in the Fasti of <persName>Ovid</persName>,
                                B. ii., 1. 746, <persName>Lucretia</persName> is
                                found amidst her female servants, making a cloak, or "lacerna," for
                                her husband. Suetonius says that Augustus refused to wear any
                                garments not woven by his female relations. Cooke seems to think
                                that "vestiant" alludes to the very act of putting the clothes upon
                                a person. He says, "The better sort of people had eating-dresses,
                                which are here alluded to. These dresses were light garments, to put
                                on as soon as they had bathed. They commonly bathed before eating,
                                and the chief meal was in the evening." This, however, does not seem
                                to be the meaning of the passage, although Colman has adopted it. We may here
                                remark that the censure here described is not unlike that mentioned
                                in the Prologue to the Mercator of Plautus, as administered by
                                Demaenetus to his son Charinus.</note> Shall I alone keep up such an
                            expensive establishment, while my only son, who ought equally, or even
                            more so, to enjoy these things-inasmuch as his age is better suited for
                            the enjoyment of them--him, poor youth, have I driven away from home by
                            my severity! Were I to do this, really I should deem myself deserving of

                            how his mistress may be disposed toward him. He loves her to
                            distraction: on her account, this trouble and going abroad took
                            place.</p>

                            possesses them. To him who knows how to use them, they are blessings; to

                        <p> I'll tell you. However the case stood, Clinia ought still to have
                            remained at home. Perhaps his father was a little stricter than he
                            liked: he should have put up with it. For whom ought he to bear with, if
                            he would not bear with his own father Was it reasonable that he should
                            live after his son's humor, or his son after his? And as to charging him
                            with harshness, it is not the fact. For the severities of fathers are
                            generally of one character, those I mean who are in some degree
                            reasonable men.<milestone n="205" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"

                            as it always was; so far as we could form a judgment from the

                        <p> First of all then, when we came to the house, Dromo knocked at the door;
                            a certain old woman came out; when she opened the door, he directly
                            rushed in; I followed; the old woman bolted the door, and returned to
                            her wool. On this occasion might be known, Clinia, or else on none, in
                            what pursuits she passed her life during your absence; when we thus came
                            upon a female unexpectedly. For this circumstance then gave us an
                            opportunity of judging of the course of her daily life; a thing which
                            especially discovers what is the disposition of each individual. We
                            found her industriously plying at the web; plainly clad in a mourning

                                dresses were worn. The Romans also wore mourning for the dead, which
                                seems, in the time of the Republic, to have been black or dark blue
                                for either sex. Under the Empire the men continued to wear black,
                                but the women wore white. No jewels or ornaments were worn upon

                                and much information upon this subject is given in various passages
                                in the Art of Love. In the Remedy of Love, l. 351, <persName>Ovid</persName> speaks of these practices in
                                the following terms: "At the moment, too, when she shall be smearing
                                her face with the cosmetics laid up on it, you may come into the
                                presence of your mistress, and don't let shame prevent you. You will
                                find there boxes, and a thousand colors of objects; and you will see
                                'oesypum,' the ointment of the fleece, trickling down and flowing
                                upon her heated bosom. These drugs, Phineus, smell like thy tables;
                                not once alone has sickness been caused by this to my stomach."
                                Lucretius also, in his Fourth Book, l. 1168, speaks of a female who
                                "covers herself with noxious odors, and whom her female attendants
                                fly from to a distance, and chuckle by stealth." See also the

                        <p> You wish to indulge in your amours; you wish to possess your mistress;
                            you wish that to be procured where-withal to make her presents; in
                            getting this, you do not wish the risk to be your own. You are not wise
                            to no purpose,--if indeed it is being wise to wish for that which can
                            not happen. Either the one must be had with the other, or the one must
                            be let alone with the other. Now, of these two alternatives, consider
                            which one you would prefer; although this project which I have formed, I
                            know to be both a wise and a safe one. For there is an opportunity for
                            your mistress to be with you at your father's house, without fear of a
                            discovery; besides, by these self-same means, I shall find the money
                            which you have promised her--to effect which, you have already made my
                            ears deaf with entreating me. What would you have more?</p>

                        <p> Upon my word, my dear Antiphila, I commend you, and think you fortunate
                            in having made it your study that your manners should be conformable to
                            those good looks of yours: and so may the Gods bless me, I do not at all
                            wonder if every man is in love with you. For your discourse has been a
                            proof to me what kind of disposition you possess. And when now I reflect
                            in my mind upon your way of life, and that of all of you, in fact, who
                            keep the public at a distance from yourselves, it is not surprising both
                            that you are of that disposition, and that we are not; for it is your
                            interest to be virtuous; those, with whom we are acquainted, will not
                            allow us to be so. For our lovers, allured merely by our beauty, court
                            us for that; when that has faded, they transfer their affections
                            elsewhere; and unless we have made provision in the mean time for the
                            future, we live in destitution. Now with you, when you have once
                            resolved to pass your life with one man whose manners are especially
                            kindred to your own, those persons<milestone n="393" unit="TLN line"

                                this passage: "Madame Dacier, contrary to the authority of all
                                editions and MSS., adopts a conceit of her father's in this place,
                                and places this speech to Clitipho, whom she supposes to have
                                retired to a hiding-place, where he might overhear the conversation,
                                and from whence he peeps out to make this speech to Syrus. This she
                                calls an agreeable jeu de th&pound;e&acirc;tre, and doubts
                                not but all lovers of Terence will be obliged to her father for so
                                ingenious a remark; but it is to be feared that critical sagacity
                                will not be so lavish of acknowledgments as filial piety. There does
                                not appear the least foundation for this remark in the Scene, nor
                                has the Poet given us the least room to doubt of Clitipho being
                                actually departed. To me, instead of an agreeable jeu de
                                th&pound;e&acirc;tre, it appears a most absurd and
                                ridiculous device; particularly vicious in this place, as it most
                                injudiciously tends to interrupt the course of Clinia's more

                                more than one day in the action, it is not the only one in which the
                                day is represented as breaking. The Amphitryon and the Curculio of
                                Plautts commence before daybreak, and the action is carried on into
                                the middle of the day. Madame Dacier absolutely considers it as a
                                fact beyond all doubt, that the Roman Audience went home after the
                                first two Acts of the Play, and returned for the representation of
                                the third the next morning at daybreak. Scaliger was of the same
                                opinion; but it is not generally entertained by Commentators.</note>
                            Why do I delay to knock at my neighbor's door, that he may learn from me
                            the first that his son has returned? Although I am aware that the youth
                            would not prefer this. But when I see him tormenting himself so
                            miserably about his absence, can I conceal a joy so unhoped for,
                            especially when there can be no danger to him from the discovery? I will
                            not do so; but as far as I can I will assist the old man. As I see my
                            son aiding his friend and year's-mate, and acting as his confidant in
                            his concerns, it is but right that we old men as well should assist each
                            other. <stage>Enter MENEDEMUS from his house.</stage></p>

                            fall from the one side as from the other. In the first place, formerly,
                            rather than allow your son to visit a young woman, who was then content
                            with a very little, and to whom any thing was acceptable, you frightened
                            him away from here. After that, she began, quite against her
                            inclination, to seek a subsistence upon the town. Now, when she can not
                            be supported without a great expense, you are ready to give any thing.
                            For, that you may know how perfectly she is trained to extravagance, in
                            the first place, she has already brought with her more than ten female

                                "Dolia omnia, omnes serias." The finer kinds of wine were drawn off
                                from the " dolia," or large vessels, into the "amphorae," which,
                                like the "dolia," were made of earth, and sometimes of glass. The
                                mouths of the vessels were stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork,
                                which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being rubbed over
                                with a composition of pitch, clay, wax, or gypsum. On the outside,
                                the title of the wine was painted, and among the Romans the date of
                                the vintage was denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office.
                                When the vessels were of glass, small tickets or labels, called
                                "pittacia," were suspended from them, stating to a similar effect.
                                The "seriae" were much the same as the "dolia," perhaps somewhat
                                smaller; they were both long, bell-mouthed vessels of earthen-ware,
                                formed of the best clay, and lined with pitch while hot from the
                                furnace. "Seriae" were also used to contain oil and other liquids;
                                and in the Captivi of Plautus the word is applied to pans used for
                                the purpose of salting meat. "Relino" signifies the act of taking
                                the seal of pitch or Wax off the stopper of the
                            wine-vessel.</note>;" she kept all on the stir: and this but a single

                                old times, a " laudator temporis acti," is wishful to flatter the
                                vanity of Chremes, as it is a feeling common to old age, perhaps by
                                no means an unamiable one, to think former times better than the
                                present. Aged people feel grateful to those happy hours when their
                                hopes were bright, and every thing was viewed from the sunny side of
                                life.</note> but as times are now, very passable: nor do I in the

                            he was not abounding in wealth, his son ran away through want. Are you

                                Madame Dacier suggests that Chremes is prevented by his wife's
                                coming from making a proposal to advance the money himself, on the
                                supposition that it will be a lucrative speculation. This notion is
                                contradicted by Colman, who adds the following note from Eugraphius:
                                "Syrus pretends to have concerted this plot against Menedemus, in
                                order to trick him out of some money to be given to Clinia's
                                supposed mistress. Chremes, however, does not approve of this: yet
                                it serves to carry on the plot; for when Antiphila proves afterward
                                to be the daughter of Chremes, he necessarily becomes the debtor of
                                Bacchis, and is obliged to lay down the sum for which he imagines
                                his daughter is pledged."</note>

                            every thing you both speak and act ignorantly and foolishly: how many
                            blunders you disclose in this single affair! For, in the first place,
                            then, if you had been disposed to obey my orders, the child ought to
                            have been dispatched; you ought not in words to have feigned her death,
                            and in reality to have left hopes of her surviving. But that I pass
                            over; compassion, maternal affection, I allow it. But how finely you did
                            provide for the future! What was your meaning ? Do reflect. It's clear,
                            beyond a doubt, that your daughter was betrayed by you to this old
                            woman, either that through you she might make a living by her, or that
                            she might be sold in open market as a slave. I suppose you reasoned
                            thus: " any thing is enough, if only her life is saved :" what are you
                            to do with those who understand neither law, nor right and justice? Be
                            it for better or for worse, be it for them or against them, they see

                                some jewel or trinket among their clothes, hoping thereby to avoid
                                incurring the guilt above mentioned, and to ease their

                                "Infortunium!" was the name by which the slaves commonly denoted a
                                beating. Colman has the following remark here: " Madame Dacier, and
                                most of the later critics who have implicitly followed her, tell us
                                that in the interval between the third and fourth Acts, Syrus has
                                been present at the interview between Chremes and Antiphila within.
                                The only difficulty in this doctrine is how to reconcile it to the
                                apparent ignorance of Syrus, which he discovers at the entrance of
                                Clinia. But this objection, says she, is easily answered. Syrus
                                having partly heard Antiphila's story, and finding things likely to
                                take an unfavorable turn, retires, to consider what is best to be
                                done. But surely this is a most unnatural impatience at so critical
                                a conjuncture; and, after all, would it not be better to take up the
                                matter just where Terence has left it, and to suppose that Syrus
                                knew nothing more of the affair than what might be collected from
                                the late conversation between Chremes and Sostrata, at which we know
                                he was present ? This at once accounts for his apprehensions, which
                                he betrayed even during that Scene, as well as for his imperfect
                                knowledge of the real state of the case, till apprised of the whole

                            placed in a state of security. For if you now go away from us, and leave
                            Bacchis here, our old man will immediately come to know that she is
                            Clitipho's mistress; if you take her away with you, it will be concealed
                            just as much as it has been hitherto concealed.</p>

                            for with what face am I to address my father about it? You understand
                            what I mean ?</p>

                            for a wife: that this Bacchis is Clitipho's mistress.</p>

                            And I suppose, then, you would have me request my father to keep it a
                            secret from your old man.</p>

                        <p> What? Are you quite in your senses or sober? Why, you were for ruining
                            him outright. For how could he be in a state of security ? Tell me
                            that.</p>

                        <p> For my part, I yield the palm to this device. Here I do pride myself
                            exultingly, in having in myself such exquisite resources, and power of
                            address so great, as to deceive them both by telling the truth: so that
                            when your old man tells ours that she is his son's mistress, he'll still
                            not believe him.</p>

                        <p> But yet, by these means you again cut off all hopes of my marriage; for
                            as long as Chremes believes that she is my mistress, he'll not give me
                            his daughter. Perhaps you care little what becomes of me, so long as you
                            provide for him.</p>

                                Colman quotes the following remark from Patrick: "There is a
                                remarkable passage in Arrian's Account of Alexander, lib. iv., where
                                he tells us that some embassadors from the Celtae, being asked by
                                Alexander what in the world they dreaded most, answered, ' That they
                                feared lest the sky should fall [upon them].' Alexander, who
                                expected to hear himself named, was surprised at an answer which
                                signified that they thought themselves beyond the reach of all human
                                power, plainly implying that nothing could hurt them, unless he
                                would suppose impossibilities, or a total destruction of nature."
                                Aristotle, in his Physics, B. iv., informs us that it was the early
                                notion of ignorant nations that the sky was supported on the
                                shoulders of Atlas, and that when he let go of it, it would
                                fall.</note>

                                of composition, and quoted certain lines which occur in the

                                speech in the original, and the Commentators have been puzzled to
                                make sense of them. It seems to me that the Poet's intention is no
                                more than this: Bacchis expresses some reluctance to act under the
                                direction of Syrus, but is at length prevailed on, finding that he
                                can by those means contrive to pay her the money which he has

                            come, his son was so greatly missed by him; but when he sees such a vast
                            expense incurred by him every day at home, and no limit to it, he'll
                            wish that this son would leave him a second time. See--here comes Syrus
                            most opportunely.</p>

                        <p> Just as you please. I don't mean that in reality you should give her to
                            him, but that you should pretend it.</p>

                            not to mix me up in them. Do you think that I'll betroth my daughter to
                            a person to whom I will not marry her?</p>

                        <p> It might have been cleverly managed; and I under-took this affair for
                            the very reason, that a short time since you so urgently requested
                            it.</p>

                            about; but in some other way.</p>

                        <p> It shall be done: some other method must be thought of; but as to what I
                            was telling you of,--about the money which she owes to Bacchis,--that
                            must now be repaid her. And you will not, of course, now be having
                            recourse to this method; "What have I to do with it? Was it lent to me?
                            Did I give any orders? Had she the power to pawn my daughter without my
                            consent?" They quote that saying, Chremes, with good reason, " Riorous

                            and at the same time I shall effect more easily what I wish. Here he

                            difficult when you do it with reluctance. As this walk of mine, for
                            instance, though not fatiguing, it has reduced me to weariness. And now
                            I dread nothing more than that I should be packed off somewhere hence
                            once again, that I may not have access to Bacchis. May then all the Gods

                                the beginning of the Play.</note>

                            debaucheries here reduce his father to beggary! For if I go on supplying
                            his extravagance, Menedemus, in that case my circumstances will
                            undoubtedly be soon reduced to the level of your rake.</p>

                            this effect, that I have settled all my property on her as her

                                following Note: "The departure of Menedemus here is very abrupt,
                                seeming to be in the midst of a conversation; and his re-entrance
                                with Clitipho, already supposed to be apprised of what has passed
                                between the two old gentlemen, is equally precipitate. Menage
                                imagines that some verses are lost here. Madame Dacier strains hard
                                to defend the Poet, and fills up the void of time by her old
                                expedient of making the Audience wait to see Chremes walk
                                impatiently to and fro, till a sufficient time is elapsed for
                                Menedemus to have given Clitipho a summary account of the cause of
                                his father's anger. The truth is, that a too strict observance of
                                the unity of place will necessarily produce such absurdities; and
                                there are several other instances of the like nature in

                            importance, and did not look forward to the future, I took measures that
                            you might neither want nor be able to waste this which I have. When,

                                they had committed any fault, and then suing for pardon through a
                                "precator" or "mediator." See the Mostellaria of Plautus, 1. 1074,
                                where Tranio takes refuge at the altar from the vengeance of his
                                master, Theuropides.</note> or for an intercessor for yourself.</p>

                        <p> I'll tell you what's come into my mind; be you the judge. While they had
                            you alone, while they had no other source of joy more nearly to affect
                            them, they indulged you, they lavished upon you. Now a daughter has been
                            found, a pretense has been found in fact on which to turn you
                            adrift.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> It's very probable.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Do you suppose that he is so angry on account of this fault?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> I do not think so.</p>

                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Now consider another thing. All mothers are wont to be advocates for
                            their sons when in fault, and to aid them against a father's severity;
                            'tis not so here.</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> You say true; what then shall I now do, Syrus?</p>
                    </sp>
                    <sp>
                        <speaker>SYRUS</speaker>
                        <p> Question them on this suspicion; mention the matter without reserve;
                            either, if it is not true, you'll soon bring them both to compassion, or
                            else you'll soon find out whose son you are. </p>
                    </sp>

                        <speaker>CLITIPHO</speaker>
                        <p> You give good advice; I'll do so. <stage>He goes into the house of
                                CHREMES.</stage></p>

                            For the less hope the young man entertains, the greater the difficulty
                            with which he'll bring his father to his own terms. I'm not sure even,
                            that he may not take a wife, and then no thanks for Syrus. But what is
                            this? The old man's coming out of doors; I'll be off. What has so far
                            happened, I am surprised at, that he didn't order me to becarried off
                            from here: now I'll away to Menedemus here, I'll secure him as my
                            intercessor; I can put no trust in our old man. <stage>Goes into the

                                    been found</lemma>: This sentence has given much trouble to the
                                Commentators. Colman has
                                the following just remarks upon it: "Madame Dacier, as well as all
                                the rest of the Commentators, has stuck at these words. Most of them
                                imagine she means to say, that the discovery of Antiphila is a plain
                                proof that she is not barren. Madame Dacier supposes that she
                                intimates such a proof to be easy, because Clitipho and Antiphila
                                were extremely alike; which sense she thinks immediately confirmed
                                by the answer of Chremes. I can not agree with any of them, and
                                think that the whole difficulty of the passage here, as in many
                                other places, is entirely of their own making. Sostrata could not
                                refer to the reply of Chremes, because she could not possibly tell
                                what it would be; but her own speech is intended as an answer to his
                                preceding one, which she takes as a sneer on her late wonderful
                                discovery of a daughter; imagining that he means to insinuate that
                                she could at any time with equal ease make out the proofs of the
                                birth of her son. The elliptical mode of expression so usual with
                                Terence, together with the refinements of Commentators, seem to have
                                created all the obscurity."</note></p>

                            is just like you in disposition, you will easily prove that he is your
                            child; for he is exactly like you; why, he has not a single vice left
                            him but you have just the same. Then, besides, no woman could have been
                            the mother of such a son but yourself. But he's coming out of doors, and
                            how demure! When you understand the matter, you may form your own
                            conclusions.</p>
