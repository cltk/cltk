<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>CHREMES and DEMIPHO are two aged Athenians, brothers. Nausistrata, the wife of Chremes, is a wealthy woman, possessed of large estates in the island of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>. Chremes, who goes thither yearly to receive the rents, meets with a poor woman there, whom he secretly marries, and has by her a daughter called Phanium: while engaged in this intrigue, Chremes passes at <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> by the name of Stilpho. By his wife, Nausistrata, at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, Chremes has a son, named Phaedria, and his brother has a son, named Antipho. Phanium having now arrived at her fifteenth year, the two brothers privately agree that she shall be brought to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and married to Antipho. For this purpose, Chremes goes to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, while Demipho is obliged to take a journey to <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>. On departing, they leave their sons in the care of Geta, one of Demipho's servants. Shortly afterward, Phaedria falls in love with a Music-girl, but, from want of means, is unable to purchase her from her owner. In the mean time, the Lemnian wife of Chremes, urged by poverty, embarks for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, whither she arrives with her daughter and her nurse. Here they inquire for Stilpho, but in vain, as they can not find any one of that name. Shortly after, the mother dies, and Antipho, seeing Phanium by accident, falls in love with her. Being wishful to marry her, he applies to Phormio, a Parasite, for his advice. The latter hits upon the following scheme: there being a law at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which obliges the next-of-kin to female orphans, either to marry them or give them a portion, the Parasite pretends that he is a friend of Phanium, and insists that Antipho is her nearest relation, and is consequently bound to marry her. Antipho is summoned before a court of justice, and it being previously arranged, allows judgment to be given against himself, and immediately marries Phanium. Shortly after, the old men return upon the same day, and are much vexed, the one on finding that his son has married a woman without a fortune, the other that he has lost the opportunity of getting his daughter advantageously married. In the mean time, Phaedria being necessitated to raise some money to purchase the Music-girl, Geta and Phormio arrange that the former shall pretend to the old man that Phormio has consented to take back the woman whom Antipho has married, if Demipho will give her a portion of thirty mine. Demipho borrows the money of Chremes, and pays it to Phormio, who hands it over to Phaedria, and Phaedria to Dorio, for his mistress. At this conjuncture, it becomes known who Phanium really is, and the old men are delighted to find that Antipho has married the very person they wished. They attempt, however, to get back the thirty minae from Phormio, and proceed to threats and violence. On this, Phormio, who has accidentally learned the intrigue of Chremes with the woman of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, exposes him, and relates the whole story to his wife, Nausistrata; on which she censures her husband for his bad conduct, and the Play concludes with her thanks to Phormio for his information.

<head>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</head>
<p>DEMIPHO, the brother of Chremes, has gone abroad, his son Antipho being left at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Chremes has secretly a wife and a daughter at <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, another wife at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and an only son, who loves a Music-girl. The mother arrives at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, and there dies. The girl, her orphan daughter, (Chremes being away,) arranges the funeral. After Antipho has fallen in love with her when seen there, through the aid of the Parasite he receives her as his wife. His father and Chremes, having now returned. begin to be enraged. Afterward they give thirty minae to the Parasite, that he may take her as his own wife. With this money the Music-girl is bought for Phoedria. Antipho then keeps his wife, who has been recognized by his uncle.

<sp><speaker>THE PROLOGUE.</speaker><p>SINCE the old Poet<milestone n="1" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Since the old Poet</lemma>: He alludes to his old enemy, Luscus Lavinius, who is mentioned in all his Prologues, except those to the Hecyra.</note> can not withdraw our bard from his pursuits and reduce him to indolence, he endeavors, by invectives, to deter him from writing: for he is wont to say to this effect,--that the Plays which he has hitherto composed are poor in their language, and of meagre style; because he has nowhere described a frantic youth as seeing a hind in flight, and the hounds pursuing; while he implores<note anchored="yes">While one implored)--Ver. 8. "Et eam plorare, orare ut subveniat sibi." This is probably in allusion to some absurd passage in one of the Plays of Lavinius. It is generally supposed to mean, that the stag implores the young man; but as the youth is mad, the absurdity of the passage is heightened if we suppose that he implores the stag, and, in the moment of its own danger, entreats it to come to his own assistance; as certainly the Latin will admit of that interpretation.--Ovid has a somewhat similar passage in the Pontic Epistles, B. ii. Ep. ii. 1. 39: "The hind that, in its terror, is flying from the savage dogs, hesitates not to trust itself to the neighboring house."</note> and entreated that he would give her aid. But if he had been aware that his Play, when formerly first represented, stood its ground more through the merits of the performers than its own, he would attack with much less boldness than he does. Now, if there is any one who says or thinks to this effect, that if the old Poet had not assailed him first, the young one could have devised no Prologue for him to repeat, without having some one to abuse, let him receive this for an answer: "that the prize is proposed in common to. all who apply to the Dramatic art." He has aimed at driving our Poet from his studies to absolute want; he then has in-tended this for an answer, not an attack. If he had opposed him with fair words, he would have heard himself civilly addressed; what has been given by him, let him consider as now returned. I will make an end of speaking about him, when, of his own accord, he himself makes an end of offending. Now give your attention to what I request. I present you a new Play, which they call "Epidicazomenos,"<milestone n="25" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Epidicazomenos</lemma>: A Play of Apollodorus, so called from that Greek word, signifying "one who demands justice from another," in. allusion to Phormio, who is the complainant in the suit, which is the foundation of the plot.</note> in Greek: in the Latin, he calls it "Phormio;" because the person that acts the principal part is Phormio, a Parasite, through whom, principally, the plot will be' carried on, if your flavor attends the Poet. Lend your attention; in silence give an ear with impartial feelings, that we may not experience a like fortune to what we did, when, through a tumult, our Company was driven from the place;<milestone n="32" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Was driven from the place</lemma>: Alluding, probably, to the disturbances which took place at the first representation of the Hecyra, and which are mentioned in the Prologues to that Play.</note> which place, the merit of the actor, and your good-will and candor seconding it, has since restored unto us.

<stage>Enter DAVUS,<note anchored="yes">Davus is a protatic character, only introduced for the purpose of opening the story.</note> with a bag of money in his hand.</stage>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Geta, my very good friend and fellow-townsman, came to me yesterday. There had been for some time a trifling balance of money of his in my hands upon a small account; he asked me to make it up. I have done so, and am carrying it to him. But I hear that his master's son has taken a wife; this, I suppose, is scraped together as a present for her. How unfair a custom!--that those who have the least should always be giving something to the more wealthy! That which the poor wretch has with difficulty spared, ounce by ounce, out of his allowance,<milestone n="43" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Out of his allowance</lemma>: Donatus tells us that the slaves received four "modii," or measures of corn, each month, which was called their "demensum."</note> defrauding himself of every indulgence, the whole of it will she carry of, without thinking with how much labor it has been acquired.

"To strike" a person for a present was said when it was extorted from him reluctantly. So in the Trinummuns of Plautus, 1. 247, "Ibi illa pendentem ferit."

Madame Dacier thinks it was an initiation into the great mysteries of <persName>Ceres</persName>, which was commonly performed while children were yet very young; others suggest that it means the period of weaning the child, and initiating it into the use of another kind of diet. Donatus says, that Varro speaks of children being initiated into the mysteries of the Deities Edulia, Potica, and Cuba, the Divinities of Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping.</note> too: all this the mother will carry off; the child will only be the pretext for the present. But don't I see Geta there?

<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Well then, listen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I give you my best attention.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Well, and his son Phaedria?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> As well as your own self.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> It so happened to both the old gentlemen, just at the same period, that the one had to take a journey to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, and our old man to <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>, to see an old acquaintance; he tempted over the old man by letters, promising him all but mountains of gold.

<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Ah, Geta, you undertook a hard task there.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> I came to experience it, I know that.

As long as I was trusty to the old men, I was paid for it in my shoulder-blades. This, then, occurred to my mind: why, this is folly to kick against the spur.<milestone n="78" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Kick against the spur</lemma>: "To kick against the pricks," or "in spite of the spur," was a common Greek proverb.--The expression occurs in the New Testament, Acts ix. 5.

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Our young fellow did no mischief whatever at first; that Phaedria at once picked up a certain damsel, a Music-girl, and fell in love with her to distraction. She belonged to a most abominable Procurer; and their fathers had taken good care that they should have nothing to give him.. There remained nothing for him then but to feed his eyes, to follow her about, to escort her to the school,<milestone n="86" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To the school</lemma>: It was the custom for the "lenones," or "procurers," to send their female slaves to music-schools, in order to learn accomplishments. So in the Prologue to the Rudens of Plautus: "This Procurer brought the maiden to <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> hither. A-certain Athenian youth, a citizen of this city, beheld her as she was going home from the music-school."</note> and to escort her back again. We, having nothing to do, lent our aid to Phaedria. Near the school at which she was taught, right opposite the place, there was a certain barber's shop: here we were generally in the habit of waiting for her, until she was coming home again. In the mean time, while one day we were sitting there, there came in a young man in tears;<note anchored="yes">Young man in tears)--Ver. 92. In the Play of Apollodorus, it was the barber himself that gave the account how he had just returned from cutting off the young woman's hair, which was one of the usual ceremonies in mourning among the Greeks. Donatus remarks, that Terence altered this circumstance that he might not shock a Roman audience by a reference to manners so different from their own.</note> we were surprised at this. We inquired what was the matter? "Never," said he, "has poverty appeared to me a burden so grievous and so insupportable as just now. I have just seen a certain poor young woman in this neighborhood lamenting her dead mother. She was laid out before her, and not a single friend, acquaintance, or relation was there with her, except one poor old woman, to assist her in the funeral: I pitied her. The girl herself was of surpassing beauty." What need of a long story? She moved us all. At once Antipho exclaims, "Would you like us to go and visit her?" The other said, "I think awe ought--let us go--show us the way, please." We went, and arrived there; we saw her; the girl was beautiful, and that you might say so the more, there was no heightening to her beauty; her hair disheveled, her feet bare, herself neglected, and in tears; her dress:mean, so 'that, had there not been an excess of beauty in her very charms, these circumstances must have extinguished those charms. The one who had lately fallen in love with the Music-girl said: "She is well enough;" but our youth----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I know it already-fell in love with her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Can you imagine to what an extent? Observe the consequence. The day after, he goes straight to the old woman; entreats her to let him have her: she, on the other hand, refuses him, and says that he is not acting properly; that,she is a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, virtuous, and born of honest parents: that if he wishes to make her his wife, he is at liberty to do so according to law; but if otherwise, she gives him a refusal. Our youth was at a loss what to. do. He was both eager to marry her, and he dreaded his absent father.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Would not his father, if he had returned, have given him leave?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> He let him marry a girl with no fortune, and of obscure birth! He would never do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> What came of it at last?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> What came of it? There is one Phormio here, a Parasite, a fellow of great assurance; may all the Gods confound him!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> What has he done?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> He has given this piece of advice, which I will tell you of. "There is a law, that orphan girls are to marry those who are their next-of-kin; and the same law commands such persons to marry them. I'll say you are the next-of-kin, and take out a summons<milestone n="127" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Take out a summons</lemma>: "Dica" was the writ or summons with which an action at law was commenced.</note> against you; I'll pretend that I am a friend of the girl's father; we will come before the judges: who her father was, who her mother, how she is related to you--all this I'll trump up, just as will be advantageous and suited to my purpose; on your disproving none of these things, I shall prevail, of course. Your father will return; a quarrel will be the consequence; what care I? She will still be ours."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> An amusing piece of assurance!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> He was, persuaded to this. It was carried out; they came into court: we were beaten. He has married her.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Upon my faith, I don't know; this one thing I do know, whatever fortune may bring, I'll bear it with firmness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> You please me; well, that is the duty of a man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> All my hope is in myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I commend you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Suppose I have recourse to some one to intercede for me, who will plead for: me in these terms: "Pray, do forgive him this time; but if after this he does any thing, I make no entreaty:" if only he doesn't add, "When I've gone, e'en kill him for my part."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> What of the one who was usher to the Music-girl?<note anchored="yes">Usher to the Music-girl)--
Ver. 144. This is said satirically of Phaedria, who was in the habit of escorting the girl to the music-school. It was the duty of the "paedagogi," or "tutors," to lead the children to school, who were placed under their care. See the speech of Lydus, the paedagogus of Pistoclerus, in the Bacchides of Plautus, Act iii. Sc. 3, where, enlarging upon his duties, he mentions this among them.</note>

<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Perhaps he hasn't much to give.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Why, really, nothing at all, except mere hopes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Is his father come back or not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Not yet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Well, when do you expect your old man?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> I don't know for certain; but I just now heard that a letter has been brought from him, and has been left with the officers of the customs: I'm going to fetch it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Is there any thing else that you want with me, Geta?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Nothing, but that I wish you well. <stage>Exit DAVUS.</stage> Hark you, boy <stage>calling at the door</stage>.

<stage>Enter ANTIPHO and PHAEDRIA.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> That things should have come to such a pass, Phaedria, that I should be in utter dread ,of my father, who wishes me so well, whenever his return comes into my thoughts! Had I not been inconsiderate, I might have waited for him, as I ought to have done.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Do you ask the question? You, who have been my confederate in so bold an adventure? How I do wish it had never entered the mind of Phormio to persuade me to this, or to urge me in the heat of my passion to this step, which is the source of my misfortunes. Then I should not have obtained her; in that case I might have been uneasy for some few days; but still, this perpetual anxiety would not have been tormenting my mind <stage>touching PHAEDRIA</stage>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> I hear you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> While I am every moment expecting his return, who is to sever from me this connection.<note anchored="yes">Sever from me this connection)--Ver. 161. By forcing him to divorce her.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Other men feel uneasiness because they can not gain what they love; you complain because you have too much. You are surfeited with love, Antipho. Why, really, upon my faith, this situation of yours is surely one to be coveted and desired. So may the Gods kindly bless me, could I be at liberty to be so long in possession of the object of my love, I could contentedly die. Do you, then, form a judgment as to the rest, what I am now suffering from this privation, and what pleasure you enjoy from the possession of your desires; not to mention how, without any expense, you have obtained a well-born and genteel woman, and have got a wife of unblemished reputation: happy you, were not this one thing wanting, a mind capable of bearing all this with moderation. If you had to deal with that Procurer with whom I have to deal, then you would soon be sensible of it. We are mostly all of us inclined by nature to be dissatisfied with our lot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Still, on the other hand, Phadria, you now seem to me the fortunate man, who still have the liberty, without restraint, of resolving on what pleases you best: whether to keep, to love on, or to give her up. I, unfortunately, have got my-self into that position, that I have neither right<note anchored="yes">Neither right)--Ver, 176. No right to get rid of her in consequence of the judgment which, at the suit of Phormio, has been pronounced against him; nor yet, right to keep her, because of his father insisting upon turning her out of doors.</note> to give her up, nor liberty to retain her. But how's this? Is it our Geta I see running this way? 'Tis he himself. Alas! I'm dreadfully afraid what news it is he's now bringing me.</p></sp></div2>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself.</stage> Geta, you are undone, unless you instantly find out some expedient; so suddenly do such mighty evils now threaten me thus unprepared, which I neither know how to shun, nor how to extricate myself therefrom; for this daring step of:ours can not now any longer be kept a secret. If such a result is not adroitly guarded against, these matters will cause the ruin of myself, or of my master.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>to PHAEDRIA.</stage> Why, I wonder, is he coming in such fright?:</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself.</stage> Besides, I've but a moment left for this matter--my master's close at hand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>to PHAEDRIA.</stage> What mischief is this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself.</stage> When he comes to hear of it, what remedy shall I discover for his anger Am I to speak? I shall irritate him: be silent? I shall provoke him: excuse myself? I should be washing a brickbat.<note anchored="yes">Be washing a brickbat)--
Ver. 187. "Laterem lavare," "to wash a brick,"' or "tile," was a proverb signifying labor in vain, probably because (if the brick was previously baked) it was impossible to wash away the red color of it. According to some, the saying alluded to the act of washing a brick which had been only dried in the sun, in which case the party so doing both washed away the brick and soiled his own fingers.</note> Alas! unfortunate me! While I am trembling for myself, this Antipho distracts my mind. I am concerned for him; I'm in dread for him: 'tis he that now keeps me here; for had it not been for him, I should have made due provision for my safety, and have taken vengeance on the old man for his crabbedness; I should have scraped up something, and straightway taken to my heels away from here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>to PHAEDRIA.</stage> I wonder What running away or theft it is that he's planning.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself.</stage> But where shall I find Antipho, or which way go look for him?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>to himself.</stage> I'll make my way homeward; he's generally there.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> <stage>to ANTIPHO.</stage> Let's call the fellow back.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>calling out.</stage> Stop, this instant.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Geta!</p></sp>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Pray, tell me what news you bring, and dispatch it in one word, if you can.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> I'll do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Out with it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Just now, at the harbor----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> What, my father?----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> You've hit it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p>. Ruined outright!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Pshaw!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> What am I to do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> <stage>to GETA.</stage> What is it you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> That I have seen his father, your uncle.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> How am I, wretch that I am, now to find a remedy for this sudden misfortune? But if it should be my fortune, Phanium, to be torn away from you, life would cease to be desirable.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Therefore, Antipho, since matters are thus, the more need have you to be on your guard; fortune helps the brave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I am not myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> But just now it is especially necessary you should be so, Antipho; for if your father perceives that you are alarmed, he will think that you have been guilty of sone fault.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> That's true.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I can not change.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> What would you do, if now something else still more difficult had to be done by you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> As I am not equal to this, I should be still less so to the other.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> This is doing nothing at all, Phaedria, let's be gone; why do we waste our time here to no purpose. I shall be off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> And I too. <stage>They move as if going.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Pray, now, if I assume an air, will that do? <stage>He endeavors to assume another air.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> You are trifling.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Look at my countenance--there's for you. <stage>Assuming a different air.</stage> Will that do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> No.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Well, will this? <stage>Assuming another air.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Pretty well.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Well then, this? <stage>Assuming a still bolder air.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> That's just the thing. There now, keep to that, and answer him word for word, like for like; don't let him, in his anger, disconcert you with his blustering words.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I understand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Say that you were forced against your will by law, by sentence of the court; do you take me? <stage>Looking earnestly in one direction.</stage> But who is the old man that I see at the end of the street?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> 'Tis he himself. I can not stand it. <stage>Going.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Oh! What are you about? Whither are you going, Antipho? Stop, I tell you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I know my own self and my offense; to your management I trust Phanium and my own existence. <stage>(Exit hastily.)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Geta, what's to be done now?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> You will just hear some harsh language: I shall be trussed up and trounced, if I am not somewhat mistaken. But what we were just now advising Antipho to do, the same we must do ourselves, Phaedria.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Away with your "musts;" rather do you command me what I am to do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> DO you remember what were your words formerly on our entering upon this project, with the view of protecting yourselves from ill consequences--that their cause was just, clear, unanswerable, and most righteous?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> I remember it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Well then, now there's need of that plea, or of one still better and more plausible, if such there can be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> I'll use my best endeavors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Do you then accost him first; I'll be here in re-serve,<note anchored="yes">Here in reserve)--Ver. 230. "Succenturiatus."

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart to PHAEDRIA.</stage> Just brought in at last.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> What will they say to me, or what excuse will they find? I wonder much.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> Why, I've found that out already; do think of something else.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Will he be saying this to me: "I did it against my will; the law compelled me?" I hear you, and admit it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> Well said!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> But knowingly, in silence, to give up the cause to his adversaries--did the law oblige him to do that as well?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> That is a hard blow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> I'll clear that up; let me alone for that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> It is a matter of doubt what I am to do; for beyond expectation, and quite past all belief, has this befallen me. So enraged am I, that I can not compose my mind to think upon it. Wherefore it is the duty of all persons, when affairs are the most prosperous,<note anchored="yes">When affairs are the most prosperous)--Ver. 241.

Whatever falls out beyond his hopes, all that he must look upon as so much gain.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> O Phaedria, it is incredible how much I surpass my master in wisdom. All my misfortunes have been already calculated upon by me, upon my master coming home. I must grind at the mill, be beaten, wear fetters, be set to work in the fields; not one individual thing of these will happen unexpected by my mind. Whatever falls out beyond my expectations, all that I shall look upon as so much gain. But why do you hesitate to accost him, and soften him at the outset with fair words? <stage>PHAEDRIA goes forward to accost DEMIPHO.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Do you ask me, Phaedria? You people have cooked up a fine marriage in my absence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> What now, are you angry with him for that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> What a clever contriver!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Have I not reason to be angry with him? I long for him to come into my sight, that he may know that through his faultiness, from being a mild father, I am become a most severe one.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> But he has done nothing, uncle, for which you should blame him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Now, do look at that; all alike; all hanging together; when you know one, you know all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> That is not the case.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> When the one is in fault, the other is at hand to defend him; when it is the other, then he is ready; they just help one another by turns.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> The old man, without. knowing it, has exactly described their proceedings.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> For if it had not been so, you would not, Phaedria, have stood up for him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> If, uncle; it is the fact, that Antipho has been guilty of any fault, in consequence of which he has been too regardless of his interest or his reputation, I would not allege any reason why he should not suffer what he deserves. But if some one by chance, relying upon his own artfulness, has laid a snare for our youthful age, and has succeeded, is it our fault or that of the judges, who often, through envy, take away from the rich, or, through compassion, award to the poor?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> Unless I knew the case, I could fancy he was saying the truth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Is there any judge who can possibly know your rights, when you yourself don't answer a word--as he has done?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> He acted the part of an ingenuous young man; after they had come before the judges, he was not able to say what he had intended, so much did his modesty confuse him there through his bashfulness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> I commend him: but why do I hesitate at once to accost the old man? <stage>Going forward to DEMIPHO.</stage> Master, welcome to you! I'm glad to see you safe returned.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> For some minutes past I've heard you accusing all of us undeservedly; and me the most undeservedly of them all; for what would you have had me do for you in this affair?

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Aye, aye, fine talking; as if any one would have trusted him, while you were living.<note anchored="yes">While you were living)--Ver. 302. There was a law at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> which enacted that persons who lent money to young men in the lifetime of their parents should have no power to recover it.

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> No, it shall not be so; it must not be. Ought I to allow her to remain with him as his wife a single day? She merits no indulgence. I should like this fellow to be pointed out to me, or to be shown where he lives.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> O brave and kind man! But, Phormio, I often dread lest this courage may end in the stocks at last.<note anchored="yes">In the stock at last)--Ver. 325. "In nervum; crumpat denique." There are several interpretations suggested for these words. Some think they allude to the drawing of a bow till it breaks; but they are more generally thought to imply termination in corporal punishment. "Nervus" is supposed to have been the name of a kind of stocks used in torturing slaves, and so called from being formed, in part at least, of the sinews of animals.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Oh, by no means; I've made trial, and have already pondered on the paths for my feet. How many men before to-day do you suppose I have beaten, even to death, strangers as well as citizens: the better I understand it, the oftener I try it. Just tell me, look you, did you ever hear of an action of damages being brought against me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> How is that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Because the net is never spread for the hawk or the kite, that do us the mischief; it is spread for those that do us none: because in the last there is profit, while with the others it is labor lost.- For persons, out of whom any thing can be got, there's risk from others; they know that I've got nothing.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> It's impossible that sufficient thanks can be returned you by him for your kindness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Why no; no person can return thanks sufficient to his patron<note anchored="yes">To his patron)--Ver. 338. "Regi." The Parasites were in the habit of calling their patron "Rex," their "King."</note> for his kindness. For you to take your place at table at free cost,<note anchored="yes">At free cost)--Ver. 339.

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> What is the meaning of that expression?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> When you are in doubt which in especial to par-take of. When you enter upon a consideration how delicious these things are, and how costly they are, the person who provides them, must you not account him a very God--neither more nor less?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Oh, the impudence of the fellow! Does he come on purpose to accuse me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> For really, I have no reason why I should be offended at the young man, if he did not know him; since that person, when growing aged and poor, and supporting himself by his labor, generally confined himself to the country; there hehad a piece of land from my father to cultivate; full oft, in the mean time, did the old. man tell me that this kinsman of his neglected him: but what a man?

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>sneeringly.</stage> You are fishing it out, just as if you didn't know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> I, know?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PEM.</speaker><p> Yes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> I say I do not; you, Who affirm it, recall it to my recollection.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Come now, didn't you know your own cousin-ger-man?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> You torture me to death; tell me his name.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> His name?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Of course. <stage>PHORMIO hesitates.</stage> Why are you silent now?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> Heavens, I'm undone; I've forgot the name.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Well, what do you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to GETA.</stage> Geta, if you recollect the name I told you a short time since, prompt me. <stage>Aloud, to DEMIPHO.</stage> Well then, I sha'n't tell you; as if you didn't know, you come to pump me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> But, after all, what matters that to me? It is Stilpho.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Whom did you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Stilpho, I tell you; you knew him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> I neither know him, nor had I ever any relation of that name.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Say you so? Are you not ashamed of this? But if he had left you ten talents----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> May the Gods confound you!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> You'd have been the first, from memory, to trace your line of kindred, even as far back as from grandfather and great-grandfather.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Very likely what you say. In that case, when I had undertaken it, I should have shown how she was related to me; do you do the same: tell me, how is she related to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Well done, my master, that's right! <stage>Threateningly to PHORMIO.</stage> Hark you, take you care.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> I've already made the matter quite plain where I ought, before the judges; besides, if it was untrue, why didn't your son disprove it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Do you talk about my son to me? Of whose folly there is no speaking in the language it deserves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Then do you, who are so wise, go to the magistrates, that for you they may give a second decision in the same cause, since you reign alone<note anchored="yes">Since you reign alone)--Ver. 605. This is a remark well put into the mouth of an Athenian, as the public were very jealous of any person becoming paramount to the laws, and to prevent it, were frequently guilty of the most odious oppression.</note> here, and are the only man allowed to get a second trial in the same cause.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Although wrong has been done me, still, however, rather than engage in litigation, or listen to you, just as though she had been my relation, as the law orders one to find her a portion, rid me of her, and take five minae.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> laughing.) Ha, ha, ha! a pleasant individual!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Well! am I asking any thing unfair? Or am I not to obtain even this, which is my right at common law?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Pray, really is it so, that when you have abused-her like a courtesan, the law orders you to pay her hire and pack her off? Or is it the fact, that in order that a citizen may bring no disgrace upon herself through poverty, she has been ordered to be given to her nearest relative, to pass her life with him alone? A thing which you mean to prevent.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Yes, to her nearest.relative, indeed; but why to us, or on what ground?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Well, well, a thing tried, they say, you can't try over again.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Not try it? On the contrary, I shall not desist until I have gone through with it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> You are trifling.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Only let me alone for that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> In short, Demipho, I have nothing to do with you; your son has been cast, and not you; for your time of life for marrying has now gone by.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Consider that it is he that says to you all I now say, or else assuredly, together with this wife of his, I'll be forbidding him the house.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> You'll be acting more considerately.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Are you so resolved, you unlucky fellow, to do me all the mischief you can?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to GETA.</stage> He's afraid of us, although he's so careful to conceal it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to PHORMIO.</stage> Your beginning has turned out well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> But if, on the contrary, you endure what must be endured, you'll be doing what's worthy of you, so that we may be on friendly terms.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>indignantly.</stage> What, I seek your friendship, or have any wish to see or hear you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> If you can agree with her, you will have some one to cheer up your old age; just consider your time of life.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Let her cheer up yourself; keep her to yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Really, do moderate your passion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Mark what I say. There have been words enough already; if you don't make haste to fetch away the woman, I shall turn her out: I have said it, Phormio.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> If you use her in any other manner than is befitting a free-born woman, I shall be bringing a swinging action against you: I have said it, Demipho. <stage>To GETA.</stage> Hark you, if there should be any occasion for me, I shall be at home.</p></sp>

The idea is truly comic, and it is worked up with all that simplicity and chastity so peculiar to the manner of Terence. An ordinary writer would have indulged himself in twenty little conceits on this occasion; but the dry gravity of Terence infinitely surpasses, as true humor, all the drolleries which, perhaps, even those great masters of Comedy, Plautus or Moli&egrave;re, might have been tempted to throw out. It is the highest art of a Dramatic Author, on some occasions, to leave a good deal to the Actor; and it has been remarked by Heinsius and others, that Terence was particularly attentive to this circumstance."</note> than before.

<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>to DORIO.</stage> Aye, aye, don't you show too little of the Procurer. <stage>To PHAEDRIA.</stage> What has he been doing?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> What, he? Acting the part of a most inhuman fellow; been and sold my Pamphila.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Sold her, say you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Sold her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> <stage>ironically.</stage> What a shocking crime--a wench bought with one's own money!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> I can not prevail upon him to wait for me the next three days, and so far break off the bargain with the person, while I get the money from my friends, which has been promised me; if I don't give it him then, let him not wait a single hour longer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> Very good.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> It's not a long time that he asks, Dorio; do let him prevail upon you; he'll pay you two-fold for having acted to him thus obligingly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> Mere words!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Will you allow Pamphila to be carried away from this place? And then, besides, can you possibly allow their love to be severed asunder?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> Neither I nor you cause that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> May all the Gods grant you what you are deserving of!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> I have borne with you for several months quite against my inclination; promising and whimpering, and yet bringing nothing; now, on the other hand, I have found one to pay, and not be sniveling; give place to your betters.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I' faith, there surely was a day named, if I remember right, for you to pay him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> It is the fact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> Do I deny it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Is that day past, then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> No; but this one has come before it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Are you not ashamed of your perfidy?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Do you try to trifle with him <stage>pointing to PHAEDRIA</stage> in this manner?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORIO</speaker><p> Why really, on the contrary, Antipho, it's he trifling with me, for he knew me to be a person of this sort; I supposed him to be quite a different man; he has deceived me; I'm not a bit different to him from what I was before. But however that may be, I'll yet do this; the captain has said, that to-morrow morning he will pay me the money; if you bring it me before that, Phaedria, I'll follow my rule, that he is the first served who is the first to pay.

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Well, have you brought your daughter with you, Chremes, for whom you went to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> No.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Why not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> When her mother found that I staid here longer than usual, and at the same time the age of the girl did not suit with my delays, they told me that she, with all her family, set out in search of me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Pray, then, why did you stay there so long, when you had heard of this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Why, faith, a malady detained me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> From what cause? Or what was it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Do you ask me? Old age itself is a malady. However, I heard that they had arrived safe, from the caps tain who brought them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Have you heard, Chremes, what has happened to my son in my absence?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> 'Tis that, in fact, that has embarrassed me in my plans. For if I offer my daughter in marriage to any person that's a stranger, it must all be told how and by whom I had her. You I knew to be fully as faithful to me as I am to myself; if a stranger shall think fit to be connected with me by marriage, he will hold his tongue, just as long as good terms exist between us: but if he takes a dislike to me, he'll be knowing more than it's proper he should know. I am afraid, too, lest my wife should, by some means, come to know of it; if that is the case, it only remains for me to shake myself<milestone n="585" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To shake myself</lemma>: "Me excutiam."

I came to the fellow to tell him that money was needed, and by what means it might be procured. Hardly had I said one half, when he understood me; he was quite delighted; complimented me; asked where the old man was; gave thanks to the Gods that an opportunity was afforded him for showing himself no less a friend to Phaedria than to Antipho: I bade the fellow wait for me at the Forum; whither I would bring the old gentlemanly. But see, here's the very man <stage>catching sight of the Old Man</stage>. Who is the further one? Heyday, Phaedria's father has got back! still, brute beast that I am, what was I afraid of? Is it because two are presented instead of one for me to dupe? I deem it preferable to enjoy a two-fold hope. I'll try for it from him from whom I first intended: if he gives it me, well and good; if I can make nothing of him, then I'll attack this new-comer.</p></sp></div2>

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> It was about that I was talking to him just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> But really, on carefully reflecting upon this matter I think I have found a remedy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> What is the remedy?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> When I left you, by accident Phormio met me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Who is Phormio?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> He who patronized her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> I understand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> It seemed to me that I might first sound him; I took the fellow aside: "Phormio," said I, "why don't we try to settle these matters between us rather with a good grace than with a bad one? My master's a generous man, and one who hates litigation; but really, upon my faith, all his friends were just now advising him with one voice to turn her instantly out of doors."</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> <stage>continuing the supposed conversation.</stage> "He'll have to give satisfaction at law, you say, if he turns her out? That has been already inquired into: aye, aye, you'll have enough to do, if you engage with him; he is so eloquent. But suppose he's beaten; still, however, it's not his life, but his money that's at stake." After I found that the fellow was influenced by these words, I said: "We are now by ourselves here; come now, what should you like to be given you, money down, to drop this suit with my master, so that she may betake herself off, and you annoy us no more?"</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Who ordered you to say so?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Go on with your story.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> At first the fellow raved.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Say, what did he ask?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> What? A great deal too much.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> How much? Tell me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Suppose he were to give a great talent.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Aye, faith, perdition to him rather; has he no shame?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Just what I said to him: "Pray," said I, "suppose he was portioning an only daughter of his own. It has been of little benefit that he hasn't one of his own, when another has been found to be demanding a fortune." To be brief, and to pass over his impertinences, this at last was his final answer: "I," said he," from the very first, have been desirous to marry the daughter of my friend, as was fit I should; for I was aware of the ill results of this, a poor wife being married into a rich family, and becoming a slave. But, as I am now conversing with you unreservedly, I was in want of a wife to bring me a little money with which to pay off my debts; and even yet, if Demipho is willing to give as much as I am to receive with her to whom I am engaged, there is no one whom I should better like for a wife."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> Whether to say he's doing this through folly or mischief, through stupidity or design, I'm in doubt.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Well, well, let him take her then; I'll give it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Don't be crying out; you may have those ten of me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> A lady's maid must be brought for his wife; and then too, a little more is wanted for some furniture, and some is wanted for the wedding expenses. " Well then," said he, "for these items, put down ten more."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Then let him at once bring six hundred actions<milestone n="667" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Six hundred actions</lemma>: "Sescentos;" literally, "six hundred."

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Pray do be quiet; I'll give it: do you only bring your son to marry the woman we want him to have.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> Ah me! Geta, you have ruined me by your treachery.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> 'Tis on my account she's turned off; it's right that I should bear the loss.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> " Take care and let me know," said he, "as soon as possible, if they are going to let me have her, that I may get rid of the other, so that I mayn't be in doubt; for the others have agreed to.pay me down the portion directly."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Let him have her at once; let him give notice to them that he breaks off the match with the other, and let him marry this woman.</p></sp>

May then all the Gods, Goddesses, Deities above and below, with every evil confound you! Look now, if you wish any thing to succeed, intrust it to him who may bring you from smooth water on to a rock. What was there less advantageous than to touch upon this sore, or to name my wife? Hopes have been excited in my father that she may possibly be got rid of. Pray now, tell me, suppose Phormio receives the portion, she must be taken home by him as his wife: what's to become of me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> There is nothing, Antipho, but what it may be made worse by being badly told: you leave out what is good, and you mention the bad. Now then, hear the other side: if he receives the money, she must be taken as his wife, you say; I grant you; still, some time at least will be allowed for preparing for the nuptials, for inviting, and for sacrificing.

She must tell her that we are going to give her in marriage to Phormio, that she may not be angry with us; and that he is a fitter match for her, as knowing more of her; that we have in no way departed from our duty; that as much has been given for a portion as he asked for.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> What the plague does that matter to you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> A great deal, Demipho. It is not enough for you to do your duty, if common report does not approve of it; I wish all this to be done with her own sanction as well, that she mayn't be saying that she has been turned out of doors.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SOPHRONA</speaker><p> I' faith, that's the very reason why we, wretched creatures, have never been able to find you out here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SOPHRONA</speaker><p> Your daughter is alive. Her poor mother died of grief.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> An unfortunate thing!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> What is it you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOPHRONA</speaker><p> It was done on purpose, in order that her lover might be enabled to marry her without a portion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Ye Gods, by our trust in you! How often do those things come about through accident, which you couldn't dare to hope for? On my return, I have found my daughter matched with the very person I wished, and just as I wanted; a thing that we were both using our endeavors, with the greatest earnestness, to bring about. Without any very great management on our part, by her own management, she has by herself brought this about.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOPHRONA</speaker><p> Now consider what's to be done. The young man's father has returned, and they say that he bears this with feelings highly offended.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> There's no danger of that. But, by Gods and men, do take care that no one comes to know that she's my daughter.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GETA </speaker><p> <stage>laughing.</stage> What do you think?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I don't know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Why, something most marvelous. Your uncle has been discovered to be the father of your wife, Phanium.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>starting.</stage> Ha! what's that you say</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> He formerly cohabited secretly with her mother at <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> A dream: how could she be ignorant about her own father?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Be sure, Phormio, that there is some reason: but do you suppose that, outside of the door, I was able to understand every thing that passed between them within?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> On my faith, I too have heard the same story.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Aye, and I'll give you still further reason for believing it: your uncle in the mean time came out from there; not long after he returned again, with your father; each said that he gave you permission to retain her; in fine, I've been sent to find you, and bring you to them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Why then carry me off<milestone n="881" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Carry me off</lemma>: Madame Dacier says that Antipho is so rejoiced here at Geta's news, that he jumps upon his shoulders, and is carried off in triumph, which was a sort of stage-trick, and was very diverting to the Audience. On this, Colman observes: "I believe Madame Dacier has not the least foundation for this extraordinary piece of information; and I must confess, that I have too high an opinion, both of the Roman audience and actors, to believe it to be true."</note> at once;--why do you delay?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> I'll do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> O my dear Phormio, farewell!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Farewell, Antipho. <stage>ANTIPHO and GETA go into DEMIPHO'S house.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> So may the Gods bless me, this has turned out luckily. I'm glad of it, that such good fortune has thus suddenly befallen them. I have now an excellent opportunity for diddling the old men, and ridding Phaedria of all anxiety about the money, so that he mayn't be under the necessity of applying to any of his companions. For this same money, as it has been given him, shall be given for good, whether they like it or not: how to force them to this, I've fund out the very way. I must now assume a new air and countenance. But I'll betake myself off to this next alley; from that spot I'll present myself to them, when they come out of doors. I sha'n't go to the fair, where I pretended I was going. <stage>He retires into the alley.</stage>

<stage>Enter DEMIPHO and CHREMES, from DEMIPHO'S house.</stage>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> I do give and return hearty thanks to the Gods, and with reason, brother, inasmuch as these matters have turned out for us so fortunately. We must now meet with Phormio as soon as possible, before he squanders our thirty minae, so that we may get them from him.
<stage>Enter PHORMIO, coming forward, and speaking aloud, as though not seeing them.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>accosting him.</stage> Why, Phormio, we were coming to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Perhaps about the very same affair. <stage>DEMIPHO nods assent.</stage> I' faith, I thought so. What were you coming to my house for? Ridiculous; are you afraid that I sha'n't do what I have once undertaken? Hark you, whatever is my poverty, still, of this one thing I have taken due care, not to forfeit my word.</p></sp>

Demipho's thoughts are wholly taken up how to recover the money, and Phormio is equally solicitous to retain it; but Chremes, who had just left his daughter, is regardless of their discourse, and fresh from the impressions which she had made on him, longs to know if his brother's sentiments of her were equally favorable, and naturally puts this paternal question to him."</note> just as I told you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Very much so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> And this is what I'm come to tell you, Demipho, that I'm quite ready; whenever you please, give me my wife. For I postponed all my other business, as was fit I should, when I understood that you were so very desirous to have it so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to CHREMES.</stage> But he has dissuaded me from giving her to you. "For what," says he, "will be the talk among people if you do this? Formerly, when she might have been handsomely disposed of, then she wasn't given; now it's a disgrace for her to be turned out of doors, a repudiated woman;" pretty nearly, in fact, all the reasons which you yourself, some little time since, were urging to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Upon my faith, you are treating me in a very insulting manner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> How so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Do you ask me? Because I shall not be able to marry the other person I mentioned; for with what face shall I return to her whom I've slighted?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Then besides, I see that Antipho is unwilling to part with her. <stage>Aside, prompting DEMIPHO.</stage> Say so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Then besides, I see that my son is very unwilling to part with the damsel.

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> What, when I've paid it over to the persons to whom I was indebted?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> What's to be done, then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> If you will let me have her for a wife, as you promised, I'll take her; but if you prefer that she should stay with you, the portion must stay with me, Demipho. For it isn't fair that I should be misled for you, as it was for your own sakes that I broke off with the other woman, who was to have brought me a portion just as large.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Away with you to utter perdition, with this swaggering, you vagabond. What, then, do you fancy we don't know you, or your doings?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> You are provoking me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Would you have married her, if she had been given to you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Try the experiment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> That my son might cohabit with her at your house, that was your design.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Pray, what is that you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Then do you give me my money?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Nay, but do you give me my wife?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Come before a magistrate. <stage>Going to seize hold of him.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Why, really, if you persist in being troublesome--</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> What will you do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> What, I?

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>with a careless air.</stage> Oh, were you the person?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> What a jest he's making of us.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> <stage>to PHORMIO.</stage> We'll let you off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Nonsense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> What would you have? We'll forgive you the money you've got,</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> I hear you. Why the plague, then, do you two trifle with me in this way, you silly men, with your childish speeches--"I won't, and I will; I will, and I won't," over again: "keep it, give it me back; what has been said, is unsaid; what had been just a bargain, is now no bargain."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to DEMIPHO.</stage> In what manner, or from whom has he come to know of this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> I don't, know; but that I've told it to no one, I know for certain.</p></sp>

Chremes stands greatly in awe of his wife, and will submit to any thing rather than the story should come to her ears; but Demipho can not brook the thoughts of losing so much money, and encourages his brother to behave with spirit and resolution, promising to make up matters between him and his wife."</note> from us such a sum of money as this, and so palpably to impose upon us? By heavens, I'd sooner die. Manage to show yourself of resolute and ready wit. You see that this slip of yours has got abroad, and that you can not now possibly conceal it from your wife; it is then more conducive to our quiet, Chremes, ourselves to disclose what she will be hearing from others; and then, in our own fashion, we shall be able to take vengeance upon this dirty fellow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to himself.</stage> Good lack-a-day, now's the sticking-point, if I don't look out for myself. They are making toward me with a gladiatorial air.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> <stage>apart, to DEMIPHO.</stage> But I doubt whether it's possible for her to be appeased.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>apart, to CHREMES.</stage> Be of good courage; I'll effect a reconciliation between you; remembering this, Chremes, that she is dead and gone<milestone n="965" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Dlead and gone</lemma>: "E medio excedere," was an Euphemism signifying "to die," which it was deemed of ill omen to mention.</note> by whom you had this girl.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>in a loud voice.</stage> Is this the way you are going to deal with me? Very cleverly done. Come on with you. By heavens, Demipho, you have provoked me, not to his advantage <stage>pointing at CHREMES</stage>. How say you? <stage>addressing CHREMES</stage>. When you've been doing abroad just as you pleased, and have had no regard for this excellent lady here, but on the contrary, have been injuring her in an unheard-of manner, would you be coming to me with prayers to wash away your offenses? On telling her of this, I'll make her so incensed with you, that you sha'n't quench her, though you should melt away into tears.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> A plague may all the Gods and Goddesses send upon him. That any fellow should be possessed of so much impudence! Does not this villain deserve to be transported hence to some desolate land at the public charge?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> I am brought to such a pass, that I really don't know what to do in it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> I know; let's go into court.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Into court? Here in preference <stage>pointing to CHREMES'S house</stage>, if it suits you in any way. <stage>Moves toward the house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>to CHREMES.</stage> Follow him, and hold him back, till I call out the servants.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> <stage>trying to seize PHORMIO.</stage> But I can't by myself; run and help me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>to DEMIPHO, who seizes hold of him.</stage> There's one action of damages against you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Sue him at law, then.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> And another with you, Chremes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Lay hold of him. <stage>They both drag him.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Is it thus you do? Why then I must exert my voice: Nausistrata, come out <stage>calling aloud</stage>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> <stage>to DEMIPHO.</stage> Stop his mouth.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Hold my tongue?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to CHREMES.</stage> It's all up with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Was ever any thing now more ungenerously done? Your men, who, when they come to their wives, then become incapacitated from old age.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NAUSISTRATA</speaker><p> Demipho, I appeal to you; for with that man it is irksome for me to speak. Were these those frequent journeys and long visits at <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>? Was this the lowness of prices that reduced our rents?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Nausistrata, I don't deny that in this matter he has been deserving of censure; but still, it may be pardoned.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> He is talking to the dead.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> For he did this neither through neglect or aversion to yourself. About fifteen years since, in a drunken fit, he had an intrigue with this poor woman, of whom this girl was born, nor did he ever touch her afterward. She is dead and gone: the only difficulty that remained in this matter. Wherefore, I do beg of you, that, as in other things, you'll bear this with patience.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NAUSISTRATA</speaker><p> Why should I with patience? I could wish, afflicted as I am, that there were an end now of this matter. But how can I hope? Am I to suppose that, at his age, he will not offend in future? Was he not an old man then, if old age makes people behave themselves decently? Are my looks and my age more attractive now, Demipho?

<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> I know it all, as well as yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NAUSISTRATA</speaker><p> Does it appear, then, that I deserved this treatment?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> Far from it: but since, by reproaching, it can not now be undone, forgive him: he entreats you--he begs your pardon--owns his fault--makes an apology. What would you have more?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>sneeringly.</stage> Does it seem to you so very improper for your son, a young man, to keep one mistress, while you have two wives? Are you ashamed of nothing? With what face will you censure him? Answer me that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> He shall do as you wish.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NAUSISTRATA</speaker><p> Nay, that you may now know my determination, I neither forgive nor promise any thing, nor give any answer, before I see my son: to his decision I leave every thing. What he bids me, I shall do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMIPHO</speaker><p> You are a wise woman, Nausistrata.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Assuredly there is a God, who both hears and sees what we do. And I do not consider that to be true which is commonly said: "Fortune frames and fashions the affairs of mankind, just as she pleases."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> Heyday! what means this? I've met with Socrates, not Phaedria, so far as I see. Why hesitate to go up and address him? <stage>Accosting him.</stage> How now, Phaedria, whence have you acquired this new wisdom, and derived such great delight, as you show by your countenance?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> O welcome, my friend; O most delightful Phormio, welcome ! There's not a person in all the world I could more wish just now to meet than yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Pray, tell me what is the matter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Aye, faith, I have to beg of you, that you will listen to it. My Pamphila is a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and of noble birth, and rich.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> What is it you tell me? Are you dreaming, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Upon my faith, I'm saying what's true.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Yes, and this, too, is a true saying: " You'll have no great difficulty in believing that to be true, which you greatly wish to be so."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Nay, but do listen, I beg of you, to all the wonderful things I have to tell you of. It was while thinking of this to myself, that I just now burst forth into those expressions which you heard--that we, and what relates to us, are ruled by the sanction of the Gods, and not by blind chance.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> I've been for some time in a state of suspense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Do you know Phanocrates?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> As well as I do yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> The rich man?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> I understand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> He is the father of Pamphila. Not to detain you, these were the circumstances: Calchas was his servant, a worthless, wicked fellow. Intending to run away from the house, he carried off this girl, whom her father was bringing up in the country, then five years old, and, secretly taking her with him to Eubaea, sold her to Lycus, a merchant. This person, a long time after, sold her, when now grown up, to Dorio. She, however, knew that she was the daughter of parents of rank, inasmuch as she recollected herself being attended and trained up by female servants: the name of her parents she didn't recollect.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> How, then, were they discovered?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Stay; I was coming to that. This runaway was caught yesterday, and sent back to Phanocrates: he related the wonderful circumstances I have mentioned about the girl, and how she was sold to Lycus, and afterward to Dorio. Phanocrates sent immediately, and claimed his daughter; but when he learned that she had been sold, he came running to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> O, how extremely fortunate!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Phanocrates has no objection to my marrying her; nor has my father, I imagine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Trust me for that; I'll have all this matter managed for you; Phormio has so arranged it, that you shall not be a suppliant to your father, but his judge.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> You are joking.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> So it is, I tell you. Do you only give me the thirty minae which Dorio----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> You put me well in mind; I understand you; you may have them; for he must give them back, as the law forbids a free woman to be sold; and, on my faith, I do rejoice that an opportunity is afforded me of rewarding you, and taking a hearty vengeance upon him; a monster of a fellow he has feelings more hardened than iron.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> Now, Phaedria, I return you thanks; I'll make you a return upon occasion, if ever I have the opportunity. You impose a heavy task upon me, to be contending with you in good offices, as I can not in wealth; and in affection and zeal, I must repay you what I owe. To be surpassed in deserving well, is a disgrace to a man of principle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Services badly bestowed, I take to be disservices. But I do not know any person more grateful and more mindful of a service than yourself. What is it you were just now mentioning about my father?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHORMIO</speaker><p> There are many particulars, which at present I have not the opportunity to relate. Let's go in-doors, for Nausistrata has invited me to dinner, and I'm afraid we may keep them waiting.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHAEDRIA</speaker><p> Very well; follow me. <stage>To the AUDIENCE.</stage> Fare you well, and grant us your applause.</p></sp></div2></div1>
