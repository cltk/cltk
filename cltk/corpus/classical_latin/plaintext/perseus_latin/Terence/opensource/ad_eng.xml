<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>MICIO and DEMEA are two brothers of dissimilar tempers. Demea is married, and lives a country life, while his brother remains single, and resides in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Demea has two sons, the elder of whom, Aeschinus, has been adopted by Micio. Being allowed by his indulgent uncle to gratify his inclinations without restraint, Aeschinus has debauched Pamphila, the daughter of a widow named Sostrata. Having, however, promised to marry the young woman, he has been pardoned for the offense, and it has been kept strictly secret. Ctesipho, who lives in the country with his father under great restraint, on visiting the city, falls in love with a certain Music-girl, who belongs to the Procurer Sannio. To screen his brother, Aeschinus takes the responsibility of the affair on himself, and succeeds in carrying off the girl for him. Demen, upon hearing of this, censures Micio for his ill-timed indulgence, the bad effects of which are thus exemplified in Aeschinus; and at the same time lauds the steady conduct and frugality of Ctesipho, who has been brought up under his own supervision. Shortly after this, Sostrata hears the story about the Music-girl, at the very time that her daughter Pamphila is in labor. She naturally supposes that Aeschinus has deserted her daughter for another, and hastens to acquaint Hegio, her kinsman, with the fact. Meantime Demea learns that Ctesipho has taken part in carrying off the Music-girl, whereon Syrus invents a story, and screens Ctesipho for the moment. Demea is next informed by Hegio of the conduct of Aeschinus toward Pamphila. Wishing to find his brother, he is purposely sent on a fruitless errand by Syrus, on which he wanders all over the city to no purpose. Micio having now been informed by Hegio, and knowing that the intentions of Aeschinus toward Pamphila are not changed, accompanies him to the house of Sostrata, whom he consoles by his promise that Aeschinus shall marry her daughter. Demea then returns from his search, and, rushing into Micio's house, finds his son Ctesipho there carousing; on which he exclaims vehemently against Micio, who uses his best endeavors to soothe him, and finally with success. He now determines to become kind and considerate for the future. At his request, Pamphila is brought to Micio's house, and the nuptials are celebrated. Micio, at the earnest request of Demea and Aeschinus, marries Sostrata; Hegio has a competency allowed him; and Syrus and his wife <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> are made free. The Play concludes with a serious warning from Demea, who advises his relatives not to squander their means in riotous living; but, on the contrary, to bear admonition and to submit to restraint in a spirit of moderation and thankfulness.</p></div2>

<head>THE TITLE OF THE PLAY.</head>

<p>PERFORMED at the, Funeral Games of Aemilius Paulus,<note anchored="yes">Of Aemilius Paulus) This Play (from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">)*adelfoi\,</foreign> "The Brothers") was performed at the Funeral Games of Lucius Aemilius Paulus, who was surnamed Macedonicus, from having gained a victory over Perseus, King of <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName>. He was so poor at the time of his decease, that they were obliged to sell his estate in order to pay his widow her dower. The Q. Fabius Maximus and P. Cornelius Africanus here mentioned were not, as some have thought, the Curule Aediles, but two sons of Aemilius Paulus, who had taken the surnames of the families into which they had been adopted.</note> which were celebrated by Q. Fabius Maximns and P. Cornelius Africanus. L. Atilius Praenestinus and Minutius Prothimus performed it. Flaccus, the freedman of Claudius, composed the music for Sarranian flutes.<note anchored="yes">Sarranian flutes) The "Sarranian" or "Tyrian" pipes, or flutes, are supposed to have been of a quick and mirthful tone; Madame Dacier has consequently with much justice suggested that the representation being on the occasion of a funeral, the title has not come down to us in a complete form, and that it was performed with the Lydian, or grave, solemn pipe, alternately with the Tyrian. This opinion is also strengthened by the fact that Donatus expressly says that it was performed to the music of Lydian flutes.</note> Taken from the Greek of Menander, L. Anicius and M. Cornelius being Consuls.<note anchored="yes">Being Consuls) L. Anicius Gallus and M.

<head>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</head>
<p>As Demea has two sons, young men, he gives Aeschinus to his brother Micio to be adopted by him; but he retains Ctesipho: him, captivated with the charms of a Music-girl, and under a harsh and strict father, his brother Aeschinus screens; the scandal of the affair and the amour he takes upon himself; at last, he carries the Music-girl away from the Procurer. This same Aeschinus has previously debauched a poor woman, a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and has given his word that she shall be his wife. Demea upbraids him, and is greatly vexed; afterward, however, when the truth is discovered, Aeschinus marries the girl who has been debauched; and, his harsh father Demea now softened, Ctesipho retains the Music-girl.

In the Greek, there is a young man, who, at the early part of the Play, carries off a Courtesan from a Procurer; that part Plautus has entirely left out. This portion he has adopted in the <title>Adelphi</title>, and has transferred it, translated word for word. This new Play we are about to perform; determine then whether you think a theft has been committed, or a passage has been restored to notice which has been passed over in neglect. For as to what these malevolent persons say, that men of noble rank assist him, and are always writing in conjunction with him--that which they deem to be a heavy crimination, he takes to be the highest praise; since he pleases those who please you all and the public; the aid of whom in war, in peace, in private business,<milestone n="20" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In war, in peace, in private, business</lemma>: According to Donatus, by the words "<foreign lang="la">in bello</foreign>," Terence is supposed to refer to his friend and patron Scipio; by "<foreign lang="la">in otio</foreign>," to Furius Publius; and in the words "<foreign lang="la">in negotio</foreign>" to Laelius, who was famed for his wisdom.</note> each one has availed himself of, on his own occasion, without any haughtiness on their part.

A wife, if you stay long abroad, either imagines that you are in love or are beloved, or that you are drinking and indulging your inclination, and that you only are taking your pleasure, while she herself is miserable. As for myself, in consequence of my son not having returned home, what do I imagine? In what ways am I not disturbed? For fear lest he may either have taken cold,<milestone n="36" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Either have taken cold</lemma>: Westerhovius observes that this passage seems to be taken from one in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, <bibl n="Pl. Mil. 3.1">l. 721</bibl>, et seq.: "Troth, if I had had them, enough anxiety should I have had from my children; I should have been everlastingly tormented in mind: but if perchance one had had a fever, I think I should have died. Or if one in liquor had tumbled any where from his horse, I should have been afraid that he had broken his legs or neck on that occasion." It may be remarked that.there is a great resemblance between the characters of Micio here and Periplecomenus in the Miles Gloriosus.</note> or have fallen down somewhere, or have broken some limb. Oh dear! that any man should take it into his head, or find out what is dearer to him than he is to himself! And yet he is not my son, but my brother's. He is quite different in disposition. I, from my very youth upward, have lived a comfortable town life, and taken my ease; and, what they esteem a piece of luck, I have never had a wife. He, on the contrary to all this, has spent his life in the country, and has always lived laboriously and penuriously. He married a wife, and has two sons. This one, the elder of them, I have adopted. I have brought him up from an infant, and considered and loved him as my own. In him I centre my delight; this object alone is dear to me. On the other hand, I take all due care that he may hold me equally dear. I give--I overlook; I do not judge it necessary to exert my authority in every thing; in fine, the things that youth prompts to, and that others do unknown to their fathers, I have used my son not to conceal from me. For he, who, as the practice is, will dare to tell a lie to or to deceive his father, will still more dare to do so to others. I think it better to restrain children through a sense of shame and liberal treatment, than through fear. On these points my brother does not agree with me, nor do they please him. He often comes to me exclaiming, "What are you about, Micio? Why do you ruin for us this youth? Why does he intrigue? Why does he drink? Why do you supply him with the means for these goings on? You indulge him with too much dress; you are very inconsiderate." He himself is too strict, beyond what is just and reasonable; and he is very much mistaken, in my opinion, at all events, who thinks that an authority is more firm or more lasting which is established by force, than. that which is founded on affection. Such is my mode of reasoning; and thus do I persuade myself. He, who, compelled by harsh treatment, does his duty, so long as he thinks it will be known, is on his guard: if he hopes that it will be concealed, he again returns to his natural bent. He whom you have secured by kindness, acts from inclination; he is anxious to return like for like; present and absent, he will be the same. This is the duty of a parent, to accustom a son to do what is right rather of his own choice, than through fear of another. In this the father differs from the master: he who can not do this, let him confess that he does not know how to govern children. But is not this the very man of whom I was speaking? Surely it is he. I don't know why it is I see him out of spirits; I suppose he'll now be scolding as usual. Demea, I am glad to see you well.<milestone n="81" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To see you well</lemma>: Cooke remarks, that though there are several fine passages in this speech, and good observations on human life, yet it is too long a soliloquy.</note></p></sp></div2>

<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Why are you out of spirits?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Do you ask me, when we have such a son as Aeschinus,<milestone n="82" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Such a son as Aeschinus</lemma>: The passage pretty clearly means by "<foreign lang="la">ubi nobis Aeschinus sit</foreign>," "when I've got such a son as Aeschinus." Madame Dacier, however, would translate it: "Ask me--you, in whose house Aeschinus is?" thus accusing him of harboring Aeschinus; a very forced construction, however.</note> why I'm out of spirits?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> Did I not say it would be so? <stage>To DEMEA.</stage> What has he been doing?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> What has he been doing? He, who is ashamed of nothing, and fears no one, nor thinks that any law can control him. But I pass by what has been previously done: what a thing he has just perpetrated!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Why, what is it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> He has broken open a door,<milestone n="88" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Broken open a door</lemma>: The works of Ovid and Plautus show that it was no uncommon thing for riotous young men to break open doors; Ovid even suggests to the lover the expediency of getting into the house through the windows.</note> and forced his way into another person's house, beaten to death the master himself, and all the household, and carried off a wench whom he had a fancy for. All people are exclaiming that it was a most disgraceful proceeding. How many, Micio, told me of this as I was coming here? It is in everybody's mouth. In fine, if an example must be cited, does he not see his brother giving his attention to business, and living frugally and soberly in the country? No action of his is like this. When I say this to him, Micio, I say it to you. You allow him to be corrupted.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Never is there any thing more unreasonable than a man who wants experience, who thinks nothing right except what he himself has done.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> What is the meaning of that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Because, Demea, you misjudge these matters. It is no heinous crime, believe me, for a young man to intrigue or to drink; it is not; nor yet for him to break open a door. If neither I nor you did so, it was poverty that did not allow us to do so. Do you now claim that as a merit to yourself which you then did from necessity? That is unfair; for if we had had the means to do so, we should have done the same. And, if you were a man, you would now suffer that other son of yours to act thus now, while his age will excuse it, rather than, when he has got you, after long wishing it, out of the way, he should still do so, at a future day, and at an age more unsuited.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> O <persName>Jupiter</persName>! You, sir, are driving me to distraction. Is it not a heinous thing for a young man to do these things?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Oh! do listen to me, and do not everlastingly din me upon this subject. You gave me your son to adopt; he became mine; if he offends in any thing, Demea, he offends against me: in that case I shall bear the greater part of the inconvenience. Does he feast,<milestone n="117" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Does he feast</lemma>: Colman has the following observation here: "The mild character of Micio is contrasted by <persName>Cicero</persName> to that of a furious, savage, severe father, as drawn by the famous Comic Poet, Caecilius. Both writers are quoted in the Oration for Caelius, in the composition of which it is plain that the orator kept his eye pretty closely on our Poet. The passages from Caecilius contain all that vehemence and severity which, as <persName>Horace</persName> tells us, was accounted the common character of the style of that author."</note> does he drink, does he smell of perfumes,<milestone n="117" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Smell of perfumes</lemma>: For an account of the "<foreign lang="la">unguenta</foreign>," or perfumes in use among the ancients, see the Notes to Bohn's Translation of Plautus.</note>--it is at my cost.

Thanks to the Gods, I both have means for doing this, and these things are not as yet an annoyance. In fine, either desist, or else find some arbitrator between us: I will show that in this matter you are the most to blame.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Ah me! Learn to be a father from those who are really so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> You are his father by nature, I by my anxiety.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> You, feel any anxiety?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Oh dear,--if you persist, I'll leave you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Is it thus you act?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Am I so often to hear about the same thing?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I have some concern for my son.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> I have some concern for him too; but, Demea, let us each be concerned for his own share--you for the one, and I for the other. For, to concern yourself about both is almost the same thing as to demand him back again, whom you intrusted to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Alas, Micio!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> So it seems to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> What am I to say to this? If it pleases you, henceforth--let him spend, squander, and destroy; it's nothing to me. If I say one word after this----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Again angry, Demea?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Won't you believe me? Do I demand him back whom I have intrusted? I am concerned for him; I am not a stranger in blood; if I do interpose----well, well, I have done. You desire me to concern myself for one of them,--do concern myself; and I give thanks to the Gods, he is just as I would have him; that fellow of yours will find it out at a future day : I don't wish to say any thing more harsh against him. <stage>(Exit.)</stage>

He represents Micio as appalled at his adopted son's irregularities, lest if he should appear wholly unmoved, he should seem to be corrupting him, rather than to be treating him with only a proper degree of indulgence.</note> not nothing at all, nor yet all just as he says; still they do give me some uneasiness; but I was unwilling to show him that I took them amiss, for he is such a man; when I would pacify him, I steadily oppose and resist him; and in spite of it he hardly puts up with it like other men; but if I were to inflame, or even to humor his anger, I should certainly be as mad as himself. And yet Aesclhinus has done me some injustice in this affair. What courtesan has he not intrigued with? Or to which of them has he not made some present? At last, he recently told me that he wished to take a wife,<milestone n="151" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Wished to take a wife</lemma>: Donatus remarks here, that the art of Terence in preparing his incidents is wonderful. He contrives that even ignorant persons shall open the plot, as in the present instance, where we understand that Aeschinus has mentioned to Micio his intention of taking a wife, though he has not entered into particulars. This naturally leads us to the ensuing parts of the Play, without forestalling any of the circumstances.</note> I suppose he was just then tired of them all. I was in hopes that the warmth of youth had now subsided; I was delighted. But look now, he is at it again; however, I am determined to know it, whatever it is, and to go meet the fellow, if he is at the Forum. <stage>(Exit.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> And of as high a character as any one ever was.

Depend upon it, I'll prosecute my rights; and you shall never pay with words for the evil that you have done me in deed.

<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> It were better for you not to be making a disturbance here before the house; for if you persist in being impertinent, you shall be dragged in at once, and there you shall be lashed to death with whips.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> A free man, with whips?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> So it shall be.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> I was afraid you would.</p></sp>

The "assertor" laid hands upon the person, declaring that he or she was free; and till the cause was tried, the person whose freedom was claimed, remained in the hands of the "assertor."</note> Now consider which you choose; take the money, or prepare yourself for the action. Think of it, Procurer, till I return.<milestone n="196" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Till I return</lemma>: Colman has a curious remark here: "I do not remember, in the whole circle of modern comedy, a more natural picture of the elegant ease and indifference of a fine gentleman, than that exhibited in this Scene in the character of Aeschinus."</note> <stage>He  goes into the house of MICIO.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> <stage>to himself.</stage> O supreme <persName>Jupiter</persName>! I do by no means wonder that men run mad through ill usage. He has dragged me out of my house, beaten me, taken my property away against my will, and has given me, unfortunate wretch, more than five hundred blows. In return for all this ill usage he demands the girl to be made over to him for just the same price at which she was bought. But however, since he has so well deserved of me, be it so: he demands what is his due. Very well, I consent then, provided he only gives the money. But I suspect this; when I have said that I will sell her for so much, he'll be getting witnesses forthwith that I have sold her.<milestone n="204" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">That I have sold her</lemma>: He means, that if he only names a price, Aeschinus will suborn witnesses to say that be has agreed to sell her, in which case Aeschinus will carry her off with impunity, and the laws will not allow him to recover her; as it will then be an ordinary debt, and he will be put off with all the common excuses used by debtors.</note> As to getting the money, it's all a dream. Call again by and by; come back to-morrow. I could bear with that too, hard as it is, if he would only pay it. But I consider this to be the fact; when you take up this trade, you must brook and bear in silence the affronts of these young fellows. However, no one will pay me; it's in vain for me to be reckoning upon that.</p></sp></div2>

<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> Then you'll never make a fortune. Get out with you, Sannio; you don't know how to take in mankind.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> I believe that to be the better plan--but I was never so cunning as not, whenever I was able to get it, to prefer getting ready money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> Come, come, I know your spirit; as if twenty minae were any thing at all to you in comparison to obliging him; besides, they say that you are setting out for <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> (aside.) Hah!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> That you have been buying up many things to take thither; and that the vessel is hired. This I know, your mind is in suspense; however, when you return thence, I hope you'll settle the matter.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> Ah me! unfortunate wretch, I am now in danger of even losing part of the principal. Has he no shame? He has loosened all my teeth; my head, too, is full of bumps with his cuffs; and would he defraud me as well? I shall go nowhere.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> Just as you please. Have you any thing more to say before I go?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SANNIO</speaker><p> Why yes, Syrus, i' faith, I have this to request. Whatever the matters that are past, rather than go to law, let what is my own be returned me; at least, Syrus, the sum she cost me. I know that you have not hitherto made trial of my friendship; you will have no occasion to say that I am unmindful or ungrateful.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> I'll do the best I can. But I see Ctesipho; he's in high spirits about his mistress.</p></sp>

O brother, brother, how can I sufficiently commend you? This I am quite sure of; I can never speak of you in such high terms but that your deserts will surpass it. For I am of opinion that I possess this one thing in especial beyond all others, a brother than whom no individual is more highly endowed with the highest qualities.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CTESIPHO</speaker><p> What's the matter? 'Tis through him, Syrus, that I am now alive--generous creature! Has he not deemed every thing of secondary importance to himself in comparison with my happiness? The reproach, the discredit, my own amour and imprudence, he has taken upon himself.

First, I would stop the breath of the old fellow himself who gave being to this monster; then as for his prompter, Syrus, out upon him! How I would tear him piecemeal! I would snatch him by the middle up aloft, and dash him head downward upon the earth, so that with his brains he would bestrew the road: I would pull out the eyes of the young fellow himself, and afterward hurl him headlong over some precipice.

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Has abandoned our family.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> Then I am undone! Why so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> He has attached himself to another woman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> Woe unto wretched me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> And he makes no secret of it; he himself has carried her off openly from a procurer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> Are you quite sure of this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Quite sure; I saw it myself, Sostrata, with these same eyes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> Ah wretched me! What is one now to believe, or whom believe? Our own Aeschinus, the very life of us all, in whom all our hopes and comforts were centred! Who used to swear he could never live a single day without her! Who used to say, that he would place the infant on his father's knees,
<milestone n="333" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">On his father's knees</lemma>: It was a prevalent custom with the Greeks to place the newly-born child upon the knee of its grandfather.</note> and thus entreat that he might be allowed to make her his wife!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CANTHARA</speaker><p> Pooh, pooh! Are you in your senses, my good man? Does this seem to you a business to be made known to any one?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> I, indeed, have no wish for it. In the first place, then, that his feelings are estranged from us, the thing itself declares. Now, if we make this known, he'll deny it, I'm quite sure; your reputation and your daughter's character will then be in danger. On the other hand, if he were fully to confess it, as he is in love with another woman, it would not be to her advantage to be given to him. Therefore, under either circumstance, there is need of silence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> Oh! by no means in the world! I'll not do it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> What is it you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> I'll make it known.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> Ha, my dear Sostrata, take care what you do!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> The matter can not possibly be in a worse position than it is at present. In the first place, she has no portion; then, besides, that which was as good as a portion, her honor, is lost: she can not be given in marriage as a virgin. This resource is left; if he should deny it, I have a ring which he lost as evidence of the truth. In fine, Geta, as I am fully conscious that no blame attaches to me, and that neither interest nor any consideration unworthy of her or of myself has had a share in this matter, I will make trial----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> What am I to say to this? I agree, as you speak for the best.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSTRATA</speaker><p> You be off as fast as possible, and relate all the matter just as it has happened to her kinsman Hegio; for he was the best friend of our lamented Simulus, and has shown especial regard for us.</p></sp>

This sorrow still remains for unhappy me, should Aeschinus be able to seduce him, even him, who promises so fair, to a course of debauchery. Where am I to inquire for him? I doubt he has been carried off to some bad house; that profligate has persuaded him, I'm quite sure. But look--I see Syrus coming this way, I shall now know from him where he is.

<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I do every thing I can; I spare no pains; I train him up to it: in fine, I bid him look into the lives of men, as though into a mirror, and from others to take an example for himself. Do this, I say----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> And then, moreover----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> Upon my honor, I have not the leisure to listen to you just at present: I have got some fish just to my taste, and must take care they are not spoiled; for that would be as much a crime in me, as for you, Demea, not to observe those maxims which you have just been mentioning; and so far as I can, I lay down precepts for my fellow-servants on the very same plan; "this is too salt, that is quite burned up, this is not washed enough, that is very well done; remember and do so another time." I carefully instruct them so far as I can to the best of my capacity. In short, Demea, I bid them look into their sauce-pans as though into a mirror,

<sp><speaker>GETA</speaker><p> All our hopes, Hegio, are centred in you; you we have for our only friend; you are our protector, our father. The old man, Simulus, when dying, recommended us to you; if you forsake us, we are undone.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>HEGIO</speaker><p> Worse, by far: for this indeed might in some measure have been borne with. The hour of night prompted him; passion, wine, young blood; 'tis human nature.

<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> The wolf in the fable
<milestone n="538" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The wolf in the fable</lemma>: This was a proverbial expression, tantamount to our saying, "Talk of the devil, he's sure to appear." Servius, in his Commentary on the Ninth Eclogue of Virgil, says that the saying arose from the common belief that the person whom a wolf sets his eyes, upon is deprived of his voice, and thence came to be applied to a person who, coming, upon others in the act of talking about him, necessarily put a stop to their conversation. Cooke says, in reference to this passage, "This certainly alludes to a Fable of Aesop's, of the Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape: which is translated by Phaedrus, and is the tenth of his First Book." It is much more certain that Cooke is mistaken here, and that the fable of the arbitration of the Ape between the Wolf and the Fox has nothing to do with this passage. If it alludes to any fable (which from the expression itself is riot at all unlikely), it is more likely to be that where the Nurse threatens that the wolf shall take the naughty Child, on which he makes his appearance, but is disappointed in his expectations, or else that of the Shepherd-boy and the Wolf. See the Stichus of Plautus, 1. 57, where the same. expression occurs.</note>----</p></sp>

<stage>Enter AESCHINUS.</stage>
<p>I am quite distracted in mind! for this misfortune so unexpectedly to befall me, that I neither know what to do with myself, or how to act! My limbs are enfeebled through fear, my faculties bewildered with apprehension; no counsel is able to find a place within my breast. Alas! how to extricate myself from this perplexity I know not; so strong a suspicion has taken possession of them about me; not without some reason too: Sostrata believes that I have purchased this Music-girl for myself: the old woman informed me of that. For by accident, when she was sent for the midwife, I saw her, and at once went up to her. "How is Pamphila?" I inquired; "is her delivery at hand? Is it for that she is sending for the midwife?" "Away, away, Aeschinus," cries she; "you have deceived us long enough; already have your promises disappointed us sufficiently." "Ha !" said I; "pray what is the meaning of this?" "Farewell," she cries; "keep to her who is your choice." I instantly guessed what it was they suspected, but still I checked myself, that I might not be telling that gossip any thing about my brother, whereby it might be divulged. Now what am I to do? Shall I say she is for my brother, a thing that ought:by no means to be repeated any where? However, let that pass. It is possible it might go no further. I am afraid they would not believe it, so many probabilities concur against it; 'twas I myself carried her off; 'twas I, my own self, that paid the money for her; 'twas my own house she was carried to. This I confess has been entirely my own fault. Ought I not to have disclosed this affair, just as it happened, to my father? I might have obtained his consent to marry her. I have been too negligent hitherto; henceforth, then, arouse yourself, Aeschinus. This then is the first thing; to go to them and clear myself.

Others, and even men of worth, have frequently done the same. But after it happened, pray, did you show any circumspection? Or did you use any foresight as to what was to be done, or how it was to be done? If you were ashamed to tell me of it, by what means was I to come to know it? While you were at a loss upon these points, ten months have been lost. So far indeed as lay in your power, you have periled both yourself and this poor girl, and the child. What did you imagine--that the Gods would set these matters to rights for you while you were asleep, and that she would be brought home to your chamber without any exertions of your own? I would not have you to be equally negligent in other affairs. Be of good heart, you shall have her for your wife.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> But I have already betrothed the young woman to him; the matter is settled: the marriage takes place to-day. I have removed all apprehensions. This is rather the duty of a man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> But does the affair please you, Micio?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> If I were able to alter it, no; now, as I can not, I bear it with patience. The life of man is just like playing with dice:
<milestone n="742" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Playing with dice</lemma>: The "<foreign lang="la">tesserae</foreign>" of the ancients were cubes, or what we call "dice;" while the "<foreign lang="la">tali</foreign>" were in imitation of the knuckle-bones of animals, and were marked on four sides only.

Madame Dacier suggests that Menander may possibly have borrowed this passage from the Republic of Plato, <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 604C">B.

<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Not at all, and indeed I have no wish to sell her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> What will you do with her then?</p></sp>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> See, here comes the common corrupter of my children.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Pray moderate your passion, and recover yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I have moderated it; I am myself; I forbear all reproaches; let us come to the point: was this agreed upon between us,--proposed by yourself, in fact,--that you were not to concern yourself about my son, nor I about yours? Answer me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> It is the fact,--I don't deny it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Why is he now carousing at your house? Why are you harboring my son ? Why do you purchase a mistress for him, Micio ? Is it at all fair, that I should have any less justice from you, than you from me? Since I do not concern myself about your son, don't you concern yourself about mine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> You don't reason fairly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> No ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> For surely it is a maxim of old, that among themselves all things are common to friends.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Smartly said; you've got that speech up for the occasion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Listen to a few words, unless it is disagreeable, Demea. In the first place, if the extravagance your sons are guilty of distresses you, pray do reason with yourself. You formerly brought up the two suitably to your circumstances, thinking that your own property would have to suffice for them both; and, of course, you then thought that I should marry. Adhere to that same old rule of yours,--save, scrape together, and be thrifty for them; take care to leave them as much as possible, and take that credit to yourself: my fortune, which has come to them beyond their expectation, allow them to enjoy; of your capital there will be no diminution; what comes from this quarter, set it all down as so much gain. If you think proper impartially to consider these matters in your mind, Demea, you will save me and yourself, and them, considerable uneasiness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I don't speak about the expense; their morals----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Hold; I understand you; that point I was coming to.<milestone n="824" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">That point I was coming to</lemma>: Colman observes here: "Madame Dacier makes an observation on this speech, something like that of Donatus on one of Micio's above; and says that Micio, being hard put to it by the real circumstances of the case, thinks to confound Demea by a nonsensical gallimatia. I can not be of the ingenious lady's opinion on this matter, for I think a more sensible speech could not be made, nor a better plea offered in favor of the young men, than that of Micio in the present instance."</note> There are in men, Demea, many signs from which a conjecture is easily formed; so that when two persons do the same thing, you may often say, this one may be allowed to do it with impunity, the other may not; not that the thing itself is different, but that he is who does it. I see signs in them, so as to feel confident that they will turn out as we wish. I see that they have good sense and understanding, that they have modesty upon occasion, and are affectionate to each other; you may infer that their bent and disposition is of a pliant nature; at any time you like you may reclaim them. But still, you may be apprehensive that they will be somewhat too apt to neglect their interests. O my dear Demea, in all other things we grow wiser with age; this sole vice does old age bring upon men: we are all more solicitous about our own interests than we need be; and in this respect age will make them sharp enough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Only take care, Micio, that these fine reasonings of yours, and this easy disposition of yours, do not ruin us in the end.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Say no more; there's no danger of that. Now think no further of these matters. Put yourself to-day into my hands; smooth your brow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Why, as the occasion requires it, I must do so; but to-morrow I shall be off with my son into the country at day-break.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Aye, to-night, for my share; only keep yourself in good-humor for the day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I'll carry off that Music-girl along with me as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> You will gain your point; by that means you will keep your son fast there; only take care to secure her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I'll see to that; and what with cooking and grinding, I'll take care she shall be well covered with ashes, smoke, and meal; besides all this, at the very mid-day<milestone n="851" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At the very mid-day</lemma>: Exposed to the heat of a mid-day sun.</note> I'll set her gathering stubble; I'll make her as burned and as black as a coal.</p></sp>

<stage>DEMEA alone.</stage>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Never was there any person of ever such well-trained habits of life, but that experience, age, and custom are always bringing him something new, or suggesting something; so much so, that what you believe you know you don't know, and what you have fancied of first importance to you, on making trial you reject; and this is my case at present: for the rigid life I have hitherto led, my race nearly run, I now renounce. Why so ?--I have found, by experience, that there is nothing better for a man than an easy temper and complacency. That this is the truth, it is easy for any one to understand on comparing me with my brother. He has always spent his life in ease and gayety; mild, gentle, offensive to no one, having a smile for all, he has lived for himself, and has spent his money for himself; all men speak well of him, all love him. I, again, a rustic, a rigid, cross, self-denying, morose and thrifty person, married a wife; what misery I entailed in consequence! Sons were born--a fresh care. And just look, while I have been studying to do as much as possible for them, I have worn out my life and years in saving; now, in the decline of my days, the return I get from them for my pains is their dislike. He, on the other hand, with out any trouble on his part, enjoys a father's comforts; they love him; me they shun; him they trust with all their secrets, are fond of him, are always with him. I am forsaken; they wish him to live; but my death, forsooth, they are longing for. Thus, after bringing them up with all possible pains, at a trifling cost he has made them his own; thus I bear all the misery, he enjoys the pleasure. Well, then, henceforward let us try, on the other hand, whether I can't speak kindly and act complaisantly, as he challenges me to it: I also want myself to be loved and highly valued by my friends. If that is to be effected by giving and indulging, I will not be behind him. If our means fail, that least concerns me, as I am the eldest.<milestone n="884" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Am the eldest</lemma>: And therefore likely to be the first to die, and to avoid seeing such a time come.</note></p></sp></div2>

<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> Well done! now I am called " kind."

<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I think they deserve it. What say you, Aeschinus, as to this plan ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> I quite agree to it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> It is much more proper than that she, being sick and lying-in, should be brought hither through the street.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> Why, my dear father, I never did see any thing better contrived.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> It's my way; but see, here's Micio coming out.</p></sp></div2>

<stage>Enter MICIO, from his house.</stage>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> <stage>speaking to GETA, within.</stage> Does my brother order it? Where is he? <stage>To DEMEA.</stage> Is this your order, Demea?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Certainly, I do order it, and in this matter, and in every thing else, wish especially to make this family one with ourselves, to oblige, serve, and unite them.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> Father, pray let it be so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> I do not oppose it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> On the contrary, i' faith, it is what we ought to do: in the first place, she is the mother of his wife <stage>pointing to AESCHINUS</stage>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> She is. What then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> An honest and respectable woman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> So they say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Advanced in years.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> I am aware of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Through her years, she is long past child-bearing; there is no one to take care of her; she is a lone woman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> What can be his meaning ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> It is right you should marry her; and that you, Aeschinus, should use your endeavors to effect it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> I, marry her, indeed ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> You.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> I?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> You, I say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> You are trifling !</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Aeschinus, if you are a man, he'll do it</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> My dear father----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> What, ass! do you attend to him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> 'T is all in vain; it can not be otherwise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> You are mad!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> Do let me prevail on you, my father.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Are you out of your senses? Take yourself off.<milestone n="940" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Take yourself off</lemma>: Aeschinus, probably, in his earnestness, has seized hold of him with his hand, which Micio now pushes away.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Come, do oblige your son.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Are you quite in your right mind? Am I, in my five-and-sixtieth year, to be marrying at last? A decrepit old woman too ? Do you advise me to do this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> Do; I have promised it.<milestone n="943" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I have promised it</lemma>: This is not the truth; the notion has only been started since he last saw them.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Promised, indeed; be generous at your own cost, young man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Come, what if he should ask a still greater favor ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> As if this was not the greatest !</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Do comply.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> Don't make any difficulty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Do promise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Will you not have done?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> Not until I have prevailed upon you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Really, this is downright force.<milestone n="946" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Really, this is downright force</lemma>: "<foreign lang="la">Vis est haec quidem</foreign>." The same expression occurs in the Captivi of Plautus, <bibl n="Pl. Capt. 3.5">l. 755</bibl>. The expression seemed to be a common one with the Romans. According to Suetonius, Julius Caesar used it when attacked by his murderers in the senate-house. On Tullius Cimber seizing hold of his garments, he exclaimed, <cit><quote lang="la">Ita quidem vis est!</quote><bibl n="Suet. Jul. 82.1">(82.1)</bibl></cit>--" Why, really, this is violence !"</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Act with heartiness, Micio.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Although this seems to me<milestone n="947" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">This seems to me</lemma>: Donatus informs us that in Menander's Play, the old man did not make any resistance whatever to the match thus patched up for him. Colman has the following observation on this fact: "It is surprising that none of the critics on this passage. have taken notice of this observation of Donatus, especially as our loss of Menander makes it rather curious. It is plain that Terence in the plan of his last Act followed Menander; but though he has adopted the absurdity of marrying Micio to the old lady, yet we learn from Donatus that his judgment rather revolted at this circumstance, and he improved on his original by making Micio express a repugnance to such a match, which it seems he did not in the Play of Menander."</note> to be wrong, foolish, absurd, and repugnant to my mode of life, yet, if you so strongly wish it, be it so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> You act obligingly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> With reason I love you; but----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> What ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I will tell you, when my wish has been complied with.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> What now ? What remains to be done?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Hegio here is their nearest relation; he is a connection of ours and poor; we ought to do some good for him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Do what?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> There is a little farm here in the suburbs, which you let out; let us give it him to live upon.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> But is it a little one ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> If it were a large one, still it ought to be done; he has been as it were a father to her; he is a worthy man, and connected with us; it would be properly bestowed. In fine, I now adopt that proverb which you, Micio, a short time ago repeated with sense and wisdom--it is the common vice of all, in old age, to be too intent upon our own interests. This stain we ought to avoid: it is a true maxim, and ought to be observed in deed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> What am I to say to this? Well then, as he desires it <stage>pointing to AESCHINUS</stage>, it shall be given him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> My father!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Now, Micio, you are indeed my brother, both in spirit and in body.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> I am glad of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> <stage>aside.</stage> I foil him at his own weapon.<milestone n="961" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At his own weapon</lemma>: He probably means, by aping the kind feeling which is a part of Micio's character.</note></p></sp></div2>

<stage>Enter SYRUS, from the house.</stage>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> It has been done as you ordered, Demea.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> You are a worthy fellow. Upon my faith,--in my opinion, at least,--I think Syrus ought at once to be made free.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> He free! For what reason?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> For many.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> O my dear Demea! upon my word, you are a worthy man! I have strictly taken care of both these sons of yours, from childhood; I have taught, advised, and carefully instructed them in every thing I could.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> The thing is evident; and then, besides all this, to cater for them, secretly bring, home a wench, prepare a morning entertainment;<milestone n="969" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A morning entertainment</lemma>: A banquet in the early part or middle of the day was considered by the Greeks a debauch.</note> these are the accomplishments of no ordinary person.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRUS</speaker><p> O, what a delightful man !</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Last of all, he assisted to-day in purchasing this Music-wench--he had the management of it; it is right he should be rewarded; other servants will be encouraged thereby: besides, he <stage>pointing to AESCHINUS</stage> desires it to be so.

<sp><speaker>AESCHINUS</speaker><p> I do wish it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> Why really, in seriousness, if she was the first to do so, there is no doubt she ought to be made free.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> What, for doing that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> For doing that; in fine, receive the amount from me<milestone n="981" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Receive the amount from me</lemma>: The only sign of generosity he has yet shown.</note> at which she is valued.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MICIO</speaker><p> Syrus, you have thrived pretty well to-day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> If, in addition, Micio, you will do your duty, and lend him a little ready money in hand for present use, he will soon repay you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DEMEA</speaker><p> I will tell you:--That I may convince you of this, Micio, that the fact that they consider you an easy and kind-hearted man, does not proceed from your real life, nor, indeed, from a regard for virtue and justice; but from your humoring, indulging, and pampering them. Now therefore, Aeschinus, if my mode of life has been displeasing to you, because I do not quite humor you in every thing, just or unjust, I have done: squander, buy, do what you please. But if you would rather have one to reprove and correct those faults, the results of which, by reason of your youth, you can not see, which you pursue too ardently, and are thoughtless upon, and in due season to direct you; behold me ready to do it for you.</p></sp>
