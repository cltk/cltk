				<head>Book I</head>
				<head>The Earliest Legends</head>
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="pr"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whether the task I have undertaken of writing a complete history of the Roman people from the very commencement of its existence will reward me for the labour spent on it, I neither know for certain, nor if I did know would I venture to say.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For I see that this is an old-established and a common practice, each fresh writer being invariably persuaded that he will either attain greater certainty in the materials of his narrative, or surpass the rudeness of antiquity in the excellence of his style.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> However this may be, it will still be a great satisfaction to me to have taken my part, too, in investing, to the utmost of my abilities, the annals of the foremost nation in the world with a deeper interest; and if in such a crowd of writers my own reputation is thrown into the shade, I would console myself with the renown and greatness of those who eclipse my fame.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The subject, moreover, is one that demands immense labour. It goes back beyond 700 years and, after starting from small and humble beginnings, has grown to such dimensions that it begins to be overburdened by its greatness. I have very little doubt, too, that for the majority of my readers the earliest times and those immediately succeeding, will possess little attraction; they will hurry on to these modern days in which the might of a long paramount nation is wasting by internal decay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> I, on the other hand, shall look for a further reward of my labours in being able to close my eyes to the evils which our generation has witnessed for so many years; so long, at least, as I am devoting all my thoughts to retracing those pristine records, free from all the anxiety which can disturb the historian of his own times even if it cannot warp him from the truth.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The traditions of what happened prior to the foundation of the City or whilst it was being built, are more fitted to adorn the creations of the poet than the authentic records of the historian, and I have no intention of establishing either their truth or their falsehood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This much licence is conceded to the ancients, that by intermingling human actions with divine they may confer a more august dignity on the origins of states. Now, if any nation ought to be allowed to claim a sacred origin and point back to a divine paternity that nation is Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For such is her renown in war that when she chooses to represent Mars as her own and her founder's father, the nations of the world accept the statement with the same equanimity with which they accept her dominion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But whatever opinions may be formed or criticisms passed upon these and similar traditions, I regard them as of small importance. The subjects to which I would ask each of my readers to devote his earnest attention are these-the life and morals of the community; the men and the qualities by which through domestic policy and foreign war dominion was won and extended. Then as the standard of morality gradually lowers, let him follow the decay of the national character, observing how at first it slowly sinks, then slips downward more and more rapidly, and finally begins to plunge into headlong ruin, until he reaches these days, in which we can bear neither our diseases nor their remedies.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>There is this exceptionally beneficial and fruitful advantage to be derived from the study of the past, that you see, set in the clear light of historical truth, examples of every possible type. From these you may select for yourself and your country what to imitate, and also what, as being mischievous in its inception and disastrous in its issues, you are to avoid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Unless, however, I am misled by affection for my undertaking, there has never existed any commonwealth greater in power, with a purer morality, or more fertile in good examples; or any state in which avarice and luxury have been so late in making their inroads, or poverty and frugality so highly and continuously honoured, showing so clearly that the less wealth men possessed the less they coveted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In these latter years wealth has brought avarice in its train, and the unlimited command of pleasure has created in men a passion for ruining themselves and everything else through self-indulgence and licentiousness. But criticisms which will be unwelcome, even when perhaps necessary, must not appear in the commencement at all events of this extensive work.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> We should much prefer to start with favourable omens, and if we could have adopted the poets' custom, it would have been much pleasanter to commence with prayers and supplications to gods and goddesses that they would grant a favourable and successful issue to the great task before us.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Aeneas in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.</note>To begin with, it is generally admitted that after the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, whilst the rest of the Trojans were massacred, against two of them &mdash;Aeneas and Antenor &mdash;the Achivi refused to exercise the rights of war, partly owing to old ties of hospitality, and partly because these men had always been in favour of making peace and surrendering Helen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their subsequent fortunes were different. Antenor sailed into the furthest part of the Adriatic, accompanied by a number of Enetians who had been driven from <placeName key="tgn,7016760">Paphlagonia</placeName> by a revolution and after losing their king Pylaemenes before Troy were looking for a settlement and a leader.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The combined force of Enetians and Trojans defeated the Euganei, who dwelt between the sea and the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> and occupied their land. The place where they disembarked was called <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, and the name was extended to the surrounding district; the whole nation were called Veneti.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Similar misfortunes led to Aeneas becoming a wanderer but the Fates were preparing a higher destiny for him. He first visited <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, then was carried down to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> in quest of a settlement; from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> he directed his course to the Laurentian territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Here, too, the name of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> is found, and here the Trojans disembarked, and as their almost infinite wanderings had left them nothing but their arms and their ships, they began to plunder the neighbourhood. The Aborigines, who occupied the country, with their king Latinus at their head came hastily together from the city and the country districts to repel the inroads of the strangers by force of arms.</p> <p>From this point there is a twofold tradition. According to the one, Latinus was defeated in battle, and made peace with Aeneas, and subsequently a family alliance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> According to the other, whilst the two armies were standing ready to engage and waiting for the signal, Latinus advanced in front of his lines and invited the leader of the strangers to a conference.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He inquired of him what manner of men they were, whence they came, what had happened to make them leave their homes, what were they in quest of when they landed in Latinus' territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When he heard that the men were Trojans, that their leader was Aeneas, the son of Anchises and Venus, that their city had been burnt, and that the homeless exiles were now looking for a place to settle in and build a city, he was so struck with the noble bearing of the men and their leader, and their readiness to accept alike either peace or war, that he gave his right hand as a solemn pledge of friendship for the future.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A formal treaty was made between the leaders and mutual greetings exchanged between the armies. Latinus received Aeneas as a guest in his house, and there, in the presence of his tutelary deities, completed the political alliance by a domestic one, and gave his daughter in marriage to Aeneas.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This incident confirmed the Trojans in the hope that they had reached the term of their wanderings and won a permanent home.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They built a town, which Aeneas called <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName> after his wife. In a short time a boy was born of the new marriage, to whom his parents gave the name of Ascanius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In a short time the Aborigines and Trojans became involved in war with Turnus, the king of the Rutulians. Lavinia had been betrothed to him before the arrival of Aeneas, and, furious at finding a stranger preferred to him, he declared war against both Latinus and Aeneas.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Neither side could congratulate themselves on the result of the battle; the Rutulians were defeated, but the victorious Aborigines and Trojans lost their leader Latinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Feeling their need of allies, Turnus and the Rutulians had recourse to the celebrated power of the Etruscans and Mezentius, their king, who was reigning at <placeName key="perseus,Caere">Caere</placeName>, a wealthy city in those days. From the first he had felt anything but pleasure at the rise of the new city, and now he regarded the growth of the Trojan state as much too rapid to be safe to its neighbours, so he welcomed the proposal to join forces with the Rutulians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To keep the Aborigines from abandoning him in the face of this strong coalition and to secure their being not only under the same laws, but also the same designation, Aeneas called both nations by the common name of Latins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> From that time the Aborigines were not behind the Trojans in their loyal devotion to Aeneas. So great was the power of Etruria that the renown of her people had filled not only the inland parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> but also the coastal districts along the whole length of the land from the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> to the Straits of <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messina</placeName>. Aeneas, however, trusting to the loyalty of the two nations who were day by day growing into one, led his forces into the field, instead of awaiting the enemy behind his walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The battle resulted in favour of the Latins, but it was the last mortal act of Aeneas His tomb &mdash; whatever it is lawful and right to call him &mdash; is situated on the bank of the Numicius. He is addressed as <q direct="unspecified">Jupiter Indiges.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>His<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Ascanius and the Foundation of Alba.</note> son Ascanius was not old enough to assume the government but his throne remained secure throughout his minority. During that interval &mdash;such was Lavinia's force of character &mdash;though a woman was regent, the Latin State, and the kingdom of his father and grandfather, were preserved unimpaired for her son.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I will not discuss the question-for who could speak decisively about a matter of such extreme antiquity ? &mdash;whether the man whom the Julian house claim, under the name of Iulus, as the founder of their name, was this Ascanius or an older one than he, born of Creusa, whilst <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> was still intact, and after its fall a sharer in his father's fortunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This Ascanius, where-ever born, or of whatever mother-it is generally agreed in any case that he was the son of Aeneas-left to his mother (or his stepmother) the city of <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName>, which was for those days a prosperous and wealthy city, with a superabundant population, and built a new city at the foot of the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> hills, which from its position, stretching along the side of the hill, was called <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="perseus,Alba Longa">Alba Longa</placeName>.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> An interval of thirty years elapsed between the foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName> and the colonisation of <placeName key="perseus,Alba Longa">Alba Longa</placeName>. Such had been the growth of the Latin power, mainly through the defeat of the Etruscans, that neither at the death of Aeneas, nor during the regency of Lavinia, nor during the immature years
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> of the reign of Ascanius, did either Mezentius and the Etruscans or any other of their neighbours venture to attack them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When terms of peace were being arranged, the river <placeName key="tgn,1121086">Albula</placeName>, now called the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, had been fixed as the boundary between the Etruscans and the Latins.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Ascanius was succeeded by his son Silvius, who by some chance had been born in the forest. He became the father of Aeneas Silvius, who in his turn had a son, Latinus Silvius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He planted a number of colonies: the colonists were called <foreign lang="la">Prisci Latini</foreign>. The cognomen of Silvius was common to all the remaining kings of Alba, each of whom succeeded his father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Their names are Alba, Atys, Capys, Capetus, Tiberinus, who was drowned in crossing the <placeName key="tgn,1121086">Albula</placeName>, and his name transferred to the river, which became henceforth the famous <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>. Then came his son Agrippa, after him his son Romulus Silvius. He was struck by lightning and left the crown to his son Aventinus, whose shrine was on the hill which bears his name and is now a part of the city of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He was succeeded by Proca, who had two sons, Numitor and Amulius. To Numitor, the elder, he bequeathed the ancient throne of the Silvian house. Violence, however, proved stronger than either the father's will or the respect due to the brother's seniority; for Amulius expelled his brother and seized the crown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Adding crime to crime, he murdered his brother's sons and made the daughter, Rea Silvia, a Vestal virgin; thus, under the pretence of honouring her, depriving her of all hopes of issue.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p>But<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">THE STORY OF ROMULUS. Birth and Uprearing.</note> the Fates had, I believe, already decreed the origin of this great city and the foundation of the mightiest empire under heaven.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Vestal was forcibly violated and gave birth to twins. She named Mars as their father, either because she really believed it, or because the fault might appear less heinous if a deity were the cause of it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But neither gods nor men sheltered her or her babes from the king's cruelty; the priestess was thrown into prison, the boys were ordered to be thrown into the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By a heaven-sent chance it happened that the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> was then overflowing its banks, and stretches of standing water prevented any approach to the main channel. Those who were carrying the children expected that this stagnant water would be sufficient to drown them, so under the impression that they were carrying out the king's orders they
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> exposed the boys at the nearest point of the overflow, where the Ficus Ruminalis (said to have been formerly called Romularis) now stands. The locality was then a wild solitude.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The tradition goes on to say that after the floating cradle in which the boys had been exposed had been left by the retreating water on dry land, a thirsty she-wolf from the surrounding hills, attracted by the crying of the children, came to them, gave them her teats to suck and was so gentle towards them that the king's flock-master found her licking the boys with her tongue. According to the story his name was Faustulus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He took the children to his hut and gave them to his wife Larentia to bring up. Some writers think that Larentia, from her unchaste life, had got the nickname of <q direct="unspecified">She-wolf</q> amongst the shepherds, and that this was the origin of the marvellous story.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>As soon as the boys, thus born and thus brought up, grew to be young men they did not neglect their pastoral duties but their special delight was roaming through the woods on hunting expeditions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As their strength and courage were thus developed, they used not only to lie in wait for fierce beasts of prey, but they even attacked brigands when loaded with plunder. They distributed what they took amongst the shepherds, with whom, surrounded by a continually increasing body of young men, they associated themselves in their serious undertakings and in their sports and pastimes.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed"><placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> recognised, Amulius killed.</note> is said that the festival of the Lupercalia, which is still observed, was even in those days celebrated on the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> hill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This hill was originally called Pallantium from a city of the same name in <placeName key="tgn,2094818">Arcadia</placeName>; the name was afterwards changed to Palatium. <placeName key="tgn,2319904">Evander</placeName>, an <placeName key="tgn,2136419">Arcadian</placeName>, had held that territory many ages before, and had introduced an annual festival from <placeName key="tgn,2078249">Arcadia</placeName> in which young men ran about naked for sport and wantonness, in honour of the Lycaean Pan, whom the Romans afterwards called Inuus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The existence of this festival was widely recognised, and it was while the two brothers were engaged in it that the brigands, enraged at losing their plunder, ambushed them. <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> successfully defended himself, but <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> was taken prisoner and brought before Amulius, his captors impudently accusing him of their own crimes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The principal charge brought against them was that of invading Numitor's lands with a body of young men whom they had got together, and carrying off plunder as though in regular warfare.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> accordingly was handed over to Numitor for punishment.</p> <p>Faustulus had from the beginning suspected that it was royal offspring that he was bringing up, for he was aware that the boys had been exposed at the king's command and the time at which he had taken them away exactly corresponded with that of their exposure. He had, however, refused to divulge the matter prematurely, until either a fitting opportunity occurred or necessity demanded its disclosure. The necessity came first.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Alarmed for the safety of <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> he revealed the state of the case to <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName>. It so happened that Numitor also, who had <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> in his custody, on hearing that he and his brother were twins, and comparing their ages, and the character and bearing so unlike that of one in a servile condition, began to recall the memory of his grandchildren, and further inquiries brought him to the same conclusion as Faustulus; nothing was wanting to the recognition of <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName>. So the king Amulius was being enmeshed on all sides by hostile purposes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> shrunk from a direct attack with his body of shepherds, for he was no match for the king in open fight. They were instructed to approach the palace by different routes and meet there at a given time, whilst from Numitor's house <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> lent his assistance with a second band he had collected. The attack succeeded and the king was killed.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the fray, Numitor gave out that an enemy had entered the City and was attacking the palace, in order to draw off the <placeName key="tgn,2127955">Alban</placeName> soldiery to the citadel, to defend it. When he saw the young men coming to congratulate him after the assassination, he at once called a council of his people and explained his brother's infamous conduct towards him, the story of his grandsons, their parentage and bringing up, and how he recognised them. Then he proceeded to inform them of the tyrant's death and his responsibility for it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The young men marched in order through the midst of the assembly and saluted their grandfather as king; their action was approved by the whole population, who with one voice ratified the title and sovereignty of the king.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Foundation of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</note> the government of Alba was thus transferred to Numitor, <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> were seized with the desire of building a city in the locality where they had been exposed. There was the superfluous population of the <placeName key="tgn,2127955">Alban</placeName> and Latin towns, to these were added the shepherds: it was natural to hope that with all these Alba would be small and <placeName key="tgn,7010390">Lavinium</placeName> small in comparison with the city which was to be founded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These pleasant anticipations were disturbed by the ancestral curse &mdash;ambition &mdash;which led to a deplorable quarrel over what was at first a trivial matter. As they were twins and no claim to precedence could be based on seniority, they decided to consult the tutelary deities of the place by means of augury as to who was to give his name to the new city, and who was to rule it after it had been founded. <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> accordingly selected the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> as his station for observation, <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>.</p>

The augury had just been announced to <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> when double the number appeared to him. Each was saluted as king by his own party.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The one side based their claim on the priority of the appearance, the other on the number of the birds. Then followed an angry altercation; heated passions led to bloodshed; in the tumult <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> was killed. The more common report is that <placeName key="tgn,2053128">Remus</placeName> contemptuously jumped over the newly raised walls and was forthwith killed by the enraged <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName>, who exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">So shall it be henceforth with every one who leaps over my walls.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Romulus thus became sole ruler, and the city was called after him, its founder.</p> <p>His<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Legend of <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName> and Cacus.</note> first work was to fortify the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> hill where he had been brought up. The worship of the other deities he conducted according to the use of Alba, but that of <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName> in accordance with the Greek rites as they had been instituted by <placeName key="tgn,2319904">Evander</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was into this neighbourhood, according to the tradition, that <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName>, after he had killed Geryon, drove his oxen, which were of marvellous beauty. He swam across the <placeName key="tgn,2061783">Tiber</placeName>, driving the oxen before him, and wearied with his journey, lay down in a grassy place near the river to rest himself and the oxen, who enjoyed the rich pasture.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When sleep had overtaken him, as he was heavy with food and wine, a shepherd living near, called Cacus, presuming on his strength, and captivated by the beauty of the oxen, determined to secure them. If he drove them before him into the cave, their hoof-marks would have led their owner in his search for them in the same direction, so he dragged the finest of them backwards by their tails into his cave. At the first streak of dawn <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName> awoke, and on surveying his herd and saw that some were missing.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He proceeded towards the nearest cave, to see if any tracks pointed in that direction, but he found that every hoof-mark led from the cave and none towards it. Perplexed and bewildered he began to drive the herd away from so dangerous a neighbourhood. Some of the cattle, missing those which were left behind, lowed as they often do, and an answering low sounded from the cave.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName> turned in that direction, and as Cacus tried to prevent him by force from entering the cave, he was killed by a blow from <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName>' club, after vainly appealing for help to his comrades.</p> <p>The king of the country at that time was <placeName key="tgn,2319904">Evander</placeName>, a refugee from Peloponnesus, who ruled more by personal ascendancy than by the exercise of power.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was looked up to with reverence for his knowledge of letters &mdash;a new and marvellous thing for uncivilized men-but he was still more revered because of his mother, who was believed to be a divine being and regarded with wonder, by all as an interpreter of Fate, in the days before the arrival of the <placeName key="tgn,2662097">Sibyl</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This <placeName key="tgn,2319904">Evander</placeName>, alarmed by the crowd of excited shepherds standing round a stranger whom they accused of open murder, ascertained from them the nature of his act and what led to it. As he observed the bearing and stature of the man to be more than human in greatness and august dignity, he asked who he was.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he heard his name, and learnt his father and his country, he said, <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName>, son of <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>, hail! My mother, who speaks truth in the name of the gods, has prophesied that thou shalt join the company of the gods, and that here a shrine shall be dedicated to thee, which in ages to come the most powerful nation in all the world shall call their <foreign lang="la">Ara Maxima</foreign> and honour with thine own special worship.</q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> grasped <placeName key="tgn,2319904">Evander</placeName>'s right hand and said that he took the omen to himself and would fulfil the prophecy by building and consecrating the altar.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then a heifer of conspicuous beauty was taken from the herd, and the first sacrifice was offered; the Potitii and Pinarii, the two principal families in those parts, were invited by <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> to assist in the sacrifice and at the feast which followed.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It so happened that the Potitii were present at the appointed time and the entrails were placed before them; the Pinarii arrived after these were consumed and came in for the rest of the banquet.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> It became a permanent institution from that time that as long as the family of the Pinarii survived they should not eat of the entrails of the victims. The Potitii, after being instructed by <placeName key="tgn,2319904">Evander</placeName>, presided over that rite for many ages, until they handed over this ministerial office to public servants after which the whole race of the Potitii perished.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>This, out of all foreign rites, was the only one which <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> adopted, as though he felt that an immortality won through courage, of which this was the memorial, would one day be his own reward.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Political Constitution.</note> the claims of religion had been duly acknowledged, <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> called his people to a council. As nothing could unite them into one political body but the observance of common laws and customs, he gave them
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> a body of laws, which he thought would only be respected by a rude and uncivilised race of men if he inspired them with awe by assuming the outward symbols of power. He surrounded himself with greater state, and in particular he called into his service twelve lictors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some think that he fixed upon this number from the number of the birds who foretold his sovereignty; but I am inclined to agree with those who think that as this class of public officers was borrowed from the same people from whom the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">sella curulis</foreign></q><note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">sella curulis</foreign> &mdash;Lit. <q direct="unspecified">the chariot seat</q>, and hence the seat of the supreme magistrate when administering justice.</note> and the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign></q> <note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">toga praetexta.</foreign> &mdash;Lit. <q direct="unspecified">the bordered toga</q> (i.e. edged with purple), worn by the higher magistrates and priests, and also by all free-born boys till about their sixteenth year and by girls till their marriage.</note> were adopted &mdash;their neighbours, the Etruscans &mdash;so the number itself also was taken from them. Its use amongst the Etruscans is traced to the custom of the twelve sovereign cities of Etruria, when jointly electing a king furnishing him each with one lictor.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Meantime<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed"><placeName key="tgn,2326181">The Asylum</placeName>.</note> the City was growing by the extension of its walls in various directions an increase due rather to the anticipation of its future population than to any present overcrowding. His next care was to secure an addition to the population that the size of the City might not be a
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> source of weakness. It had been the ancient policy of the founders of cities to get together a multitude of people of obscure and low origin and then to spread the fiction that they were the children of the soil. In accordance with this policy, <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> opened a place of refuge on the spot where, as you go down from the Capitol, you find an enclosed space
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> between two groves. A promiscuous crowd of freemen and slaves, eager for change, fled thither from the neighbouring states. This was the first accession of strength to the nascent greatness
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> of the city.</p> <p>When<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Senate.</note> he was satisfied as to its strength, his next step was to provide for that strength being wisely directed. He created a hundred senators; either, because that number was adequate, or because there were only a hundred heads of houses who could be created. In any case they were called the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">Patres</foreign></q> in virtue of their rank, and their descendants were called <q direct="unspecified">Patricians.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Rape of the Sabines.</note> Roman State had now become so strong that it was a match for any of its neighbours in war, but its greatness threatened to last for only one generation, since through the absence of women there was no hope of offspring, and there was no right of intermarriage with their neighbours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Acting on the advice of the senate, <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> sent envoys amongst the surrounding nations to ask for alliance and the right of intermarriage on behalf of his new community.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was represented that cities, like everything else, sprung from the humblest beginnings, and those who were helped on by their own courage and the favour of heaven won for themselves great power and great renown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As to the origin of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, it was well known that whilst it had received divine assistance, courage and self-reliance were not wanting. There should, therefore, be no reluctance for men to mingle their blood with their fellow-men.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Nowhere did the envoys meet with a favourable reception. Whilst their proposals were treated with contumely, there was at the same time a general feeling of alarm at the power so rapidly growing in their midst. Usually they were dismissed with the question, <q direct="unspecified">whether they had opened an asylum for women, for nothing short of that would secure for them inter-marriage on equal terms.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Roman youth could ill brook such insults, and matters began to look like an appeal to force.</p> <p>To secure a favourable place and time for such an attempt, <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName>, disguising his resentment, made elaborate preparations for the celebration of games in honour of <q direct="unspecified">Equestrian <placeName key="tgn,2065549">Neptune</placeName>,</q> which he called <q direct="unspecified">the <foreign lang="la">Consualia</foreign>.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He ordered public notice of the spectacle to be given amongst the adjoining cities, and his people supported him in making the celebration as magnificent as their knowledge and resources allowed, so that expectations were raised to the highest pitch.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was a great gathering; people were eager to see the new City, all their nearest neighbours-the people of Caenina, Antemnae, and Crustumerium-were there, and the whole <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> population came, with their wives and families.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They were invited to accept hospitality at the different houses, and after examining the situation of the City, its walls and the large number of dwelling-houses it included, they were astonished at the rapidity with which the Roman State had grown.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>When the hour for the games had come, and their eyes and minds were alike riveted on the spectacle before them, the preconcerted signal was given and the Roman youth dashed in all directions to carry off the maidens who were present.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The larger part were carried off indiscriminately, but some particularly beautiful girls who had been marked out for the leading patricians were carried to their houses by plebeians told off for the task.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> One, conspicuous amongst them all for grace and beauty, is reported to have been carried off by a group led by a certain Talassius, and to the many inquiries as to whom she was intended for, the invariable answer was given, <q direct="unspecified">For Talassius.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Hence the use of this word in the marriage rites.<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">Talassio</foreign>. &mdash;The procession in which the bride was led from her parents' house to her new home was attended by minstrels who invoked Tallassius in the nuptial song.</note> Alarm and consternation broke up the games, and the parents of the maidens fled, distracted with grief, uttering bitter reproaches on the violators of the laws of hospitality and appealing to the god to whose solemn games they had come, only to be the victims of impious
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> perfidy.</p> <p>The abducted maidens were quite as despondent and indignant. <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName>, however, went round in person, and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and &mdash;dearest of all to human nature-would be the mothers of
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> freemen. He begged them to lay aside their feelings of resentment and give their affections to those whom fortune had made masters of their persons. An injury had often led to reconciliation and love; they would find their husbands all the more affectionate because each would do his utmost, so far as in him lay to make up for the loss of parents and
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> country. These arguments were reinforced by the endearments of their husbands who excused their conduct by pleading the irresistible force of their passion &mdash;a plea effective beyond all others in appealing to a woman's nature.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The First Wars.</note> feelings of the abducted maidens were now pretty completely appeased, but not so those of their parents. They went about in mourning garb, and tried by their tearful complaints to rouse their countrymen to action. Nor did they confine their remonstrances to their own cities; they flocked from all sides to Titus Tatius, the king of the Sabines, and sent formal deputations to him, for his was the most influential name in those parts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The people of Caenina, Crustumerium, and Antemnae were the greatest sufferers; they thought Tatius and his Sabines were too slow in moving, so these three cities prepared to make war conjointly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Such, however, were the impatience and anger of the Caeninensians that even the Crustuminians and Antemnates did not display enough energy for them, so the men of Caenina made an attack upon Roman territory on their own account.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whilst they were scattered far and wide, pillaging and destroying, <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> came upon them with an army, and after a brief encounter taught them that anger is futile without strength. He put them to a hasty flight, and following them up, killed their king and despoiled his body; then after slaying their leader took their city at the first assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was no less anxious to display his achievements than he had been great in performing them, so, after leading his victorious army home, he mounted to the Capitol with the spoils of his dead foe borne before him on a frame constructed for the purpose. He hung them there on an oak, which the shepherds looked upon as a sacred tree, and at the same time marked out the site for the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>, and addressing the god by a new title, uttered the following invocation: <q direct="unspecified">Jupiter Feretrius!
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> these arms taken from a king, I, <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> a king and conqueror, bring to thee, and on this domain, whose bounds I have in will and purpose traced, I dedicate a temple to receive the <foreign lang="la">spolia opima</foreign> which posterity following my example shall bear hither, taken from the kings and generals of our foes slain in battle.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Such was the origin of the first temple dedicated in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. And the gods decreed that though its founder did not utter idle words in declaring that posterity would thither bear their spoils, still the splendour of that offering should not be dimmed by the number of those who have rivalled his achievement. For after so many years have elapsed and so many wars been waged, only twice have the <foreign lang="la">spolia opima</foreign> been offered.<note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="ed">The first time by Cornelius Cossus, who slew Lars Tolumnius, B.C. <date value="-437">437</date> (see Book IV. chap. xx. p. 243); the second by Claudius Marcellus, who slew Viridomarus, king of the Gauls, B.C. <date value="-222">222</date>.</note> So seldom has Fortune granted that glory to men.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst the Romans were thus occupied, the army of the Antemnates seized the opportunity of their territory being unoccupied and made a raid into it. <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> hastily led his legion against this fresh foe and surprised them as they were scattered over the fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the very first battle-shout and charge the enemy were routed and their city captured. Whilst Romulus was exulting over this double victory, his wife, Hersilia, moved by the entreaties of the abducted maidens, implored him to pardon their parents and receive them into citizenship, for so the State would increase in unity and strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He readily granted her request. He then advanced against the Crustuminians, who had commenced war, but their eagerness had been damped by the successive defeats of their neighbours, and they offered but slight resistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Colonies were planted in both places; owing to the fertility of the soil of the Crustumine district, the majority gave their names for that colony. On the other hand there were numerous migrations to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, mostly of the parents and relatives of the abducted maidens.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Sabines.</note> last of these wars was commenced by the Sabines and proved the most serious of all, for nothing was done in passion or impatience; they masked their designs till war had actually commenced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Strategy was aided by craft and deceit, as the following incident shows.</p> <p>Spurius Tarpeius was in command of the Roman citadel. Whilst his daughter had gone outside the fortifications to fetch water for some religious ceremonies, Tatius bribed her to admit his troops within the citadel.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Once admitted, they crushed her to death beneath their shields, either that the citadel might appear to have been taken by assault, or that her example might be left as a warning that no faith should be kept with traitors.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A further story runs that the Sabines were in the habit of wearing heavy gold armlets on their left arms and richly jeweled rings, and that the girl made them promise to give her <q direct="unspecified">what they had on their left arms,</q> accordingly they piled their shields upon her instead of golden gifts.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some say that in bargaining for what they had in their left hands, she expressly asked for their shields, and being suspected of wishing to betray them, fell a victim to her own bargain.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>However this may be, the Sabines were in possession of the citadel. And they would not come down from it the next day, though the Roman army was drawn up in battle array over the whole of the ground between the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> and the Capitoline hill, until, exasperated at the loss of their citadel and determined to recover it, the Romans mounted to the attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Advancing before the rest, Mettius Curtius, on the side of the Sabines, and Hostius Hostilius, on the side of the Romans, engaged in single combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Hostius, fighting on disadvantageous ground, upheld the fortunes of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> by his intrepid bravery, but at last he fell; the Roman line broke and fled to what was then the gate of the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> was being swept away by the crowd of fugitives, and lifting up his hands to heaven he exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>, it was thy omen that I obeyed when I laid here on the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> the earliest foundations of the City. Now the Sabines hold its citadel, having bought it by a bribe, and coming thence have seized the valley and are pressing hitherwards in battle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Do thou, Father of gods and men, drive hence our foes, banish terror from Roman hearts, and stay our shameful flight!
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Here do I vow a temple to thee, <q direct="unspecified">Jove the Stayer,</q> as a memorial for the generations to come that it is through thy present help that the City has been saved.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, as though he had become aware that his prayer had been heard, he cried, <q direct="unspecified">Back, Romans! Jupiter Optimus Maximus bids you stand and renew the battle.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They stopped as though commanded by a voice from heaven-<placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> dashed up to the foremost line, just as Mettius Curtius had run down from the citadel in front of the Sabines and driven the Romans in headlong flight over the whole of the ground now occupied by the Forum. He was now not far from the gate of the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName>, and was shouting: <q direct="unspecified">We have conquered our faithless hosts, our cowardly foes; now they know that to carry off maidens is a very different thing from fighting with men.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the midst of these vaunts <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName>, with a compact body of valiant troops, charged down on him. Mettius happened to be on horseback, so he was the more easily driven back, the Romans followed in pursuit, and, inspired by the courage of their king, the rest of the Roman army routed the Sabines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Mettius, unable to control his horse, maddened by the noise of his pursuers, plunged into a morass. The danger of their general drew off the attention of the Sabines for a moment from the battle; they called out and made signals to encourage him, so, animated to fresh efforts, he succeeded in extricating himself. Thereupon the Romans and Sabines renewed the fighting in the middle of the valley, but the fortune of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> was in the ascendant.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Peace and Union with the Sabines.</note> it was that the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> women, whose wrongs had led to the war, throwing off all womanish fears in their distress, went boldly into the midst of the flying missiles with dishevelled hair and rent garments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Running across the space between the two armies they tried to stop any further fighting and calm the excited passions by appealing to their fathers in the one army and their husbands in the other not to bring upon themselves a curse by staining their hands with the blood of a father-in-law or a son-in-law, nor upon their posterity the taint of parricide.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">If,</q> they cried, <q direct="unspecified">you are weary of these ties of kindred, these marriage-bonds, then turn your anger upon us; it is we who are the cause of the war, it is we who have wounded and slain our husbands and fathers. Better for us to perish rather than live without one or the other of you, as widows or as orphans.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The armies and their leaders were alike moved by this appeal. There was a sudden hush and silence. Then the generals advanced to arrange the terms of a treaty. It was not only peace that was made, the two nations were united into one State, the royal power was shared between them, and the seat of government for both nations was <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After thus doubling the City, a concession was made to the Sabines in the new appellation of Quirites, from their old capital of Cures. As a memorial of the battle, the place where Curtius got his horse out of the deep marsh on to safer ground was called the Curtian lake.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Curies and Centuries.</note> joyful peace, which put an abrupt close to such a deplorable war, made the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> women still dearer to their husbands and fathers, and most of all to <placeName key="tgn,2005143">Romulus</placeName> himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Consequently when he effected the distribution of the people into the thirty curiae, he affixed their names to the curiae. No doubt there were many more than thirty women, and tradition is silent as to whether those whose names were given to the curiae were selected on the ground of age, or on that of personal distinction &mdash; either their own or their husbands' &mdash;or merely by lot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The enrolment of the three centuries of knights took place at the same time; the Ramnenses were called after <placeName key="tgn,2005143">Romulus</placeName>, the Titienses from T. Tatius. The origin of the Luceres and why they were so called is uncertain.</p> <p>Thenceforward the two kings exercised their joint sovereignty with perfect harmony.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Some<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Death of T.

They came to seek redress from him in accordance with international law, but the influence and importunities of his friends had more weight with Tatius than the remonstrances of the Laurentines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consequence was that he brought upon himself the punishment due to them, for when he had gone to the annual sacrifice at <placeName key="tgn,7010390">Lavinium</placeName>, a tumult arose in which he was killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> is reported to have been less distressed at this incident than his position demanded, either because of the insincerity inherent in all joint sovereignty, or because he thought he had deserved his fate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He refused, therefore, to go to war, but that the wrong done to the ambassadors and the murder of the king might be expiated, the treaty between <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7010390">Lavinium</placeName> was renewed.</p> <p>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Fidenae.</note> in this direction an unhoped-for peace was secured, war broke out in a much nearer quarter, in fact almost at the very gates of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. The people of Fidenae considered that a power was growing up too close to them, so to prevent the anticipations of its future greatness from being realised, they took the initiative in making war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Armed bands invaded and devastated the country lying between the City and Fidenae. Thence they turned to the left-the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> barred their advance on the right-and plundered and destroyed, to the great alarm of the country people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A sudden rush from the fields into the City was the first intimation of what was happening.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A war so close to their gates admitted of no delay, and <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> hurriedly led out his army and encamped about a mile from Fidenae. Leaving a small detachment to guard the camp, he went forward with his whole force, and whilst one part were ordered to lie in ambush in a place overgrown with dense brushwood, he advanced with the larger part and the whole of the cavalry towards the city, and by riding up to the very gates in a disorderly and provocative manner he succeeded in drawing the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The cavalry continued these tactics and so made the flight which they were to feign seem less suspicious, and when their apparent hesitation whether to fight or to flee was followed by the retirement of the infantry, the enemy suddenly poured out of the crowded gates, broke the Roman line and pressed on in eager pursuit till they were brought to where the ambush was set.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then the Romans suddenly rose and attacked the enemy in flank; their panic was increased by the troops in the camp bearing down upon them. Terrified by the threatened attacks from all sides, the Fidenates turned and fled almost before <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> and his men could wheel round from their simulated flight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They made for their town much more quickly than they had just before pursued those who pretended to flee, for their flight was a genuine one.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They could not, however, shake off the pursuit; the Romans were on their heels, and before the gates could be closed against them, burst through pell-mell with the enemy.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with <placeName key="tgn,7009104">Veii</placeName>.</note> contagion of the war-spirit in Fidenae infected the Veientes. This people were connected by ties of blood with the Fidenates, who were also Etruscans, and an additional incentive was supplied by the mere proximity of the place, should the arms of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> be turned against all her neighbours. They made an incursion into Roman territory, rather for the sake of plunder than as an act of regular war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After securing their booty they returned with it to <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName>, without entrenching a camp or waiting for the enemy. The Romans, on the other hand, not finding the enemy on their soil, crossed the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, prepared and determined to fight a decisive battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On hearing that they had formed an entrenched camp and were preparing to advance on their city, the Veientes went out against them, preferring a combat in the open to being shut up and having to fight from houses and walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Romulus gained the victory, not through stratagem, but through the prowess of his veteran army. He drove the routed enemy up to their walls, but in view of the strong position and fortifications of the city, he abstained from assaulting it. On his march home-wards, he devastated their fields more out of revenge than for the sake of plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The loss thus sustained, no less than the previous defeat, broke the spirit of the Veientes, and they sent envoys to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to sue for peace. On condition of a cession of territory a truce was granted to them for a hundred years.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>These were the principal events at home and in the field that marked the reign of Romulus. Throughout-whether we consider the courage he showed in recovering his ancestral throne, or the wisdom he displayed in founding the City and adding to its strength through war and peace alike-we find nothing incompatible with the belief in his divine origin and his admission to divine immortality after death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was, in fact, through the strength given by him that the City was powerful enough to enjoy an assured peace for forty years after his departure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was, however, more acceptable to the populace than to the patricians but most of all was he the idol of his soldiers. He kept a bodyguard of three hundred men round him in peace as well as in war These he called the <q direct="unspecified">Celeres.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Disappearance of Romulus.</note> these immortal achievements, Romulus held a review of his army at the <q direct="unspecified">Caprae Palus</q> in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>. A violent thunder storm suddenly arose and enveloped the king in so dense a cloud that he was quite invisible to the assembly. From that hour Romulus was no longer seen on earth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the fears of the Roman youth were allayed by the return of bright, calm sun-shine after such fearful weather, they saw that the royal seat was vacant. Whilst they fully believed the assertion of the Senators, who had been standing close to him, that he had been snatched away to heaven by a whirlwind, still, like men suddenly bereaved, fear and grief kept them for some time speechless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At length, after a few had taken the initiative, the whole of those present hailed Romulus as <q direct="unspecified">a god, the son of a god, the King and Father of the City of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</q> They put up supplications for his grace and favour, and prayed that he would be propitious to his children and save and protect them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I believe, however, that even then there were some who secretly hinted that he had been torn limb from limb by the senators-a tradition to this effect, though certainly a very dim one, has filtered down to us.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The other, which I follow, has been the prevailing one, due, no doubt, to the admiration felt for the man and the apprehensions excited by his disappearance. This generally accepted belief was strengthened by one man's clever device. The tradition runs that Proculus Julius, a man whose authority had weight in matters of even the gravest importance, seeing how deeply the community felt the loss of the king, and how incensed they were against the senators, came forward into the assembly and said: <q direct="unspecified">Quirites!
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> at break of dawn, to-day, the Father of this City suddenly descended from heaven and appeared to me.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst, thrilled with awe, I stood rapt before him in deepest reverence, praying that I might be pardoned for gazing upon him, <q direct="unspecified">Go,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">tell the Romans that it is the will of heaven that my <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> should be the head of all the world. Let them henceforth cultivate the arts of war, and let them know assuredly, and hand down the knowledge to posterity, that no human might can withstand the arms of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</q></q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is marvellous what credit was given to this man's story, and how the grief of the people and the army was soothed by the belief which had been created in the immortality of Romulus.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Disputes<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Disputes as to his Successor.</note> arose among the senators about the vacant throne. It was not the jealousies of individual citizens, for no one was sufficiently prominent in so young a State, but the rivalries of parties in the State that led to this strife.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> families were apprehensive of losing their fair share of the sovereign power, because after the death of Tatius they had had no representative on the throne; they were anxious, therefore, that the king should be elected from amongst them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The ancient Romans could ill brook a foreign king; but amidst this diversity of political views, all were for a monarchy; they had not yet tasted the sweets of liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senators began to grow apprehensive of some aggressive act on the part of the surrounding states, now that the City was without a central authority and the army without a general. They decided that there must be some head of the State, but no one could make up his mind to concede the dignity to any one else.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The matter was settled by the hundred senators dividing them-selves into ten <q direct="unspecified">decuries,</q> and one was chosen from each decury to exercise the supreme power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Ten therefore were in office, but only one at a time had the insignia of authority and the lictors. Their individual authority was restricted to five days, and they exercised it in rotation. This break in the monarchy lasted for a year, and it was called by the name it still bears &mdash;that of <q direct="unspecified">interregnum.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After a time the plebs began to murmur that their bondage was multiplied, for they had a hundred masters instead of one. It was evident that they would insist upon a king being elected, and elected by them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the senators became aware of this growing determination, they thought it better to offer spontaneously what they were bound to part with, so, as an act of grace, they committed the supreme power into the hands of the people, but in such a way that they did not give away more privilege than they retained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For they passed a decree that when the people had chosen a king, his election would only be valid after the senate had ratified it by their authority. The same procedure exists to-day in the passing of laws and the election of magistrates, but the power of rejection has been withdrawn; the senate give their ratification before the people proceed to vote, whilst the result of the election is still uncertain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>At that time the <q direct="unspecified">interrex</q> convened the assembly and addressed it as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Quirites! elect your king, and may heaven's blessing rest on your labours! If you elect one who shall be counted worthy to follow Romulus, the senate will ratify your choice.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So gratified were the people at the proposal that, not to appear behindhand in generosity, they passed a resolution that it should be left to the senate to decree who should reign in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Numa Pompilius elected King.</note> was living, in those days, at Cures, a <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> city, a man of renowned justice and piety-Numa Pompilius. He was as conversant as any one in that age could be with all divine and human law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His master is given as Pythagoras of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, as tradition speaks of no other. But this is erroneous, for it is generally agreed that it was more than a century later, in the reign of Servius Tullius, that Pythagoras gathered round him crowds of eager students, in the most distant part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="perseus,Metapontum">Metapontum</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7004291">Crotona</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now, even if he had been contemporary with Numa, how could his reputation have reached the Sabines? From what places, and in what common language could he have induced any one to become his disciple? Who could have guaranteed the safety of a solitary individual travelling through so many nations differing in speech and character?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I believe rather that Numa's virtues were the result of his native temperament and self-training, moulded not so much by foreign influences as by the rigorous and austere discipline of the ancient Sabines, which was the purest type of any that existed in the old days.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When Numa's name was mentioned, though the Roman senators saw that the balance of power would be on the side of the Sabines if the king were chosen from amongst them, still no one ventured to propose a partisan of his own, or any senator, or citizen in preference to him. Accordingly they all to a man decreed that the crown should be offered to Numa Pompilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was invited to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and following the precedent set by Romulus, when he obtained his crown through the augury which sanctioned the founding of the City, Numa ordered that in his case also the gods should be consulted. He was solemnly conducted by an augur, who was afterwards honoured by being made a State functionary for life, to the Citadel, and took his seat on a stone facing south.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The augur seated himself on his left hand, with his head covered, and holding in his right hand a curved staff without any knots, which they called a <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">lituus</foreign>.</q> After surveying the prospect over the City and surrounding country, he offered prayers and marked out the heavenly regions by an imaginary line from east to west; the southern he defined as <q direct="unspecified">the right hand,</q> the northern as <q direct="unspecified">the left hand.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then fixed upon an object, as far as he could see, as a corresponding mark, and then transferring the lituus to his left hand, he laid his right upon Numa's head and offered this prayer:
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <q direct="unspecified">Father <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, if it be heaven's will that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I hold, should be king of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, do thou signify it to us by sure signs within those boundaries which I have traced.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then he described in the usual formula the augury which he desired should be sent. They were sent, and Numa being by them manifested to be king, came down from the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">templum</foreign>.</q><note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">templum</foreign> &mdash;In taking auspices, the augur or magistrate marked out a rectangular space by noting certain objects, trees or what not, within which the desired signs were to appear, and tracing a corresponding area mentally in the sky. The spot where he took his station, the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">auguraculum</foreign></q>, was also a small rectangular space; each of these was called a <q direct="unspecified">templum.</q> All important magisterial acts were preceded by auspices, and the word <q direct="unspecified">templum</q> was extended to denote the position occupied by the magistrate, such as the senate-house, the platform from which the Assembly was addressed, etc.</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Numa's Religious Institutions.</note> in this way obtained the crown, Numa prepared to found as it were anew by laws and customs that City which had so recently been founded by force of arms He saw that this was impossible whilst a state of war lasted, for war brutalised men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thinking that the ferocity of his subjects might be mitigated by the disuse of arms, he built the temple of Janus at the foot of the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> as an index of peace and war, to signify when it was open that the State was under arms, and when it was shut that all the surrounding nations were at peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Twice since Numa's reign has it been shut, once after the first Punic war in the consulship of T. Manlius, the second time, which heaven has allowed our generation to witness, after the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>, when peace on land and sea was secured by the emperor Caesar Augustus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After forming treaties of alliance with all his neighbours and closing the temple of Janus, Numa turned his attention to domestic matters. The removal of all danger from without would induce his subjects to luxuriate in idleness, as they would be no longer restrained by the fear of an enemy or by military discipline. To prevent this, he strove to inculcate in their minds the fear of the gods, regarding this as the most powerful influence which could act upon an uncivilised and, in those ages, a barbarous people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But, as this would fail to make a deep impression without some claim to supernatural wisdom, he pretended that he had nocturnal interviews with the nymph Egeria: that it was on her advice that he was instituting the ritual most acceptable to the gods and appointing for each deity his own special priests.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>First of all he divided the year into twelve months, corresponding to the moon's revolutions. But as the moon does not complete thirty days in each month, and so there are fewer days in the lunar year than in that measured by the course of the sun, he interpolated intercalary months and so arranged them that every twentieth year the days should coincide with the same position of the sun as when they started, the whole twenty years being thus complete.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He also established a distinction between the days on which legal business could be transacted and those on which it could not, because it would sometimes be advisable that there should be no business transacted with the people.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next he turned his attention to the appointment of priests. He himself, however, conducted a great many religious services, especially those which belong to the Flamen of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">Flamen</foreign>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;Lit. <q direct="unspecified">the kindler,</q> his duty being to supervise the ceremonies connected with the burnt sacrifices.</note> But he thought that in a warlike state there would be more kings of the type of Romulus than of Numa who would take the field in person. To guard, therefore, against the sacrificial rites which the king performed being interrupted, he appointed a Flamen as perpetual priest to <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, and ordered that he should wear a distinctive dress and sit in the royal curule chair. He appointed two additional Flamens, one for Mars, the other for Quirinus, and also chose virgins as priestesses to
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Vesta. This order of priestesses came into existence originally in Alba and was connected with the race of the founder. He assigned them a public stipend that they might give their whole time to the temple, and made their persons sacred and inviolable by a vow of chastity and other religious
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> sanctions. Similarly he chose twelve <q direct="unspecified">Salii</q> for Mars Gradivus, and assigned to them the distinctive dress of an embroidered tunic and over it a brazen cuirass. They were instructed to march in solemn procession through the City, carrying the twelve shields called the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">Ancilia</foreign>,</q> and singing hymns accompanied by a solemn dance in triple time.</p> <p>The next office to be filled was that of the Pontifex
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Maximus. Numa appointed the son of Marcus, one of the senators &mdash;Numa Marcius &mdash;and all the regulations bearing on religion, written out and sealed, were placed in his charge. Here was laid down with what victims, on what days, and at what temples the various sacrifices were to be offered, and from what sources the expenses connected with them were to be
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> defrayed. He placed all other sacred functions, both public and private, under the supervision of the Pontifex, in order that there might be an authority for the people to consult, and so all trouble and confusion arising through foreign rites being adopted and their ancestral ones neglected might be
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> avoided. Nor were his functions confined to directing the worship of the celestial gods; he was to instruct the people how to conduct funerals and appease the spirits of the departed, and what prodigies sent by lightning or in any other way were to be attended to and expiated. To elicit these signs of the divine will, he dedicated an altar to Jupiter Elicius on the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>, and consulted the god through auguries, as to which prodigies were to receive attention.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The deliberations and arrangements which these matters involved diverted the people from all thoughts of war and provided them with ample occupation. The watchful care of the gods, manifesting itself in the providential guidance of human affairs, had kindled in all hearts such a feeling of piety that the sacredness of promises and the sanctity of oaths were a controlling force for the community scarcely less effective than the fear inspired by laws and penalties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And whilst his subjects were moulding their characters upon the unique example of their king, the neighbouring nations, who had hitherto believed that it was a fortified camp and not a city that was placed amongst them to vex the peace of all, were now induced to respect them so highly that they thought it sinful to injure a State so entirely devoted to the service of the gods.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There was a grove through the midst of which a perennial stream flowed, issuing from a dark cave. Here Numa frequently retired unattended as if to meet the goddess, and he consecrated the grove to the Camaenae, because it was there that their meetings with his wife Egeria took place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He also instituted a yearly sacrifice to the goddess Fides and ordered that the Flamens should ride to her temple in a hooded chariot, and should perform the service with their hands covered as far as the fingers, to signify that Faith must be sheltered and that her seat is holy even when it is in men's right hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were many other sacrifices appointed by him and places dedicated for their performance which the pontiffs call the Argei. The greatest of all his works was the preservation of peace and the security of his realm throughout the whole of his reign.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Thus by two successive kings the greatness of the State was advanced; by each in a different way, by the one through war, by the other through peace. Romulus reigned thirty-seven years, Numa forty-three. The State was strong and disciplined by the lessons of war and the arts of peace.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Tullus Hostilius and the War with Alba.</note> death of Numa was followed by a second interregnum. Then Tullus Hostilius, a grandson of the Hostilius who had fought so brilliantly at the foot of the Citadel against the Sabines, was chosen king by the people, and their choice was confirmed by the Senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was not only unlike the last king, but he was a man of more warlike spirit even than Romulus, and his ambition was kindled by his own youthful energy and by the glorious achievements of his grandfather.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Convinced that the vigour of the State was becoming enfeebled through inaction, he looked all round for a pretext for getting up a war.</p> <p>It so happened that Roman peasants were at that time in the habit of carrying off plunder from the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> territory, and the Albans from Roman territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Gaius Cluilius was at the time ruling in Alba. Both parties sent envoys almost simultaneously to seek redress. Tullus had told his ambassadors to lose no time in carrying out their instructions; he was fully aware that the Albans would refuse satisfaction, and so a just ground would exist for proclaiming war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> envoys proceeded in a more leisurely fashion. Tullus received them with all courtesy and entertained them sumptuously. Meantime the Romans had preferred their demands, and on the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> governor's refusal had declared that war would begin in thirty days.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When this was reported to Tullus, he granted the Albans an audience in which they were to state the object of their coming. Ignorant of all that had happened, they wasted time in explaining that it was with great reluctance that they would say anything which might displease Tullus, but they were bound by their instructions; they were come to demand redress, and if that were refused they were ordered to declare war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <q direct="unspecified">Tell your king,</q> replied Tullus, <q direct="unspecified">that the king of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> calls the gods to witness that whichever nation is the first to dismiss with ignominy the envoys who came to seek redress, upon that nation they will visit all the sufferings of this war.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Albans reported this at home. Both sides made extraordinary preparations for a war, which closely resembled a civil war between parents and children, for both were of Trojan descent, since <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName> was an offshoot of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and Alba of <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName>, and the Romans were sprung from the stock of the kings of Alba.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The outcome of the war, however, made the conflict less deplorable, as there was no regular engagement, and though one of the two cities was destroyed, the two nations were blended into one.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Albans were the first to move, and invaded the Roman territory with an immense army. They fixed their camp only five miles from the City and surrounded it with a moat; this was called for several centuries the <q direct="unspecified">Cluilian Dyke</q> from the name of the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> general, till through lapse of time the name and the thing itself disappeared.</p> <p>While they were encamped Cluilius, the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> king, died, and the Albans made Mettius Fufetius dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king's death made Tullus more sanguine than ever of success. He gave out that the wrath of heaven which had fallen first of all on the head of the nation would visit the whole race of Alba with condign punishment for this unholy war. Passing the enemy's camp by a night march, he advanced upon <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> territory. This drew Mettius from his entrenchments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He marched as close to his enemy as he could, and then sent on an officer to inform Tullus that before engaging it was necessary that they should have a conference. If he granted one, then he was satisfied that the matters he would lay before him were such as concerned <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> no less than Alba. Tullus did not reject the proposal, but in case the conference should prove illusory, he led out his men in order of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Albans did the same. After they had halted, confronting each other, the two commanders, with a small escort of superior officers, advanced between the lines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> general, addressing Tullus, said: <q direct="unspecified">I think I have heard our king Cluilius say that acts of robbery and the non-restitution of plundered property, in violation of the existing treaty, were the cause of this war, and I have no doubt that you, Tullus, allege the same pretext. But if we are to say what is true, rather than what is plausible, we must admit that it is the lust of empire which has made two kindred and neighbouring peoples take up arms.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whether rightly or wrongly I do not judge; let him who began the war settle that point; I am simply placed in command by the Albans to conduct the war. But I want to give you a warning, Tullus. You know, you especially who are nearer to them, the greatness of the Etruscan State, which hems us both in; their immense strength by land, still more by sea.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Now remember, when once you have given the signal to engage, our two armies will fight under their eyes, so that when we are wearied and exhausted they may attack us both, victor and vanquished alike. If then, not content with the secure freedom we now enjoy, we are determined to enter into a game of chance, where the stakes are either supremacy or slavery, let us, in heaven's name, choose some method by which, without great suffering or bloodshed on either side, it can be decided which nation, is to be master of the other.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Although, from natural temperament, and the certainty he felt of victory, Tullus was eager to fight, he did not disapprove of the proposal. After much consideration on both sides a method was adopted, for which Fortune herself provided the necessary means.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Combat of the Horatii and Curiatii.</note> happened to be in each of the armies a triplet of brothers, fairly matched in years and strength. It is generally agreed that they were called Horatii and Curiatii. Few incidents in antiquity have been more widely celebrated, yet in spite of its celebrity there is a discrepancy in the accounts as to which nation each belonged. There are authorities on both sides, but I find that the majority give the name of Horatii to the Romans, and my sympathies lead me to follow them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The kings suggested to them that they should each fight on behalf of their country, and where victory rested, there should be the sovereignty. They raised no objection; so the time and place were fixed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But before they engaged a treaty was concluded between the Romans and the Albans, providing that the nation whose representatives proved victorious should receive the peaceable submission of the other.</p> <p>This is the earliest treaty recorded, and as all treaties, however different the conditions they contain, are concluded with the same forms, I will describe the forms with which this one was concluded as handed down by tradition.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Fetial put the formal question to Tullus: <q direct="unspecified">Do you, King, order me to make a treaty with the <foreign lang="la">Pater Patratus</foreign> of the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> nation?</q> On the king replying in the affirmative, the Fetial said: <q direct="unspecified">I demand of thee, King, some tufts of grass.</q> The king replied: <q direct="unspecified">Take those that are pure.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Fetial brought pure grass from the Citadel. Then he asked the king: <q direct="unspecified">Do you constitute me the plenipotentiary of the People of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the Quirites, sanctioning also my vessels and comrades?</q> To which the king replied: <q direct="unspecified">So far as may be without hurt to myself and the People of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the Quirites, I do.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Fetial was M. Valerius. He made Spurius Furius the Pater Patratus by touching his head and hair with the grass. Then the Pater Patratus, who is constituted for the purpose of giving the treaty the religious sanction of an oath, did so by a long formula in verse, which it is not worth while to quote.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After reciting the conditions he said: <q direct="unspecified">Hear, 0 <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, hear! thou Pater Patratus of the people of Alba! Hear ye, too, people of Alba! As these conditions have been publicly rehearsed from first to last, from these tablets, in perfect good faith, and inasmuch as they have here and now been most clearly understood, so these conditions the People of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> will not be the first to go back from.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If they shall, in their national council, with false and malicious intent be the first to go back, then do thou, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, on that day, so smite the People of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, even as I here and now shall smite this swine, and smite them so much the more heavily, as thou art greater in power and might.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With these words he struck the swine with a flint. In similar wise the Albans recited their oath and formularies through their own dictator and their priests.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the conclusion of the treaty the six combatants armed themselves. They were greeted with shouts of encouragement from their comrades, who reminded them that their fathers' gods, their fatherland, their fathers, every fellow-citizen, every fellowsoldier, were now watching their weapons and the hands that wielded them. Eager for the contest and inspired by the voices round them, they advanced into the open space between the opposing lines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The two armies were sitting in front of their respective camps, relieved from personal danger but not from anxiety, since upon the fortunes and courage of this little group hung the issue of dominion. Watchful and nervous, they gaze with feverish intensity on a spectacle by no means entertaining.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The signal was given, and with uplifted swords the six youths charged like a battle-line with the courage of a mighty host. Not one of them thought of his own danger; their sole thought was for their country, whether it would be supreme or subject, their one anxiety that they were deciding its future fortunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When, at the first encounter, the flashing swords rang on their opponents shields a deep shudder ran through the spectators, then a breathless silence followed as neither side seemed to be gaining any advantage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Soon, however, they saw something more than the swift movements of limbs and the rapid play of sword and shield: blood became visible flowing from open wounds. Two of the Romans fell one on the other, breathing out their life, whilst all the three Albans were wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The fall of the Romans was welcomed with a burst of exultation from the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> army; whilst the Roman legions, who had lost all hope, but not all anxiety, trembled for their solitary champion surrounded by the three Curiatii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It chanced that he was untouched, and though not a match for the three together, he was confident of victory against each separately. So, that he might encounter each singly, he took to flight, assuming that they would follow as well as their wounds would allow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had run some distance from the spot where the combat began, when, on looking back, he saw them following at long intervals from each other, the foremost not far from him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He turned and made a desperate attack upon him, and whilst the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> army were shouting to the other Curiatii to come to their brother's assistance, Horatius had already slain his foe and, flushed with victory, was awaiting the second encounter. Then the Romans cheered their champion with a shout such as men raise when hope succeeds to despair, and he hastened to bring the fight to a close.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Before the third, who was not far away, could come up, he despatched the second Curiatius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The survivors were now equal in point of numbers, but far from equal in either confidence or strength. The one, unscathed after his double victory, was eager for the third contest; the other, dragging himself wearily along, exhausted by his wounds and by his running, vanquished already by the previous slaughter of his brothers, was an easy conquest to his victorious foe. There was, in fact, no fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Roman cried exultingly: <q direct="unspecified">Two have I sacrificed to appease my brothers' shades; the third I will offer for the issue of this fight, that the Roman may rule the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName>.</q> He thrust his sword downward into the neck of his opponent, who could no longer lift his shield, and then despoiled him as he lay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Horatius was welcomed by the Romans with shouts of triumph, all the more joyous for the fears they had felt. Both sides turned their attention to burying their dead champions, but with very different feelings, the one rejoicing in wider dominion, the other deprived of their liberty and under alien rule.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The tombs stand on the spots where each fell; those of the Romans close together, in the direction of Alba; the three <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> tombs, at intervals, in the direction of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the armies separated, Mettius inquired what commands he was to receive in accordance with the terms of the treaty. Tullus ordered him to keep the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> soldiery under arms, as he would require their services if there were war with the Veientines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Both armies then withdrew to their homes. <note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed"><p>Horatius' Murder of his Sister.</p></note> Horatius was marching at the head of the Roman army, carrying in front of him his triple spoils. His sister, who had been betrothed to one of the Curiatii, met him outside the Capene gate. She recognised on her brother's shoulders the cloak of her betrothed, which she had made with her own hands; and bursting into tears she tore her hair and called her dead lover by
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> name. The triumphant soldier was so enraged by his sister's outburst of grief in the midst of his own triumph and the public rejoicing that he drew his sword and stabbed the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> girl. <q direct="unspecified">Go,</q> he cried, in bitter reproach, <q direct="unspecified">go to your betrothed with your ill-timed love, forgetful as you are of your dead brothers, of the one who still lives and of your
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> country! So perish every Roman woman who mourns for an enemy!</q> The deed horrified patricians and plebeians alike; but his recent services were a set-off to it. He was brought before the king for trial. To avoid responsibility for passing a harsh sentence, which would be repugnant to the populace, and then carrying it into execution, the king summoned an assembly of the people, and said: <q direct="unspecified">I appoint two duumvirs to judge the treason of Horatius according to
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> law.</q> The dreadful language of the law was: <q direct="unspecified">The duumvirs shall judge cases of treason; if the accused appeal from the duumvirs the appeal shall be heard; if their sentence be confirmed the lictor shall hang him by a rope on the fatal tree and shall scourge him either within or without the

As the City grew so the <foreign lang="la">pomoerium</foreign> was extended. Here it is equivalent to the limits of the City (see Livy's account in chap. xliv.).</note> The duumvirs appointed under this law did not think that by its provisions they had the power to acquit even an innocent person. Accordingly they condemned him; then one of them said <q direct="unspecified">Publius Horatius, I pronounce you guilty
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> of treason. Lictor, bind his hands.</q> The lictor had approached and was fastening the cord, when Horatius, at the suggestion of Tullus, who placed a merciful interpretation on the law, said
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <q direct="unspecified">I appeal.</q> The appeal was accordingly brought before the people.</p> <p>Their decision was mainly influenced by Publius Horatius the father, who declared that his daughter had been justly slain , had it not been so, he would have exerted his authority as a father in punishing his son. Then he implored them not to bereave of all his children the man whom they had so lately seen surrounded with such
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> noble offspring. Whilst saying this he embraced his son, and then, pointing to the spoils of the Curiatii suspended on the spot now called the <foreign lang="la">Pila Horatia</foreign>, he said: <q direct="unspecified">Can you bear, Quirites, to see bound scourged, and tortured beneath the gallows the man whom you saw, lately, coming in triumph adorned with his foemen's spoils? Why, the Albans themselves could not bear the sight of such a
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> hideous spectacle. Go, lictor, bind those hands which when armed but a little time ago won dominion for the Roman people. Go, cover the head of the liberator of this City! Hang him on the fatal tree, scourge him within the <foreign lang="la">pomoerium</foreign> if only it be amongst the trophies of his foes or without if only it be amongst the tombs of the Curiatii! To what place can you take this youth where the monuments of his splendid exploits will not vindicate him from such a
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> shameful punishment?</q> The father's tears and the young soldier's courage ready to meet every peril were too much for the people. They acquitted him because they admired his bravery rather than because they regarded his cause as a just one. But since a murder in broad daylight demanded some expiation, the father was commanded to make an atonement for his son at the cost of
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> the State. After offering certain expiatory sacrifices he erected a beam across the street and made the young man pass under it, as under a yoke, with his head covered. This beam exists to-day, having always been kept in repair by the State: it is called <q direct="unspecified">The
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Sister's Beam.</q> A tomb of hewn stone was constructed for Horatia on the spot where she was murdered.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Treachery of Mettius Fufetius.</note> the peace with Alba was not a lasting one. The <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> dictator had incurred general odium through having entrusted the fortunes of the State to three soldiers, and this had an evil effect upon his weak character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As straightforward counsels had turned out so unfortunate, he tried to recover the popular favour by resorting to crooked ones, and as he had previously made peace his aim in war , so now he sought the occasion of war in peace. He recognised that his State possessed more courage than strength, he therefore incited other nations to declare war openly and formally, whilst he kept for his own people an opening for treachery under the mask of an alliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The people of Fidenae, where a Roman colony existed, were induced to go to war by a compact on the part of the Albans to desert to them; the Veientines were taken into the plot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When Fidenae had broken out into open revolt, Tullus summoned Mettius and his army from Alba and marched against the enemy. After crossing the Anio he encamped at the junction of that river with the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The army of the Veientines had crossed the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> at a spot between his camp and Fidenae. In the battle they formed the right wing near the river, the Fidenates were on the left nearer the mountains. Tullus formed his troops in front of the Veientines, and stationed the Albans against the legion of the Fidenates. The <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> general showed as little courage as fidelity; afraid either to keep his ground or to openly desert, he drew away gradually towards the mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he thought he had retired far enough, he halted his entire army, and still irresolute, he began to form his men for attack, by way of gaining time, intending to throw his strength on the winning side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those Romans who had been stationed next to the Albans were astounded to find that their allies had withdrawn and left their flank exposed, when a horseman rode up at full speed and reported to the king that the Albans were leaving the field. In this critical situation, Tullus vowed to found a college of twelve Salii and to build temples to Pallor and Pavor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, reprimanding the horseman loud enough for the enemy to hear, he ordered him to rejoin the fighting line, adding that there was no occasion for alarm, as it was by his orders that the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> army was making a circuit that they might fall on the unprotected rear of the Fidenates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At the same time he ordered the cavalry to raise their spears; this action hid the retreating <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> army from a large part of the Roman infantry. Those who had seen them, thinking that what the king had said was actually the case, fought all the more keenly. It was now the enemies' turn to be alarmed; they had heard clearly the words of the king, and, moreover, a large part of the Fidenates who had formerly joined the Roman colonists understood Latin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Fearing to be cut off from their town by a sudden charge of the Albans from the hills, they retreated. Tullus pressed the attack, and after routing the Fidenates, returned to attack the Veientines with greater confidence, as they were already demoralized by the panic of their allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They did not wait for the charge , but their flight was checked by the river in their rear. When they reached it, some, flinging away their arms, rushed blindly into the water, others, hesitating whether to fight or fly, were overtaken and slain. Never had the Romans fought in a bloodier battle.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> army, who had been watching the fight, marched down into the plain. Mettius congratulated Tullus on his victory, Tullus replied in a friendly tone, and as a mark of goodwill, ordered the Albans to form their camp contiguous to that of the Romans, and made preparations for a <q direct="unspecified">lustral sacrifice</q><note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed"><emph>lustral sacrifices</emph> &mdash;These were offered on behalf of the whole army to the war-god Mars, the victims being a boar, a ram, and a bull. See also note 3, book III.</note> on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> morrow. As soon as it was light, and all the preparations were made, he gave the customary order for both armies to muster on
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> parade. The heralds began at the furthest part of the camp, where the Albans were, and summoned them first of all; they, attracted by the novelty of hearing the Roman addressing his troops, took up their position close round
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> him. Secret instructions had been given for the Roman legion to stand fully armed behind them, and the centurions were in readiness to execute instantly the orders they received.</p> <p>Tullus commenced as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Romans! if in any war that you have ever waged there has been reason for you to thank, first, the immortal gods, and then your own personal courage, such was certainly the case in yesterday's
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> battle. For whilst you had to contend with an open enemy, you had a still more serious and dangerous conflict to maintain against the treachery and perfidy of your allies. For I must undeceive you-it was by no command of mine that the Albans withdrew to the mountains. What you heard was not a real order but a pretended one, which I used as an artifice to prevent your knowing that you were deserted, and so losing heart for the battle, and also to fill the enemy with alarm and a desire to flee by making them think that they were being
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> surrounded. The guilt which I am denouncing does not involve all the Albans; they only followed their general, just as you would have done had I wanted to lead my army away from the field. It is Mettius who is the leader of this march, Mettius who engineered this war, Mettius who broke the treaty between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Alba. Others may venture on similar practices, if I do not make this man a signal lesson to all the world.</q> The armed centurions closed round Mettius, and the king proceeded: <q direct="unspecified">I shall take a course which will bring good fortune and happiness to the Roman people and myself, and to you, Albans; it is my intention to transfer the entire <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> population to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to give the rights of citizenship to the plebeians, and enrol the nobles in the senate, and to make one City, one
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> State. As formerly the <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> State was broken up into two nations, so now let it once more become one,</q> The Alban soldiery listened to these words with conflicting feelings, but unarmed as they were and hemmed in by armed men, a common fear kept them
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> silent. Then Tullus said: <q direct="unspecified">Mettius Fufetius! if you could have learnt to keep your word and respect treaties, I would have given you that instruction in your lifetime, but now, since your character is past cure, do at least teach mankind by your punishment to hold those things as sacred which have been outraged by you. As yesterday your interest was divided between the Fidenates and the Romans, so now you shall give up your body to be divided and
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> dismembered.</q> Thereupon two four-horse chariots were brought up, and Mettius was bound at full length to each, the horses were driven in opposite directions, carrying off parts of the body in each chariot, where the limbs had been secured by the
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> cords. All present averted their eyes from the horrible spectacle. This is the first and last instance amongst the Romans of a punishment so regardless of humanity. Amongst other things which are the glory of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is this, that no nation has ever been contented with milder punishments.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Destruction of Alba.</note> the cavalry had been sent on in advance to conduct the population to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; they were followed by the legions, who were marched thither to destroy the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they entered the gates there was not that noise and panic which are usually found in captured cities, where, after the gates have been shattered or the walls levelled by the battering-ram or the citadel stormed, the shouts of the enemy and the rushing of the soldiers through the streets throw everything into universal confusion with fire and sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here, on the contrary, gloomy silence and a grief beyond words so petrified the minds of all, that, forgetting in their terror what to leave behind, what to take with them, incapable of thinking for themselves and asking one another's advice, at one moment they would stand on their thresholds, at another wander aimlessly through their houses, which they were seeing then for the last time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But now they were roused by the shouts of the cavalry ordering their instant departure, now by the crash of the houses undergoing demolition, heard in the furthest corners of the city, and the dust, rising in different places, which covered everything like a cloud. Seizing hastily what they could carry, they went out of the city, and left behind their hearths and household gods and the homes in which they had been born and brought up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Soon an unbroken line of emigrants filled the streets, and as they recognised one another the sense of their common misery led to fresh outbursts of tears. Cries of grief, especially from the women, began to make themselves heard, as they walked past the venerable temples and saw them occupied by troops, and felt that they were leaving their gods as prisoners in an enemy's hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the Albans had left their city the Romans levelled to the ground all the public and private edifices in every direction, and a single hour gave over to destruction and ruin the work of those four centuries during which Alba had stood. The temples of the gods, however, were spared, in accordance with the king's proclamation.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Union of the two Peoples.</note> fall of Alba led to the growth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The number of the citizens was doubled, the Caelian hill was included in the city, and that it might become more populated, Tullus chose it for the site of his palace, and for the future lived there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He nominated <placeName key="tgn,1031727">Alban</placeName> nobles to the senate that this order of the State might also be augmented, amongst them were the Tullii, the Servilii, the Quinctii, the Geganii, the Curiatii, and the Cloelii. To provide a consecrated building for the increased number of senators he built the senate-house, which down to the time of our fathers went by the name of the Curia Hostilia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To secure an accession of military strength of all ranks from the new population, he formed ten troops of knights from the Albans; from the same source he brought up the old legions to their full strength and enrolled new ones.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Impelled<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Sabines.</note> by the confidence in his strength which these measures inspired, Tullus proclaimed war against the Sabines, a nation at that time second only to the Etruscans in numbers and military strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Each side had inflicted injuries on the other and refused all redress. Tullus complained that Roman traders had been arrested in open market at the shrine of Feronia; the Sabines' grievance was that some of their people had previously sought refuge in the Asylum and been kept in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These were the ostensible grounds of the war. The Sabines were far from forgetting that a portion of their strength had been transferred to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by Tatius, and that the Roman State had lately been aggrandised by the inclusion of the population of Alba; they, therefore , on their side began to look round for outside help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Their nearest neighbour was Etruria, and, of the Etruscans, the nearest to them were the Veientines. Their past defeats were still rankling in their memories, and the Sabines, urging them to revolt, attracted many volunteers; others of the poorest and homeless classes were paid to join them. No assistance was given by the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With the Veientes-it is not so surprising that the other cities rendered no assistance &mdash;the truce with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was still held to be binding.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whilst preparations were being made on both sides with the utmost energy, and it seemed as though success depended upon which side was the first to take the offensive, Tullus opened the campaign by invading the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory. A severe action was fought at the Silva Malitiosa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Whilst the Romans were strong in their infantry, their main strength was in their lately increased cavalry force. A sudden charge of horse threw the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> ranks into confusion, they could neither offer a steady resistance nor effect their flight without great slaughter.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Last Years and Death of Tullus.</note> victory threw great lustre upon the reign of Tullus, and upon the whole State and added considerably to its strength. At this time it was reported to the king and the senate that there had been a shower of stones on the Alban Mount.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As the thing seemed hardly credible, men were sent to inspect the prodigy, and whilst they were watching, a heavy shower of stones fell from the sky, just like hailstones heaped together by the wind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They fancied, too, that they heard a very loud voice from the grove on the summit bidding the Albans celebrate their sacred rites after the manner of their fathers. These solemnities they had consigned to oblivion, as though they had abandoned their gods when they abandoned their country and had either adopted Roman rites or, as sometimes happens, embittered against Fortune, had given up the service of the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In consequence of this prodigy, the Romans, too, kept up a public religious observance for nine days, either &mdash;as tradition asserts &mdash;owing to the voice from the Alban Mount, or because of the warning of the soothsayers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In either case, however, it became permanently established whenever the same prodigy was reported; a nine days' solemnity was observed.</p> <p>Not long after a pestilence caused great distress, and made men indisposed for the hardships of military service. The warlike king, however, allowed no respite from arms; he thought, too, that it was more healthy for the soldiery in the field than at home.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At last he himself was seized with a lingering illness, and that fierce and restless spirit became so broken through bodily weakness, that he who had once thought nothing less fitting for a king than devotion to sacred things, now suddenly became a prey to every sort of religious terror, and filled the City with religious observances.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was a general desire to recall the condition of things which existed under <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>, for men felt that the only help that was left against sickness was to obtain the forgiveness of the gods and be at peace with heaven.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Tradition records that the king, whilst examining the commentaries of <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>, found there a description of certain secret sacrificial rites paid to <placeName key="tgn,2483975">Jupiter</placeName> Elicius: he withdrew into privacy whilst occupied with these rites, but their performance was marred by omissions or mistakes. Not only was no sign from heaven vouchsafed to him, but the anger of Jupiter was roused by the false worship rendered to him, and he burnt up the king and his house by a stroke of lightning.</p> <p>Tullus had achieved great renown in war, and reigned for two-and-thirty years.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Election of Ancus Martius.</note> the death of Tullus, the government in accordance with the original constitution, again devolved on the senate. They appointed an interrex to conduct the election. The people chose Ancus Martius as king, the senate confirmed the choice. His mother was <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>'s daughter.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At the outset of his reign-remembering what made his grandfather glorious, and recognising that the late reign, so splendid in all other respects, had, on one side, been most unfortunate through the neglect of religion or the improper performance of its rites-he determined to go back to the earliest source and conduct the state offices of religion as they had been organised by <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>. He gave the Pontifex instructions to copy them out from the king's commentaries and set them forth in some public place. The neighbouring states and his own people, who were yearning for peace, were led to hope that the king would follow his grandfather in disposition and policy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Latins.</note> this state of affairs, the Latins, with whom a treaty had been made in the reign of Tullus, recovered their confidence, and made an incursion into Roman territory. On the Romans seeking redress, they gave a haughty refusal, thinking that the king of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> was going to pass his reign amongst chapels and altars, In the temperament of Ancus there was a touch of <placeName key="tgn,2053172">Romulus</placeName> as well as <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He realised that the great necessity of <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>'s reign was peace, especially amongst a young and aggressive nation, but he saw, too, that it would be difficult for him to preserve the peace which had fallen to his lot unimpaired. His patience was being put to the proof, and not only put to the proof but despised; the times demanded a Tullus rather than a <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>. <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName> had instituted religious observances for times of peace, he would hand down the ceremonies appropriate to a state of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In order, therefore, that wars might be not only conducted but also proclaimed with some formality, he wrote down the law, as taken from the ancient nation of the Aequicoli, under which the Fetials act down to this day when seeking redress for injuries. The procedure is as follows: &mdash;</p>

When he has reached the frontiers of the nation from whom satisfaction is demanded, he says, <q direct="unspecified">Hear, 0 <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>! Hear ye confines</q>-naming the particular nation whose they are &mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Hear, 0 Justice! I am the public herald of the Roman People rightly and duly authorised do I come; let confidence be placed in my words.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then he recites the terms of the demands and calls <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName> to witness: <q direct="unspecified">If I am demanding the surrender of those men or those goods, contrary to justice and religion, suffer me nevermore to enjoy my native land.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He repeats these words as he crosses the frontier, he repeats them to whoever happens to be the first person he meets, he repeats them as he enters the gates and again on entering the forum, with some slight changes in the wording of the formula.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If what he demands are not surrendered at the expiration of thirty-three days-for that is the fixed period of grace-he declares war in the following terms: <q direct="unspecified">Hear, 0 <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName>, and thou Janus Quirinus, and all ye heavenly gods, and ye, gods of earth and of the lower world, hear me!
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I call you to witness that this people</q> &mdash; mentioning it by name &mdash; <q direct="unspecified">is unjust and does not fulfill its sacred obligations. But about these matters we must consult the elders in our own land in what way we may obtain our rights.</q></p> <p>With these words the ambassador returned to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> for consultation.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The king forthwith consulted the senate in words to the following effect: <q direct="unspecified">Concerning the matters suits and causes, whereof the <foreign lang="la">Pater Patratus</foreign> of the Roman people and Quirites hath complained to the <foreign lang="la">Pater Patratus</foreign> of the <foreign lang="la">Prisci Latini</foreign>, and to the people of the <foreign lang="la">Prisci Latini</foreign> which matters they were bound severally to surrender, discharge, and make good, whereas they have done none of these things &mdash;say what is your opinion?</q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He whose opinion was first asked, replied, <q direct="unspecified">I am of opinion that they ought to be recovered by a just and righteous war, wherefore I give my consent and vote for it.</q> Then the others were asked in order, and when the majority of those present declared themselves of the same opinion, war was agreed upon.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It was customary for the Fetial to carry to the enemies' frontiers a blood-smeared spear tipped with iron or burnt at the end, and, in the presence of at least three adults, to say, <q direct="unspecified">Inasmuch as the peoples of the <foreign lang="la">Prisci Latini</foreign> have been guilty of wrong against the People of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> and the Quirites, and inasmuch as the People of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> and the Quirites have ordered that there be war with the <foreign lang="la">Prisci Latini</foreign>, and the Senate of the People of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> and the Quirites have determined and decreed that there shall be war with the <foreign lang="la">Prisci Latini</foreign>, therefore I and the People of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, declare and make war upon the peoples of the <foreign lang="la">Prisci Latini.</foreign></q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> With these words he hurled his spear into their territory. This was the way in which at that time satisfaction was demanded from the Latins and war declared, and posterity adopted the custom.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After handing over the care of the various sacrificial rites to the Flamens and other priests, and calling up a fresh army, Ancus advanced against Politorium, a city belonging to the Latins. He took it by assault, and following the custom of the earlier kings who had enlarged the State by receiving its enemies into Roman citizenship, he transferred the whole of the population to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName> had been settled by the earliest Romans, the Sabines had occupied the Capitoline hill with the Citadel, on one side of the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName>, and the Albans the Caelian hill, on the other, so the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> was assigned to the new-comers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Not long afterwards there was a further addition to the number of citizens through the capture of Tellenae and Ficana. Politorium after its evacuation was seized by the Latins and was again recovered; and this was the reason why the Romans razed the city, to prevent its being a perpetual refuge for the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At last the whole war was concentrated round Medullia, and fighting went on for some time there with doubtful result. The city was strongly fortified and its strength was increased by the presence of a large garrison. The Latin army was encamped in the open and had had several engagements with the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At last Ancus made a supreme effort with the whole of his force and won a pitched battle, after which he returned with immense booty to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, and many thousands of Latins were admitted into citizenship. In order to connect the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> with the <placeName key="tgn,2118187">Palatine</placeName>, the district round the altar of <foreign lang="la">Venus Murcia</foreign> was assigned to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Janiculum also was brought into the city boundaries, not because the space was wanted, but to prevent such a strong position from being occupied by an enemy. It was decided to connect this hill with the City, not only by carrying the City wall round it, but also by a bridge, for the convenience of traffic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This was the first bridge thrown over the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, and was known as the <foreign lang="la">Pons Sublicius</foreign>.<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">Pons Sublicius</foreign> &mdash;<q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,2064201">The Bridge</placeName> of Piles.</q> down to comparatively late times, no material but wood was allowed in its construction, probably to allow of its being cut down in case of an enemy attempting to force a passage. We see this in the story of Horatius Cocles (Book II. chap. x.).</note> The <foreign lang="la">Fossa Quiritium</foreign> also was the work of King Ancus and afforded no inconsiderable protection to the lower
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> and therefore more accessible parts of the City .Amidst this vast population now that the State had become so enormously increased, the sense of right and wrong was obscured, and secret crimes were committed. To overawe the growing lawlessness a prison was built in the heart of the City overlooking the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Forum.</p> <p>The additions made by this king were not confined to the City. The Mesian Forest was taken from the Veientines and the Roman dominion extended to the sea, at the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> the city of <placeName key="tgn,7007018">Ostia</placeName> was built, salt pits were constructed on both sides of the river, and the temple of Jupiter Feretrius was enlarged in consequence of the brilliant successes in the war.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Migration of the Tarquins to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note> the reign of Ancus a wealthy and ambitious man named Lucumo removed to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, mainly with the hope and desire of winning high distinction, for which no opportunity had existed in <placeName key="perseus,Tarquinii">Tarquinii</placeName>, since there also he was an alien He was the son of Demaratus a Corinthian, who had been driven from home by a revolution, and who happened to settle in <placeName key="perseus,Tarquinii">Tarquinii</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There he married and had two sons, their names were Lucumo and Arruns. Arruns died before his father, leaving his wife with child; Lucumo survived his father and inherited all his property. For Demaratus died shortly after Arruns, and being unaware of the condition of his daughter in law, had made no provision in his will for a grandchild.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The boy, thus excluded from any share of his grandfathers property was called in consequence of his poverty, Egerius. Lucumo, on the other hand, heir to all the property, became elated by his wealth and his ambition was stimulated by his marriage with Tanaquil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This woman was descended from one of the foremost families in the State and could not bear the thought of her position by marriage being inferior to the one she claimed by birth. The Etruscans looked down upon Lucumo as the son of a foreign refugee; she could not brook this indignity and, forgetting all ties of patriotism if only she could see her husband honoured, resolved to emigrate from <placeName key="perseus,Tarquinii">Tarquinii</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> seemed the most suitable place for her purpose. She felt that among a young nation where all nobility is a thing of recent growth and won by personal merit, there would be room for a man of courage and energy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> She remembered that the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> Tatius had reigned there, that Numa had been summoned from Cures to fill the throne, that Ancus himself was sprung from a Sabine mother, and could not trace his nobility beyond Numa. Her husband's ambition and the fact that <placeName key="tgn,7006776">Tarquinii</placeName> was his native country only on the mother's side, made him give a ready ear to her proposals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They accordingly packed up their goods and removed to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>They had got as far as the Janiculum when a hovering eagle swooped gently down and took off his cap as he was sitting by his wife's side in the carriage, then circling round the vehicle with loud cries, as though commissioned by heaven for this service, replaced it carefully upon his head and soared away. It is said that Tanaquil, who, like most Etruscans, was expert in interpreting celestial prodigies, was delighted at the omen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> She threw her arms round her husband and bade him look for a high and majestic destiny, for such was the import of the eagle's appearance, of the particular part of the sky where it appeared, and of the deity who sent it. The omen was directed to the crown and summit of his person, the bird had raised aloft an adornment put on by human hands, to replace it as the gift of heaven.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Full of these hopes and surmises they entered the City, and after procuring a domicile there, they announced his name as Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The fact of his being a stranger, and a wealthy one, brought him into notice, and he increased the advantage which Fortune gave him by his courteous demeanour, his lavish hospitality, and the many acts of kindness by which he won all whom it was in his power to win, until his reputation even reached the palace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Once introduced to the king's notice, he soon succeeded by adroit complaisance in getting on to such familiar terms that he was consulted in matters of state, as much as in private matters, whether they referred to either peace or war. At last, after passing every test of character and ability, he was actually appointed by the king's will guardian to his children.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Ancus<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Death of Ancus, Election of Tarquinius Priscus.</note> reigned twenty-four years, unsurpassed by any of his predecessors in ability and reputation, both in the field and at home. His sons had now almost reached manhood. Tarquin was all the more anxious for the election of the new king to be held as soon as possible. At the time fixed for it he sent the boys out of the way on a hunting expedition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He is said to have been the first who canvassed for the crown and delivered a set speech to secure the interest of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In it he asserted that he was not making an unheard-of request, he was not the first foreigner who aspired to the Roman throne; were this so, any one might feel surprise and indignation. But he was the third. Tatius was not only a foreigner, but was made king after he had been their enemy; <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName>, an entire stranger to the City, had been called to the throne without any seeking it on his part.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As to himself, as soon as he was his own master, he had removed to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> with his wife and his whole fortune; he had lived at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> for a larger part of the period during which men discharge the functions of citizenship than he had passed in his old country;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> he had learnt the laws of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, the ceremonial rites of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, both civil and military, under Ancus himself, a very sufficient teacher; he had been second to none in duty and service towards the king; he had not yielded to the king himself in generous treatment of others. Whilst he was stating these facts, which were certainly true, the Roman people with enthusiastic unanimity elected him king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Though in all other respects an excellent man, his ambition, which impelled him to seek the crown, followed him on to the throne; with the design of strengthening himself quite as much as of increasing the State, he made a hundred new senators. These were afterwards called <q direct="unspecified">the Lesser Houses</q> and formed a body of uncompromising supporters of the king, through whose kindness they had entered the senate.</p> <p><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Institution of the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">Ludi Romani</foreign>.</q></note>- The first war he engaged in was with the Latins.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He took the town of Apiolae by storm; and carried off a greater amount of plunder than could have been expected from the slight interest shown in the war. After this had been brought in wagons to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, he celebrated the Games with greater splendour and on a larger scale than his predecessors.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then for the first time a space was marked for what is now the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">Circus Maximus</foreign>.</q> Spots were allotted to the patricians and knights where they could each build for themselves stands-called <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">fori</foreign></q> &mdash;from which to view the Games.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These stands were raised on wooden props, branching out at the top, twelve feet high. The contests were horse-racing and boxing, the horses and boxers mostly brought from Etruria. They were at first celebrated on occasions of especial solemnity; subsequently they became an annual fixture, and were called indifferently the <q direct="unspecified">Roman</q> or the <q direct="unspecified">Great Games.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This king also divided the ground round the Forum into building sites; arcades and shops were put up.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Sabines-The Augur Attus Navius.</note> was also making preparations for surrounding the City with a stone wall when his designs were interrupted by a war with the Sabines. So sudden was the outbreak that the enemy were crossing the Anio before a Roman army could meet and stop them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was great alarm in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. The first battle was indecisive, and there was great slaughter on both sides. The enemies' return to their camp allowed time for the Romans to make preparations for a fresh campaign. Tarquin thought his army was weakest in cavalry and decided to double the centuries, which <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> had formed, of the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, and to distinguish them by his own name.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now as <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName> had acted under the sanction of the auspices, Attus Navius, a celebrated augur at that time, insisted that no change could be made, nothing new introduced, unless the birds gave a favourable omen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The king's anger was roused, and in mockery of the augur's skill he is reported to have said, <q direct="unspecified">Come, you diviner, find out by your augury whether what I am now contemplating can be done.</q> Attus, after consulting the omens, declared that it could. <q direct="unspecified">Well,</q> the king replied, <q direct="unspecified">I had it in my mind that you should cut a whetstone with a razor. Take these, and perform the feat which your birds portend can be done.</q> It is said that without the slightest hesitation he cut it through.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There used to be a statue of Attus, representing him with his head covered, in the Comitium, on the steps to the left of the senate-house, where the incident occurred. The whet-stone also, it is recorded, was placed there to be a memorial of the marvel for future generations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At all events, auguries and the college of augurs were held in such honour that nothing was undertaken in peace or war without their sanction; the assembly of the curies, the assembly of the centuries, matters of the highest importance, were suspended or broken up if the omen of the birds was unfavourable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even on that occasion Tarquin was deterred from making changes in the names or numbers of the centuries of knights; he merely doubled the number of men in each, so that the three centuries contained eighteen hundred men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those who were added to the centuries bore the same designation, only they were called the <q direct="unspecified">Second</q> knights, and the centuries being thus doubled are now called the <q direct="unspecified">Six Centuries.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Second Sabine War.</note> this division of the forces was augmented there was a second collision with the Sabines, in which the increased strength of the Roman army was aided by an artifice. Men were secretly sent to set fire to a vast quantity of logs lying on the banks of the Anio, and float them down the river on rafts. The wind fanned the flames, and as the logs drove against the piles and stuck there they set the bridge<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed">This must have been a bridge thrown across by the Sabines to secure their retreat.</note> on fire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This incident , occurring during the battle, created a panic among the Sabines and led to their rout, and at the same time prevented their flight; many after escaping from the enemy perished in the river. Their shields floated down the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> as far as the City, and being recognised, made it clear that there had been a victory almost before it could be announced.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In that battle the cavalry especially distinguished themselves. They were posted on each wing, and when the infantry in the centre were being forced back it is said that they made such a desperate charge from both sides that they not only arrested the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> legions as they were pressing on the retreating Romans, but immediately put them to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Sabines in wild disorder, made for the hills, a few gamed them, by far the greater number, as was stated above, were driven by the cavalry into the river. Tarquin determined to follow them up before they could recover from their panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He sent the prisoners and booty to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; the spoils of the enemy had been devoted to <placeName key="tgn,2094117">Vulcan</placeName>, they were accordingly collected into an enormous pile and burnt; then he proceeded forthwith to lead his army into the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In spite of their recent defeat and the hopelessness of repairing it, the Sabines met him with a hastily raised body of militia, as there was no time for concerting a plan of operations. They were again defeated, and as they were now brought to the verge of ruin, sought for peace.</p>

Then he made war on the Prisci Latini. No general engagement took place, he attacked each of their towns in succession and subjugated the whole nation. The towns of Corniculum, Old Ficulea, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, Nomentum, were all taken from the Prisci Latini or those who had gone over to them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then peace was made.</p> <p>Works<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Undertakings in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</note> of peace were now commenced with greater energy even than had been displayed in war, so that the people enjoyed no more quiet at home than they had had in the field.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He made preparations for completing the work, which had been interrupted by the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> war, of enclosing the City in those parts where no fortification yet existed with a stone wall. The low-lying parts of the City round the Forum, and the other valleys between the hills, where the water could not escape, were drained by conduits which emptied into the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He built up with masonry a level space on the Capitol as a site for the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName> which he had vowed during the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> war, and the magnitude of the work revealed his prophetic anticipation of the future greatness of the place.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Birth and Youth of Servius Tullius.</note> that time an incident took place as marvellous in the appearance as it proved in the result. It is said that whilst a boy named Servius Tullius was asleep, his head was enveloped in flames, before the eyes of many who were present.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The cry which broke out at such a marvellous sight aroused the royal family, and when one of the domestics was bringing water to quench the flames the queen stopped him, and after calming the excitement forbade the boy to be disturbed until he awoke of his own accord. Presently he did so, and the flames disappeared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Tanaquil took her husband aside and said to him, <q direct="unspecified">Do you see this boy, whom we are bringing up in such a humble style? You may be certain that he will one day be a light to us in trouble and perplexity, and a protection to our tottering house. Let us henceforth bring up with all care and indulgence one who will be the source of measureless glory to the State and to ourselves.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From this time the boy began to be treated as their child and trained in those accomplishments by which characters are stimulated to the pursuit of a great destiny. The task was an easy one, for it was carrying out the will of the gods. The youth turned out to be of a truly kingly disposition, and when search was made for a son-in-law to Tarquinius, none of the Roman youths could be compared with him in any respect, so the king betrothed his daughter to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The bestowal of this great honour upon him, whatever the reason for it, forbids our believing that he was the son of a slave, and, in his boyhood, a slave himself. I am more inclined to the opinion of those who say that in the capture of Corniculum, Servius Tullius, the leading man of that city, was killed, and his wife, who was about to become a mother, was recognised amongst the other captive women, and in consequence of her high rank was exempted from servitude by the Roman queen, and gave birth to a son in the house of Priscus Tarquinius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This kind treatment strengthened the intimacy between the women and the boy brought up as he was from infancy in the royal household was held in affection and honour. It was the fate of his mother who fell into the hands of the enemy when her native city was taken that made people think he was the son of a slave.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Assassination of Tarquin.</note> Tarquin had been about thirty-eight years on the throne Servius Tullius was held in by far the highest esteem of any one, not only with the king but also with the patricians and the commons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The two sons of Ancus had always felt most keenly their being deprived of their father's throne through the treachery of their guardian; its occupation by a foreigner who was not even of Italian, much less of Roman descent, increased their indignation, when they saw that not even after the death of Tarquin would the crown revert to them, but would suddenly descend to a slave &mdash;that crown which Romulus, the offspring of a god, and himself a god, had worn whilst he was on earth, now to he the possession of a slave - born slave a hundred years later!
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They felt that it would be a disgrace to the whole Roman nation, and especially to their house, if, while the male issue of Ancus was still,alive, the sovereignty of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> should be open not only to foreigners but even to slaves. They determined, therefore, to repel that insult by the sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But it was on Tarquin rather than on Servius that they sought to avenge their wrongs; if the king were left alive he would be able to deal more summary vengeance than an ordinary citizen, and in the event of Servius being killed, the king would certainly make any one else whom he chose for a son-in-law heir to the crown. These considerations decided them to form a plot against the king's life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Two shepherds, perfect desperadoes, were selected for the deed. They appeared in the vestibule of the palace, each with his usual implement, and by pretending to have a violent and outrageous quarrel, they attracted the attention of all the royal guards. Then, as they both began to appeal to the king, and their clamour had penetrated within the palace, they were summoned before the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first they tried, by shouting each against the other, to see who could make the most noise, until, after being repressed by the lictor and ordered to speak in turn, they became quiet, and one of the two began to state his case.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst the king's attention was absorbed in listening to him, the other swung aloft his axe and drove it into the king's head, and leaving the weapon in the wound both dashed out of the palace.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Accession of Servius.</note> the bystanders were supporting the dying Tarquin in their arms, the lictors caught the fugitives. The shouting drew a crowd together, wondering, what had happened. In the midst of the confusion, Tanaquil ordered the palace to be cleared and the doors closed; she then carefully prepared medicaments for dressing the wound, should there be hopes of life; at the same time she decided on other precautions, should the case prove hopeless, and hastily summoned Servius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> She showed him her husband at the point of death, and taking his hand, implored him not to leave his father-in-law's death unavenged, nor to allow his mother-in-law to become the sport of her enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">The throne is yours, Servius,</q> she said, <q direct="unspecified">if you are a man; it does not belong to those who have, through the hands of others, wrought this worst of crimes. Up! follow the guidance of the gods who presaged the exaltation of that head round which divine fire once played! Let that heaven-sent flame now inspire you. Rouse yourself in earnest! We, too, though foreigners, have reigned. Bethink yourself not whence you sprang, but who you are. If in this sudden emergency you are slow to resolve, then follow my counsels.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As the clamour and impatience of the populace could hardly be restrained, Tanaquil went to a window in the upper part of the palace looking out on the Via Nova-the king used to live by the temple of Jupiter Stator-and addressed the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> She bade them hope for the best; the king had been stunned by a sudden blow, but the weapon had not penetrated to any depth, he had already recovered consciousness, the blood had been washed off and the wound examined, all the symptoms were favourable, she was sure they would soon see him again, meantime it was his order that the people should recognise the authority of Servius Tullius, who would administer justice and discharge the other functions of royalty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Servius appeared in his <foreign lang="la">trabea</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">trabea</foreign>. &mdash;A white tunic with purple stripes, the official dress of the kings, and alsoofthe higher members of thepriesthood and the <q direct="unspecified">knights.</q></note> attended by the lictors, and after taking his seat in the royal chair decided some cases and adjourned others under pretence of consulting the king. So for several days after Tarquin's death Servius continued to strengthen his position by giving out that he was exercising a delegated authority. At length the sounds of mourning arose in the palace and divulged the fact of the king's death. Protected by a strong bodyguard Servius was the first who ascended the throne without being elected by the people, though without opposition from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> senate. When the sons of Ancus heard that the instruments of their crime had been arrested, that the king was still alive, and that Servius was so powerful, they went into exile at Suessa Pometia.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Servius<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">His Political Organisation.</note> consolidated his power quite as much by his private as by his public measures. To guard against the children of Tarquin treating him as those of Ancus had treated Tarquin, he married his two daughters to the scions of the royal house, <placeName key="tgn,2023439">Lucius</placeName> and Arruns Tarquin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Human counsels could not arrest the inevitable course of destiny, nor could Servius prevent the jealousy aroused by his ascending the throne from making his family the scene of disloyalty and hatred.</p> <p>The truce with the Veientines had now expired, and the resumption of war with them and other Etruscan cities came most opportunely to help in maintaining tranquillity at home.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In this war the courage and good fortune of Tullius were conspicuous, and he returned to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, after defeating an immense force of the enemy, feeling quite secure on the throne, and assured of the goodwill of both patricians and commons.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then he set himself to by far the greatest of all works in times of peace. Just as <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName> had been the author of religious laws and institutions, so posterity extols Servius as the founder of those divisions and classes in the State by which a clear distinction is drawn between the various grades of dignity and fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He instituted the census, a most beneficial institution in what was to be a great empire, in order that by its means the various duties of peace and war might be assigned, not as heretofore, indiscriminately, but in proportion to the amount of property each man possessed. From it he drew up the classes and centuries and the following distribution of them, adapted for either peace or war.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Those<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Classes and Centuries.</note> whose property amounted to, or exceeded 100,000 lbs. weight of copper were formed into eighty centuries, forty of juniors and forty of seniors.<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed">The <q direct="unspecified">juniors</q> betwen the ages of seventeen to forty-six, the <q direct="unspecified">seniors</q> above that age. But military service was not obligatory on men over sixty.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These were called the First Class. The seniors were to defend the City, the juniors to serve in the field. The armour which they were to provide themselves with comprised helmet, round shield, greaves, and coat of mail, all of brass; these were to protect the person. Their offensive weapons were spear and sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To this class were joined two centuries of carpenters whose duty it was to work the engines of war; they were without arms. The Second Class consisted of those whose property amounted to between 75,000 and 100,000 lbs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> weight of copper; they were formed, seniors and juniors together, into twenty centuries. Their regulation arms were the same as those of the First Class, except that they had an oblong wooden shield instead of the round brazen one and no coat of mail.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Third Class he formed of those whose property fell as low as 50,000 lbs.; these also consisted of twenty centuries, similarly divided into seniors and juniors. The only difference in the armour was that they did not wear greaves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the Fourth Class were those whose property did not fall below 25,000 lbs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They also formed twenty centuries; their only arms were a spear and a javelin. The Fifth Class was larger, it formed thirty centuries. They carried slings and stones, and they included the supernumeraries, the horn-blowers, and the trumpeters, who formed three centuries. This Fifth Class was assessed at 11,000 lbs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The rest of the population whose property fell below this were formed into one century and were exempt from military service.</p> <p>After thus regulating the equipment and distribution of the infantry, he rearranged the cavalry. He enrolled from amongst the principal men of the State twelve centuries.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the same way he made six other centuries (though only three had been formed by <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName>) under the same names under which the first had been inaugurated. For the purchase of the horse, 10,000 lbs. were assigned them from the public treasury; whilst for its keep certain widows were assessed to pay 2000 lbs. each, annually. The burden of all these expenses was shifted from the poor on to the rich.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Then additional privileges were conferred. The former kings had maintained the constitution as handed down by <placeName key="tgn,2072021">Romulus</placeName>, viz., manhood suffrage in which all alike possessed the same weight and enjoyed the same rights. Servius introduced a graduation; so that whilst no one was ostensibly deprived of his vote, all the voting power was in the hands of the principal men of the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The knights were first summoned to record their vote, then the eighty centuries of the infantry of the First Class; if their votes were divided, which seldom happened, it was arranged for the Second Class to be summoned; very seldom did the voting extend to the lowest Class.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Nor need it occasion any surprise, that the arrangement which now exists since the completion of the thirty-five tribes, their number being doubled by the centuries of juniors and seniors, does not agree with the total as instituted by Servius Tullius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For, after dividing the City with its districts and the hills which were inhabited into four parts, he called these divisions <q direct="unspecified">tribes,</q> I think from the tribute they paid, for he also introduced the practice of collecting it at an equal rate according to the assessment. These tribes had nothing to do with the distribution and number of the centuries.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The work of the census was accelerated by an enactment in which Servius denounced imprisonment and even capital punishment against those who evaded assessment. On its completion he issued an order that all the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, knights and infantry alike, should appear in the <placeName key="tgn,7014001">Campus Martius</placeName>, each in their centuries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the whole army had been drawn up there, he purified it by the triple sacrifice of a swine, a sheep, and an ox.<note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="ed">As in the case of Tullus Hostilius (see note 9). This sacrifice was afterwards regularly offered on the completion of each five-year period (<foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign>).</note> This was called <q direct="unspecified">a closed <foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign>,</q> because with it the census was completed. Eighty thousand citizens are said to have been included in that census. Fabius Pictor, the oldest of our historians states that this was the number of those who could bear arms.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>To<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Enlargement of the City.</note> contain that population it was obvious that the City would have to be enlarged. He added to it the two hills &mdash;the Quirinal and the Viminal &mdash;and then made a further addition by including the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName>, and to give it more importance he lived there himself. He surrounded the City with a mound and moats and wall; in this way he extended the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">pomoerium</foreign>.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Looking only to the etymology of the word, they explain <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">pomoerium</foreign></q> as <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">postmoerium</foreign>;</q> but it is rather a <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">circamoerium</foreign>.</q> For the space which the Etruscans of old, when founding their cities, consecrated in accordance with auguries and marked off by boundary stones at intervals on each side, as the part where the wall was to be carried, was to be kept vacant so that no buildings might connect with the wall on the inside (whilst now they generally touch), and on the outside some ground might remain virgin soil untouched by cultivation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This space, which it was forbidden either to build upon or to plough, and which could not be said to be behind the wall any more than the wall could be said to be behind it, the Romans called the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">pomoerium</foreign>.</q> As the City grew, these sacred boundary stones were always moved forward as far as the walls were advanced.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">League with the Latins.</note> the State was augmented by the expansion of the City and all domestic arrangements adapted to the requirements of both peace and war, Servius endeavoured to extend his dominion by state-craft, instead of aggrandising it by arms, and at the same time made an addition to the adornment of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The temple of the Ephesian Diana was famous at that time, and it was reported to have been built by the cooperation of the states of <placeName key="tgn,2097781">Asia</placeName>. Servius had been careful to form ties of hospitality and friendship with the chiefs of the Latin nation, and he used to speak in the highest praise of that cooperation and the common recognition of the same deity. By constantly dwelling on this theme he at length induced the Latin tribes to join with the people of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in building a temple to <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their doing so was an admission of the predominance of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; a question which had so often been disputed by arms. Though the Latins, after their many unfortunate experiences in war, had as a nation laid aside all thoughts of success, there was amongst the Sabines one man who believed that an opportunity presented itself of recovering the supremacy through his own individual cunning.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The story runs that a man of substance belonging to that nation had a heifer of marvellous size and beauty. The marvel was attested in after ages by the horns which were fastened up in the vestibule of the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The creature was looked upon as-what it really was-a prodigy, and the soothsayers predicted that, whoever sacrificed it to <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName>, the state of which he was a citizen should be the seat of empire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This prophecy had reached the ears of the official in charge of the temple of <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName>. When the first day on which the sacrifice could properly be offered arrived the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> drove the heifer to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, took it to the temple and placed it front of the altar. The official in charge was a Roman, and, struck by the size of the victim which was well known by report he recalled the prophecy and addressing the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> said, <q direct="unspecified">Why, pray, are you, stranger, preparing to offer a polluted sacrifice to <placeName key="tgn,2098819">Diana</placeName>? Go and bathe yourself first in running water. The <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> is flowing down there at the bottom of the valley.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Filled with misgivings, and anxious for everything to be done properly that the prediction might be fulfilled, the stranger promptly went down to the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>. Meanwhile the Roman sacrificed the heifer to <placeName key="tgn,2118015">Diana</placeName>. This was a cause of intense gratification to the king and to his people.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Servius was now confirmed on the throne by long possession. It had, however, come to his ears that the young Tarquin was giving out that he was reigning without the assent of the people. He first secured the goodwill of the plebs by assigning to each householder a slice of the land which had been taken from the enemy. Then he was emboldened to put to them the question whether it was their will and resolve that he should reign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was acclaimed as king by a unanimous vote such as no king before him had obtained.</p> <p><emph>The Assassination of the King.</emph> This action in no degree damped Tarquin's hopes of making his way to the throne, rather the reverse. He was a bold and aspiring youth, and his wife Tullia stimulated his restless ambition. He had seen that the granting of land to the commons was in defiance of the opinion of the senate, and he seized the opportunity it afforded him of traducing Servius and strengthening his own faction in that assembly.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So it came about that the Roman palace afforded an instance of the crime which tragic poets have depicted,<note anchored="yes" n="14" resp="ed">Sophocles in the <bibl>Oedipus</bibl> and Aeschylus in the <bibl>Agamemnon</bibl></note> with the result that the loathing felt
						<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> for kings hastened the advent of liberty, and the crown won by villainy was the last that was worn.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This Lucius Tarquinius-whether he was the son or the grandson of King Priscus Tarquinius is not clear; if I should give him as the son I should have the preponderance of authorities-had a brother, Arruns Tarquinius, a youth of gentle character. The two Tullias, the king's daughters, had, as I have already stated, married these two brothers; and they themselves were of utterly unlike dispositions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was, I believe, the good fortune of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> which intervened to prevent two violent natures from being joined in marriage, in order that the reign of Servius Tullius might last long enough to allow the State to settle into its new constitution. The high-spirited one of the two Tullias was annoyed that there was nothing in her husband for her to work on in the direction of either greed or ambition. All her affections were transferred to the other Tarquin; he was her admiration, he, she said, was a man, he was really of royal blood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> She despised her sister, because having a man for her husband she was not animated by the spirit of a woman. Likeness of character soon drew them together, as evil usually consorts best with evil. But it was the woman who was the originator of all the mischief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> She constantly held clandestine interviews with her sister's husband, to whom she unsparingly vilified alike her husband and her sister, asserting that it would have been better for her to have remained unmarried and he a bachelor, rather than for them each to be thus unequally mated, and fret in idleness through the poltroonery of others. Had heaven given her the husband she deserved, she would soon have seen the sovereignty which her father wielded established in her own house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> She rapidly infected the young man with her own recklessness. Lucius Tarquin and the younger Tullia, by a double murder, cleared from their houses the obstacles to a fresh marriage; their nuptials were solemnised with the tacit acquiescence rather than the approbation of Servius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From that time the old age of Tullius became more embittered, his reign more unhappy. The woman began to look forward from one crime to another; she allowed her husband no rest day or night, for fear lest the past murders should prove fruitless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> What she wanted, she said, was not a man who was only her husband in name, or with whom she was to live in uncomplaining servitude; the man she needed was one who deemed himself worthy of a throne, who remembered that he was the son of Priscus Tarquinius, who preferred to wear a crown rather than live in hopes of it.<note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="ed">The behavior of the yonger Tullia to the mild and gentle Arruns contrasted with that towards Lucius has been well compared to Goneril's attitude towards <placeName key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> and towards Edmund.

You are not, like your father, a native of <placeName key="tgn,2117881">Corinth</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7006776">Tarquinii</placeName>, nor is it a foreign crown you have to win.

Make your way back to <placeName key="tgn,7006776">Tarquinii</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7010734">Corinth</placeName>, sink back to the position whence you sprung; you have your brother's nature rather than your father's.</q><note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="ed">These impassioned appeals may be compared to those of Lady Macbeth, Act I, Scene vii.</note> With taunts like these she egged him
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> on. She, too, was perpetually haunted by the thought that whilst Tanaquil, a woman of alien descent, had shown such spirit as to give the crown to her husband and her son-in-law in succession, she herself, though of royal descent, had no power either in giving it or taking it
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> away. Infected by the woman's madness Tarquin began to go about and interview the nobles, mainly those of the Lesser Houses; he reminded them of the favour his father had shown them, and asked them to prove their gratitude; he won over the younger men with presents. By making magnificent promises as to what he would do, and by bringing charges against the king, his cause became stronger amongst all ranks.</p> <p>At last, when he thought the time for action had arrived, he appeared suddenly in the Forum with a body of armed
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> men. A general panic ensued, during which he seated himself in the royal chair in the senate-house and ordered the Fathers to be summoned by the crier <q direct="unspecified">into the presence of King Tarquin.</q> They hastily assembled, some already prepared for what was coming; others, apprehensive lest their absence should arouse suspicion, and dismayed by the extraordinary nature of the incident, were convinced that the fate of Servius was
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> sealed.</p> <p>Tarquin went back to the king's birth, protested that he was a slave and the son of a slave, and after his (the
							<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> speaker's) father had been foully murdered, seized the throne, as a woman's gift, without any interrex being appointed as heretofore, without any assembly being convened, without any vote of the people being taken or any confirmation of it by the Fathers. Such was his origin, such was his right to the
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> crown. His sympathies were with the dregs of society from which he had sprung, and through jealousy of the ranks to which he did not belong, he had taken the land from the foremost men in the State and divided it amongst the vilest; he had shifted on to them the whole of the burdens which had formerly been borne in common by
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> all; he had instituted the census that the fortunes of the wealthy might be held up to envy, and be an easily available source from which to shower doles, whenever he pleased, upon the neediest.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Servius had been summoned by a breathless messenger, and arrived on the scene while Tarquin was speaking. As soon as he reached the vestibule, he exclaimed in loud tones, <q direct="unspecified">What is the meaning of this, Tarquin?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> How dared you, with such insolence, convene the senate or sit in that chair whilst I am alive?</q> Tarquin replied fiercely that he was occupying his father's seat, that a king's son was a much more legitimate heir to the throne than a slave, and that he, Servius, in playing his reckless game, had insulted his masters long enough. Shouts arose from their respective partisans, the people made a rush to the senate-house, and it was evident that he who won the fight would reign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then Tarquin, forced by sheer necessity into proceeding to the last extremity, seized Servius round the waist, and being a much younger and stronger man, carried him out of the senate-house and flung him down the steps into the Forum below. He then returned to call the senate to order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The officers and attendants of the king fled. The king himself, half dead from the violence, was put to death by those whom Tarquin had sent in pursuit of him. It is the current belief that this was done at Tullia's suggestion, for it is quite in keeping with the rest of her wickedness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At all events, it is generally agreed that she drove down to the Forum in a two-wheeled car, and, unabashed by the presence of the crowd, called her husband out of the senate-house and was the first to salute him as king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He told her to make her way out of the tumult, and when on her return she had got as far as the top of the Cyprius Vicus, where the temple of Diana lately stood, and was turning to the right on the Urbius Clivus, to get to the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName>, the driver stopped horror-struck and pulled up, and pointed out to his mistress the corpse of the murdered Servius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, the tradition runs, a foul and unnatural crime was committed, the memory of which the place still bears, for they call it the Vicus Sceleratus. It is said that Tullia, goaded to madness by the avenging spirits of her sister and her husband, drove right over her father's body, and carried back some of her father's blood with which the car and she herself were defiled to her own and her husband's house-hold gods, through whose anger a reign which began in wickedness was soon brought to a close by a like cause.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Servius Tullius reigned forty-four years, and even a wise and good successor would have found it difficult to fill the throne as he had done. The glory of his reign was all the greater because with him perished all just and lawful kingship in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Gentle and moderate as his sway had been, he had nevertheless, according to some authorities, formed the intention of laying it down, because it was vested in a single person, but this purpose of giving freedom to the State was cut short by that domestic crime.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucius Tarquinius now began his reign. His conduct procured for him the nickname of <q direct="unspecified">Superbus,</q> for he deprived his father-in-law of burial, on the plea that Romulus was not buried, and he slew the leading nobles whom he suspected of being partisans of Servius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Conscious that the precedent which he had set, of winning a throne by violence, might be used against himself, he surrounded himself with a guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For he had nothing whatever by which to make good his claim to the crown except actual violence; he was reigning without either being elected by the people or confirmed by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As more over, he had no hope of winning the affections of the citizens, he had to maintain his dominion by fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To make himself more dreaded, he conducted the trials in capital cases without any assessors, and under this pretence he was able to put to death, banish, or fine not only those whom he suspected or disliked, but also those from whom his only object was to extort money.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His main object was so to reduce the number of senators, by refusing to fill up any vacancies, that the dignity of the order itself might be lowered through the smallness of its numbers, and less indignation felt at all public business being taken out of its hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was the first of the kings to break through the traditional custom of consulting the senate on all questions, the first to conduct the government on the advice of his palace favourites. War, peace, treaties, alliances were made or broken off by him, just as he thought good, without any authority from either people or senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He made a special point of securing the Latin nation, that through his power and influence abroad he might be safer amongst his subjects at home; he not only formed ties of hospitality with their chief men, but established family connections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He gave his daughter in marriage to Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, who was quite the foremost man of the Latin race, descended, if we are to believe traditions, from Ulysses and the goddess Circe; through that connection he gained many of his son-in-law's relations and friends.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Tarquin had now gained considerable influence amongst the Latin nobility, and he sent word for them to meet on a fixed date at the Grove of Ferentina, as there were matters of mutual interest about which he wished to consult them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They assembled in considerable numbers at daybreak; Tarquin kept his appointment, it is true, but did not arrive till shortly before sunset. The council spent the whole day in discussing many topics. Turnus Herdonius, from <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>, had made a fierce attack on the absent Tarquin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was no wonder, he said, that the epithet <q direct="unspecified">Tyrant</q> had been bestowed upon him at Rome &mdash;for this was what people commonly called him, though only in whispers-could anything show the tyrant more than his thus trifling with the whole Latin nation? After summoning the chiefs from distant homes, the man who had called the council was not present.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He was in fact trying how far he could go, so that if they submitted to the yoke he might crush them. Who could not see that he was making his way to sovereignty over the Latins?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even supposing that his own countrymen did well to entrust him with supreme power, or rather that it was entrusted and not seized by an act of parricide, the Latins ought not, even in that case, to place it in the hands of an alien.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But if his own people bitterly rue his sway, seeing how they are being butchered, sent into exile, stripped of all their property, what better fate can the Latins hope for? If they followed the speaker's advice they would go home and take as little notice of the day fixed for the council as he who had fixed it was taking.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Just while these and similar sentiments were being uttered by the man who had gained his influence in <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName> by treasonable and criminal practice, Tarquin appeared on the scene.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That put a stop to his speech, for all turned from the speaker to salute the king.</p> <p>When silence was restored, Tarquin was advised by those near to explain why he had come so late. He said that having been chosen as arbitrator between a father and a son, he had been detained by his endeavours to reconcile them, and as that matter had taken up the whole day, he would bring forward the measures he had decided upon the next day.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is said that even this explanation was not received by Turnus without his commenting on it; no case, he argued, could take up less time than one between a father and a son, it could be settled in a few words; if the son did not comply with the father's wishes he would get into trouble.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With these censures on the Roman king he left the council. Tarquin took the matter more seriously than he appeared to do and at once began to plan Turnus' death, in order that he might inspire the Latins with the same terror through which he had crushed the spirits of his subjects at home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As he had not the power to get him openly put to death, he compassed his destruction by bringing a false charge against him. Through the agency of some of the Aricians opposed to Turnus, he bribed a slave of his to allow a large quantity of swords to be carried secretly into his quarters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This plan was executed in one night. Shortly before daybreak Tarquin summoned the Latin chiefs into his presence as though something had happened to give him great alarm. He told them that his delay on the previous day had been brought about by some divine providence, for it had proved the salvation both of them and himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He was informed that Turnus was planning his murder and that of the leading men in the different cities, in order that he might hold sole rule over the Latins. He would have attempted it the previous day in the council; but the attempt was deferred owing to the absence of the convener of the council, the chief object of attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Hence the abuse levelled against him in his absence , because his delay had frustrated the hopes of success. If the reports which reached him were true, he had no doubt that, on the assembling of the council at daybreak, Turnus would come armed and with a strong body of conspirators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was asserted that a vast number of swords had been conveyed to him. Whether this was an idle rumour or not could very soon be ascertained, he asked them to go with him to Turnus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The restless, ambitious character of Turnus, his speech of the previous day, and Tarquin's delay, which easily accounted for the postponement of the murder all lent colour to their suspicions. They went, inclined to accept Tarquin's statement, but quite prepared to regard the whole story as baseless, if the swords were not discovered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they arrived, Turnus was roused from sleep and placed under guard and the slaves who from affection to their master were preparing to defend him were seized. Then, when the concealed swords were produced from every corner of his lodgings, the matter appeared only too certain and Turnus was thrown into chains. Amidst great excitement a council of the Latins was at once summoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The sight of the swords, placed in the midst, aroused such furious resentment that he was condemned, without being heard in his defence, to an unprecedented mode of death. He was thrown into the fountain of Ferentina and drowned by a hurdle weighted with stones being placed over him.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Treaty with the Latins.</note> the Latins had reassembled in council and had been commended by Tarquin for having inflicted on Turnus a punishment befitting his revolutionary and murderous designs, Tarquin addressed them as follows:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was in his power to exercise a long-established right, since, as all the Latins traced their origin to Alba, they were included in the treaty made by Tullus under which the whole of the Alban State with its colonies passed under the suzerainty of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He thought, however, that it would be more advantageous for all parties if that treaty were renewed, so that the Latins could enjoy a share in the prosperity of the Roman people, instead of always looking out for, or actually suffering, the demolition of their towns and the devastation of their fields, as happened in the reign of Ancus and afterwards whilst his own father was on the throne.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Latins were persuaded without much difficulty, although by that treaty <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was the predominant State, for they saw that the heads of the Latin League were giving their adhesion to the king, and Turnus afforded a present example of the danger incurred by any one who opposed the king's wishes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So the treaty was renewed, and orders were issued for the <q direct="unspecified">juniors</q><note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="ed">See above, note 13.</note> amongst the Latins to muster under arms , in accordance with the treaty, on a given day, at the Grove of Ferentina.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In compliance with the order contingents assembled from all the thirty towns, and with a view to depriving them of their own general or a separate command, or distinctive standards, he formed one Latin and one Roman century into a maniple, thereby making one unit out of the two, whilst he doubled the strength of the maniples, and placed a centurion over each half.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>However tyrannical the king was in his domestic administration he was by no means a despicable general; in military skill he would have rivalled any of his predecessors had not the degeneration of his character in other directions prevented him from attaining distinction here also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was the first to stir up war with the Volscians-a war which was to last for more than two hundred years after his time &mdash;and took from them the city of Pomptine Suessa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The booty was sold and he realised out of the proceeds forty talents of silver. He then sketched out the design of a temple to <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, which in its extent should be worthy of the king of gods and men, worthy of the Roman empire, worthy of the majesty of the City itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He set apart the above-mentioned sum for its construction.</p> <p>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Conquest of <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName>.</note> next war occupied him longer than he expected. Failing to capture the neighbouring city of <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName> by assault and finding it useless to attempt an investment after being defeated under its walls, he employed methods against it which were anything but Roman, namely, fraud and deceit.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He pretended to have given up all thoughts of war and to be devoting himself to laying the foundations of his temple and other undertakings in the City.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Meantime it was arranged that Sextus, the youngest of his three sons, should go as a refugee to <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName>, complaining loudly of his father's insupportable cruelty and declaring that he had shifted his tyranny from others on to his own family and even regarded the presence of his children as a burden and was preparing to devastate his own family as he had devastated the senate so that not a single descendant, not a single heir to the crown might be left.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He had, he said, himself escaped from the murderous violence of his father, and felt that no place was safe for him except amongst Lucius Tarquin's enemies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Let them not deceive themselves, the war which apparently was abandoned was hanging over them, and at the first chance he would attack them when they least expected it. If amongst them there was no place for suppliants, he would wander through <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, he would petition the Volsci, the Aequi, the Hernici, until he came to men who know how to protect children against the cruel and unnatural persecutions of parents.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Perhaps he would find people with sufficient spirit to take up arms against a remorseless tyrant backed by a warlike people.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>As it seemed probable that if they paid no attention to him he would, in his angry mood, take his departure, the people of <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName> gave him a kind reception.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They told him not to be surprised if his father treated his children as he had treated his own subjects and his allies; failing others he would end by murdering himself. They showed pleasure at his arrival and expressed their belief that with his assistance the war would be transferred from the gates of <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName> to the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He was admitted to the meetings of the national council. Whilst expressing his agreement with the elders of <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName> on other subjects, on which they were better informed, he was continually urging them to war, and claimed to speak with special authority, because he was acquainted with the strength of each nation, and knew that the king's tyranny, which even his own children had found insupportable, was certainly detested by his subjects.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So after gradually working up the leaders of the Gabinians to revolt, he went in person with some of the most eager of the young men on foraging and plundering expeditions. By playing the hypocrite both in speech and action, he gained their mistaken confidence more and more; at last he was chosen as commander in the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Whilst the mass of the population were unaware of what was intended, skirmishes took place between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName> in which the advantage generally rested with the latter, until the Gabinians from the highest to the lowest firmly believed that Sextus Tarquin had been sent by heaven to be their leader.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for the soldiers, he became so endeared to them by sharing all their toils and dangers, and by a lavish distribution of the plunder, that the elder Tarquin was not more powerful in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> than his son was in <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName>.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When he thought himself strong enough to succeed in anything that he might attempt, he sent one of his friends to his father at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to ask what he wished him to do now that the gods had given him sole and absolute power in <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName>. To this messenger no verbal reply was given, because, I believe, he mistrusted him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The king went into the palace-garden, deep in thought, his son's messenger following him. As he walked along in silence it is said that he struck off the tallest poppy-heads with his stick.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Tired of asking and waiting for an answer, and feeling his mission to be a failure, the messenger returned to <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName>, and reported what he had said and seen, adding that the king, whether through temper or personal aversion or the arrogance which was natural to him, had not uttered a single word.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When it had become clear to Sextus what his father meant him to understand by his mysterious silent action, he proceeded to get rid of the foremost men of the State by traducing some of them to the people, whilst others fell victims to their own unpopularity. Many were publicly executed, some against whom no plausible charges could be brought were secretly assassinated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some were allowed to seek safety in flight, or were driven into exile; the property of these as well as of those who had been put to death was distributed in grants and bribes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The gratification felt by each who received a share blunted the sense of the public mischief that was being wrought, until, deprived of all counsel and help, the State of <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName> was surrendered to the Roman king without a single battle.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Public Works in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note> the acquisition of <placeName key="perseus,Gabii">Gabii</placeName>, Tarquin made peace with the Aequi and renewed the treaty with the Etruscans. Then he turned his attention to the business of the City. The first thing was the temple of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> on the Tarpeian Mount, which he was anxious to leave behind as a memorial of his reign and name, both the Tarquins were concerned in it, the father had vowed it, the son completed it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> That the whole of the area which the temple of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> was to occupy might be wholly devoted to that deity, he decided to deconsecrate the fanes and chapels, some of which had been originally vowed by King Tatius at the crisis of his battle with Romulus, and subsequently consecrated and inaugurated.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Tradition records that at the commencement of this work the gods sent a divine intimation of the future vastness of the empire, for whilst the omens were favourable for the deconsecration of all the other shrines, they were unfavourable for that of the fane of Terminus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was interpreted to mean that as the abode of Terminus was not moved and he alone of all the deities was not called forth from his consecrated borders, so all would be firm and immovable in the future empire.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This augury of lasting dominion was followed by a prodigy which portended the greatness of the empire. It is said that whilst they were digging the foundations of the temple, a human head came to light with the face perfect; this appearance unmistakably portended that the spot would be the stronghold of empire and the head of all the world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was the interpretation given by the soothsayers in the City, as well as by those who had been called into council from Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The king's designs were now much more extensive; so much so that his share of the spoils of Pometia, which had been set apart to complete the work, now hardly met the cost of the foundations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This makes me inclined to trust Fabius-who, moreover, is the older authority-when he says that the amount was only forty talents, rather than Piso, who states that forty thousand pounds of silver were set apart for that object.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For not only is such a sum more than could be expected from the spoils of any single city at that time, but it would more than suffice for the foundations of the most magnificent building of the present day.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Determined to finish his temple, he sent for workmen from all parts of Etruria, and not only used the public treasury to defray the cost, but also compelled the plebeians to take their share of the work. This was in addition to their military service, and was anything but a light burden.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Still they felt it less of a hardship to build the temples of the gods with their own hands, than they did afterwards when they were transferred to other tasks less imposing, but involving greater toil-the construction of the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">fori</foreign></q> in the Circus and that of the <foreign lang="la">Cloaca Maxima</foreign>, a subterranean tunnel to receive all the sewage of the City. The magnificence of these two works could hardly be equalled by anything in the present day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the plebeians were no longer required for these works, he considered that such a multitude of unemployed would prove a burden to the State, and as he wished the frontiers of the empire to be more widely colonised, he sent colonists to <placeName key="perseus,Signia">Signia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7009536">Circeii</placeName> to serve as a protection to the City by land and sea.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>While<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Mission to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</note> he was carrying out these undertakings a frightful portent appeared; a snake gliding out of a wooden column created confusion and panic in the palace. The king himself was not so much terrified as filled with anxious forebodings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Etruscan soothsayers were only employed to interpret prodigies which affected the State; but this one concerned him and his house personally, so he decided to send to the world-famed oracle of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Fearing to entrust the oracular response to any one else, he sent two of his sons to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, through lands at that time unknown and over seas still less known. Titus and Arruns started on their journey.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They had as a travelling companion L. Junius Brutus, the son of the king's sister, <placeName key="tgn,7006776">Tarquinia</placeName>, a young man of a very different character from that which he had assumed. When he heard of the massacre of the chiefs of the State, amongst them his own brother, by his uncle's orders, he determined that his intelligence should give the king no cause for alarm nor his fortune any provocation to his avarice, and that as the laws afforded no protection, he would seek safety in obscurity and neglect.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Accordingly he carefully kept up the appearance and conduct of an idiot, leaving the king to do what he liked with his person and property, and did not even protest against his nickname of <q direct="unspecified">Brutus</q>; for under the protection of that nickname the soul which was one day to liberate <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was awaiting its destined hour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The story runs that when brought to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> by the Tarquins, more as a butt for their sport than as a companion, he had with him a golden staff enclosed in a hollow one of cornel wood, which he offered to Apollo as a mystical emblem of his own character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After executing their father's commission the young men were desirous of ascertaining to which of them the kingdom of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> would come. A voice came from the lowest depths of the cavern: <q direct="unspecified">Whichever of you, young men, shall be the first to kiss his mother, he shall hold supreme sway in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Sextus had remained behind in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and to keep him in ignorance of this oracle and so deprive him of any chance of coming to the throne, the two Tarquins insisted upon absolute silence being kept on the subject. They drew lots to decide which of them should be the first to kiss his mother.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On their return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, Brutus, thinking that the oracular utterance had another meaning, pretended to stumble, and as he fell kissed the ground, for the earth is of course the common mother of us all.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Then they returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, where preparations were being energetically pushed forward for a war with the Rutulians</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Story of Lucretia.</note> people who were at that time in possession of <placeName key="perseus,Ardea">Ardea</placeName>, were, considering the nature of their country and the age in which they lived, exceptionally wealthy. This circumstance really originated the war, for the Roman king was anxious to repair his own fortune, which had been exhausted by the magnificent scale of his public works and also to conciliate his subjects by a distribution of the spoils of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His tyranny had already produced disaffection but what moved their special resentment was the way they had been so long kept by the king at manual and even servile labour.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>An attempt was made to take Ardea by assault; when that failed recourse was had to a regular investment to starve the enemy out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When troops are stationary, as is the case in a protracted more than in an active campaign, furloughs are easily granted, more so to the men of rank however, than to the common soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The royal princes sometimes spent their leisure hours in feasting and entertainments, and at a wine party given by
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> Sextus Tarquinius at which Collatinus, the son of Egerius, was present, the conversation happened to turn upon their wives, and each began to speak of his own in terms of extraordinarily high praise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As the dispute became warm Collatinus said that there was no need of words, it could in a few hours be ascertained how far his <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName> was superior to all the rest. <q direct="unspecified">Why do we not,</q> he exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">if we have any youthful vigour about us mount our horses and pay your wives a visit and find out their characters on the spot?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> What we see of the behaviour, of each on the unexpected arrival of her husband, let that be the surest test.</q> They were heated with wine, and all shouted: <q direct="unspecified">Good! Come on!</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Setting spur to their horses they galloped off to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, where they arrived as darkness was beginning to close in; Thence they proceeded to Collatia, where they found <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName> very differently employed from the king's daughters-in-law, whom they had seen passing their time in feasting and luxury with their acquaintances. She was sitting at her wool work in the hall, late at night, with her, maids busy round her.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The palm in this competition of wifely virtue was awarded to <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>. She welcomed the arrival of her husband and the Tarquins, whilst her victorious spouse courteously invited the royal princes to remain as his guests. Sextus Tarquin, inflamed by the beauty and exemplary purity of <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>, formed the vile project of effecting her dishonour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After their youthful frolic they returned for the time to camp.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A few days afterwards Sextus Tarquin went, unknown to Collatinus, with one companion to Collatia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was hospitably received by the household, who suspected nothing, and after supper was conducted to the bedroom set apart for guests. When all around seemed safe and everybody fast asleep, he went in the frenzy of his passion with a naked sword to the sleeping <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>, and placing his left hand on her breast, said, <q direct="unspecified">Silence, <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>! I am Sextus Tarquin, and I have a sword in my hand; if you utter a word, you shall die.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the woman, terrified out of her sleep, saw that no help was near, and instant death threatening her, Tarquin began to confess his passion, pleaded, used threats as well as entreaties, and employed every argument likely to influence a female heart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he saw that she was inflexible and not moved even by the fear of death, he threatened to disgrace her, declaring that he would lay the naked corpse of the slave by her dead body, so that it might be said that she had been slain in foul adultery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By this awful threat, his lust triumphed over her inflexible chastity, and Tarquin went off exulting in having successfully attacked her honour. <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>, overwhelmed with grief at such a frightful outrage, sent a messenger to her father at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> and to her husband at Ardea, asking them to come to her, each accompanied by one faithful friend; it was necessary to act, and to act promptly; a horrible thing had happened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Spurius Lucretius came with Publius Valerius, the son of Volesus; Collatinus with Lucius Junius Brutus, with whom he happened to be returning to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> when he was met by his wife's messenger. They found <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName> sitting in her room prostrate with grief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As they entered, she burst into tears, and to her husband's inquiry whether all was well, replied, <q direct="unspecified">No! what can be well with a woman when her honour is lost? The marks of a stranger Collatinus are in your bed. But it is only the body that has been violated the soul is pure; death shall bear witness to that. But pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is Sextus Tarquin, who, coming as an enemy instead of a guest forced from me last night by brutal violence a pleasure fatal to me, and, if you are men, fatal to him.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They all successively pledged their word, and tried to console the distracted woman , by turning the guilt from the victim of the outrage to the perpetrator, and urging that it is the mind that sins not the body, and where there has been no consent there is no guilt <q direct="unspecified">It is for you,</q> she said, <q direct="unspecified">to see that he gets his deserts:
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> although I acquit myself of the sin, I do not free myself from the penalty; no unchaste woman shall henceforth live and plead <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>'s example.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>She had a knife concealed in her dress which she plunged into her, heart, and fell dying on the floor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Her father and husband raised the death-cry.<note anchored="yes" n="18" resp="ed">As soon as life was extinct, those round the death-bed raised a loud cry of woe and called out the name of the deceased. For a similar custom among the Hebrews, comp. 2 Sam. xviii. 33.</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Expulsion of the Tarquins.</note> they were absorbed in grief, Brutus drew the knife from <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>'s wound and holding it, dripping with blood, in front of him, said, <q direct="unspecified">By this blood - most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son &mdash;I swear, and you, 0 gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole brood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or any one else to reign in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Then he handed the knife to Collatinus and then to Lucretius and Valerius, who were all astounded at the marvel of the thing, wondering whence Brutus had acquired this new character. They swore as they were directed; all their grief changed to wrath, and they followed the lead of Brutus, who summoned them to abolish the monarchy forthwith.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They carried the body of <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName> from her home down to the Forum, where, owing to the unheard-of atrocity of the crime, they at once collected a crowd.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Each had his own complaint to make of the wickedness and violence of the royal house. Whilst all were moved by the father's deep distress, Brutus bade them stop their tears and idle laments, and urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All the high-spirited amongst the younger men came forward as armed volunteers, the rest followed their, example. A portion of this body was left to hold Collatia, and guards were stationed at the gates to prevent any news of the movement from reaching the king; the rest marched in arms to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> with Brutus in command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On their, arrival, the sight of so many men in arms spread panic and confusion wherever they marched, but when again the people saw that the foremost men of the State were leading the way, they realised that what-ever the movement was it was a serious one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The terrible occurrence created no less excitement in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> than it had done in Collatia; there was a rush from all quarters of the City to the Forum. When they had gathered there, the herald summoned them to attend the <q direct="unspecified">Tribune of the Celeres</q>; this was the office which Brutus happened at the time to be holding.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He made a speech quite out of keeping with the character and temper he had up to that day assumed. He dwelt upon the brutality and licentiousness of Sextus Tarquin, the infamous outrage on <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName> and her pitiful death, the bereavement sustained by her, father, Tricipitinus, to whom the cause of his daughter's death was more shameful and distressing than the actual death itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then he dwelt on the tyranny of the king, the toils and sufferings of the plebeians kept underground clearing out ditches and sewers &mdash;Roman men, conquerors of all the surrounding nations , turned from warriors into artisans and stonemasons!
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He reminded them of the shameful murder of Servius Tullius and his daughter driving in her accursed chariot over her father's body, and solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> By enumerating these and, I believe, other still more atrocious incidents which his keen sense of the present injustice suggested, but which it is not easy to give in detail, he goaded on the incensed multitude to strip the king of his sovereignty and pronounce a sentence of banishment against Tarquin with his wife and children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> With a picked body of the <q direct="unspecified">Juniors,</q> who volunteered to follow him, he went off to the camp at Ardea to incite the army against the king, leaving the command in the City to Lucretius, who had previously been made Prefect of the City by the king.

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the news of these proceedings reached the camp, the king, alarmed at the turn affairs were taking, hurried to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to quell the outbreak. Brutus, who was on the same road, had become aware of his approach, and to avoid meeting him took another route, so that he reached Ardea and Tarquin <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> almost at the same time, though by different ways.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Tarquin found the gates shut, and a decree of banishment passed against him; the Liberator of the City received a joyous welcome in the camp, and the king's sons were expelled from it. Two of them followed their father, into exile amongst the Etruscans in Caere. Sextus Tarquin proceeded to Gabii, which he looked upon as his kingdom, but was killed in revenge for the old feuds he had kindled by his rapine and murders.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Lucius Tarquinius Superbus reigned twenty-five years. The whole duration of the regal government from the foundation of the City to its liberation was two hundred and forty-four years. Two consuls were then elected in the assembly of centuries by the prefect of the City, in accordance with the regulations of Servius Tullius. They were Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus.</p></div1>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The tyranny of the last king made this liberty all the more welcome, for such had been the rule of the former kings that they might not undeservedly be counted as founders of parts, at all events, of the city; for the additions they made were required as abodes for the increased population which they themselves had augmented.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There is no question that the Brutus who won such glory through the expulsion of Superbus would have inflicted the gravest injury on the State had he wrested the sovereignty from any of the former kings, through desire of a liberty for which the people were not ripe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What would have been the result if that horde of shepherds and immigrants, fugitives from their own cities, who had secured liberty, or at all events impunity, in the shelter of an inviolable sanctuary<note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed"><emph>sanctuary</emph> &mdash;see Book I. chap. viii.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> &mdash;if, I say, they had been freed from the restraining power of kings and, agitated by tribunician storms, had begun to foment quarrels with the patricians in a City where they were aliens before sufficient time had elapsed for either family ties or a growing love for the very soil to effect a union of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> hearts? The infant State would have been torn to pieces by internal dissension. As it was, however, the moderate and tranquilizing authority of the kings had so fostered it that it was at last able to bring forth the fair fruits of liberty, in the maturity of its
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> strength. But the origin of liberty may be referred to this time rather because the consular authority was limited to one year than because there was any weakening of the authority which the kings had
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> possessed. The first consuls retained all the old jurisdiction and insignia of office; one only, however, had the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign>,</q> to prevent the fear which might have been inspired by the sight of both with those dread symbols. Through the concession of his colleague, Brutus had them first, and he was not less zealous in guarding the public liberty than he had been in achieving
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> it. His first act was to secure the people, who were now jealous of their newly-recovered liberty, from being influenced by any entreaties or bribes from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> king. He therefore made them take an oath that they would not suffer any man to reign in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. The senate had been thinned by the murderous cruelty of Tarquin, and Brutus' next care was to strengthen its influence by selecting some of the leading men of equestrian rank to fill the vacancies; by this means he brought it up to the old number of three
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> hundred. The new members were known as <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">conscripti</foreign>,</q> the old ones retained their designation of <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">patres</foreign>.</q> This measure had a wonderful effect in promoting harmony in the State and bringing the patricians and plebeians together.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He next gave his attention to the affairs of religion. Certain public functions had hitherto been executed by the kings in person;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> with the view of supplying their place a <q direct="unspecified">king for sacrifices</q> was created,<note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="ed"><emph>king for sacrifices</emph> &mdash;The discharge of these functions by any one of lower rank than a king might be deemed an affront by the gods. A striking instance of the <q direct="unspecified">legalism</q> of the Roman religion.</note> and lest he should become king in anything more than name, and so threaten that liberty which was their first care, his office was made subordinate to the <foreign lang="la">Pontifex Maximus</foreign>. I think that they went to unreasonable lengths in devising safeguards for their liberty, in all, even the smallest
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> points. The second consul &mdash;L. Tarquinius Collatinus &mdash;bore an unpopular name &mdash;this was his sole offence &mdash;and men said that the Tarquins had been too long in power. They began with Priscus; then Servius Tullius reigned, and Superbus Tarquinius, who even after this interruption had not lost sight of the throne which another filled, regained it by crime and violence as the hereditary possession of his house. And now that he was expelled, their power was being wielded by Collatinus; the Tarquins did not know how to live in a private station, the very name was a danger to
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> liberty. What were at first whispered hints became the common talk of the City, and as the people were becoming suspicious and alarmed, Brutus summoned an
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> assembly. He first of all rehearsed the people's oath, that they would suffer no man to reign or to live in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> by whom the public liberty might be imperiled. This was to be guarded with the utmost care, no means of doing so were to be neglected. Personal regard made him reluctant to speak, nor would he have spoken had not his affection for the common-wealth compelled
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> him. The Roman people did consider that their freedom was not yet fully won; the royal race, the royal name, was still there, not only amongst the citizens but in the government; in that fact lay an injury, an obstacle to full
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> liberty. Turning to his brother consul: <q direct="unspecified">These apprehensions it is for you, L. Tarquinius, to banish of your own free will. We have not forgotten, I assure you, that you expelled the king's family, complete your good work, remove their very name. Your fellow-citizens will, on my authority, not only hand over your property, but if you need anything, they will add to it with lavish generosity. Go, as our friend, relieve the common-wealth from a perhaps groundless, fear, men are persuaded that only with the family will the tyranny of the Tarquins
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> depart.</q></p> <p>At first the consul was struck dumb with astonishment at this extraordinary request; then, when he was beginning to speak, the foremost men in the commonwealth gathered round him and repeatedly urged the same plea, but with little
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> success. It was not till Spurius Lucretius, his superior in age and rank, and also his father-in-law, began to use every method of entreaty and persuasion that he yielded to the universal
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> wish. The consul, fearing lest after his year of office had expired and he returned to private life, the same demand should be made upon him, accompanied with loss of property and the ignominy of banishment, formally laid down the consulship, and after transferring all his effects to Lanuvium, withdrew from the
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> State. A decree of the senate empowered Brutus to propose to the people a measure exiling all the members of the house of Tarquin. He conducted the election of a new consul, and the centuries elected as his colleague Publius Valerius, who had acted with him in the expulsion of the royal family.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Though<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">A Conspiracy to Restore the Tarquins.</note> no one doubted that war with the Tarquins was imminent, it did not come as soon as was universally expected. What was not expected, however, was that through intrigue and treachery the new-won liberty was almost lost.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>There were some young men of high birth in Rome who during the late reign had done pretty much what they pleased, and being born companions of the young Tarquins were accustomed to live in royal fashion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now that all were equal before the law, they missed their former licence and complained that the liberty which others enjoyed had become slavery for them; as long as there was a king, there was a person from whom they could get what they wanted, whether lawful or not, there was room for personal influence and kindness, he could show severity or indulgence, could discriminate between his friends and his enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the law was a thing, deaf and inexorable, more favourable to the weak than to the powerful, showing no indulgence or forgiveness to those who transgressed; human nature being what it was, it was a dangerous plan to trust solely to one's innocence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When they had worked themselves into a state of disaffection, envoys from the royal family arrived, bringing a demand for the restoration of their property without any allusion to their possible return. An audience was granted them by the senate, and the matter was discussed for some days; fears were expressed that the non-surrender would be taken as a pretext for war, while if surrendered it might provide the means of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The envoys, meantime, were engaged on another task: whilst ostensibly seeking only the surrender of the property they were secretly hatching schemes for regaining the crown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst canvassing the young nobility in favour of their apparent object, they sounded them as to their other proposals, and meeting with a favourable reception, they brought letters addressed to them by the Tarquins and discussed plans for admitting them secretly at night into the City.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The project was at first entrusted to the brothers Vitellii and Aquilii. The sister of the Vitellii was married to the consul Brutus, and there were grown-up children from this marriage &mdash;<placeName key="tgn,1002948">Titus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>. Their, uncles took them into the conspiracy, there were others besides, whose names have been lost.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In the meantime the opinion that the property ought to be restored was adopted by the majority of the senate, and this enabled the envoys to prolong their stay, as the consuls required time to provide vehicles for conveying the goods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They employed their time in consultations with the conspirators, and they insisted on getting a letter, which they were to give to the Tarquins, for without such a guarantee, they argued, how could they be sure that their envoys had not brought back empty promises in a matter of such vast importance?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A letter was accordingly given as a pledge of good faith, and this it was that led to the discovery of the plot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The day previous to the departure of the envoys they happened to be dining at the house of the Vitellii. After all who were not in the secret had left, the conspirators discussed many details respecting their projected treason, which were overheard by one of the slaves, who had previously
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> suspected that something was afoot, but was waiting for the moment when the letter should be given, as its seizure would be a complete proof of the plot. When he found that it had been given, he disclosed the affair to the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They at once proceeded to arrest the envoys and the conspirators, and crushed the whole plot without exciting any alarm. Their first care was to secure the letter before it was destroyed. The traitors were forthwith thrown into prison; there was some hesitation in dealing with the envoys, and although they had evidently been guilty of a hostile act, the rights of international law were accorded them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The question of the restoration of the property was referred anew to the senate, who yielding to their feelings of resentment prohibited its restoration, and forbade its being brought into the treasury; it was given as plunder to the plebs, that their share in this spoliation might destroy for ever any prospect of peaceable relations with the Tarquins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The land of the Tarquins, which lay between the City and the <placeName key="tgn,2061783">Tiber</placeName>, was henceforth sacred to <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> and known as the <placeName key="tgn,7014001">Campus Martius</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There happened, it is said, to be a crop of corn there which was ripe for the harvest, and as it would have been sacrilege to consume what was growing on the Campus, a large body of men were sent to cut it. They carried it, straw and all, in baskets to the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, and threw it into the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was the height of the summer and the stream was low, consequently the corn stuck in the shallows, and heaps of it were covered with mud; gradually as the debris which the river brought down collected there, an island was formed. I believe that it was subsequently raised and strengthened so that the surface might be high enough above the water, and firm enough to carry temples and colonnades.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After the royal property had been disposed of, the traitors were sentenced and executed. Their punishment created a great sensation owing to the fact that the consular office imposed upon a father the duty of inflicting punishment on his own children; he who ought not to have witnessed it was destined to be the one to see it duly carried out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Youths belonging to the noblest families were standing tied to the post, but all eyes were turned to the consul's children, the others were unnoticed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Men did not grieve more for their punishment than for the crime which had incurred it &mdash;that they should have conceived the idea, in that year above all, of betraying to one, who had been a ruthless tyrant and was now an exile and an enemy, a newly liberated country, their father, who had liberated it, the consulship which had originated in the Junian house, the senate, the plebs, all that <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> possessed of human or divine.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The consuls took their seats, the lictors were told off to inflict the penalty; they scourged their bared backs with rods and then beheaded them. During the whole time, the father's countenance betrayed his feelings, but the father's stern resolution was still more apparent as he superintended the public execution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After the guilty had paid the penalty, a notable example of a different nature was provided to act as a deterrent of crime, the informer was assigned a sum of money from the treasury and he was given his liberty and the rights of citizenship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He is said to have been the first to be made free by the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">vindicta</foreign>.</q> Some suppose this designation to have been derived from him, his name being Vindicius. After him it was the rule that those who were made free in this way were considered to be admitted to the citizenship.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Tarquin, Death of Brutus.</note> A detailed report of these matters reached Tarquin. He was not only furious at the failure of plans from which he had hoped so much, but he was filled with rage at finding the way blocked against secret intrigues; and consequently determined upon open war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He visited the cities of Etruria and appealed for help; in particular, he implored the people of <placeName key="tgn,7009104">Veii</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Tarquinii">Tarquinii</placeName> not to allow one to perish before their eyes who was of the same blood with them, and from being a powerful monarch was now, with his children, homeless and destitute.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had no single person amongst them deemed worthy to reign, so they had distributed the kingly authority amongst themselves, and had given his property as plunder to the people, that all might be involved in the crime. He wanted to recover his country and his throne and punish his ungrateful subjects.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Veientines must help him and furnish him with resources, they must set about avenging their own wrongs also, their legions so often cut to pieces, their territory torn from them.</p> <p>This appeal decided the Veientines, they one and all loudly demanded that their former humiliations should be wiped out and their losses made good, now that they had a Roman to lead them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The people of <placeName key="perseus,Tarquinii">Tarquinii</placeName> were won over by the name and nationality of the exile; they were proud of having a countryman as king in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> So two armies from these cities followed Tarquin to recover his crown and chastise the Romans. When they had entered the Roman territory the consuls advanced against them; Valerius with the infantry in phalanx formation,<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed"><emph>phalanx formation</emph> &mdash;The legion would thus present a front of 500 heavy-armed soldiers, six file deep.</note> Brutus reconnoitering in advance with the
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> cavalry. Similarly the enemy's cavalry was in front of his main body, Arruns Tarquin, the king's son, in command; the king himself followed with the legionaries. Whilst still at a distance Arruns distinguished the consul by his escort of lictors; as they drew nearer he clearly recognised Brutus by his features, and in a transport of rage exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">That is the man who drove us from our country; see him proudly advancing, adorned with our
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> insignia! Ye gods, avengers of kings, aid me!</q> With these words, he dug spurs into his horse and rode straight at the consul. Brutus saw that he was making for
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> him. It was a point of honour in those days for the leaders to engage in single combat, so he eagerly accepted the challenge, and they charged with such fury, neither of them thinking of protecting himself, if only he could wound his foe, that each drove his spear at the same moment through the other's shield, and they fell dying from their horses, with the spears sticking in
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> them. The rest of the cavalry at once engaged, and not long after the infantry came up. The battle raged with varying fortune, the two armies being fairly matched; the right wing of each was victorious, the left
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> defeated. The Veientes, accustomed to defeat at the hands of the Romans, were scattered in flight, but the Tarquinians, a new foe, not only held their ground, but forced the Romans to give way.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the battle had gone in this way, so great a panic seized Tarquin and the Etruscans that the two armies of <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Tarquinii">Tarquinii</placeName>, on the approach of night, despairing of success, left the field and departed for their homes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The story of the battle was enriched by marvels. In the silence of the next night a great voice is said to have come from the forest of Arsia, believed to be the voice of Silvanus, which spoke thus: <q direct="unspecified">The fallen of the Tusci are one more than those of their foe; the Roman is conqueror.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At all events the Romans left the field as victors; the Etruscans regarded themselves as vanquished, for when daylight appeared not a single enemy was in sight.</p> <p>P. Valerius, the consul, collected the spoils and returned in triumph to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He celebrated his colleague's obsequies with all the pomp possible in those days, but far greater honour was done to the dead by the universal mourning, which was rendered specially noteworthy by the fact that the matrons were a whole year in mourning for him, because he had been such a determined avenger of violated chastity.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Growing Popularity of Valerius.</note> this the surviving consul, who had been in such favour with the multitude, found himself &mdash;such is its fickleness &mdash;not only unpopular but an object of suspicion, and that of a very grave character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was rumoured that he was aiming at monarchy, for he had held no election to fill Brutus' place, and he was building a house on the top of the <placeName key="perseus,Velia">Velia</placeName>, an impregnable fortress was being constructed on that high and strong position.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul felt hurt at finding these rumours so widely believed, and summoned the people to an assembly.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> consul. Then, after securing silence, he began to eulogise the good fortune of his colleague who had met his death, as a liberator of his country, possessing the highest honour it could bestow, fighting for the commonwealth, whilst his glory was as yet undimmed by jealousy and distrust. Whereas he himself had outlived his glory and fallen on days of suspicion and opprobrium; from being a liberator of his country he had sunk to the level of the Aquilii and
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Vitellii. <q direct="unspecified">Will you,</q> he cried, <q direct="unspecified">never deem any man's merit so assured that it cannot be tainted by suspicion? Am I, the most determined foe to kings, to dread the suspicion of desiring to be one

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Laws were passed which not only cleared the consul from suspicion but produced such a reaction that he won the people's affections, hence his sobriquet of Publicola.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The most popular of these laws were those which granted a right of appeal from the magistrate to the people and devoted to the gods the person and property of any one who entertained projects of becoming king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Valerius secured the passing of these laws while still sole consul, that the people might feel grateful solely to him; afterwards he held the elections for the appointment of a colleague. The consul elected was Sp. Lucretius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But he had not, owing to his great age, strength enough to discharge the duties of his office, and within a few days he died. M. Horatius Pulvillus was elected in his place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In some ancient authors I find no mention of Lucretius, Horatius being named immediately after Brutus; as he did nothing of any note during his office, I suppose, his memory has perished.</p> <p>The temple of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> on the Capitol had not yet been dedicated, and the consuls drew lots to decide which should dedicate it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The lot fell to Horatius. Publicola set out for the Veientine war. His friends showed unseemly annoyance at the dedication of so illustrious a fane being assigned to Horatius, and tried every means of preventing it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When all else failed, they tried to alarm the consul, whilst he was actually holding the door-post<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed">The dedication of temples was usually conducted by the supreme magistrate. He laid his hand on the doorpost, thus symbolically handing over the building to the god, whilst he recited after the Pontifex the dedicatory prayer.

As to whether he disbelieved the message, or whether his conduct simply showed extraordinary self-control, there is no definite tradition, and it is not easy to decide from the records.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He only allowed the message to interrupt him so far that he gave orders for the body to be burnt; then, with his hand still on the door-post, he finished the prayer and dedicated the temple.</p> <p>These were the principal incidents at home and in the field during the first year after the expulsion of the royal family.

At one time they entreated him not to allow men of Etruscan race, of the same blood as himself, to wander as penniless exiles; at another they would warn him not to let the new fashion of expelling kings go unpunished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Liberty, they urged, possessed fascination enough in itself;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> unless kings defend their authority with as much energy as their subjects show in quest of liberty, all things come to a dead level, there will be no one thing preeminent or superior to all else in the State; there will soon be an end of kingly power, which is the most beautiful thing, whether amongst gods or amongst mortal men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Porsena considered that the presence of an Etruscan upon the Roman throne would be an honour to his nation; accordingly he advanced with an army against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Never before had the senate been in such a state of alarm, so great at that time was the power of <placeName key="perseus,Clusium">Clusium</placeName> and the reputation of Porsena. They feared not only the enemy but even their own fellow-citizens, lest the plebs, overcome by their fears, should admit the Tarquins into the City, and accept peace even though it meant slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Many concessions were made at that time to the plebs by the senate. Their first care was to lay in a stock of corn, and commissioners were despatched to Vulsi and <placeName key="perseus,Cumae">Cumae</placeName> to collect supplies. The sale of salt, hitherto in the hands of private individuals who had raised the price to a high figure, was now wholly transferred to the State. The plebs were exempted from the payment of harbour-dues and the war-tax, so that they might fall on the rich, who could bear the burden; the poor were held to pay sufficient to the State if they brought up their children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This generous action of the senate maintained the harmony of the commonwealth through the subsequent stress of siege and famine so completely that the name of king was not more abhorrent to the

The weak places in the defences were occupied by military posts; elsewhere the walls and the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> were deemed sufficient protection.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The enemy would have forced their way over the Sublician bridge had it not been for one man, Horatius Cocles. The good fortune of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> provided him as her bulwark on that memorable day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He happened to be on guard at the bridge when he saw the Janiculum taken by a sudden assault and the enemy rushing down from it to the river, whilst his own men, a panic-struck mob, were deserting their posts and throwing away their arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He reproached them one after another for their cowardice, tried to stop them, appealed to them in heaven's name to stand, declared that it was in vain for them to seek safety in flight whilst leaving the bridge open behind them, there would very soon be more of the enemy on the <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> and the Capitol than there were on the Janiculum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So he shouted to them to break down the bridge by sword or fire, or by whatever means they could, he would meet the enemies' attack so far as one man could keep them at bay. He advanced to the head of the bridge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Amongst the fugitives, whose backs alone were visible to the enemy, he was conspicuous as he fronted them armed for fight at close quarters. The enemy were astounded at his preternatural courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Two men were kept by a sense of shame from deserting him &mdash;Sp. Lartius and T. Herminius &mdash;both of them men of high birth and renowned courage. With them he sustained the first tempestuous shock and wild confused onset, for a brief interval.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then, whilst only a small portion of the bridge remained and those who were cutting it down called upon them to retire, he insisted upon these, too, retreating.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Looking round with eyes dark with menace upon the Etruscan chiefs, he challenged them to single combat, and reproached them all with being the slaves of tyrant kings, and whilst unmindful of their own liberty coming to attack that of others. For some time they hesitated, each looking round upon the others to begin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At length shame roused them to action, and raising a shout they hurled their javelins from all sides on their solitary foe. He caught them on his outstretched shield, and with unshaken resolution kept his place on the bridge with firmly planted foot. They were just attempting to dislodge him by a charge when the crash of the broken bridge and the shout which the Romans raised at seeing the work completed stayed the attack by filling them with sudden panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then Cocles said, <q direct="unspecified">Tiberinus, holy father, I pray thee to receive into thy propitious stream these arms and this thy warrior.</q> So, fully armed, he leaped into the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, and though many missiles fell over him he swam across in safety to his friends: an act of daring more famous than credible with posterity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The State showed its gratitude for such courage; his statue was set up in the Comitium, and as much land given to him as he could drive the plough round in one day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Besides this public honour, the citizens individually showed their feeling; for, in spite of the great scarcity, each, in proportions to his means, sacrificed what he could from his own store as a gift to Cocles.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Repulsed<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Story of Mucius Scaevola.</note> in his first attempt, Porsena changed his plans from assault to blockade. After placing a detachment to hold the Janiculum he fixed his camp on the plain between that hill and the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> and sent everywhere for boats, partly to intercept any attempt to get corn into <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and partly to carry his troops across to different spots for plunder, as opportunity might serve.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In a short time he made the whole of the district round <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> so insecure that not only were all the crops removed from the fields but even the cattle were all driven into the City, nor did any one venture to take them outside the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The impunity with which the Etruscans committed their depredations was due to strategy on the part of the Romans more than to fear. For the consul Valerius, determined to get an opportunity of attacking them when they were scattered in large numbers over the fields, allowed small forages to pass unnoticed, whilst he was reserving himself for vengeance on a larger scale.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So to draw on the pillagers, he gave orders to a considerable body of his men to drive cattle out of the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> gate, which was the furthest from the enemy, in the expectation that they would gain intelligence of it through the slaves who were deserting, owing to the scarcity produced by the blockade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The information was duly conveyed, and in consequence they crossed the river in larger numbers than usual in the hope of securing the whole lot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> P. Valerius ordered T. Herminius with a small body of troops to take up a concealed position at a distance of two miles on the Gabian road, whilst Sp. Lartius with some light-armed infantry was to post himself at the Colline gate until the enemy had passed him and then to intercept their retreat to the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The other consul, T. Lucretius, with a few maniples made a sortie from the Naevian gate; Valerius himself led some picked cohorts from the Caelian hill, and these were the first to attract the enemy's notice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When Herminius became aware that fighting was begun, he rose from ambush and took the enemy who were engaged with Valerius in rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Answering cheers arose right and left, from the Colline and the Naevian gates, and the pillagers, hemmed in, unequal to the fight, and with every way of escape blocked, were cut to pieces. That put an end to these irregular and scattered excursions on the part of the Etruscans.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The blockade, however, continued, and with it a growing scarcity of corn at famine prices. Porsena still cherished hopes of capturing the City by keeping up the investment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was a young noble, C. Mucius, who regarded it as a disgrace that whilst <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in the days of servitude under her kings had never been blockaded in any war or by any foe, she should now, in the day of her freedom, be besieged by those very Etruscans whose armies she had often routed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thinking that this disgrace ought to be avenged by some great deed of daring, he determined in the first instance to penetrate into the enemy's camp on his own responsibility.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On second thoughts, however, he became apprehensive that if he went without orders from the consuls, or unknown to any one, and happened to be arrested by the Roman outposts, he might be brought back as a deserter, a charge which the condition of the City at the time would make only too probable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So he went to the senate. <q direct="unspecified">I wish,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">Fathers, to swim the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>, and, if I can, enter the enemy's camp, not as a pillager nor to inflict retaliation for their pillagings. I am purposing, with heaven's help, a greater deed.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate gave their approval. Concealing a sword in his robe, he started.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he reached the camp he took his stand in the densest part of the crowd near the royal tribunal. It happened to be the soldiers' pay-day, and a secretary, sitting by the king and dressed almost exactly like him, was busily engaged, as the soldiers kept coming to him incessantly. Afraid to ask which of the two was the king, lest his ignorance should betray him, Mucius struck as fortune directed the blow and killed the secretary instead of the king.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He tried to force his way back with his blood-stained dagger through the dismayed crowd, but the shouting caused a rush to be made to the spot; he was seized and dragged back by the king's bodyguard to the royal tribunal. Here, alone and helpless, and in the utmost peril, he was still able to inspire more fear than he felt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <q direct="unspecified">I am a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">men call me C. Mucius. As an enemy I wished to kill an enemy, and I have as much courage to meet death as I had to inflict it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is the Roman nature to act bravely and to suffer bravely. I am not alone in having made this resolve against you, behind me there is a long list of those who aspire to the same distinction. If then it is your pleasure, make up your mind for a struggle in which you will every hour have to fight for your life and find an armed foe on the threshold of your royal tent.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This is the war which we, the youth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, declare against you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> You have no serried ranks, no pitched battle to fear, the matter will be settled between you alone and each one of us singly.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The king, furious with anger, and at the same time terrified at the unknown danger, threatened that if he did not promptly explain the nature of the plot which he was darkly hinting at he should be roasted alive. <q direct="unspecified">Look,</q> Mucius cried, <q direct="unspecified">and learn how lightly those regard their bodies who have some great glory in view.</q> Then he plunged his right hand into a fire burning on the altar.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Whilst he kept it roasting there as if he were devoid of all sensation, the king, astounded at his preternatural conduct, sprang from his seat and ordered the youth to be removed from the altar. <q direct="unspecified">Go,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">you have been a worse enemy to yourself than to me. I would invoke blessings on your courage if it were displayed on behalf of my country; as it is, I send you away exempt from all rights of war, unhurt, and safe.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then Mucius, reciprocating, as it were, this generous treatment. said, <q direct="unspecified">Since you honour courage, know that what you could not gain by threats you have obtained by kindness. Three hundred of us, the foremost amongst the Roman youth, have sworn to attack you in this way.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The lot fell to me first, the rest, in the order of their lot will come each in his turn till fortune shall give us a favourable chance against you.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Mucius was accordingly dismissed; afterwards he received the sobriquet of Scaevola from the loss of his right hand. Envoys from Porsena followed him to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The king's narrow escape from the first of many attempts which was owing solely to the mistake of his assailant, and the prospect of having to meet as many attacks as there were conspirators, so unnerved him that he made proposals of peace to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> One for the restoration of the Tarquins was put forward, more because he could not well refuse their request than because he had any hope of its being granted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The demand for the restitution of their territory to the Veientines, and that for the surrender of hostages as a condition of the withdrawal of the detachment from the Janiculum, were felt by the Romans to be inevitable, and on their being accepted and peace concluded, Porsena moved his troops from the Janiculum and evacuated the Roman territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As a recognition of his courage the senate gave C. Mucius a piece of land across the river, which was afterwards known as the Mucian Meadows.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Story of Cloelia</note> honour thus paid to courage incited even women to do glorious things for the State. The Etruscan camp was situated not far from the city, and the maiden Cloelia, one of the hostages, escaped, unobserved, through the guards and at the head of her sister hostages swam across the river amidst a shower of javelins and restored them all safe to their relatives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the news of this incident reached him, the king was at first exceedingly angry and sent to demand the surrender of Cloelia; the others he did not care about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Afterwards his feelings changed to admiration; he said that the exploit surpassed those of Cocles and Mucius, and announced that whilst on the one hand he should consider the treaty broken if she were not surrendered, he would on the other hand, if she were surrendered, send her back to her people unhurt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Both sides behaved honourably; the Romans surrendered her as a pledge of loyalty to the terms of the treaty; the Etruscan king showed that with him courage was not only safe but honoured, and after eulogising the girl's conduct, told her that he would make her a present of half the remaining hostages, she was to choose whom she would.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is said that after all had been brought before her, she chose the boys of tender age; a choice in keeping with maidenly modesty, and one approved by the hostages themselves, since they felt that the age which was most liable to ill-treatment should have the preference in being rescued from hostile hands.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>After peace was thus re-established, the Romans rewarded the unprecedented courage shown by a woman by an unprecedented honour, namely an equestrian statue. On the highest part of the Sacred Way a statue was erected representing the maiden sitting on horseback.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Quite<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Final Attempt to restore the Tarquins.</note> inconsistent with this peaceful withdrawal from the City on the part of the Etruscan king is the custom which, with other formalities, has been handed down from antiquity to our own age of <q direct="unspecified">selling the goods of King Porsena.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This custom must either have been introduced during the war and kept up after peace was made, or else it must have a less bellicose origin than would be implied by the description of the goods sold as <q direct="unspecified">taken from the enemy.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The most probable tradition is that Porsena, knowing the City to be without food owing to the long investment, made the Romans a present of his richly-stored camp, in which provisions had been collected from the neighbouring fertile fields of Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then, to prevent the people seizing them indiscriminately as spoils of war, they were regularly sold, under the description of <q direct="unspecified">the goods of Porsena,</q> a description indicating rather the gratitude of the people than an auction of the king's personal property, which had never been at the disposal of the Romans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To prevent his expedition from appearing entirely fruitless, Porsena, after bringing the war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to a close, sent his son Aruns with a part of his force to attack <placeName key="perseus,Aricia">Aricia</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first the Aricians were dismayed by the unexpected movement, but the succours which in response to their request were sent from the Latin towns and from <placeName key="perseus,Cumae">Cumae</placeName> so far encouraged them that they ventured to offer battle. At the commencement of the action the Etruscans attacked with such vigour that they routed the Aricians at the first charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Cuman cohorts made a strategical flank movement, and when the enemy had pressed forward in disordered pursuit, they wheeled round and attacked them in the rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Thus the Etruscans, now all but victorious, were hemmed in and cut to pieces. A very small remnant, after losing their general, made for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, as there was no nearer place of safety. Without arms, and in the guise of suppliants, they were kindly received and distributed amongst different houses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After recovering from their wounds, some left for their homes, to tell of the kind hospitality they had received; many remained behind out of affection for their hosts and the City. A district was assigned to them to dwell in, which subsequently bore the designation of <q direct="unspecified">the Tuscan quarter.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new consuls were Sp. Lartius and T. Herminius. This year Porsena made the last attempt to effect the restoration of the Tarquins. The ambassadors whom he had despatched to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with this object were informed that the senate were going to send an embassy to the king, and the most honourable of the senators were forthwith despatched.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They stated that the reason why a select number of senators had been sent to him in preference to a reply being given to his ambassadors at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was not that they had been unable to give the brief answer that, kings would never be allowed in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but simply that all mention of the matter might be for ever dropped, that after the interchange of so many kindly acts there might be no cause of irritation, for he, Porsena, was asking for what would be against the liberty of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The Romans, if they did not wish to hasten their own ruin, would have to refuse the request of one to whom they wished to refuse nothing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was not a monarchy, but a free City, and they had made up their minds to open their gates even to an enemy sooner than to a king. It was the universal wish that whatever put an end to liberty in the City should put an end to the City itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They begged him, if he wished <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to be safe, to allow it to be free.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Touched with a feeling of sympathy and respect, the king replied, <q direct="unspecified">Since this is your fixed and unalterable determination, I will not harass you by fruitless proposals, nor will I deceive the Tarquins by holding out hopes of an assistance which I am powerless to render. Whether they insist on war or are prepared to live quietly, in either case they must seek another place of exile than this, to prevent any interruption of the peace between you and me.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He followed up his words by still stronger practical proofs of friendship, for he returned the remainder of the hostages and restored the Veientine territory which had been taken away under the treaty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As all hope of restoration was cut off, Tarquin went to his son-in-law Mamilius Octavius at <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>. So the peace between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and Porsena remained unbroken.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Then the Sabines made preparations for war on a larger scale. To oppose them and also at the same time to guard against danger in the direction of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>, from which place war, though not openly declared, was still apprehended, the consuls elected were P. Valerius for the fourth time and T. Lucretius for the second.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>A conflict which broke out amongst the Sabines between the peace party and the war party brought an accession of strength to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Attius Clausus, who was afterwards known in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> as Appius Claudius, was an advocate for peace, but, unable to maintain his ground against the opposing faction, who were stirring up war, he fled to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with a large body of clients.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were admitted to the citizenship and received a grant of land lying beyond the Anio. They were called the Old Claudian tribe, and their numbers were added to by fresh tribesmen from that district. After his election into the senate it was not long before Appius gained a prominent position in that body.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The consuls marched into the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory, and by their devastation of the country and the defeats which they inflicted so weakened the enemy that no renewal of the war was to be feared for a long time. The Romans returned home in triumph.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The following year, in the consulship of Agrippa Menenius and P. Postumius, P. Valerius died. He was universally admitted to be first in the conduct of war and the arts of peace, but though he enjoyed such an immense reputation, his private fortune was so scanty that it could not defray the expenses of his funeral.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were met by the State. The matrons mourned for him as a second Brutus.</p> <p>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Auruncans.</note> the same year two Latin colonies, Pometia and <placeName key="perseus,Cora">Cora</placeName>, revolted to the Auruncans. War commenced, and after the defeat of an immense army which had sought to oppose the advance of the consuls into their territory, the whole war was centred round Pometia.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was no respite from bloodshed after the battle any more than during the fighting, many more were killed than were taken prisoners; the prisoners were everywhere butchered; even the hostages, three hundred of whom they had in their hands, fell a victim to the enemy's bloodthirsty rage.</p> <p>This year also there was a triumph in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls who succeeded, Opiter Verginius and Sp. Cassius, tried at first to take Pometia by storm, then they had recourse to regular siege-works.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Actuated more by a spirit of mortal hatred than by any hope or chance of success, the Auruncans made a sortie. The greater number were armed with blazing torches, and they carried flames and death everywhere.

After an interval, long enough for the recovery of the wounded and the filling up of the ranks, operations were resumed at Pometia in stronger force and in a more angry
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> temper. The <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign> were repaired and the other vast works were made good, and when everything was ready for the soldiers to mount the walls, the place
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> surrendered. The Auruncans, however, were treated with no less rigour after they had surrendered the city than if it had been taken by assault; the principal men were beheaded, the rest of the townsfolk sold as slaves. The town was razed, the land put up for
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> sale. The consuls celebrated a triumph more because of the terrible vengeance they had inflicted than on account of the importance of the war now terminated.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Dictatorship.</note> following year had as consuls Postumius Cominius and T. Lartius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> During this year an incident occurred which, though small in itself, threatened to lead to the renewal of a war more formidable than the Latin war which was dreaded. During the games at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> some courtesans were carried off by <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> youths in sheer wantonness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A crowd gathered, and a quarrel arose which became almost a pitched battle. The alarm was increased by the authentic report that at the instigation of Octavius Mamilius<note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed"><emph>Mamilius Octavius</emph> &mdash;Tarquin's son-in-law, mentioned at the end of chap. xv.</note> the thirty Latin towns had formed a
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> league. The apprehensions felt by the State at such a serious crisis led to suggestions being made for the first time for the appointment of a dictator. It is not, however, clearly ascertained in what year this office was created, or who the consuls were who had forfeited the confidence of the people owing to their being adherents of the Tarquins &mdash;for this, too, is part of the tradition &mdash;or who was the first
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> dictator. In the most ancient authorities I find that it was T. Lartius, and that Sp. Cassius was his master of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> horse. Only men of consular rank were eligible under the law governing the appointment. This makes me more inclined to believe that Lartius, who was of consular rank, was set over the consuls to restrain and direct them rather than Manlius Valerius, the son of Marcus and grandson of
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Volesus. Besides, if they wanted the dictator to be chosen from that family especially, they would have much sooner chosen the father, M. Valerius, a man of proved worth and also of consular rank.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>When, for the first time, a Dictator was created in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, a great fear fell on the people, after they saw the axes<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed"><emph>axes</emph> &mdash;The sign of the Dictator's absolute power over life and death, from whom there was no appeal. By the Valerian Law (chap. viii.) the consuls did not have the axes in the City; their appearance now excited alarm.</note> borne before him, and consequently they were more careful to obey his orders. For there was not, as in the case of the consuls, each of whom possessed the same authority, any chance of securing the aid of one against the other, nor was there any right of appeal, nor in short was there any safety anywhere except in
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> punctilious obedience.</p> <p>The Sabines were even more alarmed at the appointment of a Dictator than the Romans, because they were convinced that it was in their account that he had
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> been created. Accordingly envoys were sent with proposals for peace. They begged the Dictator and the senate to pardon what was a youthful escapade, but were told in reply that young men could be pardoned, but not old men, who were continually stirring up
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> fresh wars. However, the negotiations continued and peace would have been secured if the Sabines could have made up their minds to comply with the demand to make good the expenses of the war.</p> <p>War was proclaimed; an informal truce kept the year undisturbed.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next consuls were Ser. Sulpicius and Manlius Tullius. Nothing worth recording took place.</p> <p>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Battle at Lake Regillus.</note> consuls of the following year were T. Aebutius and C. Vetusius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> During their consulship Fidenae was besieged; Crustumeria captured; <placeName key="perseus,Praeneste">Praeneste</placeName> revolted from the Latins to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p> <p>The Latin war which had been threatening for some years now at last broke out.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A. Postumius, the Dictator, and T. Aebutius, Master of the Horse, advanced with a large force of infantry and cavalry to the Lake Regillus in the district of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName> and came upon the main army of the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On hearing that the Tarquins were in the army of the Latins, the passions of the Romans were so roused that they determined to engage at once.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The battle that followed was more obstinately and desperately fought than any previous ones had been. For the commanders not only took their part in directing the action, they fought personally against each other, and hardly one of the leaders in either army, with the exception of the Roman Dictator, left the field unwounded.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Tarquinius Superbus, though now enfeebled by age, spurred his horse against Postumius, who in the front of the line was addressing and forming his men. He was struck in the side and carried off by a body of his followers into a place of safety.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Similarly on the other wing Aebutius, Master of the Horse, directed his attack against Octavius Mamilius; the Tusculan leader saw him coming and rode at him full speed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So terrific was the shock that Aebutius' arm was pierced,: Mamilius was speared in the breast, and led off by the Latins into their second line.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Aebutius, unable to hold a weapon with his wounded arm, retired from the fighting. The Latin leader, in no way deterred by his wound, infused fresh energy into the combat, for, seeing that his own men were wavering, he called up the cohort of Roman exiles, who were led by Lucius Tarquinius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The loss of country and fortune made them fight all the more desperately; for a short time they restored the battle, and the Romans who were opposed to them began to give ground.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>M. Valerius, the brother of Publicola, catching sight of the fiery young Tarquin conspicuous in the front line, dug spurs into his horse and made for him with levelled lance, eager to enhance the pride of his house, that the family who boasted of having expelled the Tarquins might
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> have the glory of killing them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Tarquin evaded his foe by retiring behind his men. Valerius, riding headlong into the ranks of the exiles, was run through by a spear from behind. This did not check the horse's speed, and the Roman sank dying to the ground, his arms falling upon him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the Dictator Postumius saw that one of his principal officers had fallen, and that the exiles were rushing on furiously in a compact mass whilst his men were shaken and giving ground, he ordered his own cohort &mdash;a
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> picked force who formed his bodyguard &mdash;to treat any of their own side whom they saw in flight as enemy. Threatened in front and rear the Romans turned and faced the foe, and closed their ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Dictator's cohort, fresh in mind and body, now came into action and attacked the exhausted exiles with great slaughter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Another single combat between the leaders took place; the Latin commander saw the cohort of exiles almost hemmed in by the Roman Dictator, and hurried to the front with some maniples of the reserves. T. Herminius saw them coming, and recognised Mamilius by his dress and arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He attacked the enemies' commander much more fiercely than the Master of the Horse had previously done, so much so, in fact, that he killed him by a single spear-thrust through his side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whilst despoiling the body he himself was struck by a javelin, and after being carried back to the camp, expired whilst his wound was being dressed. Then the Dictator hurried up to the cavalry and appealed to them to relieve the infantry, who were worn out with the struggle, by dismounting and fighting on foot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They obeyed, leaped from their horses, and protecting themselves with their targets, fought in front of the standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The infantry recovered their courage at once when they saw the flower of the nobility fighting on equal terms and sharing the same dangers with themselves. At last the Latins were forced back, wavered, and finally broke their ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The cavalry had their horses brought up that they might commence the pursuit, the infantry followed. It is said that the Dictator, omitting nothing that could secure divine or human aid, vowed, during the battle, a temple to Castor and promised rewards to those who should be the first and second to enter the enemies' camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Such was the ardour which the Romans displayed that in the same charge which routed the enemy they carried their camp.</p> <p>Thus was the battle fought at Lake Regillus. The Dictator and the Master of the Horse returned in triumph to the City.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Death of Tarquin.</note> the next three years there was neither settled peace nor open war. The consuls were Q. Cloelius and T. Larcius. They were succeeded by A. Sempronius and M. Minucius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> During their consulship a temple was dedicated to Saturn and the festival of the Saturnalia instituted. The next consuls were A. Postumius and T. Verginius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I find in some authors this year given as the date of the battle at Lake Regillus, and that A. Postumius laid down his consulship because the fidelity of his colleague was suspected, on which a Dictator was appointed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So many errors as to dates occur, owing to the order in which the consuls succeeded being variously given, that the remoteness in time of both the events and the authorities make it impossible to determine either which consuls succeeded which, or in what year any particular event occurred.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Ap. Claudius and P. Servilius were the next consuls. This year is memorable for the news of Tarquin's death. His death took place at <placeName key="tgn,7006931">Cuma</placeName>, whither he had retired, to seek the protection of the tyrant Aristodemus after the power of the Latins was broken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The news was received with delight by both senate and plebs. But the elation of the patricians was carried to excess. Up to that time they had treated the commons with the utmost deference, now their leaders began to practise injustice upon them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The same year a fresh batch of colonists was sent to complete the number at <placeName key="perseus,Signia">Signia</placeName>, a colony founded by King Tarquin. The number of tribes at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was increased to twenty-one. The temple of Mercury was dedicated on May 15.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Volscians &mdash;Treaty with the Latins.</note> relations with the Volscians during the Latin war were neither friendly nor openly hostile. The Volscians had collected a force which they were intending to send to the aid of the Latins had not the Dictator forestalled them by the rapidity of his movements, a rapidity due to his anxiety to avoid a battle with the combined
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> armies. To punish them the consuls led the legions into the Volscian country. This unexpected movement paralysed the Volscians, who were not expecting retribution for what had been only an intention. Unable to offer resistance, they gave as hostages three hundred children belonging to their nobility, drawn from <placeName key="perseus,Cora">Cora</placeName> and Pometia. The legions, accordingly, were marched back without
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> fighting.</p> <p>Relieved from the immediate danger, the Volscians soon fell back on their old policy, and after forming an armed alliance with the Hernicans, made secret preparations for
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> war. They also despatched envoys through the length and breadth of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> to induce that nation to join them. But after their defeat at Lake Regillus the Latins were so incensed against every one who advocated a resumption of hostilities that they did not even spare the Volscian envoys, who were arrested and conducted to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. There they were handed over to the consuls and evidence was produced showing that the Volscians and Hernicans were preparing for war with
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. When the matter was brought before the senate, they were so gratified by the action of the Latins that they sent back six thousand prisoners<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed"><emph>prisoners</emph> &mdash;Probably captured in the battle at Lake Regillus.</note> who had been sold into slavery, and also referred to the new magistrates the question of a treaty which they had hitherto persistently refused
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> to consider. The Latins congratulated themselves upon the course they had adopted, and the advocates of peace were in high honour. They sent a golden crown as a gift to the
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Capitoline Jupiter. The deputation who brought the gift were accompanied by a large number of the released prisoners, who visited the houses where they had worked as slaves to thank their former masters for the kindness and consideration shown them in their misfortunes, and to form ties of hospitality with them. At no previous period had the Latin nation been on more friendly terms both politically and personally with the Roman government.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Volscian War and The First Secession of the Plebs.</note> But a war with the Volscians was imminent, and the State was torn with internal dissensions; the patricians and the plebeians were bitterly hostile to one another,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> owing mainly to the desperate condition of the debtors. They loudly complained that whilst fighting in the field for liberty and empire they were oppressed and enslaved by their fellow-citizens at home; their freedom was more secure in war than in peace, safer amongst the enemy than amongst their own people. The discontent, which was becoming of itself continually more embittered, was still
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> further inflamed by the signal misfortunes of one individual.</p> <p>An old man, bearing visible proofs of all the evils he had suffered, suddenly appeared in the Forum. His clothing was covered with filth, his personal appearance was made still more loathsome by a corpse-like pallor and emaciation, his unkempt
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> beard and hair made him look like a savage. In spite of this disfigurement he was recognised by the pitying bystanders; they said that he had been a centurion, and mentioned other military distinctions he possessed. He bared his breast and showed the scars which witnessed to many fights in which he had borne an honourable part. The crowd had now almost grown
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> to the dimensions of an Assembly of the people. He was asked, <q direct="unspecified">Whence came that garb, whence that disfigurement?</q> He stated that whilst serving in the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> war he had not only lost the produce of his land through the depredations of the enemy, but his farm had been burnt, all his property plundered, his cattle driven away, the war-tax demanded when he was least able
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> to pay it, and he had got into debt. This debt had been vastly increased through usury and had stripped him first of his father's and grandfather's farm, then of his other property, and at last like a pestilence had reached his person. He had been carried off by his creditor, not into slavery
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> only, but into an underground workshop, a living death. Then he showed his back scored with recent marks of the lash.</p> <p>On seeing and hearing all this a great outcry arose; the excitement was not confined to
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the Forum, it spread every where throughout the City. Men who were in bondage for debt and those who had been released rushed from all sides into the public streets and invoked <q direct="unspecified">the protection of the Quirites.</q> <note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed">The formula in which a man appealed to his fellow-citizens for help.</note> Every one was eager to join the malcontents, numerous
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> bodies ran shouting through all the streets to the Forum. Those of the senators who happened to be in the Forum and fell in with the mob were in great danger of their lives. Open violence would have been resorted to, had not the consuls, P.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Servilius and Ap. Claudius, promptly intervened to quell the outbreak. The crowd surged round them, showed their chains and other marks of degradation. These, they said, were their rewards for having served their country; they tauntingly reminded the consuls of the various campaigns in which they had fought, and peremptorily demanded
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> rather than petitioned that the senate should be called together. Then they closed round the Senate-house, determined to be themselves the arbiters and directors of public policy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>A very small number of senators, who happened to be available, were got together by the consuls, the rest were afraid to go even to the Forum, much more to the Senate-house. No business could
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> be transacted owing to the requisite number not being present. The people began to think that they were being played with and put off, that the absent senators were not kept away by accident or by fear, but in order to prevent any redress of their grievances, and that
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> the consuls themselves were shuffling and laughing at their misery. Matters were reaching the point at which not even the majesty of the consuls could keep the enraged people in check, when the absentees, uncertain whether they ran the greater risk by staying away or coming, at last entered the Senate-house. The House was now full, and a division of opinion showed itself not
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> only amongst the senators but even between the two consuls. Appius, a man of passionate temperament, was of opinion that the matter ought to be settled by a display of authority on the part of the consuls; if one or two were brought up for trial, the rest would calm down. Servilius, more inclined to gentle measures, thought that when men's passions are aroused it was safer and easier to bend them than to break them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the middle of these disturbances, fresh alarm was created by some Latin horsemen who galloped in with the disquieting tidings that a Volscian army was on the march to attack the City. This intelligence affected the patricians and the plebeians very differently; to such an extent had civic discord rent the State in twain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The plebeians were exultant, they said that the gods were preparing to avenge the tyranny of the patricians; they encouraged each other to evade enrolment, for it was better for all to die together than to perish one by one. <q direct="unspecified">Let the patricians take up arms, let the patricians serve as common soldiers, that those who get the spoils of war may share its perils.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate, on the other hand, filled with gloomy apprehensions by the twofold danger from their own fellow-citizens and from their enemy, implored the consul Servilius, who was more sympathetic towards the people, to extricate the State from the perils that beset it on all-sides.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He dismissed the senate and went into the Assembly of the plebs. There he pointed out how anxious the senate were to consult the interests of the plebs, but their deliberations respecting what was certainly the largest part; though still only a part, of the State had been cut short by fears for the safety of the State as a whole.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The enemy were almost at their gates, nothing could be allowed to take precedence of the war, but even if the attack were postponed, it would not be honourable on the part of the plebeians to refuse to take up arms for their country till they had been paid for doing so, nor would it be compatible with the self-respect of the senate to be actuated by fear rather than by good-will in devising measures for the relief of their distressed fellow-citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He convinced the Assembly of his sincerity by issuing an edict that none should keep a Roman citizen in chains or duress whereby he would be prevented from enrolling for military service, none should distrain or sell the goods of a soldier as long as he was in camp, or detain his children or grandchildren.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>On the promulgation of this edict those debtors who were present at once gave in their names for enrolment, and crowds of persons running in all quarters of the City from the houses where they were confined, as their creditors had no longer the right to detain them, gathered together in the Forum to take the military oath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These formed a considerable force, and none were more conspicuous for courage and activity in the Volscian war.</p> <p>The consul led his troops against the enemy and encamped a short distance from them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The very next night the Volscians, trusting to the dissensions amongst the Romans, made an attempt on the camp, on the chance of desertions taking place, or the camp being betrayed, in the darkness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The outposts perceived them, the army was aroused, and on the alarm being sounded they rushed to arms, so the Volscian attempt was foiled; for the rest of the night both sides kept quiet. The following day, at dawn, the Volscians filled up the trenches and attacked the rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was already being torn down on all sides while the consul, in spite of the shouts of the whole army &mdash; of the debtors most of all &mdash;demanding the signal for action, delayed for a few minutes, in order to test the temper of his men. When he was quite satisfied as to their ardour and determination, he gave the signal to charge and launched his soldiery, eager to engage, upon the foe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were routed at the very first onset, the fugitives were cut down as far as the infantry could pursue them, then the cavalry drove them in confusion to their camp. They evacuated it in their panic, the legions soon came up, surrounded it, captured and plundered it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The following day the legions marched to Suessa Pometia, whither the enemy had fled, and in a few days it was captured and given up to the soldiers to pillage. This to some extent relieved the poverty of the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The consul, covered with glory, led his victorious army back to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Whilst on the march he was visited by envoys from the Volscians of Ecetra, who were concerned for their own safety after the capture of Pometia. By a decree of the senate, peace was granted to them, some territory was taken from them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Immediately afterwards a fresh alarm was created at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by the Sabines, but it was more a sudden raid than a regular war. News was brought during the night that a <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> army had advanced as far as the Anio on a predatory expedition, and that the farms in that neighbourhood were being harried and burnt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A. Postumius, who had been the Dictator in the Latin war, was at once sent there with the whole of the cavalry force; the consul Servilius followed with a picked body of infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Most of the enemy were surrounded by the cavalry while scattered in the fields; the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> legion offered no resistance to the advance of the infantry. Tired out with their march and the nocturnal plundering-a large proportion of them were in the farms full of food and wine &mdash;they had hardly sufficient strength to flee.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> war was announced and concluded in one night, and strong hopes were entertained that peace had now been secured everywhere. The next day, however, envoys from the Auruncans came with a demand for the evacuation of the Volscian territory, otherwise they were to proclaim war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The army of the Auruncans had begun their advance when the envoys left home, and the report of its having been seen not far from Aricia created so much excitement and confusion amongst the Romans that it was impossible either for the senate to take the matter into formal consideration, or for a favourable reply to be given to those who were commencing hostilities, since they were themselves taking up arms to repel them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They marched to Aricia; not far from there they engaged the Auruncans and in one battle finished the war.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the defeat of the Auruncans, the Romans, who had, within a few days, fought so many successful wars, were expecting the fulfillment of the promises which the consul had made on the authority of the senate. Appius, partly from his innate love of tyranny and partly to undermine confidence felt in his colleague, gave the harshest sentences he could when debtors were brought before him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> One after another those who had before pledged their persons as security were now handed over to their creditors, and others were compelled to give such security.</p> <p>A soldier to whom this happened appealed to the colleague of Appius. A crowd gathered round Servilius, they reminded him of his promises, upbraided him with their services in war and the scars they had received, and demanded that he should either get an ordinance passed by the senate, or, as consul, protect his people; as commander, his soldiers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul sympathised with them, but under the circumstances he was compelled to temporise; the opposite policy was so recklessly insisted on not only by his colleague but by the entire party of the nobility. By taking a middle course he did not escape the odium of the plebs nor did he win the favour of the patricians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These regarded him as a weak popularity-hunting consul, the plebeians considered him false, and it soon became apparent that he was as much detested as Appius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A dispute had arisen between the consuls as to which of them should dedicate the temple of Mercury. The senate referred the question to the people, and issued orders that the one to whom the dedication was assigned by the people should preside over the corn-market and form a guild of merchants<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed">The connection of these various functions appears to be that Mercury, as the god of commerce (hence <emph>merchant</emph>, <emph>market</emph>), would be the patron of the newly established guild of corn merchants, who would be especially connected with his new temple.</note> and discharge functions in the presence of the Pontifex Maximus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The people assigned the dedication of the temple to M. Laetorius, the first centurion of the legion, a choice obviously made not so much to honour the man, by conferring upon him an office so far above his station, as to bring discredit on the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> One of them, at all events, was excessively angry, as were the senate, but the courage of the plebs had risen, and they went to work in a very different method from that which they had adopted at first.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For as any prospect of help from the consuls or the senate was hopeless, they took matters into their own hands, and whenever they saw a debtor brought before the court, they rushed there from all sides, and by their shouts and uproar prevented the consul's sentence from being heard, and when it was pronounced no one obeyed it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They resorted to violence, and all the fear and danger to personal liberty was transferred from the debtors to the creditors, who were roughly handled before the eyes of the consul.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>In addition to all this there were growing apprehensions of a <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> war. A levy was decreed, but no one gave in his name. Appius was furious; he accused his colleague of courting the favour of the people, denounced him as a traitor to the common-wealth because he refused to give sentence where debtors were brought before him, and moreover he refused to raise troops after the senate had ordered a levy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Still, he declared, the ship of State was not entirely deserted nor the consular authority thrown to the winds; he, single-handed, would vindicate his own dignity and that of the senate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Whilst the usual daily crowd were standing round him, growing ever bolder in licence, he ordered one conspicuous leader of the agitation to be arrested. As he was being dragged away by the lictors, he appealed. There was no doubt as to what judgment the people would give, and he would not have allowed the appeal had not his obstinacy been with great difficulty overcome more by the prudence and authority of the senate than by the clamour of the people, so determined was he to brave the popular odium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> From that time the mischief became more serious every day, not only through open clamour but, what was far more dangerous, through secession and secret meetings.</p> <p>At length the consuls, detested as they were by the plebs, went out of office &mdash;Servilius equally hated by both orders, Appius in wonderful favour with the patricians.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then A. Verginius and T. Vetusius took office. As the plebeians were doubtful as to what sort of consuls they would have, and were anxious to avoid any precipitate and ill-considered action which might result from hastily adopted resolutions in the Forum, they began to hold meetings at night, some on the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> and others on the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consuls considered this state of things to be fraught with danger, as it really was, and made a formal report to the senate. But any orderly discussion of their report was out of the question, owing to the excitement and clamour with which the senators received it, and the indignation they felt at the consuls throwing upon them the odium of measures which they ought to have carried on their own authority as consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">Xurely,</q> it was said, <q direct="unspecified">if there were really magistrates in the State, there would have been no meetings in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> beyond the public Assembly; now the State was broken up into a thousand senates and assemblies, since some councils were being held on the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> and others on the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Why, one man like Appius Claudius, who was worth more than a consul, would have dispersed these gatherings in a moment.</q> When the consuls, after being thus censured, asked what they wished them to do,
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> as they were prepared to act with all the energy and determination that the senate desired, a decree was passed that the levy should be raised as speedily as possible, for the plebs was waxing wanton through idleness.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After dismissing the senate, the consuls ascended the tribunal and called out the names of those liable to active service. Not a single man answered to his name. The people, standing round as though in informal assembly, declared that the plebs could no longer be imposed upon, the consuls should not get a single soldier until the promise made in the name of the State was fulfilled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Before arms were put into their hands, every man's liberty must be restored to him, that they might fight for their country and their fellow-citizens and not for tyrannical masters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls were quite aware of the instructions they had received from the senate, but they were also aware that none of those who had spoken so bravely within the walls of the Senate-house were now present to share the odium which they were incurring.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A desperate conflict with the plebs seemed inevitable. Before proceeding to extremities they decided to consult the senate again. Thereupon all the younger senators rushed from their seats, and crowding round the chairs of the consuls, ordered them to resign their office and lay down an authority which they had not the courage to maintain.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having had quite enough of trying to coerce the plebs on the one hand and persuading the senate to adopt a milder course on the other, the consuls at last said: <q direct="unspecified">Senators, that you may not say you have not been forewarned, we tell you that a very serious disturbance is at hand. We demand that those who are the loudest in charging us with cowardice shall support us whilst we conduct the levy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> We will act as the most resolute may wish, since such is your pleasure.</q> They returned to the tribunal and purposely ordered one of those who were in view to be called up by name.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As he stood silent, and a number of men had closed round him to prevent his being seized, the consuls sent a lictor to him. The lictor was pushed away, and those senators who were with the consuls exclaimed that it was an outrageous insult and rushed down from the tribunal to assist the lictor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The hostility of the crowd was diverted from the lictor, who had simply been prevented from making the arrest, to the senators. The interposition of the consuls finally allayed the conflict. There had, however, been no stones thrown or weapons used, it had resulted in more noise and angry words than personal injury.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The senate was summoned and assembled in disorder; its proceedings were still more disorderly. Those who had been roughly handled demanded an inquiry, and all the more violent members supported the demand by shouting and uproar quite as much as by their votes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When at last the excitement had subsided, the consuls censured them for showing as little calm judgment in the senate as there was in the Forum. Then the debate proceeded in order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Three different policies were advocated. P. Valerius did not think the general question ought to be raised; he thought they ought only to consider the case of those who, in reliance on the promise of the consul P. Servilius, had served in the Volscian, Auruncan, and <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> wars.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Titus Larcius considered that the time had passed for rewarding only men who had served, the whole plebs was overwhelmed with debt, the evil could not be arrested unless there was a measure for universal relief. Any attempt to differentiate between the various classes would only kindle fresh discord instead of allaying it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Appius Claudius, harsh by nature, and now maddened by the hatred of the plebs on the one hand and the praises of the senate on the other, asserted that these riotous gatherings were not the result of misery but of licence, the plebeians were actuated by wantonness more than by anger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This was the mischief which had sprung from the right of appeal, for the consuls could only threaten without the power to execute their threats as long as a criminal was allowed to appeal to his fellow criminals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <q direct="unspecified">Come,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">let us create a Dictator from whom there is no appeal, then this madness which is setting everything on fire will soon die down.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Let me see any one strike a lictor then, when he knows that his back and even his life are in the sole power of the man whose authority he attacks.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To many the sentiments which Appius uttered seemed cruel and monstrous, as they really were. On the other hand, the proposals of Verginius and Larcius would set a dangerous precedent, that of Larcius at all events, as it would destroy all credit. The advice given by Verginius was regarded as the most moderate, being a middle course between the other two.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But through the strength of his party, and the consideration of personal interests which always have injured and always will injure public policy, Appius won the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was very nearly being himself appointed Dictator, an appointment which would more than anything have alienated the plebians, and that too at a most critical time when the Volscians, the Aequi, and the Sabines were all in arms together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls and the older patricians, however, took care that a magistracy clothed with such tremendous powers should be entrusted to a man of moderate temper.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They created M. Valerius, the son of Volesus, Dictator. Though the plebeians recognised that it was against them that a Dictator had been created, still, as they held their right of appeal under a law which his brother had passed, they did not fear any harsh or tyrannical treatment from that family.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their hopes were confirmed by an edict issued by the Dictator, very similar to the one made by Servilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> That edict had been ineffective, but they thought that more confidence could be placed in the person and power of the Dictator, so, dropping all opposition, they gave in their names for enrolment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Ten legions, were formed, a larger army than had ever before been assembled. Three of them were assigned to each of the consuls, the Dictator took command of four.</p> <p>The war could no longer be delayed. The Aequi had invaded the Latin territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Envoys sent by the Latins asked the senate either to send help or allow them to arm for the purpose of defending their frontier. It was thought safer to defend the unarmed Latins than to allow them to rearm themselves. The consul Vetusius was despatched, and that was the end of the raids.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Aequi withdrew from the plains, and trusting more to the nature of the country than to their arms, sought safety on the mountain ridges.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The other consul advanced against the Volscians, and to avoid loss of time, he devastated their fields with the object of forcing them to move their camp nearer to his and so bringing on an engagement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The two armies stood facing each other, in front of their respective lines, on the level space between the camps. The Volscians had considerably the advantage in numbers, and accordingly showed their contempt for their foe by coming on in disorder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Roman consul kept his army motionless, forbade their raising an answering shout, and ordered them to stand with their spears fixed in the ground, and when the enemy came to close quarters, to spring forward and make all possible use of their swords. The Volscians, wearied with their running and shouting, threw themselves upon the Romans as upon men benumbed with fear, but when they felt the strength of the counter-attack and saw the swords flashing before them, they retreated in confusion just as if they had been caught in an ambush, and owing to the speed at which they had come into action, they had not even strength to flee.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Romans, on the other hand, who at the beginning of the battle had remained quietly standing, were fresh and vigorous, and easily overtook the exhausted Volscians, rushed their camp, drove them out, and pursued them as far as <placeName key="tgn,7009108">Velitrae</placeName>, victors and vanquished bursting pell-mell into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> A greater slaughter of all ranks took place there than in the actual battle; a few who threw down their arms and surrendered received quarter.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst these events were occurring amongst the Volscians, the Dictator, after entering the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory; where the most serious part of the war lay, defeated and routed the enemy and chased them out of their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A cavalry charge had broken the enemy's centre which, owing to the excessive lengthening of the wings, was weakened by an insufficient depth of files, and while thus disordered the infantry charged them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the same charge the camp was captured and the war brought to a close. Since the battle at Lake Regillus no more brilliant action had been fought in those years.</p> <p>The Dictator rode in triumph into the City. In addition to the customary distinctions, a place was assigned in the Circus Maximus to him and to his posterity, from which to view the Games, and the <foreign lang="la">sella curulis</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="ed">See note 1, Book I.</note> was placed there.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After the subjugation of the Volscians, the territory of <placeName key="tgn,7009108">Velitrae</placeName> was annexed and a body of Roman citizens was sent out to colonise it.</p> <p>Some time later, an engagement took place with the Aequi. The consul was reluctant to fight as he would have to attack on unfavourable ground, but his soldiers forced him into action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They accused him of protracting the war in order that the Dictator's term of office might expire before they returned home, in which case his promises would fall to the ground, as those of the consul had previously done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They compelled him to march his army up the mountain at all hazards; but owing to the cowardice of the enemy this unwise step resulted in success.</p> <p>They were so astounded at the daring of the Romans that before they came within range of their weapons they abandoned their camp, which was in a very strong position, and dashed down into the valley in the rear.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So the victors gained a bloodless victory and ample spoil.</p> <p>Whilst these three wars were thus brought to a successful issue, the course which domestic affairs were taking continued to be a source of anxiety to both the patricians and the plebeians. The moneylenders possessed such influence and had taken such skillful precautions that they rendered the commons and even the Dictator himself powerless.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After the consul Vetusius had returned, Valerius introduced, as the very first business of the senate, the treatment of the men who had been marching to victory, and moved a resolution as to what decision they ought to come to with regard to the debtors.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His motion was negatived, on which he said, <q direct="unspecified">I am not acceptable as an advocate of concord. Depend upon it, you will very soon wish that the Roman plebs had champions like me. As far as I am concerned, I will no longer encourage my fellow-citizens in vain hopes nor will I be Dictator in vain.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Internal dissensions and foreign wars have made this office necessary to the commonwealth; peace has now been secured abroad, at home it is made impossible. I would rather be involved in the revolution as a private citizen than as Dictator.</q> So saying, he left the House and resigned his dictatorship.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The reason was quite clear to the plebs; he had resigned office because he was indignant at the way they were treated. The non-fulfilment of his pledge was not due to him, they considered that he had practically kept his word and on his way home they followed him with approving cheers.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate now began to feel apprehensive lest on the disbandment of the army there should be a recurrence of the secret conclaves and conspiracies. Although the Dictator had actually conducted the enrolment, the soldiers had sworn obedience to the consuls. Regarding them as still bound by their oath, the senate ordered the legions to be marched out of the City on the pretext that war had been recommenced by the Aequi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This step brought the revolution to a head. It is said that the first idea was to put the consuls to death that the men might be discharged from their oath; then, on learning that no religious obligation could be dissolved by a crime, they decided, at the instigation of a certain Sicinius, to ignore the consuls and withdraw to the Sacred Mount, which lay
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> on the other side of the Anio, three miles from the City. This is a more generally accepted tradition than the one adopted by <placeName key="tgn,2040810">Piso</placeName> that the secession was made to the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There, without any commander, in a regularly entrenched camp, taking nothing with them but the necessaries of life, they quietly maintained themselves for some days, neither receiving nor giving any provocation.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A great panic seized the City, mutual distrust led to a state of universal suspense. Those plebeians who had been left by their comrades in the City feared violence from the patricians; the patricians feared the plebeians who still remained in the City, and could not make up their minds whether they would rather have them go or stay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <q direct="unspecified">How long,</q> it was asked, <q direct="unspecified">would the multitude who had seceded remain quiet?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What would happen if a foreign war broke out in the meantime?</q> They felt that all their hopes rested on concord amongst the citizens, and that this must be restored at any cost.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The senate decided, therefore, to send as their spokesman Menenius Agrippa, an eloquent man, and acceptable to the plebs as being himself of plebeian origin. He was admitted into the camp, and it is reported that he simply told them the following fable in primitive and uncouth fashion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <q direct="unspecified">In the days when all the parts of the human body were not as now agreeing together, but each member took its own course and spoke its own speech, the other members, indignant at seeing that everything acquired by their care and labour and ministry went to the belly, whilst it, undisturbed in the middle of them, did nothing but enjoy the pleasures provided for it, entered into a conspiracy; the hands were not to bring food to the mouth, the mouth was not to accept it when offered, the teeth were not to masticate it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Whilst, in their resentment, they were anxious to coerce the belly by starving it, the members themselves wasted away, and the whole body was reduced to the last stage of exhaustion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then it became evident that the belly rendered no idle service, and the nourishment it received was no greater than that which it bestowed by returning to all parts of the body this blood by which we live and are strong, equally distributed into the veins, after being matured by the digestion of the food.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> By using this comparison, and showing how the internal disaffection amongst the parts of the body resembled the animosity of the plebeians against the patricians, he succeeded in winning over his audience.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Negotiations were then entered upon for a reconciliation. An agreement was arrived at, the terms being that the plebs should have its own magistrates, whose persons were to be inviolable, and who should have the right of affording protection against the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And further, no patrician should be allowed to hold that office. Two <q direct="unspecified">tribunes of the plebs</q> were elected, C. Licinius and L. Albinus. These chose three colleagues. It is generally agreed that Sicinius, the instigator of the secession was amongst them, but who the other two were is not settled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some say that only two tribunes were created on the Sacred Hill and that it was there that the <foreign lang="la">lex sacrata</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="14" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">lex sacrata</foreign></q> &mdash;A law under which offenders were devoted (<foreign lang="la">sacer</foreign>) to the infernal deities with their wives and children and goods; by this awful curse upon any one who injured the tribunes of the plebs their inviolability was secured (<bibl>Mommsen, Vol. I. p. 177</bibl>).</note> was passed.</p> <p>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">League with the Latins; War with the Volscians.</note> the secession of the plebs Sp. Cassius and Postumius Cominius entered on their
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> consulship. In their year of office a treaty was concluded with the Latin towns and one of the consuls remained in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> for the purpose. The other was sent to the Volscian war. He routed a force of Volscians from <placeName key="tgn,7015535">Antium</placeName>, and pursued them to Longula, which he gained possession
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> of. Then he advanced to Polusca, also belonging to the Volscians, which he captured, after which he attacked Corioli in great force.</p> <p>Amongst the most distinguished of the young soldiers in their camp at that time was Cnaeus Marcius, a young man prompt in counsel and action, who afterwards received the epithet of
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Coriolanus. During the progress of the siege, while the Roman army was devoting its whole attention to the townspeople whom it had shut up within their walls, and not in the least apprehending any danger from hostile movements without, it was suddenly attacked by Volscian legions who had marched from <placeName key="tgn,7015535">Antium</placeName>. At the same moment a sortie was made from the
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> town. Marcius happened to be on guard, and with a picked body of men not only repelled the sortie but made a bold dash through the open gate, and after cutting down many in the part of the city nearest to him, seized some fire and hurled it on the buildings which abutted on the
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> walls. The shouts of the towns-men mingled with the shrieks of the terrified women and children encouraged the Romans and dismayed the Volscians, who thought that the city which they had come to assist was already captured. So the troops from <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> were routed and Corioli
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> taken. The renown which Marcius won so completely eclipsed that of the consul, that, had not the treaty with the Latins &mdash;which owing to his colleague's absence had been concluded by Sp. Cassius alone &mdash; been inscribed on a brazen column, and so permanently recorded, all memory of Postumius Cominius having carried on a war with the Volscians would have perished.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>In the same year Agrippa Menenius died, a man who all through his life was equally beloved by the patricians and the plebeians, and made himself still more endeared to the plebeians after their
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> secession. Yet he, the negotiator and arbitrator of the reconciliation, who acted as the ambassador of the patricians to the plebs, and brought them back to the City, did not possess money enough to defray the cost of his funeral. He was interred by the plebeians, each man contributing a <foreign lang="la">sextans</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">sextans</foreign>=1/6 of an <foreign lang="la">as</foreign>. A copper coin about the size of a farthing.</note> towards the expense.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new consuls were T. Geganius and P. Minucius. In this year, whilst all abroad was undisturbed by war and the civic dissensions at home were healed, the commonwealth was attacked by another much more serious evil:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> first, dearness of food, owing to the fields remaining uncultivated during the secession, and following on this a famine such as visits a besieged city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It would have led to the perishing of the slaves in any case, and probably the plebeians would have died, had not the consuls provided for the emergency by sending men in various directions to buy corn. They penetrated not only along the coast to the right of <placeName key="perseus,Ostia">Ostia</placeName> into Etruria, but also along the sea to the left past the Volscian country as far as <placeName key="perseus,Cumae">Cumae</placeName>. Their search extended even as far as <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; to such an extent did the hostility of their neighbours compel them to seek distant help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When corn had been bought at <placeName key="perseus,Cumae">Cumae</placeName>, the ships were detained by the tyrant Aristodemus, in lieu of the property of Tarquin, to whom he was heir. Amongst the Volscians and in the Pomptine district it was even impossible to purchase corn, the corn merchants were in danger of being attacked by the population. Some corn came from Etruria up the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>; this served for the support of the plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They would have been harassed by a war, doubly unwelcome when provisions were so scarce, if the Volscians, who were already on the march, had not been attacked by a frightful pestilence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This disaster cowed the enemy so effectually that even when it had abated its violence they remained to some extent in a state of terror; the Romans increased the number of colonists at <placeName key="perseus,Velitrae">Velitrae</placeName> and sent a new colony to <placeName key="perseus,Norba">Norba</placeName>, up in the mountains, to serve as a strong-hold in the Pomptine district.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Story of Coriolanus.</note> the consulship of M. Minucius and A. Sempronius, a large quantity of corn was brought from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and the question was discussed in the senate at what price it should be given to the plebs. Many were of opinion that the moment had come for putting pressure on the plebeians, and recovering the rights which had been wrested from the senate through the secession and the violence which accompanied it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Foremost among these was Marcius Coriolanus, a determined foe to the tribunitian power. <q direct="unspecified">If,</q> he argued, <q direct="unspecified">they want their corn at the old price, let them restore to the senate its old powers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Why, then, do I, after being sent under the yoke, ransomed as it were from brigands, see plebeian magistrates, why do I see a Sicinius in power? Am I to endure these indignities a moment longer than I can help?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Am I, who could not put up with a Tarquin as king, to put up with a Sicinius? Let him secede now! let him call out his plebeians, the way lies open to the Sacred Hill and to other hills. Let them carry off the corn from our fields as they did two years ago; let them enjoy the scarcity which in their madness they have produced!
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I will venture to say that after they have been tamed by these sufferings, they will rather work as labourers themselves in the fields than prevent their being cultivated by an armed secession.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is not so easy to say whether they ought to have done this as it is to express one's belief that it could have been done, and the senators might have made it a condition of lowering the price of the corn that they should abrogate the tribunitian power and all the legal restrictions imposed upon them against their will.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate considered these sentiments too bitter, the plebeians in their exasperation almost flew to arms. Famine, they said, was being used as a weapon against them, as though they were enemies; they were being cheated out of food and sustenance; the foreign corn, which fortune had unexpectedly given them as their sole means of support, was to be snatched from their mouths unless their tribunes were given up in chains to Cn. Marcius, unless he could work his will on the backs of the Roman plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In him a new executioner had sprung up, who ordered them either to die or live as slaves. He would have been attacked on leaving the Senate-house had not the tribunes most opportunely fixed a day for his impeachment. This allayed the excitement, every man saw himself a judge with the power of life and death over his enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At first Marcius treated the threats of the tribunes with contempt; they had the right of protecting not of punishing, they were the tribunes of the plebs not of the patricians. But the anger of the plebeians was so thoroughly roused that the patricians could only save themselves by the punishment of one of their order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They resisted, however, in spite of the odium they incurred, and exercised all the powers they possessed both collectively and individually. At first they attempted to thwart proceedings by posting pickets of their clients to deter individuals from frequenting meetings and conclaves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then they proceeded in a body &mdash;you might suppose that every patrician was impeached &mdash;and implored the plebeians, if they refused to acquit a man who was innocent, at least to give up to them, as guilty, one citizen, one senator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As he did not put in an appearance on the day of trial, their resentment remained unabated, and he was condemned in his absence.</p> <p>He went into exile amongst the Volscians, uttering threats against his country, and even then entertaining hostile designs against it. The Volscians welcomed his arrival, and he became more popular as his resentment against his countrymen became more bitter, and his complaints and threats were more frequently heard.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He enjoyed the hospitality of Attius Tullius, who was by far the most important man at that time amongst the Volscians and a lifelong enemy of the Romans. Impelled each by similar motives, the one by old-standing hatred, the other by newly-provoked resentment, they formed joint plans for war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were under the impression that the people could not easily be induced, after so many defeats, to take up arms again, and that after their losses in their numerous wars and recently through the pestilence, their spirits were broken. The hostility had now had time to die down; it was necessary, therefore, to adopt some artifice by which fresh irritation might be produced.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It so happened that preparations were being made for a repetition of the <q direct="unspecified">Great Games.</q><note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="ed"><emph>Great Games</emph>. &mdash;These <q direct="unspecified">Games</q> were celebrated in honour of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, usually in fulfilment of a vow made by the commander-in-chief at the commencement of a war, or as an act of thanksgiving at deliverance of the City from some great danger.</note> The reason for their repetition was that early in the morning, prior to the commencement of the Games, a householder after flogging his slave had driven him through the middle of the Circus Maximus. Then the Games commenced, as though the incident had no religious
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> significance. Not long afterwards, Titus Latinius, a member of the plebs, had a dream. <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> appeared to him and said that the dancer who commenced the Games was displeasing to him, adding that unless those Games were repeated with due magnificence, disaster would overtake the City, and he was to go and report this to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> consuls. Though he was by no means free from religious scruples, still his fears gave way before his awe of the magistrates, lest he should become an object of public
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> ridicule. This hesitation cost him dear, for within a few days he lost his son. That he might have no doubt as to the cause of this sudden calamity, the same form again appeared to the distressed father in his sleep, and demanded of him whether he had been sufficiently repaid for his neglect of the divine will, for a more terrible recompense was impending if he did not speedily go and inform the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> consuls. Though the matter was becoming more urgent, he still delayed, and while thus procrastinating he was attacked by a serious illness in the form of sudden
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> paralysis. Now the divine wrath thoroughly alarmed him, and wearied out by his past misfortune and the one from which he was suffering, he called his relations together and explained what he had seen and heard, the repeated appearance of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> in his sleep, the threatening wrath of heaven brought home to him by his
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> calamities. On the strong advice of all present he was carried in a litter to the consuls in the Forum, and from there by the consuls' order into the Senate-house. After repeating the same story to the senators, to the intense surprise of all, another marvel
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> occurred. The tradition runs that he who had been carried into the Senate-house paralysed in every limb, returned home, after performing his duty, on his own feet.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate decreed that the Games should be celebrated on the most splendid scale.</p> <p>At the suggestion of Attius Tullius, a large number of Volscians came to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In accordance with a previous arrangement with Marcius, Tullius came to the consuls, before the proceedings commenced, and said that there were certain matters touching the State which he wished to discuss privately with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When all the bystanders had been removed he began: <q direct="unspecified">It is with great reluctance that I say anything to the disparagement of my people. I do not come however to charge them with having actually committed any offence but to take precautions against their committing one.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The character of our citizens is more fickle than I should wish;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> we have experienced this in many defeats, for we owe our present security not to our own deserts but to your forbearance. Here at this moment are a great multitude of Volscians, the Games are going on, the whole City will be intent on the spectacle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I remember what an outrage was committed by the young Sabines on a similar occasion, I shudder lest any ill-advised and reckless incident should occur. For our sakes, and yours, consuls, I thought it right to give you this warning.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As far as I am concerned, it is my intention to start at once for home, lest, if I stay, I should be involved in some mischief either of speech or act.</q> With these words he departed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>These vague hints, uttered apparently on good authority, were laid by the consuls before the senate. As generally happens, the authority rather than the facts of the case induced them to take even excessive precautions. A decree was passed that the Volscians should leave the City, criers were sent round ordering them all to depart before nightfall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Their first feeling was one of panic as they ran off to their respective lodgings to take away their effects, but when they had started a feeling of indignation arose at their being driven away from the Games, from a festival which was in a manner a meeting of gods and men, as though they were under the curse of heaven and unfit for human society.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As they were going along in an almost continuous stream, Tullius, who had gone on in advance, waited for them at the Ferentine Fountain. Accosting their chief men as they came up in tones of complaint and indignation, he led them, eagerly listening to words which accorded with their own angry feelings, and through them the multitude, down to the plain which stretched below the road.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There he began a speech: <q direct="unspecified">Even though you should forget the wrongs that <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> has inflicted and the defeats which the Volscian nation has suffered, though you should forget everything else, with what temper, I should like to know, do you brook this insult of yesterday, when they commenced their Games by treating us with ignominy?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Have you not felt that they have won a triumph over you today, that as you departed you were a spectacle to the townsfolk, to the strangers, to all those neighbouring populations; that your wives, your children, were paraded as a gazing-stock before men's eyes?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What do you suppose were the thoughts of those who heard the voice of the criers, those who watched us depart, those who met this ignominious cavalcade? What could they have thought but that there was some awful guilt cleaving to us, so that if we had been present at the Games we should have profaned them and made an expiation necessary, and that this was the reason why we were driven away from the abodes of these good and religious people and from all intercourse and association with them?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Does it not occur to you that we owe our lives to the haste with which we departed if we may call it a departure and not a flight? And do you count this City as anything else than the City of your enemies where had you lingered a single day you would all have been put to death? War has been declared against you to the great misery of those who have declared it if you are really men.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>So they dispersed to their homes, with their feelings of resentment embittered by this harangue. They so worked upon the feelings of their fellow-countrymen, each in his own city, that the whole Volscian nation revolted.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By the unanimous vote of the states, the conduct of the war was entrusted to Attius Tullius and Cn. Marcius, the Roman exile, on whom their hopes chiefly rested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He fully justified their expectations, so that it became quite evident that the strength of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> lay in her generals rather than in her army.</p> <p>He first marched against Cerceii, expelled the Roman colony and handed it over to the Volscians as a free city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then he took: <placeName key="perseus,Satricum">Satricum</placeName>, Longula, Polusca, and Corioli, towns which the Romans had recently acquired. Marching across country into the Latin road, he recovered <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName>, and then, in succession, Corbio, Vetellia, Trebium Labici, and Pedum.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Finally, he advanced from Pedum against the City.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He entrenched his camp at the Cluilian Dykes, about five miles distant, and from there he ravaged the Roman territory. The raiding parties were accompanied by men whose business it was to see that the lands of the patricians were not touched;
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> a measure due either to his rage being especially directed against the plebeians, or to his hope that dissensions might arise between them and the patricians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These certainly would have arisen &mdash;to such a pitch were the tribunes exciting the plebs by their attacks on the chief men of the State &mdash;had not the fear of the enemy outside &mdash;the strongest bond of union &mdash;brought men together in spite of their mutual suspicions and aversion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On one point they disagreed; the senate and the consuls placed their hopes solely in arms, the plebeians preferred anything to war.</p> <p>Sp. Nautius and Sex.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Furius were now consul. Whilst they were reviewing the legions and manning the walls and stationing troops in various places, an enormous crowd gathered together. At first they alarmed the consuls by seditious shouts, and at last they compelled them to convene the senate and submit a motion for sending ambassadors to Cn. Marcius. As the courage of the plebeians was evidently giving way, the senate accepted the motion, and a deputation was sent to Marcius with proposals for peace.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They brought back the stern reply: If the territory were restored to the Volscians, the question of peace could be discussed;
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> but if they wished to enjoy the spoils of war at their ease, he had not forgotten the wrongs inflicted by his country-men nor the kindness shown by those who were now his hosts, and would strive to make it clear that his spirit had been roused, not broken, by his exile.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The same envoys were sent on a second mission, but were not admitted into the camp. According to the tradition, the priests also in their robes went as suppliants to the enemies' camp, but they had no more influence with him than the previous deputation.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the matrons went in a body to Veturia, the mother of Coriolanus, and Volumnia his wife.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whether this was in consequence of a decree of the senate, or simply the prompting of womanly fear, I am unable to ascertain, but at all events they succeeded in inducing the aged Veturia to go with Volumnia and her two little sons to the enemies' camp. As men were powerless to protect the City by their arms, the women sought to do so by their tears and prayers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>On their arrival at the camp a message was sent to Coriolanus that a large body of women were present. He had remained unmoved by the majesty of the State in the persons of its ambassadors, and by the appeal made to his eyes and mind in the persons of its priests; he was still more obdurate to the tears of the women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then one of his friends, who had recognised Veturia, standing between her daughter-in-law and her grandsons, and conspicuous amongst them all in the greatness of her grief, said to him. <q direct="unspecified">Unless my eyes deceive me, your mother and wife and children are here.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Coriolanus, almost like one demented, sprung from his seat to embrace his mother. She, changing her tone from entreaty to anger, said, <q direct="unspecified">Before I admit your embrace suffer me to know whether it is to an enemy or a son that I have come, whether it is as your prisoner or as your mother that I am in your camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Has a long life and an unhappy old age brought me to this, that I have to see you an exile and from that an enemy? Had you the heart to ravage this land, which has borne and nourished you?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> However hostile and menacing the spirit in which you came, did not your anger subside as you entered its borders? Did you not say to yourself when your eye rested on <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, <q direct="unspecified">Within those walls are my home, my household gods, my mother, my wife, my children</q>?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Must it then be that, had I remained childless, no attack would have been made on <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; had I never had a son, I should have ended my days a free woman in a free country? But there is nothing which I can suffer now that will not bring more disgrace to you than wretchedness to me; whatever unhappiness awaits me it will not be for long.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Look to these, whom, if you persist me your present course, an untimely death awaits, or a long life of bondage.</q> When she ceased, his wife and children embraced him, and all the women wept and bewailed their own and their country's fate. At last his resolution gave way. He embraced his family and dismissed them, and moved his camp away from the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After withdrawing his legions from the Roman territory, he is said to have fallen a victim to the resentment which his action aroused, but as to the time and circumstances of his death the traditions vary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I find in Fabius, who is by far the oldest authority, that he lived to be an old man; he relates a saying of his, which he often uttered in his later years, that it is not till a man is old that he feels the full misery of exile. The Roman husbands did not grudge their wives the glory they had won, so completely were their lives free from the spirit of detraction and envy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A temple was built and dedicated to <foreign lang="la">Fortuna Muliebris</foreign>, to serve as a memorial of their deed.</p> <p>Subsequently the combined forces of the Volscians and Aequi re-entered the Roman territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Aequi, however, refused any longer to accept the generalship of Attius Tullius, a quarrel arose as to which nation should furnish the commander of the combined army, and this resulted in a bloody battle. Here the good fortune of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> destroyed the two armies of her enemies in a conflict no less ruinous than obstinate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The new consuls were T. Sicinius and C. Aquilius. To Sicinius was assigned the campaign against the Volscians, to Aquilius that against the Hernici, for they also were in arms. In that year the Hernici were subjugated, the campaign against the Volscians ended indecisively.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Treason of Sp. Cassius</note>For the next year Sp. Cassius and Proculus Verginius were elected consuls. A treaty was concluded with the Hernici, two-thirds of their territory was taken from them. Of this Cassius intended to give half to the Latins and half to the Roman plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He contemplated adding to this a quantity of land which, he alleged, though State land, was occupied by private individuals. This alarmed many of the patricians, the actual occupiers, as endangering the security of their property. On public grounds, too, they felt anxious, as they considered that by this largess the consul was building up a power dangerous to liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then for the first time an Agrarian Law was proposed, and never, from that day to the times within our own memory, has one been mooted without the most tremendous commotions.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The other consul resisted the proposed grant. In this he was supported by the senate, whilst the plebs was far from unanimous in its favour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were beginning to look askance at a boon so cheap as to be shared between citizens and allies, and they often heard the consul Verginius in his public speeches predicting that his colleague's gift was fraught with mischief, the land in question would bring slavery on those who took it, the way was being prepared for a throne.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Why were the allies, he asked, and the Latin league included? What necessity was there for a third part of the territory of the Hernici, so lately our foes, being restored to them, unless it was that these nations might have Cassius as their leader in place of Coriolanus?</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The opponent of the Agrarian Law began to be popular. Then both consuls tried who could go furthest in humouring the plebs. Verginius said that he would consent to the assignment of the lands provided they were assigned to none but Roman citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Cassius had courted popularity amongst the allies by including them in the distribution and had thereby sunk in the estimation of his fellow-citizens. To recover their favour he gave orders for the money which had been received for the corn from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> to be refunded to the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This offer the plebeians treated with scorn as nothing else than the price of a throne. Owing to their innate suspicion that he was aiming at monarchy, his gifts were rejected as completely as if they had abundance of everything.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>It is generally asserted that immediately upon his vacating office he was condemned and put to death. Some assert that his own father was the author of his punishment, that he tried him privately at home, and after scourging him put him to death and devoted his private property to <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> From the proceeds a statue of her was made with an inscription, <q direct="unspecified">Given from the Cassian family.</q> I find in some authors a much more probable account, viz., that he was arraigned by the quaestors Caeso Fabius and L. Valerius before the people and convicted of treason, and his house ordered to be demolished. It stood on the open space in front of the temple of <foreign lang="la">Tellus</foreign>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In any case, whether the trial was a public or a private one, his condemnation took place in the consulship of Servius Cornelius and Q. Fabius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Volscians and Aequi &mdash; The Agrarian Law.</note> popular anger against Cassius did not last long. The attractiveness of the Agrarian Law, though its author was removed, was in itself sufficient to make the plebeians desire it, and their eagerness for it was intensified by the unscrupulousness of the senate, who cheated the soldiers out of their share of the spoil which they had won that year from the Volscians and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Aequi. Everything taken from the enemy was sold by the consul Fabius and the amount realised paid into the treasury.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In spite of the hatred which this produced in the plebs against the whole Fabian house, the patricians succeeded in getting Caeso Fabius elected with L. Aemilius as consuls for the next year. This still further embittered the plebeians, and domestic disturbances brought on a foreign
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> war. For the time civic quarrels were suspended, patricians and plebeians were of one mind in resisting the Aequi and Volscians, and a victorious action was fought under
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Aemilius. The enemy lost more in the retreat than in the battle, so hotly did the cavalry pursue their routed foe.</p> <p>In the same year the temple of Castor was dedicated on the 15th of July. It had been vowed by the Dictator Postumius in the Latin war; his son was appointed <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">duumvir</foreign></q> for its
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> dedication.<note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">duumvir</foreign></q> &mdash;Two men (<foreign lang="la">duumviri</foreign>) were appointed to supervise the construction of the temple and appoint the priests who were to minister there.</note></p> <p>In this year, too, the minds of the plebeians were much exercised by the attractions which the Agrarian Law held out for them, and the tribunes made their office more popular by constantly dwelling on this popular measure. The patricians, believing that there was enough and more than enough madness in the multitude as it was, viewed with horror these bribes and incentives
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> to recklessness. The consuls led the way in offering a most determined resistance, and the senate won
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the day. Nor was the victory only a momentary one, for they elected as consuls for the following year M. Fabius, the brother of Caeso, and L. Valerius, who was an object of special hatred on the part of the plebs through his prosecution of Sp. Cassius. The contest with the tribunes went on through the year; the Law remained a dead letter, and the tribunes, with their fruitless promises, turned out to be idle boasters. The Fabian house gained an immense reputation through the three successive consulships of its members, all of whom had been uniformly successful in their resistance to
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the tribunes. The office remained, like a safe investment, for some time in the family.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>War now began with <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName>, and the Volscians rose again. The people possessed more than sufficient strength for their foreign wars, but they wasted it in domestic strife. The universal anxiety was aggravated by supernatural portents, menacing almost daily City and country alike. The soothsayers, who were consulted by the State and by private persons, declared that the divine wrath was due to nothing else but the profanation of
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> sacred functions. These alarms resulted in the punishment of Oppia, a Vestal virgin who was convicted of unchastity.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Veientine and the Aequo-Volscian Wars.</note> next consuls were Q. Fabius and C. Julius. During this year the civic dissensions were as lively as ever, and the war assumed a more serious form. The Aequi took up arms, and the Veientines made depredations on Roman territory. Amidst the growing anxiety about these wars Caeso Fabius and Sp. Furius were made consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Aequi were attacking <placeName key="tgn,1045778">Ortona</placeName>, a Latin city; the Veientines, laden with plunder, were now threatening to attack <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself. This alarming condition of affairs ought to have restrained, whereas it actually increased, the hostility of the plebs, and they resumed the old method of refusing military service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was not spontaneous on their part; Sp. Licinius, one of their tribunes, thinking that it was a good time for forcing the Agrarian Law upon the senate through sheer necessity, had taken upon him the obstruction of the levy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All the odium, however, aroused by this misuse of the tribunitian power recoiled upon the author, his own colleagues were as much opposed to him as the consuls; through their assistance the consuls completed the enrolment.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>An army was raised for two wars at the same time, one against the Veientines under Fabius, the other against the Aequi under Furius. In this latter campaign nothing happened worth recording. Fabius, however, had considerably more trouble with his own men than with the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He, the consul, single handed, sustained the commonwealth, while his army through their hatred of the consul were doing their best to betray it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For, besides all the other instances of his skill as a commander, which he had so abundantly furnished in his preparation for the war and his conduct of it, he had so disposed his troops that he routed the enemy by sending only his cavalry<note anchored="yes" n="18" resp="ed">The <emph>cavalry</emph> , drawn from the patricians and wealthy plebeians, would naturally, from their aristocratic sympathies, be on the consul's side.</note> against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The infantry refused to take up the pursuit; not only were they deaf to the appeals of their bated general, but even the public disgrace and infamy which they were bringing upon themselves at the moment, and the danger which would come if the enemy were to rally, were powerless to make them quicken their pace, or, failing that, even to keep their formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Against orders they retired, and with gloomy looks &mdash;you would suppose that they had been defeated &mdash;they returned to camp, cursing now their commander, now the work which the cavalry had done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Against this example of demoralisation the general was unable to devise any remedy; to such an extent may men of commanding ability be more deficient in the art of managing their own people than in that of conquering the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consul returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but he had not enhanced his military reputation so much as he had aggravated and embittered the hatred of his soldiers towards him.</p> <p>The senate, however, succeeded in keeping the consulship in the family of the Fabii; they made M. Fabius consul, Gnaeus Manlius was elected as his colleague.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year also found a tribune advocating the Agrarian Law. It was Tiberius Pontificius. He adopted the same course as Sp. Licinius and for a short time stopped the enrolment.<note anchored="yes" n="19" resp="ed"><emph>stopped the enrolment</emph>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;This device was frequently adopted in those years by the tribunes in thier struggles with the patricians. They <q direct="unspecified">extended the protection of their sacred office to those of the plebeians who on public grounds resisted the sovereignty of the consuls by refusing to serve as soldiers</q>(<bibl>Arnold</bibl>).</note> The senate were again perturbed, but Appius Claudius told them that the power of the tribunes had been overcome in the previous year, it was actually so at the present moment, and the precedent thus set would govern the future, since it had been discovered that its very strength was breaking it
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> down. For there would never be wanting a tribune who would be glad to triumph over his colleague and secure the favour of the better party for the good of the State. If more were needed, more were ready to come to the assistance of the consuls, even one was sufficient, against the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> rest. The consuls and leaders of the senate had only to take the trouble to secure, if not all, at least some of the tribunes on the side of the commonwealth and the senate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The senators followed this advice, and whilst, as a body, they treated the tribunes with courtesy and kindness, the men of consular rank, in each private suit which they instituted, succeeded, partly by personal influence, partly by the authority their rank gave them, in getting the tribunes to exert their power for the welfare of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> State. Four of the tribunes were opposed to the one who was a hindrance to the public good; by their aid the consuls raised the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> levy.</p> <p>Then they set out for the campaign against <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName>. Succours had reached this city from all parts of Etruria, not so much out of regard for the Veientines as because hopes were entertained of the possible dissolution of the Roman State through intestine
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> discord. In the public assemblies throughout the cities of Etruria the chiefs were loudly proclaiming that the Roman power would be eternal unless its citizens fell into the madness of mutual
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> strife. This, they said, had proved to be the one poison, the one bane in powerful states which made great empires mortal. That mischief had been for a long time checked, partly by the wise policy of the senate, partly by the forbearance of the plebs, but now things had reached extremities. The one State had been severed into two, each with its own magistrates and its own
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> laws. At first the enrolments were the cause of the quarrel, but when actually on service the men obeyed their generals. As long as military discipline was maintained the evil could be arrested, whatever the state of affairs in the City, but now the fashion of disobedience to the magistrates was following the Roman soldier even into the
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> camp. During the last war, in the battle itself, at the crisis of the engagement, the victory was by the common action of the whole army transferred to the vanquished Aequi, the standards were abandoned, the commander left alone on the field, the troops returned against orders into
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> camp. In fact, if matters were pressed, <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> could be vanquished through her own soldiers, nothing else was needful than a declaration of war, a show of military activity, the Fates and the gods would do the rest.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Anticipations like these had given the Etruscans fresh energy after their many vicissitudes of defeat and victory. The Roman consuls, too, dreaded nothing but their own strength and their own arms. The recollection of the fatal precedent set in the last war deterred them from any action whereby they would have to fear a simultaneous attack from two armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They confined themselves to their camp, and in face of the double danger avoided an engagement, hoping that time and circumstances might perhaps calm the angry passions and bring about a more healthy state of mind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Veientines and Etruscans were all the more energetic in forcing an engagement; they rode up to the camp and challenged the Romans to fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At last, as they produced no effect by the taunts and insults levelled at the army and consuls alike, they declared that the consuls were using the pretext of internal dissensions to veil the cowardice of their men, they distrusted their courage more than they doubted their loyalty. Silence and inactivity amongst men in arms was a novel kind of sedition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They also made reflections, true as well as false, on the upstart quality of their nationality and descent. They shouted all this out close up to the ramparts and gates of the camp. The consuls took it with composure, but the simple soldiery were filled with indignation and shame, and their thoughts were diverted from their domestic troubles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They were unwilling that the enemy should go on with impunity, they were equally unwilling that the patricians and the consuls should win the day, hatred against the enemy and hatred against their fellow-countrymen struggled in their minds for the mastery. At length the former prevailed, so contemptuous and insolent did the mockery of the enemy become.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They gathered in crowds round the generals' quarters, they insisted upon fighting, they demanded the signal for action. The consuls put their heads together as though deliberating, and remained for some time in conference.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were anxious to fight, but their anxiety had to be repressed and concealed in order that the eagerness of the soldiers, once roused, might be intensified by opposition and delay. They replied that matters were not ripe, the time for battle had not come, they must remain within their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They then issued an order that there must be no fighting, any one fighting against orders would be treated as an enemy. The soldiers, dismissed with this reply, became the more eager for battle the less they thought the consuls wished for it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The enemy became much more exasperating when it was known that the consuls had determined not to fight, they imagined that they could now insult with impunity, that the soldiers were not entrusted with arms, matters would reach the stage of mutiny, and the dominion of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had come to an end.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In this confidence they ran up to the gates, flung opprobrious epithets and hardly stopped short of storming the camp. Naturally the Romans could brook these insults no longer, they ran from all parts of the camp to the consuls, they did not now prefer their demand quietly through the first centurions as before, they shouted them in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Matters were ripe, still the consuls hung back. At last Cn. Manlius, fearing lest the increasing disturbance might lead to open mutiny, gave way, and Fabius, after ordering the trumpets to command silence, addressed his colleague thus: <q direct="unspecified">I know, Cn. Manlius, that these men can conquer; it is their own fault that I did not know whether they wished to do so.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It has, therefore, been resolved and determined not to give the signal for battle unless they swear that they will come out of this battle victorious. A Roman consul was once deceived by his soldiers, they cannot deceive the gods.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Amongst the centurions of the first rank who had demanded to be led to battle was M. Flavoleius. <q direct="unspecified">M. Fabius,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">I will come back from the battle victorious.</q> He invoked the wrath of Father <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> and Mars <foreign lang="la">Gradivus</foreign> and other deities if he broke his oath. The whole army took the oath, man by man, after him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> When they had sworn, the signal was given, they seized their weapons, and went into action, furious with rage and confident of victory. They told the Etruscans to continue their insults, and begged the enemy so ready with the tongue to stand up to them now they were armed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> All, patricians and plebeians alike, showed conspicuous courage on that day, the Fabian house especially covered itself with glory. They determined in that battle to win back the affection of the plebs, which had been alienated through many political contests.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The battle-line was formed; neither the Veientines nor the legions of Etruria declined the contest. They were almost certain that the Romans would no more fight with them than they fought with the Aequi, and they did not despair of something still more serious happening, considering the state of irritation they were in and the double opportunity which now presented itself.<note anchored="yes" n="20" resp="ed"><emph>double opportunity</emph>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> &mdash;First murdering the consul and then going over to the enemy.</note> Things took a very different course, for in no previous war had the Romans gone into action with more grim determination, so exasperated were they by the insults of the enemy and the procrastination of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> consuls. The Etruscans had scarcely time to form their ranks when, after the javelins had in the first confusion been flung at random rather than thrown regularly, the combatants came to a hand-to-hand encounter with swords, the most desperate kind of
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> fighting. Amongst the foremost were the Fabii, who set a splendid example for their countrymen to behold. Quintus Fabius &mdash;the one who had been consul two years previously &mdash; charged, regardless of danger, the massed Veientines, and whilst he was engaged with vast numbers of the enemy, a Tuscan of vast strength and splendidly armed plunged his sword into his breast, and as he drew it out Fabius fell forward on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> wound. Both armies felt the fall of this one man, and the Romans were beginning to give ground, when M. Fabius, the consul, sprang over the body as it lay, and holding up his buckler, shouted, <q direct="unspecified">Is this what you swore, soldiers, that you would go back to camp as
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> fugitives? Are you more afraid of this cowardly foe than of Jupiter and Mars, by whom you swore? I, who did not swear, will either go back victorious, or will fall fighting by you, Quintus Fabius.</q> Then Caeso Fabius, the consul of the previous year, said to the consul, <q direct="unspecified">Is it by words like these, my brother, that you think you will make them
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> fight? The gods, by whom they swore, will-do that; our duty as chiefs, if we are to be worthy of the Fabian name, is to kindle our soldiers' courage by fighting rather than haranguing.</q> So the two Fabii dashed forward with levelled spears, and carried the whole line with them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst the battle was restored in one direction, the consul Cn. Manlius was showing no less energy on the other wing, where the fortunes of the day took a similar turn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For, like Q. Fabius on the other wing, the consul Manlius was here driving the enemy before him and his soldiers were following up with great vigour, when he was seriously wounded and retired from the front.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thinking that he was killed, they fell back, and would have abandoned their ground had not the other consul ridden up at full gallop with some troops of cavalry, and, crying out that his colleague was alive and that he had himself routed the other wing of the enemy, succeeded in checking the retreat. Manlius also showed himself amongst them, to rally his men. The well-known voices of the two consuls gave the soldiers fresh courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At the same time the enemies' line was now weakened, for, trusting to their superiority in numbers, they had detached their reserves and sent them to storm the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> These met with but slight resistance, and whilst they were wasting time by thinking more about plundering than about fighting, the Roman <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign>,<note anchored="yes" n="21" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign> &mdash;The third line, generally acting as reserves. They were veteran troops, and thier steadiness often restored a battle when the first and second lines had given way. Here they were guarding the camp.</note> who had been unable to withstand the first assault, despatched messengers to the consul to tell him the position of affairs, and then, retiring in close order to the head-quarters tent, renewed the fighting without waiting for orders. The consul Manlius had ridden back to the camp and posted troops at all the gates to block the enemies'
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> escape. The desperate situation roused the Tuscans to madness rather than courage; they rushed in every direction where there seemed any hope of escape, and for some time their efforts were fruitless. At last a compact body of young soldiers made an attack on the consul himself, conspicuous from his arms. The first weapons were intercepted by those who stood round him, but the violence of the onset could not long be withstood. The consul fell mortally wounded and all around him were
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> scattered. The Tuscans were encouraged, the Romans fled in panic through the length of the camp, and matters would have come to extremities had not the members of the consul's staff hurriedly taken up his body and opened a way for the enemy through one
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> gate. They burst through it, and in a confused mass fell in with the other consul who had won the battle; here they were again cut to pieces and scattered in all
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> directions.</p> <p>A glorious victory was won, though saddened by the death of two illustrious men. The senate decreed a triumph, but the consul replied that if the army could celebrate a triumph without its commander, he would gladly allow them to do so in return for their splendid service in the
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> war. But as his family were in mourning for his brother, Quintus Fabius, and the State had suffered partial bereavement through the loss of one of its consuls, he could not accept laurels for himself which were blighted by public and private
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> grief. The triumph he declined was more brilliant than any actually celebrated, so much does glory laid by for the moment return sometimes with added splendour. Afterwards he conducted the obsequies of his colleague and his brother, and pronounced the funeral oration over each. The greatest share of the praise which he conceded to them rested upon himself.</p> <p>He had not lost sight of the object which he set before him at the beginning of his consulship, the conciliation of the
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> plebs. To further this, he distributed amongst the patricians the care of the wounded. The Fabii took charge of a large number, and nowhere was greater care showed them. From this time they began to be popular; their popularity was won by no methods which were inconsistent with the welfare of the State.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Consequently<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Fabii at the Cremera.</note> the election of Caeso Fabius as consul, together with Titus Verginius, was welcomed by the plebs as much as by the patricians. Now that there was a favourable prospect of concord, he subordinated all military projects to the task of bringing the patricians and the plebs into union at the earliest possible moment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the beginning of his year of office he proposed that before any tribune came forward to advocate the Agrarian Law, the senate should anticipate him by themselves undertaking what was their own work and distributing the territory taken in war to the plebeians as fairly as possible. It was only right that those should have it by whose sweat and blood it had been won.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The patricians treated the proposal with scorn, some even complained that the once energetic mind of Caeso was becoming wanton and enfeebled through the excess of glory which he had won.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were no party struggles in the City. The Latins were being harassed by the inroads of the Aequi. Caeso was despatched thither with an army, and crossed over into the territory of the Aequi to ravage it. The Aequi withdrew into their towns and remained behind their walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> No battle of any importance took place.</p> <p>But the rashness of the other consul incurred a defeat at the hands of the Veientines, and it was only the arrival of Caeso Fabius with reinforcements that saved the army from destruction. From that time there was neither peace nor war with the Veientines, whose methods closely resembled those of brigands.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They retired before the Roman legions into their city; then when they found that they were withdrawn they made inroads on the fields, evading war by keeping quiet, and then making quiet impossible by war. So the business could neither be dropped nor completed.</p> <p>Wars were threatening in other quarters also; some seemed imminent as in the case of the Aequi and Volscians, who were only keeping quiet till the effect of their recent defeat should pass away, whilst it was evident that the Sabines, perpetual enemies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and the whole of Etruria would soon be in motion.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But the Veientines, a persistent rather than a formidable foe, created more irritation than alarm because it was never safe to neglect them or to turn the attention elsewhere.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Under these circumstances the Fabii came to the senate and the consul on behalf of his house spoke as follows: <q direct="unspecified">As you are aware senators the Veientine war does not require a large force so much as one constantly in the field. Let the other wars be your care, leave the Fabii to deal with the Veientines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> We will guarantee that the majesty of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> shall be safe in that quarter. We propose to carry on that war as a private war of our own at our own cost. Let the State be spared money and men there.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A very hearty vote of thanks was passed; the consul left the House and returned home accompanied by the Fabii, who had been standing in the vestibule awaiting the senate's decision. After receiving instructions to meet on the morrow, fully armed, before the consul's house, they separated for their homes.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>News of what had happened spread through the whole City, the Fabii were praised up to the skies; people said, <q direct="unspecified">One family had taken up the burden of the State, the Veientine war had become a private concern, a private quarrel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If there were two houses of the same strength in the City, and the one claimed the Volscians for themselves, the other the Aequi, then all the neighbouring states could be subjugated while <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself remained in profound tranquillity.</q></p> <p>The next day the Fabii took their arms and assembled at the appointed place.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul, wearing his <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">paludamentum</foreign>,</q><note anchored="yes" n="22" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">paludamentum</foreign> &mdash;An ample and graceful cloak, the characteristic dress of the commander-in-chief. When a Roman magistrate quitted the City to take charge of an army or a province he put off the toga &mdash;the civilian dress &mdash;and assumed the <foreign lang="la">paludamentum</foreign>.</note> went out into the vestibule and saw the whole of his house drawn up in order of march. Taking his place in the centre, he gave the word of advance. Never has an army marched through the City smaller in numbers or with a more brilliant reputation or
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> more universally admired. Three hundred and six soldiers, all patricians, all members of one house, not a single man of whom the senate even in its palmiest days would deem unfitted for high command, went forth, threatening ruin to the Veientines through the strength of
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> a single family. They were followed by a crowd; made up partly of their own relatives and friends, whose minds were not occupied with ordinary hope and anxiety, but filled with the loftiest anticipations; partly of those who shared the public anxiety, and could not find words to express their
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> affection and admiration. <q direct="unspecified">Go on,</q> they cried, <q direct="unspecified">you gallant band, go on, and may you be fortunate; bring back results equal to this beginning, then look to us for consulships and triumphs and
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> every possible reward.</q> As they passed the Citadel and the Capitol and other temples, their friends prayed to each deity, whose statue or whose shrine they saw, that they would send that band
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> with all favourable omens to success, and in a short time restore them safe to their country and their kindred. In vain were those
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> prayers sent up! They proceeded on their ill-starred way by the right postern of the Carmental gate, and reached the banks of the Cremera. This seemed to them a suitable position for a fortified post.</p> <p>L. Aemilius and C. Servilius were the next consuls. As long as it was only a question of forays and raids, the Fabii were quite strong enough not only to protect their own fortified post, but, by patrolling both sides of the border-line between the Roman and Tuscan territories, to make the whole district safe for themselves and dangerous
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> for the enemy. There was a brief interruption to these raids, when the Veientines, after summoning an army from Etruria, assaulted the fortified post
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> at the Cremera. The Roman legions were brought up by the consul L. Aemilius and fought a regular engagement with the Etruscan troops. The Veientines, however, had not time to complete their formation, and during the confusion, whilst the men were getting into line and the reserves were being stationed, a squadron of Roman cavalry suddenly made a flank attack, and gave them no chance of commencing a battle or even of
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> standing their ground. They were driven back to their camp at the Saxa Rubra, and sued for peace. They obtained it, but their natural inconstancy made them regret it before the Roman garrison was recalled from the Cremera.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The conflicts between the Fabii and the State of <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName> were resumed without any more extensive military preparations than before. There were not only forays into each other's territories and surprise attacks upon the foragers, but sometimes they fought regular engagements, and this single Roman house often
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> won the victory over what was at that time the most powerful city in Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This was a bitter mortification to the Veientines, and they were led by circumstances to adopt the plan of trapping their daring enemy in an ambuscade; they were even glad that the numerous successes of the Fabii had increased their confidence.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Accordingly<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Annihilation of the Fabii.</note> they drove herds of cattle, as if by accident, in the way of the foraying parties, the fields were abandoned by the peasants, and the bodies of troops sent to repel the raiders fled in a panic more often assumed than genuine. By this time the Fabii had conceived such a contempt for their foe as to be convinced that under no circumstances of either time or place could their invincible arms be resisted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This presumption carried them so far that at the sight of some distant cattle on the other side of the wide plain stretching from the camp they ran down to secure them although but few of the enemy were visible.<note anchored="yes" n="23" resp="ed"><emph>although but few of the enemy were visible</emph>
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> &mdash;Andtherefore they should have suspected a <emph>ruse</emph>.</note> Suspecting no danger and keeping no order they passed the ambuscade which was set on each side of the road, and whilst they were scattered in trying to catch the cattle, which in their fright were rushing wildly about, the enemy suddenly rose from their concealment and attacked them on all
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> sides. At first they were startled by the shouts round them, then javelins fell on them from every direction. As the Etruscans closed round them, they were hemmed by a continuous ring of men, and the more the enemy pressed upon them, the less the space in which they were forced to form their ever-narrowing
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> square. This brought out strongly the contrast between their scanty numbers and the host of Etruscans, whose ranks were multiplied through being
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> narrowed. After a time they abandoned their plan of presenting a front on all sides; facing in one direction they formed themselves into a wedge and by the utmost exertion of sword and muscle forced a passage
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> through. The road led up to gentle eminence, and here they halted. When the higher ground gave them room to breathe freely and to recover from the feeling of despair, they repelled those who mounted to the attack, and through the advantage of position the little band were beginning to win the day, when some Veientines who had been sent round the hill emerged on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> summit. So the enemy again had the advantage. The Fabii were all cut down to a man, and their fort taken. It is generally agreed that three hundred and six men perished, and that one only, an immature youth, was left as a stock for the Fabian house to be <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>'s greatest helper in her hour of danger both at home and in the field.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Etruscans threaten <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note> this disaster occurred, C. Horatius and T. Menenius were consuls. Menenius was at once sent against the Tuscans, flushed with their recent victory. Another unsuccessful action was fought, and the enemy took possession of the Janiculum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The City, which was suffering from scarcity as well as from the war, would have been invested &mdash;for the Etruscans had crossed the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> &mdash;had not the consul Horatius been recalled from the Volsci. The fighting approached so near the walls that the first battle, an indecisive one, took place near the temple of Spes, and the second at the Colline gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the latter, although the Romans gained only a slight advantage, the soldiers recovered something of their old courage and were better prepared for future campaigns.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The next consuls were A. Verginius and Sp. Servilius. After their defeat in the last battle, the Veientines declined an engagement. There were forays. From the Janiculum as from a citadel they made raids in all directions on the Roman territory; nowhere were the cattle or the country-folk safe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were ultimately caught by the same stratagem by which they had caught the Fabii. Some cattle were purposely driven in different directions as a decoy; they followed them and fell into an ambuscade; and as their numbers were greater, the slaughter was greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their rage at this defeat was the cause and commencement of a more serious one. They crossed the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName> by night and marched up to an attack on Servilius' camp, but were routed with great loss, and with great difficulty reached the Janiculum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul himself forthwith crossed the Tiber and entrenched himself at the foot of the Janiculum. The confidence inspired by his victory of the previous day, but still more the scarcity of corn, made him decide upon an immediate but precipitate move.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He led his army at daybreak up the side of the Janiculum to the enemies' camp; but he met with a more disastrous repulse than the one he had inflicted the day before. It was only by the intervention of his colleague that he and his army were saved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Etruscans caught between the two armies, and retreating from each alternately were annihilated. So the Veientine war was brought to a sudden close by an act of happy rashness.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Together<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Impeachments by the Tribunes of the Plebs.</note> with peace, food came more freely into the City. Corn was brought from <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName> and as the fear of future scarcity had disappeared, each individual brought out what he had hoarded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The result of ease and plenty was fresh restlessness, and as the old evils no longer existed abroad, men began to look for them at home. The tribunes began to poison the minds of the plebeians with the Agrarian Law and inflamed them against the senators who resisted it, not only against the whole body, but individual members. Q. Considius and T. Genucius, who were advocating the Law, appointed a day for the trial of T. Menenius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Popular feeling was roused against him by the loss of the fort at the Cremera, since, as consul, he had his standing camp not far from it. This crushed him, though the senators exerted themselves for him no less than they had done for Coriolanus, and the popularity of his father Agrippa had not died away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tribunes contented themselves with a fine, though they had arraigned him on a capital charge; the amount was fixed at 2000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>.</q><note anchored="yes" n="24" resp="ed">The <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">as</foreign>,</q> which is supposed to have been originally equivalent to 1 lb. avoirdupois of copper, was now probably one-sixth of that weight. Coper was the only metal then used as currency.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This proved to be a death-sentence, for they say that he was unable to endure the disgrace and grief, and was carried off by a fatal malady.</p> <p>Sp. Servilius was the next to be impeached.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His prosecution, conducted by the tribunes L. Caedicius and T. Statius, took place immediately after his year had expired, at the commencement of the consulship of C. Nautius and P. Valerius. When the day of trial came, he did not, like Menenius, meet the attacks of the tribunes by appeals for mercy, whether his own or those of the senators, he relied absolutely on his innocence and personal influence. The charge against him was his conduct in the battle with the Tuscans on the Janiculum; but the same courage which he then displayed, when the State was in danger, he now displayed when his own life was in danger.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Meeting charge by counter-charge, he boldly laid upon the tribunes and the whole of the plebs the guilt of the condemnation and death of T. Menenius; the son, he reminded them, of the man through whose efforts the plebeians had been restored to their position in the State, and were enjoying those very magistracies and laws which now allowed them to be cruel and vindictive. By his boldness he dispelled the danger, and his colleague Verginius, who came forward as a witness, assisted him by crediting him with some of his own services to the State.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The thing that helped him more, however, was the sentence passed on Menenius, so completely had the popular sentiment changed.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName> and the Sabines.</note> domestic conflicts came to an end; war began again with the Veientines, with whom the Sabines had formed an armed league. The Latin and Hernican auxiliaries were summoned, and the consul P. Valerius was sent with an army to <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName>. He at once attacked the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> camp, which was situated in front of the walls of their allies, and created such confusion that while small bodies of the defenders were making sorties in various directions to repel the attack, the gate against which the assault had been first made was forced, and once inside the rampart it became a massacre rather than a battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The noise in the camp penetrated even to the city, and the Veientines flew to arms, in a state of as great alarm as if <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName> itself was taken. Some went to the help of the Sabines, others attacked the Romans, who were wholly occupied with their assault on the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For a few moments they were checked and thrown into confusion; then, forming front in both directions, they offered a steady resistance while the cavalry whom the consul had ordered to charge routed the Tuscans and put them to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In the same hour, two armies, the two most powerful of the neighbouring states, were overcome.</p> <p>Whilst this was going on at <placeName key="perseus,Veii">Veii</placeName>, the Volscians and Aequi had encamped in the Latin territory and were ravaging their borders. The Latins, in conjunction with the Hernici drove them out of their camp without either a Roman general or Roman troops.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They recovered their own property and obtained immense booty in addition. Nevertheless, the consul C. Nautius was sent from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> against the Volscians. They did not approve, I think, of the custom of allies carrying on war in their own strength and on their own methods, without any Roman general or army.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was no kind of injury or insult that was not practised against the Volscians; they could not, however, be driven to fight a regular battle.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>L.<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Assassination of Genucius.</note> Furius and C. Manlius were the next consuls. The Veientines fell to Manlius as his province. There was no war, however; a forty years' truce was granted on their request; they were ordered to furnish corn and pay for the troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Peace abroad was at once followed by discord at home. The tribunes employed the Agrarian Law to goad the plebs into a state of dangerous excitement. The consuls, nowise intimidated by the condemnation of Menenius or the danger in which Servilius had stood, resisted them with the utmost violence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On their vacating office the tribune Genucius impeached them.</p> <p>They were succeeded by L. Aemilius and Opiter Verginius. I find in some annals Vopiscus Julius instead of Verginius. Whoever the consuls were, it was in this year that Furius and Manlius, who were to be tried before the people, went about in mourning garb amongst the younger members of the senate quite as much as amongst the plebs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They urged them to keep clear of the high offices of state and to regard the consular <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign>,</q> the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">praetexta</foreign>,</q> and the curule chair as nothing but the pomp of death, for when invested with these insignia they were like victims adorned for sacrifice.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If the consulship possessed such attractions for them, they must clearly understand that this office had been captured and crushed by the tribunician power; the consul had to do every thing at the beck and call of the tribune just as if he were his apparitor.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If he took an active line, if he showed any regard for the patricians, if he thought that anything besides the plebs formed part of the commonwealth, he should keep before his eyes the banishment of Cn. Marcius, the condemnation and death of Menenius. Fired by these appeals the senators held meetings, not in the Senate-house but in private, only a few being invited.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As the one point on which they were agreed was that the two who were impeached were to be rescued, by lawful or unlawful means, the most desperate plan was the most acceptable, and men were found who advocated the most daring crime.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Accordingly, on the day of the trial, whilst the plebs were standing in the Forum on the tiptoe of expectation, they were surprised that the tribune did not come down to them. Further delay made them suspicious; they believed that he had been intimidated by the leaders of the senate, and they complained that the cause of the people had been abandoned and betrayed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At last some who had been waiting in the vestibule of the tribune's house sent word that he had been found dead in his house. As this news spread throughout the assembly, they at once dispersed in all directions, like a routed army that has lost its general. The tribunes especially were alarmed, for they were warned by their colleague's death how absolutely ineffective the Sacred Laws were for their protection.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The patricians, on the other hand, showed extravagant delight; so far was any one of them from regretting the crime, that even those who had taken no part in it were anxious to appear as though they had, and it was openly asserted that the tribunitian power must be chastised into submission.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Publilian Law.</note> the impression produced by this frightful instance of triumphant crime was still fresh, orders were issued for a levy, and as the tribunes were thoroughly intimidated, the consuls carried it out without any interruption from them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But now the plebeians were more angry at the silence of the tribunes than at the exercise of authority on the part of the consuls. They said that it was all over with their liberty, they had gone back to the old state of things, the tribunitian power was dead and buried with Genucius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some other method must be thought out and adopted by which they could resist the patricians, and the only possible course was for the commons to defend themselves, as they had no other help. Four-and-twenty lictors attended on the consuls, and these very men were drawn from the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nothing was more contemptible and feeble than they were, if there were any that would treat them with contempt, but every one imagined them to be great and awful things.</p> <p>After they had excited one another by these speeches, Volero Publilius, a plebeian, said that he ought not to be made a common soldier after serving as a centurion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consuls sent a lictor to him. Volero appealed to the tribunes. None came to his assistance, so the consuls ordered him to be stripped and the rods got ready. <q direct="unspecified">I appeal to the people,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">since the tribunes would rather see a Roman citizen scourged before their eyes than be murdered in their beds by you.</q> The more excitedly he called out, the more violently did the lictor tear off his toga, to strip him.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then Volero, himself a man of unusual strength, and helped by those to whom he called, drove the lictor off, and amidst the indignant remonstrances of his supporters, retreated into the thickest part of the crowd crying out, <q direct="unspecified">I appeal to the plebs for protection. Help fellow citizens!
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> help fellow soldiers! You have nothing to expect from the tribunes, they themselves need your aid.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The men greatly excited got ready as if for battle and a most critical struggle was evidently impending, where no one would show the slightest respect for either public or private rights The consuls tried to check the fury of the storm, but they soon found that there is little safety for authority without strength.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The lictors were mobbed, the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> broken, and the consuls driven from the Forum into the Senate-house, uncertain how far Volero would push his victory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As the tumult was subsiding they ordered the senate to be convened, and when it was assembled they complained of the outrage done to them, the violence of the plebeians, the audacious insolence of Volero.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After many violent speeches had been made, the opinion of the older senators prevailed; they disapproved of the intemperance of the plebs being met by angry resentment on the part of the patricians.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Volero was now in high favour with the plebs, and they made him a tribune at the next election. Lucius Pinarius and P. Furius were the consuls for that year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Everybody supposed that Volero would use all the power of his tribuneship to harass the consuls of the preceding year. On the contrary, he sub-ordinated his private grievances to the interests of the State, and without uttering a single word which could reflect on the consuls, he
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> proposed to the people a measure providing that the magistrates of the plebs should be elected by the Assembly of the Tribes. At first sight this measure appeared to be of a very harmless description, but it would deprive the patricians of all power of electing through their clients' votes those whom they wanted as tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was most welcome to the plebeians, but the patricians resisted it to the utmost. They were unable to secure the one effectual means of resistance, namely, inducing one of the tribunes, through the influence of the consuls or the leading patricians, to interpose his veto.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The weight and importance of the question led to protracted controversy throughout the year.</p> <p>The plebs re-elected Volero. The patricians, feeling that the question was rapidly approaching a crisis, appointed Appius Claudius, the son of Appius, who, ever since his father's contests with them, had been hated by them and cordially hated them in return.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>From the very commencement of the year the Law took precedence of all other matters. Volero had been the first to bring it forward, but his colleague, Laetorius, though a later, was a still more energetic supporter of it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He had won an immense reputation in war, for no man was a better fighter, and this made him a stronger opponent. Volero in his speeches confined himself strictly to discussing the Law and abstained from all abuse of the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But Laetorius began by accusing Appius and his family of tyranny and cruelty towards the plebs; he said it was not a consul who had been elected, but an executioner, to harass and torture the plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The untrained tongue of the soldier was unable to express the freedom of his sentiments; as words failed him, he said, <q direct="unspecified">I cannot speak so easily as I can prove the truth of what I have said; come here to-morrow, I will either perish before your eyes or carry the Law.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Next day the tribunes took their places on the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">templum</foreign>,</q><note anchored="yes" n="25" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">templum</foreign> &mdash;See note 6, Book I. Measures could only be submitted to the people from a place which the augurs had solemnly set apart for the purpose.</note> the consuls and the nobility stood about in the Assembly to prevent the passage of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Law. Laetorius gave orders for all, except actual voters, to withdraw. The young patricians kept their places and paid no attention to the tribune's officer, whereupon Laetorius ordered some of them to be
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> arrested. Appius insisted that the tribunes had no jurisdiction over any but plebeians, they were not magistrates of the whole people, but only of the plebs; even he himself could not, according to the usage of their ancestors, remove any man by virtue of his authority, for the formula ran, <q direct="unspecified">If it seems good to you, Quirites,
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> depart!</q> By making contemptuous remarks about his jurisdiction, he was easily able to disconcert Laetorius. The tribune, in a burning rage, sent his officer to the consul, the consul sent a lictor to the tribune, exclaiming that he was a private citizen without any magisterial
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> authority. The tribune would have been treated with indignity had not the whole Assembly risen angrily to defend the tribune against the consul, whilst people rushed from all parts of the City in excited crowds to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Forum. Appius braved the storm with inflexible determination, and the conflict would have ended in bloodshed had not the other consul, Quinctius, entrusted the consulars<note anchored="yes" n="26" resp="ed"><emph>consulars</emph> &mdash;Men whohaving themselves beenconsuls were in a position to restrain an acting consul.</note> with the duty of removing, by force if necessary, his colleague from
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> the Forum. He entreated the furious plebeians to be calm, and implored the tribunes to dismiss the Assembly; they should give their passions time to cool, delay would not deprive them of their power, but would add prudence to their strength; the senate would submit to the authority of the people, and the consuls to that of the senate.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With difficulty Quinctius succeeded in quieting the plebeians; the senators had much greater difficulty in pacifying Appius.</p> <p>At length the Assembly was dismissed and the consuls held a meeting of the senate Very divergent opinions were expressed according
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> as the emotions of fear or anger predominated but the longer the interval during which they were called away from impulsive action to calm deliberation, the more averse did they become to a prolongation of the conflict so much so indeed, that they passed a vote of thanks to Quinctius for having through his exertions allayed the disturbance Appius was called upon to consent to the consular authority being so far limited as to be compatible with a harmonious commonwealth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was urged that whilst the tribunes and the consuls each tried to bring everything under their respective authority, there was no basis for common action; the State was torn in two, and the one thing aimed at was, who should be its rulers not how could its security be preserved. Appius on the other hand, called gods and men to witness that the State was being betrayed and abandoned through fear; it was not the consul who was failing the senate, the senate was failing the consul; worse conditions were being submitted to than those which had been accepted on the Sacred Hill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> However, he was over-borne by the unanimous feeling of the senate and became quiet the Law was passed in silence. Then for the first time the Tribunes were elected by the Assembly of the Tribes. According to Piso three were added, as though there had only been two before. He gives their names as Cn Siccius, L. Numitorius, M. Duellius, Sp. Icilius, and L. Mecilius.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Volscians and Aequi</note>. &mdash;During the disturbances in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the war with the Volscians and Aequi broke out afresh. They had laid waste the fields, in order that if there were a secession of the plebs they might find refuge with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When quiet had been restored they moved their camp further away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Appius Claudius was sent against the Volscians, the Aequi were left for Quinctius to deal with. Appius displayed the same savage temper in the field that he had shown at home, only it was more unrestrained because he was not now fettered by the tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He hated the commons with a more intense hatred than his father had felt, for they had got the better of him and had carried their Law though he had been elected consul as being the one man who could thwart the tribunitian power &mdash;a
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Law, too, which former consuls, from whom the senate expected less than from him, had obstructed with less trouble. Anger and indignation at all this goaded his imperious nature into harassing his army by ruthless discipline.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> No violent measures, however, could subdue them, such was the spirit of opposition with which they were filled. They did everything in a perfunctory, leisurely, careless, defiant way; no feeling of shame or fear restrained them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If he wished the column to move more quickly they deliberately marched more slowly, if he came up to urge them on in their work they all relaxed the energy they had been previously exerting of their own accord;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> in his presence they cast their eyes down to the ground, when he passed by they silently cursed him, so that the courage which had not quailed before the hatred of the plebs was sometimes shaken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After vainly employing harsh measures of every kind, he abstained from any further intercourse with his soldiers, said that the army had been corrupted by the centurions, and sometimes called them, in jeering tones, tribunes of the plebs, and Voleros.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>LIX. None of this escaped the notice of the Veientines, and they pressed on more vigorously in the hope that the Roman army would show the same spirit of disaffection towards Appius which it had shown towards Fabius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But it was much more violent towards Appius than it had been towards Fabius, for the soldiers not only refused to conquer, like the army of Fabius, but they wished to be conquered. When led into action they broke into a disgraceful flight and made for their camp, and offered no resistance till they saw the Volscians actually attacking their entrenchments and doing frightful execution in their rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then they were compelled to fight, in order that the victorious enemy might be dislodged from their rampart; it was, however, quite evident that the Roman soldiers only fought to prevent the capture of the camp; otherwise they rejoiced in their ignominious defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Appius' determination as in no way weakened by this, but when he was meditating more severe measures and ordering an assembly of his troops, the officers of his staff and the military tribunes gathered round him and warned him on no account to try how far he could stretch his authority, for its force wholly depended upon the free consent of those who obeyed it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They said that the soldiers as a body refused to come to the assembly, and demands were heard on all sides for the camp to be removed from the Volscian territory; only a short time before the victorious enemy had all but forced his way into the camp. There were not only suspicions of a serious mutiny, the evidence was before their eyes. Appius yielded at last to their remonstrances.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He knew that they would gain nothing but a delay of punishment, and consented to forego the assembly. Orders were issued for an advance on the morrow, and the trumpet gave the signal for starting at dawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the army had got clear of the camp and was forming in marching order, the Volscians, aroused, apparently, by the same signal, fell upon the rear. The confusion thus created extended to the leading ranks, and set up such a panic in the whole army that it was impossible for either orders to be heard or a fighting line to be formed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No one thought of anything but flight. They made their way over heaps of bodies and arms in such wild haste that the enemy gave up the pursuit before the Romans abandoned their flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At last, after the consul had vainly endeavoured to follow up and rally his men, the scattered troops were gradually got together again, and he fixed his camp on territory undisturbed by war. He called up the men for an assembly, and after inveighing, with perfect justice, against an army which had been false to military discipline and had deserted
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> its standards, he asked them individually where he standards were, where their arms were.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The soldiers who had thrown away their arms, the standard-bearers who had lost their standards, and in addition to these the centurions and <foreign lang="la">duplicarii</foreign>28 who had deserted their ranks, he ordered o be scourged and beheaded. Of the rank and file every tenth man was drawn by lot for punishment.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Just the opposite state of things prevailed in the army campaigning amongst the Aequi, where the consul and his soldiers vied with each other in acts of kindness and comrade-ship. Quinctius was naturally milder, and the unfortunate severity of his colleague made him all the more inclined to follow the bent of his gentle disposition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Aequi did not venture to meet an army where such harmony prevailed between the general and his men, and they allowed their enemy to ravage their territory in all directions. In no previous war had plunder been gathered from a wider area.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The whole of it was given to the soldiers, and with it those words of praise which, no less than material rewards, delight the soldier's heart. The army returned home on better terms with their general, and through him with the patricians; they said that whilst the senate had given them a father it had given the other army a tyrant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The year, which had been passed in varying fortunes of war and furious dissensions both at home and abroad, was chiefly memorable for the Assembly of Tribes, which were important rather for the victory won in a prolonged contest than for any real advantage gained.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For through the withdrawal of the patricians from their council the Assembly lost more in dignity than either the plebs gamed, or the patricians lost, in strength.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Impeachment of Appius Claudius.</note>L. Valerius and T. Aemilius were consuls for the next year, which was a still stormier one, owing, m the first place, to the struggle between the two orders over the Agrarian Law, and secondly to the prosecution of Appius Claudius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was impeached by the tribunes, M. Duellius and Cn. Siccius, on the ground of his determined opposition to the Law, and also because
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> he defended the cause of the occupiers of the public land, as if he were a third consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Never before had any one been brought to trial before the people whom the plebs so thoroughly detested, both on his own and his father's account. For hardly any one had the patricians exerted themselves more than for him whom they regarded as the champion of the senate and the vindicator of its authority, the stout bulwark against disturbances of tribunes or plebs, and now saw exposed to the rage of the plebeians simply for having gone too far in the struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Appius Claudius himself alone of all the patricians, looked upon the tribunes, the plebs, and his own trial as of no account. Neither the threats of the plebeians nor the entreaties of the senate could induce him &mdash;I will not say to change his attire and accost men as a suppliant, but &mdash;even to soften and subdue to some extent his wonted asperity of language when he had to make his defence before the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There was the same expression, the same defiant look, the same proud tones of speech, so that a large number of the plebeians were no less afraid of Appius on his trial than they had been when he was consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He only spoke in his defence once, but in the same aggressive tone that he always adopted and his firmness so dumbfounded the tribunes and the plebs' that they adjourned the case of their own accord, and then allowed it to drag on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was not a very long interval however. Before the date of the adjourned trial arrived he was' carried off by illness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The tribunes tried to prevent any funeral oration being pronounced over him, but the plebeians would not allow the obsequies of so great a man to be robbed of the customary honours. They listened to the panegyric of the dead as attentively as they had listened to the indictment of the living, and vast crowds followed him to the tomb. 
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>.<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Sabines, Aequi, and Volscians.</note>In the same year the consul Valerius advanced with an army against the Aequi, but failing to draw the enemy into an engagement he commenced an attack on their camp. A terrible storm, sent down from heaven, of thunder and hail prevented him from continuing the attack. The surprise was heightened when after the retreat had been sounded, calm and bright weather returned. He felt that it would be an act of impiety to attack a second time a camp defended by some divine power. His warlike energies were turned to the devastation of the country. The other consul, Aemilius, conducted a campaign amongst the Sabines. There, too, as the enemy kept behind their walls, their fields were laid waste. The burning not only of scattered homesteads but also of villages with numerous populations roused the Sabines to action. They met the depredators, an indecisive action was fought, after which they moved their camp into a safer locality. The consul thought this a sufficient reason for leaving the enemy as though defeated, and coming away without finishing the war. LXIII. T. Numicius Priscus and A. Verginius were the new consuls. The domestic disturbance continued through these wars, and the plebeians were evidently not going to tolerate any further delay with regard to the Agrarian Law, and were pre-paring for extreme measures, when the smoke of burning farms and the flight of the country folk announced the approach of the Volscians. This checked the revolution which was now ripe and on the point of breaking out. The senate was hastily summoned, and the consuls led the men liable for active service out to the war, thereby making the rest of the plebs more peaceably disposed. The enemy retired precipitately, having effected nothing beyond filling the Romans with groundless fears. Numicius advanced against the Volscians to <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, Verginius against the Aequi. Here he was ambushed and narrowly escaped a serious defeat; the valour of the soldiers restored the fortunes of the day, which the consul's negligence had imperilled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> More skillful generalship was shown against the Volscians; the enemy were routed in the first engagement and driven in flight to <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, which was, for those days, a very wealthy city. The consul did not venture to attack it, but he took <placeName key="perseus,Caeno">Caeno</placeName> from the Antiates, not by any means so wealthy a place. Whilst the Aequi and Volscians were keeping the Roman armies engaged, the Sabines extended their ravages up to the gates of the City. In a few days the consuls invaded their territory, and, attacked fiercely by both armies, they suffered heavier losses than they had inflicted. LXIV. Towards the close of the year there was a short interval of peace, but, as usual, it was marred by the struggle between the patricians and the plebeians. The plebs, in their exasperation, refused to take any part in the election of consuls; T. Quinctius and Q. Servilius were elected consuls by the patricians and their clients. They had a year similar to the previous one: agitation during the first part, then the calming of this by foreign war. The Sabines hurriedly traversed the plains of Crustumerium, and carried fire and sword into the district watered by the Anio, but were repulsed when almost close to the Colline gate and the walls of the City. They succeeded, however, in carrying off immense spoil both in men and cattle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul Servilius followed them up with an army bent on revenge, and though unable to come up with their main body in the open country, he carried on his ravages on such an extensive scale that he left no part unmolested by war, and returned with spoil many times greater than that of the enemy. Amongst the Volscians also the cause of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was splendidly upheld by the exertions of general and soldiers alike. To begin with, they met on level ground and a pitched battle was fought with immense losses on both sides in killed and wounded. The Romans, whose paucity of numbers made them more sensible of their loss, would have retreated had not the consul called out that the enemy on the other wing were in flight, and by this well-timed falsehood roused the army to fresh effort. They made a charge and converted a supposed victory into a real one. The consul, fearing lest by pressing the attack too far he might force a renewal of the combat, gave the signal for retiring. For the next few days both sides kept quiet, as though there were a tacit understanding. During this interval, an immense body of men from all the Volscian and Aequan cities came into camp, fully expecting that when the Romans heard of their arrival they would make a nocturnal retreat. Accordingly, about the third watch they moved out to attack the camp. After allaying the confusion caused by the sudden alarm, Quinctius ordered the soldiers to remain quietly in their quarters, marched out a cohort of Hernicans to the outposts, mounted the buglers and trumpeters on horseback, and ordered them to sound their calls and keep the enemy on the alert till dawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the remainder of the night all was so quiet in the camp that the Romans even enjoyed ample sleep. The sight of the armed infantry whom the Volscians took to be Romans and more numerous than they really were, the noise and neighing of the horses, restless under their inexperienced riders and excited by the sound of the trumpets, kept the enemy in constant apprehension of an attack. LXV. At daybreak the Romans, fresh from their undisturbed sleep, were led into action, and at the first charge broke the Volscians, worn out as they were with standing and want of sleep. It was, however, a retreat rather than a rout, for in their rear there were hills to which all behind the front ranks safely retired. When they reached the rising ground, the consul halted his army. The soldiers were with difficulty restrained, they clamoured to be allowed to follow up the beaten foe. The cavalry were much more insistent, they crowded round the general and loudly declared that they would go on in advance of the infantry. While the consul, sure of the courage of his men, but not reassured as to the nature of the ground, was still hesitating, they shouted that they would go on, and followed up their shouts by making an advance. Fixing their spears in the ground that they might be more lightly equipped for the ascent, they went up at a run. The Volscians hurled their javelins at the first onset, and then flung the stones lying at their feet upon the enemy as they came up. Many were hit, and through the disorder thus created they were forced back from the higher ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In this way the Roman left wing was nearly overwhelmed, but through the reproaches which the consul cast upon his retreating men for their rashness as well as their cowardice, he made their fear give way to the sense of shame. At first they stood and offered a firm resistance, then when by holding their ground they had recovered their energies they ventured upon an advance. With a renewed shout the whole line went forward, and pressing on in a second charge they surmounted the difficulties of the ascent, and were just on the point of reaching the summit when the enemy turned and fled. With a wild rush, pursuers and fugitives almost in one mass dashed into the camp, which was taken. Those of the Volscians who succeeded in escaping made for <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>; thither the Roman army was led. After a few days' investment the place was surrendered, not owing to any unusual efforts on the part of the besiegers, but simply because after the unsuccessful battle and the loss of their camp the enemy had lost heart.</p></div1>

This was the Fabius who was the sole survivor of the extinction of his house at the Cremera.1
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Aemilius had already in his former consulship advocated the grant of land to the plebeians. As he was now consul for the second time, the agrarian party entertained hopes that the Law would be carried out; the tribunes took the matter up in the firm expectation that after so many attempts they would gain their cause, now that one consul, at all events, was supporting them; the consul's views on the question remained unchanged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Those in occupation of the land-the majority of the patricians complained that the head of the State was adopting the methods of the tribunes and making himself popular by giving away other people's property, and in this way they shifted all the odium from the tribunes on to the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There was every prospect of a serious contest, had not Fabius smoothed matters by a suggestion acceptable to both sides, namely, that as there was a considerable quantity of land which had been taken from the Volscians the previous year, under
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the auspicious general-ship of T. Quinctius, a colony might be settled at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, which, as a seaport town, and at no great distance from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, was a suitable city for the purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This would allow the plebeians to enter on public land without any injustice to those in occupa-tion, and so harmony would be restored to the State. This suggestion was adopted. He appointed as the three commis-sioners for the distribution of the land, T. Quinctius, A. Verginius, and P. Furius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those who wished to receive a grant were ordered to give in their names. As usual, abundance produced disgust,2 and so few gave in their names that the number was made up by the addition of Volscians as colonists.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The rest of the people preferred to ask for land at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> rather than accept it elsewhere. The Aequi sought for peace from Q. Fabius, who had marched against them, but they broke it by a sudden incursion into Latin territory.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Aequi and Volscians.</note>In the following year, Q. Servilius &mdash;for he was consul with Sp. Postumius &mdash;was sent against the Aequi, and fixed his entrenched camp on Latin territory. His army was attacked by an epidemic and compelled to remain inactive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The war was protracted into the third year, when Quinctius Fabius and T. Quinctius were the consuls. As Fabius after his victory had granted peace to the Aequi, they were by special edict assigned to him as his sphere of operation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He set out in the firm belief that the renown of his name would dispose them to peace; accordingly he sent envoys to their national council who were instructed to carry a message from Q. Fabius the consul to the effect that as he had brought peace from the Aequi to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, so now he was bringing war from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to the Aequi, with the same right hand, now armed, which he had formerly given to them as a pledge of peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The gods were now the witnesses and would soon be the avengers of those through whose perfidy and perjury this had come about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In any case, however, he would rather that the Aequi should repent of their own accord than suffer at the hands of an enemy; if they did repent they could safely throw themselves on the clemency they had already experienced, but if they
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> found pleasure in perjuring themselves, they would be warring more against the angered gods than against earthly foes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>These words, however, had so little effect that the envoys barely escaped maltreatment, and an army was despatched to Mount Algidus against the Romans. On this being reported at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, feelings of indignation rather than apprehension of danger hurried the other consul out of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So two armies under the command of both consuls advanced against the enemy in battle formation, to bring about an immediate engagement. But, as it happened, not much daylight remained, and a soldier called out from the enemies outposts: <q direct="unspecified">This, Romans, is making a display of war, not waging it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> You form your line when night is at hand; we need more daylight for the coming battle. When tomorrow's sun is rising, get into line again. There will be an ample opportunity of fighting, do not fear!</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Smarting under these taunts the soldiers were marched back into camp, to wait for the next day. They thought the coming night a long one, as it delayed the contest; after returning to camp they refreshed themselves with food and sleep.</p> <p>When the next day dawned the Roman line was formed some time before that of the enemy. At length the Aequi advanced.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The fighting was fierce on both sides; the Romans fought in an angry and bitter temper; the Aequi, conscious of the danger in which their misdoing had involved them, and hopeless of ever being trusted in the future, were compelled to make a desperate and final effort.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They did not, however, hold their ground against the Roman army, but were defeated and forced to retire within their frontiers. The spirit of the rank and file of the army was unbroken and not a whit more inclined to peace.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They censured their generals because they staked all on one pitched battle, a mode of fighting in which the Romans excelled, whereas the Aequi, they said, were better at destructive forays and raids; numerous bands acting in all directions would be more successful than if massed in one great army.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly, leaving a detachment to guard the camp, they sallied forth, and made such devastating forays in the Roman territory that the terror they caused extended even to the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The alarm was all the greater because such proceedings were quite unexpected. For nothing was less to be feared than that an enemy who had been defeated and almost surrounded in his camp should think of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> predatory incursions, whilst the panic-stricken country people, pouring in at the gates and exaggerating everything in their wild alarm, exclaimed that they were not mere raids or small bodies of plunderers, entire armies of the enemy were near, preparing to swoop down on the City in force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Those who were nearest carried what they heard to others, and the vague rumours became still more exaggerated and false. The running and clamour of men shouting <q direct="unspecified">To arms!</q> created nearly as great a panic as though the City was actually taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fortunately the consul Quinctius had returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from Algidus. This relieved their fears, and after allaying the excitement and rebuking them for being afraid of a defeated enemy, he stationed troops to guard the gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate was then convened, and on their authority he proclaimed a suspension of all business; after which he set out to protect the frontier, leaving Q. Servilius as prefect of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He did not, however, find the enemy.</p> <p>The other consul achieved a brilliant success. He ascertained by what routes the parties of the enemy would come, attacked each while laden with plunder and therefore hampered in their movements, and made their plundering expeditions fatal to them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Few of the enemy escaped; all the plunder was recovered. The consul's return put an end to the suspension of business, which lasted four days.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Then the census was made and the <q direct="unspecified">lustrum</q> closed by Quinctius.<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">Lustrum</foreign>, or expiation (see note 9, Book I). The last act of the censors during their period of office was to offer an expiatory sacrifice for the whole people. On the appointed day the citizens assembled in military formation in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>. The victims, a boar, a ram, and a bull &mdash;hence the name of the sacrifice, <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">suovetaurilia</foreign></q> &mdash;were carried thrice round the assembled host, who were then declared <q direct="unspecified">purified,</q> and whilst the animals were being offered on the altar, the censor to whom the lot had fallen of conducting the ceremony recited a traditional form of prayer for the strengthening and extension of the might of the Roman people. As the censor's office was originally fixed for five years, <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign></q> was used to denote that period of time.</note> The numbers of the census are stated to have been one hundred and four thousand seven hundred and fourteen, exclusive of widows
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and orphans.</p> <p>Nothing further of any importance occurred amongst the Aequi. They withdrew into their towns and looked on passively at the rifling and burning of their homesteads. After repeatedly marching through the length and breadth of the enemies' territory and carrying destruction everywhere, the consul returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with immense glory and immense spoil.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next consuls were A. Postumius Albus and Sp. Furius Fusus. Some writers call the Furii, Fusii. I mention this in case any one should suppose that the different names denote different people.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>It was pretty certain that one of the consuls would continue the war with the Aequi. They sent, accordingly, to the Volscians of Ecetra for assistance. Such was the rivalry between them as to which should show the most inveterate enmity to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that the assistance was readily granted, and preparations for war were carried on with the utmost energy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Hernici became aware of what was going on and warned the Romans that Ecetra had revolted to the Aequi. The colonists of <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> were also suspected, because on the capture of that town a large number of the inhabitants had taken refuge with the Aequi, and they were the most efficient soldiers throughout the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the Aequi were driven into their walled towns, this body was broken up and returned to <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There they found the colonists already disaffected, and they succeeded in completely alienating them from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Before matters were ripe, information was laid before the senate that a revolt was in preparation, and the consuls were instructed to summon the chiefs of the colony to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and question them as to what was going on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They came without any hesitation, but after being introduced by the consuls to the senate, they gave such unsatisfactory replies that heavier suspicion attached to them on their departure than on their arrival.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>War was certain. Sp. Furius, the consul to whom the conduct of the war had been assigned, marched against the Aequi and found them committing depredations in the territory of the Hernici. Ignorant of their strength, because they were nowhere all in view at once, he rashly joined battle with inferior forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the first onset he was defeated, and retired into his camp, but he was not out of danger there. For that night and the next day the camp was surrounded and attacked with such vigour that not even a messenger could be despatched to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The news of the unsuccessful action and the investment of the consul and his army was brought by the Hernici, and created such an alarm in the senate that they passed a decree in a form which has never been used except under extreme emergencies.

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Numerous maneuvers and skirmishes took place during these days, because the enemy with his superior numbers was able to attack the Romans from many points and so wear out their strength, as they were not able to meet them everywhere.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Whilst one part of their army attacked the camp, another was sent to devastate the Roman territory, and, if a favourable opportunity arose, to make an attempt on the City itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> L. Valerius was left to guard the City, the consul Postumius was sent to repel the raids on the frontier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> No precaution was omitted, no exertion spared; detachments were posted in the City, bodies of troops before the gates, veterans manned the walls, and as a necessary measure in a time of such disturbance, a cessation of public business was ordered for some days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the camp, meanwhile, the consul Furius, after remaining inactive during the first days of the siege, made a sortie from the <q direct="unspecified">decuman</q><note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed"><emph>decuman gate</emph> &mdash;See plan of Roman camp in <bibl>Class. Dict.</bibl> The decuman gate was always on the rear side of the camp, the praetorian gate on the side fronting the enemy.</note> gate and surprised the enemy, and though he could have pursued him, he refrained from doing so, fearing lest the camp might be attacked from the other
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> side. Furius, a staff officer and brother of the consul, was carried too far in the charge, and did not notice, in the excitement of the pursuit, that his own men were returning and that the enemy were coming upon him from behind. Finding himself cut off, after many fruitless attempts to cut his way back to camp, he fell fighting
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> desperately. The consul, hearing that his brother was surrounded, returned to the fight, and whilst he plunged into the thick of the fray was wounded, and with difficulty rescued by those round him. This incident damped the courage of his own men and raised that of the enemy, who were so inspirited by the death of a staff officer and the wound of the consul that the Romans, who had been driven back to their camp and again besieged, were no longer a match for them either in spirits or fighting
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> strength. Their utmost efforts failed to keep the enemy in check, and they would have been in extreme danger had not T. Quinctius come to their assistance with foreign troops, an army composed of Latin and Hernican
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> contingents. As the Aequi were directing their whole attention to the Roman camp and exultingly displaying the staff officer's head he attacked them in rear, whilst at a signal given by him a sortie was made simultaneously from the camp and a large body of the enemy were
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> surrounded.</p> <p>Amongst the Aequi who were in the Roman territory there was less loss in killed and wounded, but they were more effectually scattered in flight. Whilst they were dispersed over the country with their plunder, Postumius attacked them at various points where he had posted
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> detachments. Their army was thus broken up into scattered bodies of fugitives, and in their flight they fell in with Quinctius, returning from his victory, with the wounded consul. The consul's army fought a brilliant action and avenged the wounds of the consuls and the slaughter of the staff officer and his
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> cohorts.</p> <p>During those days great losses were inflicted and sustained by both
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> sides. In a matter of such antiquity it is difficult to make any trustworthy statement as to the exact number of those who fought or those who fell. Valerius of <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, however, ventures to give definite totals. He puts the Romans who fell in Hernican territory at 5800, and the Antiates who were killed by A. Postumius whilst raiding the Roman territory at 2400. The rest who fell in with Quinctius whilst carrying off their plunder got off with nothing like so small a loss; he gives as the exact number of their killed, 4230.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>On the return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the order for the cessation of all public business was revoked. The sky seemed to be all on fire, and other portents were either actually seen, or people in their fright imagined that they saw them. To avert these alarming omens, public intercessions were ordered for three days, during which all the temples were filled with crowds of men and women imploring the protection of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> gods. After this the Latin and Hernican cohorts received the thanks of the senate for their services and were dismissed to their homes. The thousand soldiers from Antium who had come after the battle, too late to help, were sent back almost with ignominy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Pestilence in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note>Then the elections were held and L. Aebutius and P. Servilius were chosen as consuls; they entered upon office on August I, which was then the commencement of the consular year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The season was a trying one, and that year happened to be a pestilential one both for the City, and the rural districts, for the flocks and herds quite as much as for human beings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The violence of the epidemic was aggravated by the crowding into the City of the country people and their cattle through fear of raids. This promiscuous collection of animals of all kinds became offensive to the citizens, through the unaccustomed smell, and the country people, crowded as they were into confined dwellings, were distressed by the oppressive heat which made it impossible to sleep.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their being brought into contact with each other in ordinary intercourse helped to spread the disease.</p> <p>Whilst they were hardly able to bear up under the pressure of this calamity, envoys from the Hernici announced that the Aequi and Volscians had united their forces, had entrenched their camp within their territory, and were ravaging their frontier with an immense army.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> not only saw in the thinly-attended senate an indication of the widespread suffering caused by the epidemic, but they had also to carry back the melancholy reply that the Hernici must, in conjunction with the Latins, undertake their own defence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Through a sudden visitation of the angry gods, the City of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was being ravaged by pestilence; but if any respite from the evil should come, then she would send succour to her allies as she had done the year before and on all previous occasions.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The allies departed, carrying home in answer to the gloomy tidings they had brought a still more gloomy response, for they had in their own strength to sustain a war which they had hardly been equal to when supported by the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The enemy no longer confined himself to the country of the Hernici, he went on to destroy the fields of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, which were already lying waste without having suffered the ravages of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He met no one, not even an unarmed peasant, and after overrunning the country, abandoned as it was by its defenders and even devoid of all cultivation, he reached the third milestone from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on the Gabian road.</p> <p>Aebutius, the consul, was dead, his colleague Servilius was still breathing, with little hope of recovery, most of the leading men were down, the majority of the senators, nearly all the men of military age, so that not only was their strength unequal to an expeditionary force such as the position of affairs required, but it hardly allowed of their mounting guard for home defence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The duty of sentinel was discharged in person by those of the senators whose age and health allowed them to do so; the Aediles of the plebs were responsible for their inspection. On these magistrates had devolved the consular authority and the supreme control of affairs.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The helpless commonwealth, deprived of its head and all its strength, was saved by its guardian deities and the fortune of the City, who made the Volscians and Aequi think more of plunder than of their enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For they had no hope of even approaching the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, still less of effecting its capture. The distant view of its houses and its hills, so far from alluring them repelled them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Everywhere throughout their camp angry remonstrances arose: <q direct="unspecified">Why were they idly wasting their time in a waste and deserted land amid plague stricken beasts and men while they could find places free from infection in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName> with its abundant wealth?</q> They hastily plucked up their standards,<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed">When an army was in camp, these were fixed in the ground, each marking the station of the cohort to which it belonged; when they were taken up it was the signal for breaking up the camp and commencing the march.</note> and by cross-marches through the fields of <placeName key="tgn,7010297">Labici</placeName> they reached the hills of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>. All the violence and storm of war was now turned in this direction.</p> <p>Meantime the Hernici and Latins joined their forces and proceeded to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were actuated by a feeling not only of pity but also of the disgrace they would incur if they had offered no opposition to their common foe while he was advancing to attack <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or had brought no succour to those who were their allies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Not finding the enemy there, they followed up their traces from the information supplied them, and met them as they were descending from the hills of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName> into the valley of Alba. Here a very one-sided action was fought, and their fidelity to their allies met with little success for the time.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The mortality in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> through the epidemic was not less than that of the allies through the sword. The surviving consul died; amongst other illustrious victims were M. Valerius and T. Verginius Rutilus, the augurs, and Ser. Sulpicius, the <q direct="unspecified">Curio Maximus.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">Each <foreign lang="la">Curia</foreign> had its own chapel and sacrifices and its own <foreign lang="la">Curio</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">Flamen</foreign> to conduct its religious services. The whole were under the supervision of the <foreign lang="la">Curio Maximus</foreign>.</note> Amongst the common people the violence of the epidemic made great ravage. The senate, deprived of all human aid, bade the people betake themselves to prayers; they with their wives and children were ordered to go as suppliants and entreat the gods to be
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> gracious. Summoned by public authority to do what each man's misery was constraining him to do, they crowded all the temples. Prostrate matrons, sweeping with their dishevelled hair the temple floors, were everywhere imploring pardon from offended heaven, and entreating that an end might be put to the pestilence.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Great Defeat of the Volscians.</note>Whether it was that the gods graciously answered prayer or that the unhealthy season had passed, people gradually threw off the influence of the epidemic and the public health became more satisfactory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Attention was once more turned to affairs of State, and after one or two interregna had expired, P. Valerius Publicola, who had been interrex for two days, conducted the election of L. Lucretius Tricipitmus and T. Veturius Geminus or Vetusius as consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They entered office on August II, and the State was now strong enough not only to defend its frontiers, but to take the offensive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Consequently, when the Hernici announced that the enemy had crossed their frontiers, help was promptly sent. Two consular armies were enrolled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Veturius was sent to act against the Volsci, Tricipitinus had to protect the country of the allies from predatory incursions, and did not advance beyond the Hernican frontier.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In the first battle Veturius defeated and routed the enemy. Whilst Lucretius lay encamped amongst the Hernici, a body of plunderers evaded him by marching over the mountains of <placeName key="perseus,Praeneste">Praeneste</placeName>, and descending into the plains devastated the fields of the Praenestines and Gabians, and then turned off to the hills above <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Great alarm was felt in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, more from the surprising rapidity of the movement than from insufficiency of strength to repel any attack. Quintus Fabius was prefect of the City. By arming the younger men and manning the defences, he restored quiet and security everywhere.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The enemy did not venture to attack the City, but returned by a circuitous route with the plunder they had secured from the neighbourhood. The greater their distance from the City the more carelessly they marched, and in this state they fell in with the consul Lucretius, who had reconnoitred the route they were taking and was in battle formation, eager to engage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As they were on the alert and ready for the enemy, the Romans, though considerably fewer in numbers, routed and scattered the vast host, whom the unexpected attack had thrown into confusion, drove them into the deep valleys and prevented their escape.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Volscian nation was almost wiped out there. I find in some of the annals that 13,470 men fell in the battle and the pursuit, and <date value="1750">1750</date> were taken prisoners, whilst twenty-seven military standards were captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Although there may be some exaggeration, there certainly was a great slaughter. The consul, after securing enormous booty, returned victorious to his camp. The two consuls then united their camps; the Volscians and Aequi also concentrated their shattered forces. A third battle took place that year; again fortune gave the victory to the Romans, the enemy were routed and their camp taken.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Terentilian Law.</note>Matters at home drifted back to their old state; the successes in the war forthwith evoked disorders in the City. Gaius Terentilius Harsa was a tribune of the plebs that year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thinking that the absence of the consuls afforded a good opportunity for tribunitian agitation, he spent several days in haranguing the plebeians on the overbearing arrogance of the patricians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In particular he inveighed against the authority of the consuls as excessive and intolerable in a free commonwealth, for whilst in name it was less invidious, in reality it was almost more harsh and oppressive than that of the kings had been, for now, he said, they
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> had two masters instead of one, with uncontrolled, unlimited powers, who, with nothing to curb their licence, directed all the threats and penalties of the laws against the plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> To prevent this unfettered tyranny from lasting for ever, he said he would propose an enactment that a commission of five should be appointed to draw up in writing the laws which regulated the power of the consuls. Whatever jurisdiction over themselves the people gave the consul, that and that only was he to exercise; he was not to regard his own licence and caprice as law.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When this measure was promulgated, the patricians were apprehensive lest in the absence of the consuls they might have to accept the yoke. A meeting of the senate was convened by Q. Fabius, the prefect of the City. He made such a violent attack upon the proposed law and its author, that the threats and intimidation could not have been greater even if the two consuls had been standing by the tribune, threatening his life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He accused him of plotting treason, of seizing a favourable moment for compassing the ruin of the commonwealth. <q direct="unspecified">Had the gods,</q> he continued, <q direct="unspecified">given us a tribune like him last year, during the pestilence and the war, nothing could have stopped him.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After the death of the two consuls, whilst the State was lying prostrate, he would have passed laws, amid the universal confusion, to deprive the commonwealth of the power of the consuls, he would have led the Volscians and Aequi in an attack on the City.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Why, surely it is open to him to impeach the consuls for whatever tyranny or cruelty they may have been guilty of towards any citizen, to bring them to trial before those very judges, one of whom had been their victim.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His action was making &mdash;not the authority of the consuls, but &mdash;the power of the tribunes odious and intolerable, and after being exercised peaceably and in harmony with the patricians, that power was now reverting to its old evil practices.</q> As to Terentilius, he would not dissuade him from continuing as he began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <q direct="unspecified">As to you,</q> said Fabius, <q direct="unspecified">the other tribunes, we beg you to reflect that in the first instance your power was conferred upon you for the assistance of individual citizens, not for the ruin of all; you have been elected as the tribunes of the plebs, not as the enemies of the patricians. To us it is distressing, to you it is a source of odium that the commonwealth should be thus attacked while it is without its head.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> You will not impair your rights, but you will lessen the odium felt against you if you arrange with your colleague to have the whole matter adjourned till the arrival of the consuls. Even the Aequi and Volscians, after the consuls had been carried off by the epidemic last year, did not harass us with a cruel and ruthless war.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The tribunes came to an understanding with Terentilius and the proceedings were ostensibly adjourned, but, as a matter of fact, abandoned. The consuls were immediately summoned home.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Lucretius returned with an immense amount of booty, and with a still more brilliant reputation. This prestige he enhanced on his arrival by laying out all the booty in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> for three days, that each person might recognise and take away his own property.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The rest, for which no owners appeared, was sold. By universal consent a triumph was due to the consul, but the matter was delayed through the action of the tribune, who was pressing his measure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul regarded this as the more important question. For some days the subject was discussed both in the senate and the popular assembly. At last the tribune yielded to the supreme authority of the consul and dropped his measure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the consul and his army received the honour they deserved; at the head of his victorious legions he celebrated his triumph over the Volscians and Aequi. The other consul was allowed to enter the City without his troops and enjoy an

Hence its name (<foreign lang="la">ovis</foreign>=sheep).</p></note></p> <p>The following year the new consuls, P. Volumnius and Ser. Sulpicius, were confronted by the proposed law of Terentilius, which was now brought forward by the whole college of
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> tribunes. During the year, the sky seemed to be on fire; there was a great earthquake; an ox was believed to have spoken &mdash;the year before this rumour found no credence. Amongst other portents it rained flesh, and an enormous number of birds are said to have seized it while they were flying about; what fell to the ground lay about for several days without giving out any bad
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> smell. The Sibylline Books were consulted by the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">duumviri</foreign>,</q> and a prediction was found of dangers which would result from a gathering of aliens, attempts on the highest points of the City and consequent bloodshed. Amongst other notices, there was a solemn warning to abstain from all seditious agitations. The tribunes alleged that this was done to obstruct the passing of the Law, and a desperate conflict seemed imminent.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>As though to show how events revolve in the same cycle year by year, the Hernici reported that the Volscians and Aequi, in spite of their exhaustion, were equipping fresh armies. <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> was the centre of the movement; the colonists of <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> were holding public meetings in Ecetra, the capital, and the main strength of the war. On this information being laid before the senate, orders were given for a
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> levy. The consuls were instructed to divide the operations between them; the Volscians were to be the province of the one, the Aequi of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> other. The tribunes, even in face of the consuls, filled the Forum with their shouts, declaring that the story of a Volscian war was a prearranged comedy, the Hernici had been prepared beforehand for the part they were to play; the liberties of the Roman were not being repressed by straightforward opposition, but were being cunningly fooled
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> away. It was impossible to persuade them that the Volscians and Aequi, after being almost exterminated, could themselves commence hostilities; a new enemy, therefore, was being sought for; a colony which had been a loyal neighbour was being covered with
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> infamy. It was against the unoffending people of <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> that war was declared; it was against the Roman plebs that war was really being waged. After loading them with arms they would drive them in hot haste out of the City, and wreak their vengeance on the tribunes by sentencing their fellow-citizens to
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> banishment. By this means &mdash;they might be quite certain &mdash;the Law would be defeated; unless, while the question was still undecided, and they were still at home, still unenrolled, they took steps to prevent their being ousted from their occupation of the City, and forced under the yoke of
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> servitude. If they showed courage, help would not be wanting, the tribunes were unanimous. There was no cause for alarm; no danger from abroad. The gods had taken care, the previous year, that their liberties should be safely protected.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Quinctius Caeso's Opposition and Banishment.</note>Thus far the tribunes. The consuls at the other end of the Forum, however, placed their chairs in full view of the tribunes and proceeded with the levy. The tribunes ran to the spot, carrying the Assembly with them. A few were cited, apparently as an experiment, and a tumult arose at once.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As soon as any one was seized by the consuls' orders, a tribune ordered him to be released. None of them confined himself to his legal rights; trusting to their strength they were bent upon getting what they set their minds upon by main force.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The methods of the tribunes in preventing the enrolment were followed by the patricians in obstructing the Law, which was brought forward every day that the Assembly met.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The trouble began when the tribunes had ordered the people to proceed to vote &mdash;the patricians refused to withdraw.<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed">The voting was conducted by the centuries, each voting as a unit. The vote of thecentury was determined by the majority of theindividuals composing it. To prepare for the voting, spaces were roped off in the Forum, one for each century; and the patricians, by keeping their places, prevented this necessary preparation from being made.</note> The older members of the order were generally absent from proceedings which were certain not to be controlled by reason, but given over to recklessness and licence;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the consuls, too, for the most part kept away, lest in the general disorder the dignity of their office might be exposed to insult.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Caeso was a member of the Quinctian house, and his noble descent and great bodily strength and stature made him a daring and intrepid young man. To these gifts of the gods he added brilliant military qualities and eloquence as a public speaker, so that no one in the State was held to surpass him either in speech or action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he took his stand in the middle of a group of patricians, conspicuous amongst them all, carrying as it were in his voice and personal strength all dictatorships and consulships combined, he was the one to withstand the attacks of the tribunes and the storms of popular indignation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Under his leadership the tribunes were often driven from the Forum, the plebeians routed and chased away, anybody who stood in his way went off stripped and beaten. It became quite clear that if this sort of thing were allowed to go on, the Law would be defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When the other tribunes were now almost in despair, Aulus Verginius, one of the college, impeached Caeso on a capital charge. This procedure inflamed more than it intimidated his violent temper; he opposed the Law and harassed the plebeians more fiercely than ever, and declared regular war against the tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His accuser allowed him to rush to his ruin and fan the flame of popular hatred, and so supply fresh material for the charges to be brought against him. Meantime he continued to press the Law, not so much in the hope of carrying it as in order to provoke Caeso to greater recklessness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Many wild speeches and exploits of the younger patricians were fastened on Caeso to strengthen the suspicions against him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Still the opposition to the Law was kept up. A. Verginius frequently said to the plebeians, <q direct="unspecified">Are you now aware, Quirites, that you cannot have the Law which you desire, and Caeso as a citizen, together? Yet, why do I talk of the Law?
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He is a foe to liberty, he surpasses all the Tarquins in tyranny. Wait till you see the man who now, in private station, acts the king in audacity and violence &mdash;wait till you see him made consul, or dictator.</q> His words were endorsed by many who complained of having been beaten, and the tribune was urged to bring the matter to a decision.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The day of trial was now at hand, and it was evident that men generally believed that their liberty depended upon the condemnation of Caeso.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At last, to his great indignation, he was constrained to approach individual members of the plebs; he was followed by his friends, who were amongst the foremost men of the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Titus Quinctius Capitolinus, who had three times been consul, after recounting his own numerous distinctions and those of his family asserted that neither in the Quinctian house nor in the Roman State did there exist another such example of personal merit and youthful courage. He had been the foremost soldier in his army, he had often fought under his own eyes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Sp. Furius said that Caeso had been sent by Quinctius Capitolinus to his assistance when in difficulties, and that no single person had done more to retrieve the fortunes of the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> L. Lucretius, the consul of the previous year, in the splendour of his newly-won glory, associated Caeso with his own claim to distinction, enumerated the actions in which he had taken part, recounted his brilliant exploits on the march and in the field, and did his utmost to persuade them to retain
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> as their own fellow-citizen a young man furnished with every advantage that nature and fortune could give, who would be an immense power in any state of which he became a member, rather than drive him to an alien people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As to what had given such offence &mdash;his hot temper and audacity &mdash;these faults were being continually lessened; what was wanting in him &mdash;prudence &mdash;was increasing day by day. As his faults were decaying and his virtues maturing, they ought to allow such a man to live out his years in the commonwealth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Among those who spoke for him was his father, L. Quinctius Cincinnatus. He did not go over all his merits again, for fear of aggravating the feeling against him, but he pleaded for indulgence to the errors of youth; he himself had never injured any one either by word or deed, and for his own sake he implored them to pardon his son.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some refused to listen to his prayers, lest they should incur the displeasure of their friends; others complained of the maltreatment they had received, and by their angry replies showed beforehand what their verdict would be.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Over and above the general exasperation, one charge in particular weighed heavily against him. M. Volscius Fictor, who had some years previously been tribune of the plebs, had come forward to give evidence that not long after the epidemic had visited the City, he had met some young men strolling in the Suburra.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A quarrel broke out and his elder brother, still weak from illness, was knocked down by a blow from Caeso's fist, and carried home in a critical condition, and afterwards died, he believed, in consequence of the blow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had not been allowed by the consuls, during the years that had elapsed, to obtain legal redress for the outrage. Whilst Volscius was telling this story in a loud tone of voice, so much excitement was created that Caeso was very near losing his life at the hands of the people. Verginius ordered him to be arrested and taken to prison. The patricians met violence by violence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> T. Quinctius called out that when the day of trial has been fixed for any one indicted on a capital charge and is near at hand, his personal liberty ought not to be interfered with before the case is heard and sentence given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The tribune replied that he was not going to inflict punishment upon a man not yet found guilty; but he should keep him in prison till the day of the trial, that the Roman people might be in a position to punish one who has taken a man's life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The other tribunes were appealed to, and they saved their prerogative by a compromise;<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed"><emph>saved their prerogative</emph> &mdash;The fact of an appeal being made to them by a patrician gave them the opportunity of magnifying their office, whilst, on the other hand, to have set him unconditionally at liberty would have weakened their influence with the plebs.</note> they forbade him to be cast into prison, and announced as their decision that the accused should appear in court, and if he failed to do so, he should forfeit a sum of money to the people. The question was, what sum would it be fair to
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> fix? The matter was referred to the senate, the accused was detained in the Assembly whilst the senators were deliberating. They decided that he should give sureties, and each surety was bound in 3000
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>.</q> It was left to the tribunes to decide how many should be given; they fixed the number at ten. The prosecutor released the accused on that bail. Caeso was the first who gave securities on a state trial. After leaving the Forum, he went the following night into exile amongst the Tuscans.</p> <p>When the day for the trial came, it was pleaded in defence of his non-appearance that he had changed his domicile by going into
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> exile. Verginius, nevertheless, went on with the proceedings, but his colleagues, to whom an appeal was made, dismissed the
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Assembly. The money was unmercifully extorted from the father, who had to sell all his property and live for some time like a banished man in an out-of-the-way hut on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,1130786">Tiber</placeName>.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Terentilian Law again.</note>This trial and the discussions on the Law kept the State employed; there was a respite from foreign troubles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The patricians were cowed by the banishment of Caeso, and the tribunes, having, as they thought, gained the victory, regarded the Law as practically carried.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As far as the senior senators were concerned, they abandoned the control of public affairs, but the younger members of the order, mostly those who had been Caeso's intimates, were more bitter than ever against the plebeians, and quite as aggressive. They made much more progress by conducting the attack in a methodical manner.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The first time that the Law was brought forward after Caeso's flight they were organised in readiness, and on the tribunes furnishing them with a pretext, by ordering them to withdraw, they attacked them with a huge army of clients in such a way that no single individual could carry home any special share of either glory or odium. The plebeians complained that for one Caeso thousands had sprung up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During the intervals when the tribunes were not agitating the Law, nothing could be more quiet or peaceable than these same men; they accosted the plebeians affably, entered into conversation with them, invited them to their houses, and when present in the Forum even allowed the tribunes to bring all other questions forward without interrupting them. They were never disagreeable to any one either in public or private, except when a discussion commenced on the Law; on all other occasions they were friendly with the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not only did the tribunes get through their other business quietly, but they were even reelected for the following year, without any offensive remark being made, still less any violence being offered. By gentle handling they gradually made the plebs tractable, and through these methods the Law was cleverly evaded throughout the year.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new consuls, C. Claudius, the son of Appius, and P. Valerius Publicola, took over the State in a quieter condition than usual. The new year brought nothing new. Political interest centred in the fate of the Law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The more the younger senators ingratiated themselves with the plebeians, the fiercer became the opposition of the tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They tried to arouse suspicion against them by alleging that a conspiracy had been formed; Caeso was in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and plans were laid for the assassination of the tribunes and the wholesale massacre of the plebeians, and further that the senior senators had assigned to the younger members of the order the task of abolishing the tribunitian authority so that the political conditions might be the same as they were before the occupation of the Sacred Hill.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>War with the Volscians and Aequi had become now a regular thing of almost annual recurrence, and was looked forward to with apprehension.</p> <p><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Capitol surprised and taken.</note>A fresh misfortune happened nearer home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The political refugees and a number of slaves, some 2500 in all, under the leadership of Appius Herdonius the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName>, seized the Capitol and Citadel by night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Those who refused to join the conspirators were instantly massacred, others in the confusion rushed in wild terror down to the Forum; various shouts were heard: <q direct="unspecified">To arms!</q> <q direct="unspecified">The enemy is in the City.</q> The consuls were afraid either to arm the plebeians or to leave them without arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Uncertain as to the nature of the trouble which had overtaken the City, whether it was caused by citizens or by foreigners, whether due to the embittered feelings of the plebs or to the treachery of slaves, they tried to allay the tumult, but their efforts only increased it; in their terrified and distracted state the population could not be controlled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Arms were, however, distributed, not indiscriminately, but only, as it was an unknown foe, to secure protection sufficient for all emergencies. The rest of the night they spent in posting men in all the convenient situations in the City, while their uncertainty as to the nature and numbers of the enemy kept them in anxious suspense.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Daylight at length disclosed the enemy and their leader. Appius Herdonius was calling from the Capitol to the slaves to win their liberty, saying that he had espoused the cause of all the wretched in order to restore the exiles who had been wrongfully banished and remove the heavy yoke from the necks of the slaves. He would rather that this be done at the bidding of the Roman people, but if that were hopeless, he would run all risks and rouse the Volscians and Aequi.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The state of affairs became clearer to the senators and consuls. They were, however, apprehensive lest behind these openly declared aims there should be some design of the Veientines or Sabines, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> whilst there was this large hostile force within the City the Etruscan and <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> legions should appear, and then the Volscians and Aequi, their standing foes, should come, not into their territory to ravage, but into the City itself, already partly captured. Many and various were their fears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What they most dreaded was a rising of the slaves, when every man would have an enemy in his own house, whom it would be alike unsafe to trust and not to trust, since by withdrawing confidence he might be made a more determined enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Such threatening and overwhelming dangers could only be surmounted by unity and concord, and no fears were felt as to the tribunes or the plebs. That evil was mitigated, for as it only broke out when there was a respite from other evils, it was believed to have subsided now in the dread of foreign aggression. Yet it, more than almost anything else, helped to further depress the fortunes of the sinking State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For such madness seized the tribunes that they maintained that it was not war but an empty phantom of war which had settled in the Capitol, in order to divert the thoughts of the people from the Law. Those friends, they said, and clients of the patricians would depart more silently than they had come if they found their noisy demonstration frustrated by the passing of the Law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They then summoned the people to lay aside their arms and form an Assembly for the purpose of carrying the Law. Meantime the consuls, more alarmed at the action of the tribunes than at the nocturnal enemy, convened a meeting of the senate.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When it was reported that arms were being laid aside and men were deserting their posts, P. Valerius left his colleague to keep the senate together and hurried to the tribunes at the <foreign lang="la">templum</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">templum</foreign> &mdash;See note 26, Book II.</note>. <q direct="unspecified">What,</q> he asked, <q direct="unspecified">is the meaning of this,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> tribunes? Are you going to overthrow the State under the leadership of Appius Herdonius? Has the man whose appeals failed to rouse a single slave been so successful as to corrupt you? Is it when the enemy is over our heads that you decide that men shall lay down their arms and discuss laws?</q> Then turning to the Assembly he said, <q direct="unspecified">If, Quirites, you feel no concern for the City, no anxiety for yourselves, still show reverence for your gods who have been taken captive by an
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> enemy! Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Queen Juno and <placeName key="tgn,2070580">Minerva</placeName>, with other gods and goddesses, are being besieged; a camp of slaves holds the tutelary deities of your country in its
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> power. Is this the appearance which you think a State in its senses ought to present &mdash;a large hostile force not only within the walls, but in the Citadel, above the Forum, above the Senate-house, whilst meantime the Assembly is being held in the Forum, the senate are in the Senate-house, and as though peace and quiet prevailed, a senator is addressing the House, whilst the Quirites in the Assembly are proceeding to
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> vote? Would it not be more becoming for every man, patrician and plebeian alike, for the consuls and tribunes, for gods and men, to come, one and all, to the rescue with their arms, to run to the Capitol and restore liberty and calm to that most venerable abode of Jupiter Optimus
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Maximus? 0, Father Romulus, grant to thine offspring that spirit in which thou didst once win back from these same Sabines the Citadel which had been captured with gold! Bid them take the road on which thou didst lead thine army. Behold, I, the consul, will be the first to follow thee and thy footsteps as far as mortal man can follow a god.</q> He ended his speech by saying that he was taking up arms, and he summoned all the Quirites to
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> arms. If any one tried to obstruct, he should now ignore the limits set to his consular authority, the power of the tribunes, and the laws which made them inviolable, and whoever or wherever he might be, whether in the Capitol or the Forum; he should treat him as a public enemy. The tribunes had better order arms to be taken up against P. Valerius the consul, as they forbade them to be used against Appius
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Herdonius. He would dare to do in the case of the tribunes what the head of his family<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed"><emph>head of his family</emph> &mdash;the P. Valerius mentioned in Book I. chap. lviii.</note> had dared to do in the case of the kings.</p> <p>There was every prospect of an appeal to force, and of the enemy enjoying the spectacle of a riot
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. However, the Law could not be voted upon, nor could the consul go to the Capitol, for night put an end to the threatened conflict. As night came on the tribunes retired, afraid of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> consul's arms. When the authors of the disturbance were out of the way, the senators went about amongst the plebeians, and mingling with different groups pointed out the seriousness of the crisis, and warned them to reflect into what a dangerous position they were bringing
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the State. It was not a contest between patricians and plebeians; patricians and plebeians alike, the stronghold of the City, the temples of the gods, the guardian deities of the State and of every home, were being surrendered to the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>While these steps were being taken to lay the spirit of discord in the Forum, the consuls had gone away to inspect the gates and walls, in case of any movement on the part of the Sabines or Veientines.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same night messengers reached <placeName key="tgn,2101894">Tusculum</placeName> with tidings of the capture of the Citadel, the seizure of the Capitol, and the generally disturbed state of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> L. Mamilius was at that time Dictator of <placeName key="tgn,2101894">Tusculum</placeName>. After hurriedly convening the senate and introducing the messengers, he strongly urged the senators not to wait until envoys arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> begging for help;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the fact of the danger and the seriousness of the crisis, the gods who watched over alliances, and loyalty to treaties, all demanded instant action. Never again would the gods vouchsafe so favourable an opportunity for conferring an obligation on so powerful a State or one so close to their own doors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They decided that help should be sent, the men of military age were enrolled, arms were distributed. As they approached <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> in the early dawn, they presented in the distance the appearance of enemies; it seemed as though Aequi or Volscians were coming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When this groundless alarm was removed they were admitted into the City and marched in order into the Forum, where P. Valerius, who had left his colleague to direct the troops on guard at the gates, was forming his army for battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was his authority that had achieved this result; he declared that if, when the Capitol was recovered and the City pacified they would allow the covert dishonesty of the Law which the tribunes supported to be explained to them, he would not oppose the holding of a plebeian Assembly, for he was not unmindful of his ancestors or of the name he bore, which made the protection of the plebs, so to speak, a hereditary care.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Following his leadership, amid the futile protests of the tribunes, they marched in order of battle up the Capitoline hill, the legion from <placeName key="tgn,7008406">Tusculum</placeName> marching with them. The Ro- mans and their allies were striving which should have the glory of recapturing the Citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Each of the commanders were encouraging his men. Then the enemy lost heart, their only confidence was in the strength of their position; whilst thus demoralised the Romans and allies advanced to the charge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They had already forced their way into the vestibule of the temple, when P. Valerius, who was in the front, cheering on his men, was killed. P. Volumnius, a man of consular rank, saw him fall. Directing his men to protect the body, he ran to the front and took the consul's place. In the heat of their charge the soldiers were not aware of the loss they had sustained; they gained the victory before they knew that they were fighting without a general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Many of the exiles defiled the temple with their blood, many were taken prisoners, Herdonius was killed. So the Capitol was recovered. Punishment was inflicted on the prisoners according to their condition, whether slave or freeman; a vote of thanks was accorded to the Tusculans; the Capitol was cleansed and solemnly purified.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It is stated that the plebeians threw <foreign lang="la">quadrantes</foreign> into the consul's house that he might have a more splendid funeral.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>No<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Terentilian Law &mdash;Fresh Troubles.</note> sooner were order and quiet restored than the tribunes began to press upon the senators the necessity of redeeming the promise made by Publius Valerius; they urged Claudius to free his colleague's <foreign lang="la">manes</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">manes</foreign>=<q direct="unspecified">the pure, the bright, the good.</q> They were thought of as disembodied spirits, immortal as the gods.

Their position in Roman mythology might possibly be understood as pointing to a prehistoric ancestor-worship. On epitaphs they are described as <q direct="unspecified">the Divine Manes.</q></note> from the guilt of deception by allowing the Law to be proceeded with. The consul refused to allow it until he had secured the election of a
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> colleague. The contest went on till the election was held. In the month of December, after the utmost exertions on the part of the patricians, L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, the father of Caeso, was elected consul, and at once took up his
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> office. The plebeians were dismayed at the prospect of having as consul a man incensed against them, and powerful in the warm support of the senate, in his own personal merits, and in his three children, not one of whom was Caeso's inferior in loftiness of mind, while they were his superiors in exhibiting the prudence and moderation where
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> necessary. When he entered on his magistracy he continually delivered harangues from the tribunal, in which he censured the senate as energetically as he put down the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> plebs. It was, he said, through the apathy of that order that the tribunes of the plebs, now perpetually in office, acted as kings in their speeches and accusations, as though they were living, not in the commonwealth of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, but in some wretched ill-regulated family. Courage, resolution, all that makes youth distinguished at home and in the battlefield, had been expelled and banished from <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> with his son
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Caeso. Loquacious agitators, sowers of discord, made tribunes for the second and third time in succession, were living by means of infamous practices in regal licentiousness. <q direct="unspecified">Did that fellow,</q> he asked, <q direct="unspecified">Aulus Verginius, because he did not happen to be in the Capitol, deserve less punishment than Appius Herdonius? Considerably more, by Jove, if any choose to form a true estimate of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> matter. Herdonius, if he did nothing else, avowed himself an enemy and in a measure summoned you to take up arms; this man, by denying the existence of a war, deprived you of your arms, and exposed you defenceless to the mercy of your slaves and exiles. And did you &mdash;without disrespect to C. Claudius and the dead P. Valerius, I would ask &mdash;did you advance against the Capitol before you cleared these enemies out of the Forum? It is an outrage on gods and men, that when there were enemies in the Citadel, in the Capitol, and the leader of the slaves and exiles, after profaning everything, had taken up his quarters in the very shrine of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, it should be at <placeName key="tgn,7008406">Tusculum</placeName>, not at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that arms were first taken
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> up. It was doubtful whether the Citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> would be delivered by the Tusculan general, L. Mamilius, or by the consuls, P. Valerius and C. Claudius. We, who had not allowed the Latins to arm, even to defend themselves against invasion, would have been taken and destroyed, had not these very Latins taken up arms
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> unbidden. This, tribunes, is what you call protecting the plebs, exposing it to be helplessly butchered by the enemy! If the meanest member of your order, which you have as it were severed from the rest of the people and made into a province, a State of your own &mdash; if such an one, I say, were to report to you that his house was beset by armed slaves, you would, I presume, think that you ought to render him
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> assistance; was not Jupiter Optimus Maximus, when shut in by armed slaves and exiles, worthy to receive any human aid? Do these fellows demand that their persons shall be sacred and inviolable when the very gods themselves are neither sacred nor inviolable in their
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> eyes? But, steeped as you are in crimes against gods and men, you give out that you will carry your Law this year. Then, most assuredly, if you do carry it, the day when I was made consul will be a far worse day for the State than that on which P. Valerius
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> perished. Now I give you notice, Quirites, the very first thing that my colleague and myself intend to do is to march the legions against the Volscians and Aequi. By some strange fatality, we find the gods more propitious when we are at war than when we are at peace. It is better to infer from what has occurred in the past than to learn by actual experience how great the danger from those States would have been had they known that the Capitol was in the hands of exiles.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul's speech produced an impression on the plebs; the patricians were encouraged and regarded the State as reestablished. The other consul, who showed more courage in supporting than in proposing, was quite content for his colleague to take the first step in a matter of such importance, but in carrying it out he claimed his full responsibility as consul.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The tribunes laughed at what they considered idle words, and constantly asked, <q direct="unspecified">By what method were the consuls going to take out an army, when no one would allow one to be levied?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">We do not,</q> said Quinctius, <q direct="unspecified">require to make a levy. At the time when P. Valerius supplied the people with arms for the recovery of the Capitol, they all took the oath to muster at the consul's orders, and not to disband without his orders.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> We, therefore, issue an order that all of you who took that oath appear under arms, tomorrow, at Lake Regillus.</q> Thereupon the tribunes wanted to release the people from their oath by raising a quibble. They argued that Quinctius was not consul when the oath was taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the neglect of the gods, which prevails in this age, had not yet appeared, nor did every man interpret oaths and laws in just the sense which suited him best; he preferred to shape his own conduct by their requirements.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The tribunes, finding any attempt at obstruction hopeless, set themselves to delay the departure of the army. They were the more anxious to do this as a report had got abroad that the augurs had received instructions to repair to Lake Regillus and set apart with the usual augural formalities a spot where business could be transacted by a properly constituted Assembly. This would enable every measure which had been carried by the violent exercise of the tribunitian authority to be repealed by the regular Assembly of the Tribes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> All would vote as the consuls wished, for the right of appeal did not extend beyond a mile from the City, and the tribunes themselves, if they went with the army, would be subject to the authority of the consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These rumours were alarming; but what filled them with the greatest alarm were the repeated assertions of Quinctius that he should not hold an election of consuls; the diseases of the State were such that none of the usual remedies could check them; the commonwealth needed a Dictator, in order that any one who took steps to disturb the existing constitution might learn that from a Dictator there lay no appeal.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate was in the Capitol. Thither the tribunes proceeded, accompanied by the plebeians in a great state of consternation. They loudly appealed for help, first to the consuls, then to the senators, but they did not shake the determination of the consul, until the tribunes had promised that they would bow to the authority of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consuls laid before the senate the demands of the plebs and their tribunes, and decrees were passed that the tribunes should not bring forward their Law during the year, nor should the consuls take the army out of the City. The senate also judged it to be against the interests of the State that a magistrate's tenure of office should be prolonged, or that the tribunes should be reelected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls yielded to the authority of the senate, but the tribunes, against the protests of the consuls, were reelected. On this, the senate also, to avoid giving any advantage to the plebs, reappointed Lucius Quinctius as consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nothing during the whole year roused the indignation of the consul more than this proceeding of theirs. <q direct="unspecified">Can I,</q> he exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">be surprised, Conscript Fathers, if your authority has little weight with the plebs? You yourselves are weakening it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Because, forsooth, they have disregarded the senatorial decree forbidding a magistrate's continuance in office, you yourselves wish it to be disregarded, that you may not be behind the populace in headstrong thoughtlessness, as though to possess more power in the State was to show more levity and lawlessness. It is undoubtedly a more idle and foolish thing to do away with one's own resolutions and decrees than with those of others.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Imitate, Conscript Fathers, the inconsiderate multitude; sin after the example of others, you who ought to be an example to others, rather than that others should act rightly after your example, as long as I do not imitate the tribunes or allow myself to be returned as consul in defiance of the resolution of the senate.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To you, C. Claudius, I earnestly appeal, that you, too, will restrain the Roman people from this lawlessness. As to myself, rest assured that I will accept your action in the firm belief that you have not stood in the way of my advancement to honour, but that I have gathered greater glory by rejecting it, and have removed the odium which my continuance in office would have provoked.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Thereupon the two consuls issued a joint edict that no one should make L. Quinctius consul; if any one attempted it, they would not allow the vote.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls elected were Q. Fabius Vibulanus, for the third time, and L. Cornelius Maluginensis. In that year the census was taken, and owing to the seizure of the Capitol and the death of the consul, the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign></q> was closed on religious grounds.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>During their consulship matters became disturbed at the very beginning of the year. The tribunes began to instigate the plebs.</p> <p><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Volscians and Aequi.</note>The Latins and Hernici reported that war on an immense scale was commenced by the Volscians and Aequi, the Volscian legions were already at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, and there were grave fears of the colony itself revolting. With great difficulty the tribunes were induced to allow the war to take precedence of their Law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then their respective spheres of operation were allotted to the consuls: Fabius was commissioned to take the legions to <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>; Cornelius was to protect <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and prevent detachments of the enemy from coming on marauding expeditions, as was the custom with the Aequi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Hernici and Latins were ordered to furnish troops, in accordance with the treaty; two-thirds of the army consisted of allies, the rest of Roman citizens. The allies came in on the appointed day, and the consul encamped outside the Capene gate. When the lustration of the army was completed, he marched to <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> and halted at a short distance from the city and from the enemies' standing camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As the army of the Aequi had not arrived, the Volscians did not venture on an engagement, and prepared to act on the defensive and protect their camp. The next day Fabius formed his troops round the enemies' lines, not in one mixed army of allies and citizens, but each nation in a separate division, he himself being in the centre with the Roman legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He gave orders to carefully observe his signals, that all might commence the action and retire &mdash;should the signal for retirement be sounded &mdash;at the same moment. The cavalry were stationed behind their respective divisions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In this triple formation he assaulted three sides of the camp, and the Volscians, unable to meet the simultaneous attack, were dislodged from the breastworks. Getting inside their lines he drove the panic-struck crowd, who were all pressing in one direction, out of their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The cavalry, unable to surmount the breastworks, had so far been merely spectators of the fight, now they overtook the enemy and cut them down as they fled in disorder over the plain, and so enjoyed a share of the victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was a great slaughter both in the camp and in the pursuit, but a still greater amount of spoil, as the enemy had hardly been able to carry away even their arms. Their army would have been annihilated had not the fugitives found shelter in the forest.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst these events were occurring at <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, the Aequi sent forward some of their best troops and by a sudden night attack captured the citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>; the rest of the army they halted not far from the walls, in order to distract the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Intelligence of this quickly reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was carried to the camp before <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, where it produced as much excitement as if the Capitol had been taken. The service which <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName> had so recently rendered and the similar character of the danger then and now, demanded a similar return of assistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Fabius made it his first object to carry the spoil from the camp into <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>; leaving a small force there he hastened by forced marches to <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>. The soldiers were not allowed to carry anything but their arms and whatever baked bread was at hand, the consul Cornelius brought up supplies from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The fighting went on for some months at <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With a portion of his army the consul attacked the camp of the Aequi, the rest he lent to the Tusculans for the recapture of their citadel. This could not be approached by direct assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Ultimately, famine compelled the enemy to evacuate it, and after being reduced to the last extremities, they were all stripped of their arms and clothes and sent under the yoke. Whilst they were making their way home in this ignominious plight, the Roman consul on Algidus followed them up and slew them to a man.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After this victory he led his army back to a place called Columen, where he fixed his camp. As the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> were no longer exposed to danger after the defeat of the enemy, the other consul also marched out of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The two consuls entered the enemies' territories by separate routes, and each tried to outdo the other in devastating the Volscian lands on the one side and those of the Aequi eon the other.</p> <p>I find it stated in the majority of authorities that <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName> revolted this year, but that the consul L. Cornelius conducted a campaign and recaptured the town, I would not venture to assert, as there is no mention of it in the older writers.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Internal Disturbances &mdash; Peace concluded with the Aequi.</note> When this war had been brought to a close, the fears of the patricians were aroused by a

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> carry through the task they had begun. L. Lucretius, the prefect of the City, succeeded, however, in inducing the tribunes to defer action till the arrival of the consuls.</p> <p>A fresh cause of trouble arose. A. Cornelius and Q.

These latter are those mentioned in the present passage.</note> indicted M. Volscius on the ground
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> that he had given what was undoubtedly false evidence against Caeso. It had become known from many sources that after the brother of Volscius first became ill, he had not only never been seen in public, but had not even left his bed, and
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> his death was due to an illness of many months' standing. On the date at which the witness fixed the crime, Caeso was not seen in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, whilst those who had served with him declared that he had constantly been in his place in
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the ranks with them and had not had leave of absence. Many people urged Volscius to institute a private suit before a judge. As he did not venture to take this course, and all the above mentioned evidence pointed to one conclusion, his condemnation was no more doubtful than that
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> of Caeso had been on the evidence which he had given. The tribunes managed to delay matters; they said they would not allow the quaestors to bring the accused before the Assembly unless it had first been convened to carry the
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Law. Both questions were adjourned till the arrival of the consuls. When they made their triumphal entry at the head of their victorious army, nothing was said about
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the Law; most people therefore supposed that the tribunes were intimidated. But it was now the end of the year and they were aiming at a fourth year of office, so they turned their activity from the Law to canvassing the electors. Though the consuls had opposed the tribunes' continuance in office as strenuously as if the Law had been mooted
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> solely to impair their authority, the victory remained with the tribunes.</p> <p>In the same year the Aequi sued for and obtained peace. The census, commenced the previous year, was completed, and the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign>,</q> which was then closed, is stated
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> to have been the tenth since the beginning of the City. The numbers of the census amounted to 117,319. The consuls in that year won a great reputation both at home and in war, for they secured peace abroad, and though there was not harmony at home, the commonwealth was less disturbed than it had been on other occasions.</p>

As before, they obstructed the Law, the tribunes obstructed the trial of Volscius; but the new quaestors possessed greater energy and greater weight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> T. Quinctius Capitolinus, who had been thrice consul, was quaestor with M. Valerius, the son of Valerius and grandson of Volesus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As Caeso could not be restored to the house of the Quinctii, nor could the greatest of her soldiers be restored to the State, Quinctius was bound in justice and by loyalty to his family to prosecute the false witness who had deprived an innocent man of the power to plead in his own defence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As Verginius, most of all the tribunes, was agitating for the Law, an interval of two months was granted the consuls for an examination of it, in order that when they had made the people understand what insidious dishonesty it contained, they might allow them to vote upon it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> During this interval matters were quiet in the City.</p> <p>The Aequi, however, did not allow much respite. In violation of the treaty made with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the year before, they made predatory incursions into the territory of <placeName key="tgn,7010297">Labici</placeName> and then into that of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They had placed Gracchus Cloelius in command, their foremost man at that time. After loading themselves with plunder they fixed their camp on Mount Algidus. Q. Fabius, P. Volumnius, and A. Postumius were sent from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to demand satisfaction, under the terms of the treaty.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The general's quarters were located under an enormous oak, and he told the Roman envoys to deliver the instructions they had received from the senate to the oak under whose shadow he was sitting, as he was otherwise engaged.

May they look upon our complaint now, and may they presently aid our arms when we seek to redress the outraged rights of gods as well as
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> men!</q></p> <p>On the return of the envoys, the senate ordered one of the consuls to march against Gracchus on Algidus; the other was instructed to ravage the territory of the Aequi. As usual, the tribunes attempted to obstruct the levy and probably would in the end have succeeded, had there not been fresh cause for alarm.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>An immense body of Sabines came in their ravages almost up to the walls of the City. The fields were ruined, the City thoroughly alarmed. Now the plebeians cheerfully took up arms, the tribunes remonstrated in vain, and two large armies were levied.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nautius led one of them against the Sabines, formed an entrenched camp, sent out, generally at night, small bodies who created such destruction in the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory that the Roman borders appeared in comparison almost untouched by war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Minucius was not so fortunate, nor did he conduct the campaign with the same energy; after taking up an entrenched position not far from the enemy, he remained timidly within his camp, though he had not suffered any important defeat. As usual, the enemy were emboldened by the lack of courage on the other side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They made a night attack on his camp, but as they gained little by a direct assault they proceeded the following day to invest it. Before all the exits were closed by the circumvallation, five mounted men got through the enemies' outposts and brought to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the news that the consul and his army were blockaded. Nothing could have happened so unlooked for, so undreamed of; the panic and confusion were as great as if it had been the City and not the camp that was invested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul Nautius was summoned home, but as he did nothing equal to the emergency, they decided to appoint a Dictator to retrieve the threatening position of affairs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> By universal consent L. Quinctius Cincinnatus was called to the office.</p> <p>It is worth while for those who despise all human interests in comparison with riches, and think that there is no scope for high honours or for virtue except where lavish wealth abounds to listen to this story.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Story of Cincinnatus.</note>The one hope of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, L.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There he was found by the deputation from the senate either digging out a ditch or ploughing, at all events, as is generally agreed, intent on his husbandry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After mutual salutations he was requested to put on his toga that he might hear the mandate of the senate, and they expressed the hope that it might turn out well for him and for the State. He asked them, in surprise, if all was well, and bade his wife, Racilia, bring him his toga quickly from the cottage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Wiping off the dust and perspiration, he put it on and came forward, on which the deputation saluted him as Dictator and congratulated him, invited him to the City and explained the state of apprehension in which the army were.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A vessel had been provided for him by the government, and after he had crossed over, he was welcomed by his three sons, who had come out to meet him. They were followed by other relatives and friends, and by the majority of the senate. Escorted by this numerous gathering and preceded by the lictors, he was conducted to his house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> There was also an enormous gathering of the plebs, but they were by no means so pleased to see Quinctius; they regarded the power with which he was invested as excessive, and the man himself more dangerous than his power. Nothing was done that night beyond adequately guarding the City.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following morning the Dictator went, before daylight, into the Forum and named as his Master of the Horse, L. Tarquitius, a member of a patrician house, but owing to his poverty he had served in the infantry, where he was considered by far the finest of the Roman soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In company with the Master of the Horse the Dictator proceeded to the Assembly, proclaimed a suspension of all public business, ordered the shops to be closed throughout the City, and forbade the transaction of any private business whatever.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then he ordered all who were of military age to appear fully armed in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> before sunset, each with five days' provisions and twelve palisades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Those who were beyond that age were required to cook the rations for their neighbours, whilst they were getting their arms ready and looking for palisades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So the soldiers dispersed to hunt for palisades; they took them from the nearest places , no one was interfered with, all were eager to carry out the Dictator's edict.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The formation of the army was equally adapted for marching or, if circumstances required for fighting; the Dictator led the legions in person, the Master of the Horse was at the head of his cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> To both bodies words of encouragement were addressed suitable to the emergency, exhorting them to march at extra speed, for there was need of haste if they were to reach the enemy at night; a Roman army with its consul had been now invested for three days, it was uncertain what a day or a night might bring forth, tremendous issues often turned on a moment of time.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The men shouted to one another, <q direct="unspecified">Hurry on, standard-bearer!</q> <q direct="unspecified">Follow up, soldiers!</q> to the great gratification of their leaders. They reached Algidus at midnight, and on finding that they were near the enemy, halted.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Dictator, after riding round and reconnoitring as well as he could in the night the position and shape of the camp, commanded the military tribunes to give orders for the baggage to be collected together and the soldiers with their arms and palisades to resume their places in the ranks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His orders were carried out. Then, keeping the formation in which they had marched, the whole army, in one long column, surrounded the enemies' lines. At a given signal all were ordered to raise a shout; after raising the shout each man was to dig a trench in front of him and fix his palisade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As soon as the order reached the men, the signal followed. The men obeyed the order, and the shout rolled round the enemies' line and over them into the consul's camp. In the one it created panic, in the other rejoicing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans recognised their fellow-citizens' shout, and congratulated one another on help being at hand. They even made sorties from their outposts against the enemy and so increased their alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul said there must be no delay, that shout meant that their friends had not only arrived but were engaged; he should be surprised if the outside of the enemies' lines was not already attacked. He ordered his men to seize their arms and follow him. A nocturnal battle began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They notified the Dictator's legions by their shouts that on their side too the action had commenced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Aequi were already making preparations to prevent themselves from being surrounded when the enclosed enemy began the battle; to prevent their lines from being broken through, they turned from those who were investing them to fight the enemy within, and so left the night free for the Dictator to complete his work. The fighting with the consul went on till dawn.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By this time they were completely invested by the Dictator, and were hardly able to keep up the fight against one army. Then their lines were attacked by Quinctius' army, who had completed the circumvallation and resumed their arms. They had now to maintain a fresh conflict, the previous one was in no way slackened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Under the stress of the double attack they turned from fighting to supplication, and implored the Dictator on the one side and the consul on the other not to make their extermination the price of victory, but to allow them to surrender their arms and depart. The consul referred them to the Dictator, and he, in his anger, determined to humiliate his defeated enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He ordered Gracchus Cloelius and others of their principal men to be brought to him in chains, and the town of Corbio to be evacuated. He told the Aequi he did not require their blood, they were at liberty to depart; but, as an open admission of the defeat and subjugation of their nation, they would have to pass under the yoke.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This was made of three spears, two fixed upright in the ground, and the third tied to them across the top. Under this yoke the Dictator sent the Aequi.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Their camp was found to be full of everything &mdash;for they had been sent away with only their shirts on &mdash;and the Dictator gave the whole of the spoil to his own soldiers alone.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Addressing the consul and his army in a tone of severe rebuke, <q direct="unspecified">You, soldiers,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">will go without your share of the spoil, for you all but fell a spoil yourselves to the enemy from whom it was taken; and you, L. Minucius, will command these legions as a staff officer, until you begin to show the spirit of a consul.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Minucius laid down his consulship and remained with the army under the Dictator's orders. But such obedience did men in those days pay to authority when ably and wisely exercised, that the soldiers, mindful of the service he had done them rather than of the disgrace inflicted on them, voted to the Dictator a gold crown a pound in weight, and when he left they saluted him as their <q direct="unspecified">patron.</q><note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="ed"><emph>patron</emph>
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> &mdash;The patron was bound to defend and protect those dependent on him &mdash;his clients &mdash;especially those who had not strictly legal rights. The soldiers regarded the Dictator as their protector and deliverer from slavery and death.</note> Quintus Fabius, the prefect of the City, convened a meeting of the senate, and they decreed that Quinctius, with the army he was bringing home, should enter the City
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> in triumphal procession. The commanding officers of the enemy were led in front, then the military-standards were borne before the general's chariot, the arm followed
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> loaded with spoil. It is said that tables spread with provisions stood before all the houses, and the feasters followed the chariot with songs of triumph and the customary jests and lampoons. On that day the freedom of the City was bestowed on L. Mamilius the Tusculan, amidst universal approval.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Dictator would at once have laid down his office had not the meeting of the Assembly for the trial of M. Volscius detained him: fear of the Dictator prevented the tribunes from obstructing it. Volscius was condemned and went into exile at <placeName key="perseus,Lanuvium">Lanuvium</placeName>. Quinctius resigned on the sixteenth day the dictatorship which had been conferred upon him for six months. During that period the consul Nautius fought a brilliant action with the Sabines at Eretum, who suffered a severe defeat, in addition to the ravaging
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> of their fields. Fabius Quintus was sent to succeed Alinucius in command at Algidus. Towards the end of the year, the tribunes began to agitate the Law, but as two armies were absent, the senate succeeded in preventing any measure from being brought before the plebs. The latter gained their point, however, in securing the reelection of the tribunes for
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the fifth time. It is said that wolves pursued by dogs were seen in the Capitol; this prodigy necessitated its purification. These were the events of the year.</p>

As there was peace abroad at the beginning of the year, the domestic troubles began again; the same tribunes agitating for the same Law. Matters would have gone further &mdash;so inflamed were the passions on both sides &mdash;had not news arrived, as though it had been purposely arranged, of the loss of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> the garrison at Corbio in a night attack of the Aequi. The consuls summoned a meeting of the senate; they were ordered to form a
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> force of all who could bear arms and march to Algidus. The contest about the Law was suspended, and a fresh struggle began about the enlistment. The consular authority was on the point of being overborne by
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the interference of the tribunes when a fresh alarm was created. A <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> army had descended on the Roman fields for plunder, and were approaching the City. Thoroughly alarmed, the tribunes allowed the enrolment to proceed; not, however, without insisting on an agreement that since they had been foiled for five years and but slight protection to the plebeians had so far been
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> afforded, there should henceforth be ten tribunes of the plebs elected. Necessity extorted this from the senate, with only one condition, that for the future they should not see the same tribunes in two successive years. That this agreement might not, like all the others, prove illusory, when once the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> war was over, the elections for tribunes were held at once.</p> <p>The office of tribune had existed for thirty-six years when
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> for the first time ten were created, two from each class. It was definitely laid down that this should be the rule in all future elections.</p> <p>When the enrolment was completed Minucius advanced against the Sabines, but did not find the enemy. After massacring the garrison at Corbio, the Aequi had captured <placeName key="tgn,1045778">Ortona</placeName>; Horatius fought them on Algidus, inflicting great slaughter, and drove them not only from Algidus but also out of Corbio and <placeName key="tgn,1045778">Ortona</placeName>; Corbio he totally destroyed on account of their having betrayed the garrison.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>M. Valerius and Sp. Vergilius were the new consuls. There was quiet at home and abroad. Owing to excessive rain there was a scarcity of provisions. A law was carried making the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> a part of the State domain. The tribunes of the plebs were reelected.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>These men in the following year, when T. Romilius and C. Veturius were the consuls, were continually making the Law the staple of all their harangues, and said that they should be ashamed of their number being increased to no purpose, if that matter made as little progress during their two years of office as it had made during the five preceding years.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Whilst the agitation was at its height, a hurried message came from <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName> to the effect that the Aequi were in the Tusculan territory. The good services which that nation had so lately rendered made the people ashamed to delay sending assistance. Both consuls were sent against the enemy, and found him in his usual position on Algidus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> An action was fought there; above 7000 of the enemy were killed, the rest were put to flight; immense booty was taken. This, owing to the low state of the public treasury, the consuls sold. Their action, however, created ill-feeling in the army, and afforded the tribunes material on which to base an accusation against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When, therefore, they went out of office, in which they were succeeded by Spurius Tarpeius and A. Aeternius, they were both impeached &mdash;Romilius by C. Calvius Cicero, plebeian tribune, and Veturius by L. Alienus, plebeian aedile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To the intense indignation of the senatorial party, both were condemned and fined Romilius had to pay 10,000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>,</q> and Veturius 15,000. The fate of their predecessors did not shake the resolution of the new consuls; they said that while it was quite possible that they might also be condemned, it was not possible for the plebs and its tribunes to carry the Law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Through long discussion it had become stale, the tribunes now threw it over and approached the patricians in a less aggressive spirit They urged that an end should be put to their disputes and if they objected to the measures adopted by the plebeians they should consent to the appointment of a body of legislators, chosen in equal numbers from plebeians and patricians to enact what would be useful to both orders and secure equal liberty for each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The patricians thought the proposal worth consideration, they said, however, that no one should legislate unless he were a patrician since they were agreed as to the laws and only differed as to who should enact them. Commissioners were sent to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with instructions to make a copy of the famous laws of Solon, and to investigate the institutions, customs, and laws of other Greek States. Their names were Spurius Postumius Albus, A. Manlius, P. Sulpicius Camerinus.</p>

This was due to two causes: first, they were waiting for the return of the commissioners who had gone to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and the foreign laws which they were to bring; and secondly, two fearful disasters came together, famine and a pestilence which was fatal to men and fatal to cattle.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For the second time &mdash;in the 301st year from the foundation of Rome &mdash;was the form of government changed; the supreme authority was transferred from consuls to decemvirs, just as it had previously passed from kings to consuls.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The decemvirs were Appius Claudius, T. Genucius, P. Sestius, L. Veturius, C. Julius, A. Manlius, P. Sulpicius, P. Curiatius, T. Romilius, and Sp. Postumius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As Claudius and Genucius were the consuls designate, they received the honour in place of the honour of which they were deprived. Sestius, one of the consuls the year before, was honoured because he had, against his colleague, brought that subject before the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Next to them were placed the three commissioners who had gone to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as a reward for their undertaking so distant an embassage, and also because it was thought that those who were familiar with the laws of foreign States would be useful in the compilation of new ones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is said that in the final voting for the four required to complete the number, the electors chose aged men, to prevent any violent opposition to the decisions of the others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The presidency of the whole body was, in accordance with the wishes of the plebs, entrusted to Appius. He had assumed such a new character that from being a stern and bitter enemy of the people he suddenly appeared as their advocate, and trimmed his sails to catch every breath of popular favour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They administered justice each in turn, the one who was presiding judge for the day was attended by the twelve lictors, the others had only a single usher each. Notwithstanding the singular harmony which prevailed amongst them &mdash;a harmony which under other circumstances might be dangerous to individuals &mdash;the most perfect equity was shown to others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It will be sufficient to adduce a single instance as proof of the moderation with which they acted. A dead body had been discovered and dug up in the house of Sestius, a member of a patrician family.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was brought into the Assembly. As it was clear that an atrocious crime had been committed, Caius Julius, a decemvir, indicted Sestius, and appeared before the people to prosecute in person, though he had the right to act as sole judge in the case. He waived his right in order that the liberties of the people might gain what he surrendered of his power.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst highest and lowest alike were enjoying their prompt and impartial administration of justice, as though delivered by an oracle, they were at the same time devoting their attention to the framing of the laws.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These eagerly looked for laws were at length inscribed on ten tables which were exhibited in an Assembly specially convened for the purpose. After a prayer that their work might bring welfare and happiness to the State, to them and to their children, the decemvirs bade them go and read the laws which were exhibited.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">As far as the wisdom and foresight of ten men admitted, they had established equal laws for all, for highest and lowest alike; there was, however, more weight in the intelligence and advice of many men.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They should turn over each separate item in their minds, discuss them in conversations with each other, and bring forward for public debate what appeared to them superfluous or defective in each enactment.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The future laws for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> should be such as would appear to have been no less unanimously proposed by the people themselves than ratified by them on the proposal of others.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When it appeared that they had been sufficiently amended in accordance with the expression of public opinion on each head, the Laws of the Ten Tables were passed by the Assembly of Centuries. Even in the mass of legislation today, where laws are piled one upon another in a confused heap, they still form the source of all public and private jurisprudence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After their ratification, the remark was generally made that two tables were still wanting; if they were added, the body, as it might be called, of Roman law would be complete. As the day for the elections approached, this impression created a desire to appoint decemvirs for a second year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The plebeians had learnt to detest the name of <q direct="unspecified">consul</q> as much as that of <q direct="unspecified">king,</q> and now as the decemvirs allowed an appeal from one of their body to another, they no longer required the aid of their tribunes.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But after notice had been given that the election of decemvirs would be held on
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the third market day,<note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="ed"><emph>the third market day</emph> &mdash;The country people &mdash;i. e. the bulk of the population &mdash;came into the City to market every eighth day, and consequently the Assembly met for business on those days. It became customary to give notice on the third market day previous to the Assembly.</note> such eagerness to be amongst those elected displayed itself, that even the foremost men of the State began an individual canvass as humble suitors for an office which they had previously with all their might opposed, seeking it at the hands of that very plebs with which they had hitherto
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> been in conflict. I think they feared that if they did not fill posts of such great authority, they would be open to men who were not worthy of them.</p> <p>Appius Claudius was keenly alive to the chance that he might not be reelected, in spite of his age and the honours
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> he had enjoyed. You could hardly tell whether to consider him as a decemvir
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> or a candidate. Sometimes he was more like one who sought office than one who actually held it; he abused the nobility, and extolled all the candidates who had neither birth nor personal weight to recommend them; he used to bustle about the Forum surrounded by ex-tribunes of the Duellius and Scilius stamp and through them made overtures to the plebeians, until even his colleagues, who till then had been wholly devoted to him, began to watch him, wondering
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> what he meant. They were convinced that there was no sincerity about it, it was certain that so haughty a man would not exhibit such affability for nothing. They regarded this demeaning of himself and hobnobbing with private individuals as the action of a man who was not so keen to resign office as to discover some way
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> of prolonging it. Not venturing to thwart his aims openly, they tried to moderate his violence by humouring him. As he was the youngest member of their body, they unanimously conferred on him the office of presiding
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> over the elections. By this artifice they hoped to prevent him from getting himself elected; a thing which no one except the tribunes of the plebs had ever done, setting thereby the worst of precedents.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>However, he gave out that, if all went well, he should hold the elections, and he seized upon what should have been an impediment as a good opportunity for effecting his purpose. By forming a coalition he secured the rejection of the two Quinctii &mdash; Capitolinus and Cincinnatus &mdash;his own uncle, C. Claudius, one of the firmest supporters of the nobility, and other citizens of
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the same rank. He procured the election of men who were very far from being their equals either socially or politically, himself amongst the first, a step which respectable men disapproved of; all the more because no one had supposed that he would have the audacity
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> to take it. With him were elected M. Cornelius Maluginensis, M. Sergius, L. Minucius, Q. Fabius Vibulanus, Q. Poetilius, T. Antonius Merenda, K. Duillius, Sp. Oppius Cornicen, and Manlius Rabuleius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Second Duumvirate.</note> was the end of Appius' assumption of a part foreign to his nature. From that time his conduct was in accordance with his natural disposition, and he began to mould his new colleagues, even before they entered on office, into the lines of his own character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They held private meetings daily; then, armed with plans hatched in absolute secrecy for exercising unbridled power, they no longer troubled to dissemble their tyranny, but made themselves difficult of access, harsh and stern to those to whom they granted interviews.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So matters went on till the middle of May. At that period, May 15, was the proper time for magistrates to take up their office. At the outset, the first day of their government was marked by a demonstration which aroused great fears. For, whereas the previous decemvirs had observed the rule of only one having the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign></q> at a time and making this emblem of royalty go to each in turn, now all the Ten suddenly appeared, each with his twelve lictors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Forum was filled with one hundred and twenty lictors, and they bore the axes tied up in the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign>.</q> The decemvirs explained it by saying that as they were invested with absolute power of life and death, there was no reason for the axes being removed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They presented the appearance of ten kings, and manifold fears were entertained not only by the lowest classes but even by the foremost of the senators. They felt that a pretext for commencing bloodshed was being sought for, so that if any one uttered, either in the senate or amongst the people, a single word which reminded them of liberty, the rods and axes would instantly be made ready for him, to intimidate the rest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For not only was there no protection in the people now that the right of appeal to them was withdrawn, but the decemvirs had mutually agreed not to interfere with each other's sentences, whereas the previous decemvirs had allowed their judicial decisions to be revised on appeal to a colleague, and certain matters which they considered to be within the jurisdiction of the people they had referred to them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>For some time they inspired equal terror in all, gradually it rested wholly on the plebs. The patricians were unmolested; it was the men in humble life for whom they reserved their wanton and cruel treatment. They were solely swayed by personal motives, not by the justice of a cause, since influence had with them the force of equity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They drew up their judgments at home and pronounced them in the Forum; if any one appealed to a colleague, he left the presence of the one to whom he had appealed bitterly regretting that he had not abided by the first sentence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A belief, not traceable to any authoritative source, had got abroad that their conspiracy against law and justice was not for the present only, a secret and sworn agreement existed amongst them not to hold any elections, but to keep their power, now they had once obtained it, by making the decemvirate perpetual.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The plebeians now began to study the faces of the patricians, to catch haply some gleam of liberty from the men from whom they had dreaded slavery and through that dread had brought the commonwealth into its present condition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The leaders of the senate hated the decemvirs, and hated the plebs; they did not approve of what was going on, but they thought that the plebeians deserved all that they got,
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> and refused to help men who by rushing too eagerly after liberty had fallen into slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They even increased the wrongs they suffered, that through their disgust and impatience at the present conditions they might begin to long for the former state of things and the two consuls of old.</p> <p>The greater part of the year had now elapsed; two tables had been added to the ten of the previous year; if these additional laws were passed by the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">Comitia Centuriata</foreign></q> there was no reason why the decemvirate should be any longer considered necessary.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Men were wondering how soon notice would be given of the election of consuls; the sole anxiety of the plebeians was as to the method by which they could reestablish that bulwark of their liberties, the power of the tribunes, which was now suspended.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Meantime nothing was said about any elections. At first the decemvirs had bid for popularity by appearing before the plebs, surrounded by ex-tribunes, but now they were accompanied
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> by an escort of young patricians, who crowded round the tribunals, maltreated the plebeians and plundered their property, and being the stronger, succeeded in getting whatever they had taken a fancy to.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They did not stop short of personal violence, some were scourged, others beheaded, and that this brutality might not be gratuitous, the punishment of the owner was followed by a grant of his effects. Corrupted by such bribes, the young nobility not only declined to oppose the lawlessness of the decemvirs, but they openly showed that they preferred their own freedom from all restraints to the general liberty.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The fifteenth of May arrived, the decemvirs' term of office expired, but no new magistrates were appointed. Though now only private citizens, the decemvirs came forward as determined as ever to enforce their authority and retain all the emblems of power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was now in truth undisguised monarchy. Liberty was looked upon as for ever lost, none stood forth to vindicate it, nor did it seem likely that any one would do so.</p> <p>Not only had the people sunk into despondency themselves but they were beginning to be despised by their neighbours, who scorned the idea of sovereign power existing where there was no liberty.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Sabines made an incursion into Roman territory in great force, and carrying their ravages far and wide, drove away an immense quantity of men and cattle to Eretum, where they collected their scattered forces and encamped in the hope that the distracted state of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> would prevent an army from being raised. Not only the messengers who brought the information but the country people who were flying into the City created a panic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The decemvirs, hated alike by the senate and the plebs, were left without any support, and whilst they were consulting as to the necessary measures, Fortune added a fresh cause of alarm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Aequi, advancing in a different direction, had entrenched themselves on Algidus, and from there were making predatory incursions into the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Tusculum">Tusculum</placeName>. The news was brought by envoys from Tusculum who implored assistance. The panic created unnerved the decemvirs, and seeing the City encompassed by two separate wars they were driven to consult the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They gave orders for the senators to be summoned, quite realising what a storm of indignant resentment was awaiting them, and that they would be held solely responsible for the wasted territory and the threatening dangers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This, they expected, would lead to an attempt to deprive them of office, unless they offered a unanimous resistance, and by a sharp exercise of authority on a few of the most daring spirits repress the attempts of the others.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>When the voice of the crier was heard in the Forum calling the patricians to the Senate-house to meet the decemvirs, the novelty of it, after so long a suspension of the meetings of the senate, filled the plebeians with astonishment. <q direct="unspecified">What,</q> they asked, <q direct="unspecified">has happened to revive a practice so long disused? We ought to be grateful to the enemy who are menacing us with war, for causing anything to happen which belongs to the usage of a free State.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They looked in every part of the Forum for a senator, but seldom was one recognised; then they contemplated the Senate-house and the solitude round the decemvirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The latter put it down to the universal hatred felt for their authority, the plebeians explained it by saying that the senators did not meet because private citizens had not the right to summon them. If the plebs made common cause with the senate, those who were bent on recovering their liberty would have men to lead them, and as the senators when summoned would not assemble, so the plebs must refuse to be enrolled for service. Thus the plebeians expressed their opinions.</p> <p>As to the senators, there was hardly a single member of the order in the Forum, and very few in the City.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Disgusted with the state of matters they had retired to their country homes and were attending to their own affairs, having lost all interest in those of the State. They felt that the more they kept away from any meeting and intercourse with their tyrannical masters the safer would it be for them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As, on being summoned, they did not come, the ushers were despatched to their houses to exact the penalties for non-attendance and to ascertain whether they absented themselves of set purpose. They took back word that the senate was in the country. This was less unpleasant for the decemvirs than if they had been in the City and had refused to recognise their authority.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Orders were issued for all to be summoned for the following day. They assembled in greater numbers than they themselves expected. This led the plebeians to think that their liberty had been betrayed by the senate, since they had obeyed men whose term of office had expired and who, apart from the force at their disposal,<note anchored="yes" n="18" resp="ed">They still had the lictors, as no fresh magistrates had been appointed.</note> were only private citizens; thus recognising their right to convene the senate.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This obedience, however, was shown more by their coming to the Senate-house than by any servility in the sentiments which we understand that they expressed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It is recorded that after the question of the war had been introduced by Appius Claudius, and before the formal discussion began,<note anchored="yes" n="19" resp="ed">The president introduced the question and each senator was asked by him in turn to express his opinion. Valerius was out of order.</note> L. Valerius Potitus created a scene by demanding that he should be allowed to speak on the political question, and on the decemvirs forbidding him in threatening tones to do so, he declared that he would present himself before the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Marcus Horatius Barbatus showed himself an equally determined opponent, called the decemvirs <q direct="unspecified">ten Tarquins,</q> and reminded them that it was under the leadership of the Valerii and the Horatii that monarchy had been expelled from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was not the name of <q direct="unspecified">king</q> that men had now grown weary of, for it was the proper title of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, Romulus the founder of the City and his successors were called <q direct="unspecified">kings,</q> and the name was still retained for religious purposes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was the tyranny and violence of kings that men detested. If these were insupportable in a king or a king's son, who would endure them in ten private citizens?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They should see to it that they did not, by forbidding freedom of speech in the House, compel them to speak outside its walls. He could not see how it was less permissible for him as a private citizen to convene an Assembly of the people than for them to summon the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They might find out whenever they chose how much more powerful a sense of wrong is to vindicate liberty than greedy ambition is to support tyranny.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were bringing up the question of the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> war as if the Roman people had any more serious war to wage than one against men who, appointed to draw up laws, left no vestige of law or justice in the State; who had abolished the elections, the annual magistrates, the regular succession of rulers, which formed the sole guarantee of equal liberty for all; who, though simple citizens, still retained the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> and the power of despotic monarchs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After the expulsion of the kings, the magistrates were patricians; after the secession of the plebs, plebeian magistrates were appointed. <q direct="unspecified">What party did these men belong to?</q>he asked. <q direct="unspecified">The popular party? Why, what have they ever done in conjunction with the people? The nobility? What! these men, who have not held a meeting of the senate for nearly a year, and now that they are holding one, forbid any speaking on the political situation?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Do not place too much reliance on the fears of others. The ills that men are actually suffering from seem to them much more grievous than any they may fear in the future.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst Horatius was delivering this impassioned speech, and the decemvirs were in doubt how far they ought to go, whether in the direction of angry resistance
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> or in that of concession, and unable to see what the issue would be, C. Claudius, the uncle of the decemvir Appius, made a speech more in the nature of entreaty than of censure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He implored him by the shade of his father to think rather of the social order under which he had been born than of the nefarious compact made with his colleagues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was much more, he said, for the sake of Appius than of the State that he made this appeal, for the State would assert its rights in spite of them, if it could not do so with their consent. But great controversies generally kindle great and bitter passions, and it was what these might lead to that he dreaded.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Though the decemvirs forbade the discussion of any subject save the one they had introduced, their respect for Claudius prevented them from interrupting him, so he concluded with a resolution that no decree should be passed by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was universally taken to mean that Claudius adjudged them to be private citizens, and many of the consulars expressed their concurrence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Another proposal, apparently more drastic, but in reality less effective, was that the senate should order the patricians to hold a special meeting to appoint an <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">interrex</foreign>.</q> For by voting for this, they decided that those who were presiding over the senate were lawful magistrates, whoever they were, whereas the proposal that no decree should be passed made them private citizens.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The cause of the decemvirs was on the point of collapsing, when L. Cornelius Maluginensis, the brother of M. Cornelius the decemvir, who had been purposely selected from among the consulars to wind up the debate, undertook to defend his brother and his brother's colleagues by professing great anxiety about the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He was wondering, he said, by what fatality it had come about that the decemvirs should be attacked by those who had sought the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> office or by their allies or in particular by these men,<note anchored="yes" n="20" resp="ed">i. e. Horatius and Valerius.</note> or why, during all the months that the commonwealth was undisturbed, no one questioned whether those at the head of affairs were lawful magistrates or not, whereas now, when the enemy were almost at their gates, they were fomenting civic discord &mdash;unless indeed they supposed that the nature of their proceeding would be less apparent in the general confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> No one was justified in importing prejudice into a matter of such moment whilst they were preoccupied with much more serious anxieties. He gave it as his opinion that the point raised by Valerius and Horatius, namely, that the decemvirs had ceased to hold office by May 15, should be submitted to the senate for decision after the impending wars had been brought to a close and the tranquillity of the State restored.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And further, that Ap. Claudius must at once understand that he must be prepared to make a proper return of the election which he held for the appointment of decemvirs, stating whether they were elected only for a year, or until such time as the laws which were still required should be passed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In his opinion every matter but the war should for the present be laid aside. If they thought that the reports of it which had got abroad were false, and that not only the messengers which had come in but even the Tuscan envoys had invented the story, then they ought to send out reconnoitring parties to bring back accurate information.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> If, however, they believed the messengers and the envoys, a levy ought to be made at the earliest possible moment, the decemvirs should lead the armies in whatever direction each thought best, and nothing else should take precedence.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst a division was being taken and the younger senators were carrying this proposition, Valerius and Horatius rose again in great excitement and loudly demanded leave to discuss the political situation. If, they said, the faction in the senate prevented them, they would bring it before the people, for private citizens had no power to silence them either in the Senate-house or in the Assembly, and they were not going to give way before the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign> of a mock authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Appius felt that unless he met their violence with equal audacity, his authority was practically at an end.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">It will be better,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">not to speak on any subject but the one we are now considering,</q> and as Valerius insisted that he should not keep silent for a private citizen, Appius ordered a lictor to go to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Valerius ran to the doors of the Senate-house and invoked <q direct="unspecified">the protection of the Quirites.</q> L. Cornelius put an end to the scene by throwing his arms round Appius as though to protect Valerius, but really to protect Appius from further mischief. He obtained permission for Valerius to say what he wanted, and as this liberty did not go beyond words, the decemvirs achieved their purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consulars and senior senators felt that the tribunitian authority, which they still regarded with detestation, was much more eagerly desired by the plebs than the restoration of the consular authority, and they would almost rather have had the decemvirs voluntarily resigning office at a subsequent period than that the plebs should recover power through their unpopularity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If matters could be quietly arranged and the consuls restored without any popular disturbance, they thought that either the preoccupation of war or the moderate exercise of power on the part of the consuls would make the plebs forget all about their tribunes.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The levy was proclaimed without any protest from the senate. The men of age for active service answered to their names, as there was no appeal from the authority of the decemvirs. When the legions were enrolled, the decemvirs arranged among themselves their respective commands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The prominent men amongst them were Q. Fabius and Appius Claudius. The war at home threatened to be more serious than the one abroad, and the violent disposition of Appius was deemed more fitted to repress commotions in the City, whilst Fabius was looked upon as more inclined to evil practices than to be any permanent good to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This man, at one time so distinguished both at home and in the field, had been so changed by office and the influence of his colleagues that he preferred to take Appius as his model rather than be true to himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He was entrusted with the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> war, and Manlius Rabuleius and Q. Poetilius were associated with him in its conduct. M. Cornelius was sent to Algidus, together with L. Minucius, T. Antonius, Kaeso Duillius, and M. Sergius. It was decreed that Sp. Oppius should assist Ap. Claudius in the defence of the City, with an authority coordinate with that of the other decemvirs.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Aequi and Sabines.</note>The military operations were not any more satisfactory than the domestic administration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The commanders were certainly at fault in having made themselves objects of detestation to the citizens, but otherwise the whole of the blame rested on the soldiers, who, to prevent anything from succeeding under the auspices and leadership of the decemvirs, disgraced both themselves and their generals by allowing themselves to be defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both armies had been routed, the one by the Sabines at Eretum, the other by the Aequi on Algidus. Fleeing from Eretum in the silence of the night, they had entrenched themselves on some high ground near the City between Fidenae and Crustumeria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They refused to meet the pursuing enemy anywhere on equal terms, and trusted for safety to their entrenchments and the nature of the ground, not to arms or courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On Algidus they behaved more disgracefully, suffered a heavier defeat, and even lost their camp. Deprived of all their stores, the soldiers made their way to <placeName key="tgn,2734588">Tusculum</placeName>, looking for subsistence to the good faith and compassion of their hosts, and their confidence was not misplaced.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Such alarming reports were brought to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> that the senate, laying aside their feeling against the decemvirs, resolved that guards should be mounted in the City, ordered that all who were of age to bear arms should man the walls and undertake outpost duty before the gates, and decreed a supply of arms to be sent to <placeName key="tgn,2101894">Tusculum</placeName> to replace those which had been lost, whilst the decemvirs were to evacuate <placeName key="tgn,2101894">Tusculum</placeName> and keep their soldiers encamped.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The other camp was to be transferred from Fidenae on to the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory, and by assuming the offensive deter the enemy from any project of attacking the City.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Assassination of Siccius.</note> these defeats at the hands of the enemy have to be added two infamous crimes on the part of the decemvirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> L. Siccius was serving in the campaign against the Sabines. Seeing the bitter feeling against the decemvirs, he used to hold secret conversations with the soldiery and threw out hints about the creation of tribunes and resorting to a secession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was sent to select and survey a site for a camp, and the soldiers who had been told off to accompany him were instructed to choose a favourable opportunity for attacking and despatching him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They did not effect their purpose with impunity, several of the assassins fell around him whilst he was defending himself with a courage equal to his strength, and that was exceptional.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The rest brought a report back to camp that Siccius had fallen into an ambush and had died fighting bravely, whilst some soldiers had been lost with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At first the informants were believed, but subsequently a cohort which had gone out by permission of the decemvirs to bury those who had fallen, found, when they reached the spot, no corpse despoiled, but the body of Siccius lying in the centre fully armed with those around all turned towards him, whilst there was not a single body belonging to the enemy nor any trace of their having retired. They brought the body back and declared that, as a matter of fact, he had been killed by his own men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The camp was filled with deep resentment, and it was decided that Siccius should be forthwith carried to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. The decemvirs anticipated this resolve by hastily burying him with military honours at the cost of the State. The soldiers manifested profound grief at his funeral, and the worst possible suspicions were everywhere entertained against the decemvirs</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Story of <placeName key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.</note> was followed by a second atrocity, the result of brutal lust, which occurred in the City and led to consequences no less tragic than the outrage and death of <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>, which had brought about the expulsion of the royal family. Not only was the end of the decemvirs the same as that of the kings, but the cause of their losing their power was the same in each case.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ap. Claudius had conceived a guilty passion for a girl of plebeian birth. The girl's father, L. Verginius, held a high rank in the army on Algidus; he was a man of exemplary character both at home and in the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His wife had been brought up on equally high principles, and their children were being brought up in the same way. He had betrothed his daughter to L. Icilius, who had been tribune, an active and energetic man whose courage had been proved in his battles for the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This girl, now in the bloom of her youth and beauty, excited Appius' passions, and he tried to prevail on her by presents and promises. When he found that her virtue was proof against all temptation, he had recourse to unscrupulous and brutal violence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He commissioned a client, M. Claudius, to claim the girl as his slave, and to bar any claim on the part of her friends to retain possession of her till the case was tried, as he thought that the father's absence afforded a good opportunity for this illegal action.<note anchored="yes" n="21" resp="ed">In cases where a person's status was in question, whether he were a freeman or not, the custody of the person was by the Twelve Tables assigned to those who claimed his freedom, and who had to give security to the other side to produce him for trial. Appius therefore was breaking a law which he had taken a part in enacting.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As the girl was going to her school in the Forum &mdash;the grammar schools were held in booths there &mdash;the decemvir's pander laid his hand upon her, declaring that she was the daughter of a slave of his, and a slave herself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then ordered her to follow him, and threatened, if she hesitated, to carry her off by force. While the girl was stupefied with terror, her maid's shrieks, invoking <q direct="unspecified">the protection of the Quirites,</q> drew a crowd together. The names of her father Verginius and her betrothed lover, Icilius, were held in universal respect.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Regard for them brought their friends, feelings of indignation brought the crowd to the maiden's support. She was now safe from violence; the man who claimed her said that he was proceeding according to law, not by violence, there was no need for any excited gathering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He cited the girl into court. Her supporters advised her to follow him; they came before the tribunal of Appius. The claimant rehearsed a story already perfectly familiar to the judge as he was the author of the plot, how the girl had been born in his house, stolen from there, transferred to the house of Verginius and fathered on him;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> these allegations would be supported by definite evidence, and he would prove them to the satisfaction of Verginius himself, who was really most concerned, as an injury had been done to him. Meanwhile, he urged, it was only right that a slave girl should follow her master.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The girl's advocates contended that Verginius was absent on the service of the State, he would be present in two days' time if information were sent to him, and it was contrary to equity that in his absence he should incur risk with regard to his children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They demanded that he should adjourn the whole of the proceedings till the father's arrival, and in accordance with the law which he himself had enacted, grant the custody of the girl to those who asserted her freedom, and not suffer a maiden of ripe age to incur danger to her reputation before her liberty was imperilled.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before giving judgment, Appius showed how liberty was upheld by that very law to which the friends of Verginia had appealed in support of their demand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But, he went on to say, it guaranteed liberty only so far as its provisions were strictly adhered to as regarded both persons and cases. For where personal freedom is the matter of claim, that provision holds good, because any one can lawfully plead, but in the case of one who is still in her father's power, there is none but her father to whom her master need renounce possession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His decision, therefore, was that the father should be summoned, and in the meanwhile the man who claimed her should not forego his right to take the girl and give security to produce her on the arrival of her reputed father.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The injustice of this sentence called forth many murmurs, but no one ventured on open protest, until P. Numitorius, the girl's grandfather, and Icilius, her betrothed, appeared on the scene.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The intervention of Icilius seemed to offer the best chance of thwarting Appius, and the crowd made way for him. The lictor said that judgment had been given, and as Icilius continued loudly protesting he attempted to remove him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Such rank injustice would have fired even a gentle temper. He exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">I am, at your orders, Appius, to be removed at the point of the sword, that you may stifle all comment on what you want to keep concealed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I am going to marry this maiden, and I am determined to have a chaste wife. Summon all the lictors of all your colleagues, give orders for the axes and rods to be in readiness &mdash;the betrothed of Icilius shall not remain outside her father's house.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Even if you have deprived us of the two bulwarks of our liberty &mdash;the aid of our tribunes and the right of appeal to the Roman plebs &mdash;that has given you no right to our wives and children, the victims of your lust.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Vent your cruelty upon our backs and necks; let female honour at least be safe. If violence is offered to this girl, I shall invoke the aid of the Quirites here for my betrothed, Verginius that of the soldiers for his only daughter;
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> we shall all invoke the aid of gods and men, and you shall not carry out that judgment except at the cost of our lives.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Reflect, Appius, I demand of you, whither you are going! When Verginius has come, he must decide what action to take about his daughter; if he submits to this man's claim, he must look out another husband for her. Meantime I will vindicate her liberty at the price of my life, sooner than sacrifice my honour.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The people were excited and a conflict appeared imminent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The lictors had closed round Icilius, but matters had not got beyond threats on both sides when Appius declared that it was not the defence of Verginia that was Icilius' main object; a restless intriguer, even yet breathing the spirit of the tribuneship, was looking out for a chance of creating sedition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He would not, however, afford him material for it that day, but that he might allow that it was not to his insolence that he was making a concession, but to the absent Verginius, to the name of father, and to liberty, he would not adjudicate on that day, or issue any decree. He would ask M. Claudius to forego his right, and allow the girl to be in the custody of her friends till the morrow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If the father did not then appear, he warned Icilius and men of his stamp that neither as legislator would he be disloyal to his own law, nor as decemvir would he lack firmness to execute it. He certainly would not call upon the lictors of his colleagues to repress the ringleaders of sedition, he should be content with his own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The time for perpetrating this illegality was thus postponed, and after the girl's supporters had withdrawn, it was decided as the very first thing to be done that the brother of Icilius and one of Numitor's sons, both active youths, should make their way straight to the gate and summon Verginius from the camp with all possible speed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They knew that the girl's safety turned upon her protector against lawlessness being present in time. They started on their mission, and riding at full speed brought the news to the father.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> While the claimant of the girl was pressing Icilius to enter his plea and name his sureties, and Icilius kept asserting that this very thing was being arranged, purposely spinning out the time to allow of his messengers getting first to the camp, the crowd everywhere held up their hands to show that every one of them was ready to be security for him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With tears in his eyes, he said, <q direct="unspecified">It is most kind of you. To-morrow I may need your help, now I have sufficient securities.</q> So Verginia was bailed on the security of her relatives.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Appius remained for some time on the bench, to avoid the appearance of having taken his seat for that one case only. When he found that owing to the universal interest in this one case no other suitors appeared, he withdrew to his home and wrote to his colleagues in camp not to grants leave of absence to Verginius, and actually to keep him under arrest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This wicked advice came too late, as it deserved to do; Verginius had already obtained leave, and started in the first watch. The letter ordering his detention was delivered the next morning, and was therefore useless.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the City, the citizens were standing in the Forum in the early dawn, on the tiptoe of expectation. Verginius, in mourning garb, brought his daughter, similarly attired, and accompanied by a number of matrons, into the Forum. An immense body of sympathisers stood round him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He went amongst the people, took them by the hand and appealed to them to help him, not out of compassion only but because they owed it to him; he was at the front day by day, in defence of their children and their wives; of no man could they recount more numerous deeds of endurance and of daring than of him. What good was it all, he asked, if while the City was safe, their children were exposed to what would be their worst fate if it were actually captured? Men gathered round him, whilst he spoke as though he were addressing the Assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Icilius followed in the same strain. The women who accompanied him made a profounder impression by their silent weeping than any words could have made.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Unmoved by all this &mdash;it was really madness rather than love that had clouded his judgment &mdash;Appius mounted the tribunal. The claimant began by a brief protest against the proceedings of the previous day; judgment, he said, had not been given owing to the partiality of the judge. But before he could proceed with his claim or any opportunity was given to Verginius of replying, Appius intervened.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is possible that the ancient writers may have correctly stated some ground which he alleged for his decision, but I do not find one anywhere that would justify such an iniquitous decision. The one thing which can be propounded as being generally admitted is the judgment itself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> His decision was that the girl was a slave.</p> <p>At first all were stupefied with amazement at this atrocity, and for a few moments there was a dead silence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then, as M. Claudius approached the matrons standing round the girl, to seize her amidst their outcries and tears, Verginius, pointing with outstretched arm to Appius, cried, <q direct="unspecified">It is to Icilius and not to you, Appius, that I have betrothed my daughter; I have brought her up for wedlock, not for outrage. Are you determined to satisfy your brutal lusts like cattle and wild beasts? Whether these people will put up with this, I know not, but I hope that those who possess arms will refuse to do so.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whilst the man who claimed the maiden was being pushed back by the group of women and her supporters who stood round, the crier called for silence.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The decemvir, utterly abandoned to his passion, addressed the crowd and told them that he had ascertained not only through the insolent abuse of Icilius on the previous day and the violent behaviour of Verginius, which the Roman people could testify to, but mainly from certain definite information received, that all through the night meetings had been held in the City to organise a seditious movement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Forewarned of the likelihood of disturbances, he had come down into the Forum with an armed escort, not to injure peaceable citizens, but to uphold the authority of the government by putting down the disturbers of public tranquillity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">It will therefore,</q> he proceeded, <q direct="unspecified">be better for you to keep quiet. Go, lictor, remove the crowd and clear a way for the master to take possession of his slave.</q> When, in a transport of rage, he had thundered out these words, the people fell back and left the deserted girl a prey to injustice.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Verginius, seeing no prospect of help anywhere, turned to the tribunal. <q direct="unspecified">Pardon me, Appius, I pray you, if I have spoken disrespectfully to you, pardon a father's grief. Allow me to question the nurse here, in the maiden's presence, as to what are the real facts of the case, that if I have been falsely called her father, I may leave her with the greater resignation.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Permission being granted, he took the girl and her nurse aside to the booths near the temple of Venus Cloacina, now known as the <q direct="unspecified">New Booths,</q> and there, snatching up a butcher's knife, he plunged it into her breast, saying, <q direct="unspecified">In this the only way in which I can, I vindicate, my child, thy freedom.</q> Then, looking towards the tribunal, <q direct="unspecified">By this blood, Appius, I devote thy head to the infernal gods.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Alarmed at the outcry which arose at this terrible deed, the decemvir ordered Verginius to be arrested. Brandishing the knife, he cleared the way before him, until, protected by a crowd of sympathisers, he reached the city gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Icilius and Numitorius took up the lifeless body and showed it to the people; they deplored the villainy of Appius, the ill-starred beauty of the girl, the terrible compulsion under which the father had acted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The matrons, who followed with angry cries, asked, <q direct="unspecified">Was this the condition on which they were to rear children, was this the reward of modesty and purity?</q> with other manifestations of that womanly grief, which, owing to their keener sensibility, is more demonstrative, and so expresses itself in more moving and pitiful fashion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The men, and especially Icilius, talked of nothing but the abolition of the tribunitian power and the right of appeal and loudly expressed their indignation at the condition of public affairs.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The people were excited partly by the atrocity of the deed, partly by the opportunity now offered of recovering their liberties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Appius first ordered. Icilius to be summoned before him, then, on his refusal to come, to be arrested. As the lictors were not able to get near him, Appius himself with a body of young patricians forced his way through the crowd and ordered him to be taken to prison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> By this time Icilius was not only surrounded by the people, but the people's leaders were there &mdash;L. Valerius and M. Horatius. They drove back the lictors and said, if they were going to proceed by law, they would undertake the defence of Icilius against one who was only a private citizen, but if they were going to attempt force, they would be no unequal match for him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A furious scuffle began; the decemvir's lictors attacked Valerius and Horatius; their <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign></q> were broken up by the people; Appius mounted the platform, Horatius and Valerius followed him; the Assembly listened to them, Appius was shouted down.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Valerius, assuming the tone of authority, ordered the lictors to cease attendance on one who held no official position; on which Appius, thoroughly cowed, and fearing for his life, muffled his head with his toga and retreated into a house near the Forum, without his adversaries perceiving his flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Sp. Oppius burst into the Forum from the other side to support his colleague, and saw that their authority was overcome by main force. Uncertain what to do and distracted by the conflicting advice given him on all sides, he gave orders for the senate to be summoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As a great number of the senators were thought to disapprove of the conduct of the decemvirs, the people hoped that their power would be put an end to through the action of the senate, and consequently became quiet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate decided that nothing should be done to irritate the plebs, and, what was of much more importance, that every precaution should be taken to prevent the arrival of Verginius from creating a commotion in the army.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Secession of the Plebs &mdash;Fall of the Decemvirs.</note> Accordingly, some of the younger senators were sent to the camp, which was then on Mount Vecilius. They informed the three decemvirs who were in command that by every possible means they
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> were to prevent the soldiers from mutinying. Verginius caused a greater commotion in the camp than the one
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> he had left behind in the City. The sight of his arrival with a body of nearly 400 men from the City, who, fired with indignation, had enlisted themselves as his comrades, still more the weapon still clenched in his hand and his blood-besprinkled clothes, attracted the attention of the whole camp. The civilian garb seen in all directions in the camp made the number of the citizens who had
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> accompanied him seem greater than it was.</p> <p>Questioned as to what had happened, Verginius for a long time could not speak for weeping; at length when those who had run up stood quietly round him and there was silence, he explained
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> everything in order just as it happened. Then lifting up his hands to heaven he appealed to them as his fellow-soldiers and implored them not to attribute to him what was really the crime of Appius, nor to look upon him with
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> abhorrence as the murderer of his children. His daughter's life was dearer to him than his own, had she been allowed to live in liberty and purity; when he saw her dragged off as a slave-girl to be outraged, he thought it better to lose
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> his child by death than by dishonour. It was through compassion for her that he had fallen into what looked like cruelty, nor would he have survived her had he not entertained the hope of avenging her death by the aid of his fellow-soldiers. For they, too, had daughters and sisters and wives; the lust of Appius was not quenched with his daughter's life, nay rather, the more impunity it met
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> with the more unbridled would it be. Through the sufferings of another they had received a warning how to guard themselves against a like wrong. As for him, his wife had been snatched from him by Fate, his daughter, because she could no longer live in chastity, had
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> met a piteous but an honourable death. There was no longer in his house any opportunity for Appius to gratify his lust, from any other violence on that man's part he would defend himself with the same resolution with which he had defended his child; others must look out for themselves and for their children.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>To this impassioned appeal of Verginius the crowd replied with a shout that they would not fail him in his grief or in the defence of his liberty. The civilians mingling in the throng of soldiers told the same tragic story, and how much more shocking this incident was to behold than to hear about; at the same time they announced that affairs were in fatal confusion at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> and that some had followed them into camp with the tidings that Appius after
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> being almost killed had gone into exile. The result was a general call to arms, they plucked
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> up the standards and started for <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>. The decemvirs, thoroughly alarmed at what they saw and at what they heard of the state of things in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, went to different parts of the camp to try and allay the excitement. Where they tried persuasion no answer was returned, but where they attempted to exercise authority, the reply was, <q direct="unspecified">We are men and have arms.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>They marched in military order to the City and occupied the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>. Every one whom they met was urged to recover the liberties of the plebs and appoint tribunes; apart from this no appeals to violence were heard.</p> <p>The meeting of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> senate was presided over by Sp. Oppius. They decided not to adopt any harsh measures, as it was through their own lack
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> of energy that the sedition had arisen. Three envoys of consular rank were sent to the army to demand in the name of the senate by whose orders they had abandoned their camp, and what they meant by occupying the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> in arms, and diverting the war from foreign foes to their own country,
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> which they had taken forcible possession of. They were at no loss for an answer, but they were at a loss for some one to give it, since they had as yet no regular leader, all individual officers did not venture to expose themselves to the dangers of such a position. The only reply was a loud and general demand that L. Valerius and. M. Horatius should be sent to them, to these men they would give a formal reply.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the envoys were dismissed, Verginius pointed out to the soldiers that they had a few moments ago felt themselves embarrassed in a matter of no great importance, because they were a multitude without a head, and the answer they had given, though it served their turn was the outcome
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> rather of the general feeling at the time than of any settled purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was of opinion that ten men should be chosen to hold supreme command, and by virtue of their military rank should be called tribunes of the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He himself was the first to whom this distinction was offered, but he replied, <q direct="unspecified">Reserve the opinion you have formed of me till both you and I are in more favourable circumstances; so long as my daughter is unavenged no honour can give me pleasure, nor in the present disturbed state of the commonwealth is it any advantage for those men to be at your head who are most obnoxious to party malice.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> I am to be of any use, I shall be none the less so in a private capacity.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Ten military tribunes, accordingly, were appointed.</p> <p>The army acting against the Sabines did not remain passive. There, too, at the instigation of Icilius and Numitorius, a revolt against the decemvirs took place. The feelings of the soldiery were roused by the recollection of the murdered Siccius no less than by the fresh story of the maiden whom it had been sought to make a victim of foul lust.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When Icilius heard that tribunes of the soldiers had been elected on the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>, he anticipated from what he knew of the plebs that
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> when they came to elect their tribunes they would follow the lead of the army and choose those who were already elected as military tribunes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As he was looking to a tribuneship himself, he took care to get the same number appointed and invested with similar powers by his own men, before they entered the City. They made their entry through the Colline gate in military order, with standards displayed, and proceeded through the heart of the City to the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There the two armies united, and the twenty military tribunes were requested to appoint two of their number to take the supreme direction of affairs. They appointed. M. Oppius and. Sex. Manlius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Alarmed at the direction affairs were taking, the senate held daily meetings, but the time was spent in mutual reproaches rather than in deliberation. The decemvirs were openly charged with the murder of Siccius, the profligacy of Appius, and the disgrace incurred in the field. It was proposed that Valerius and Horatius should go to the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>, but they refused to go unless the decemvirs gave up the insignia of an office which had expired the previous year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The decemvirs protested against this attempt to coerce them, and said that they would not lay down their authority until the laws which they were appointed to draw up were duly enacted.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>M. Duillius, a former tribune, informed the plebs that, owing to incessant wranglings, no business was being transacted in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He did not believe that the senators would trouble about them till they saw the City deserted; the Sacred Hill would remind them of the firm determination once shown by the plebs, and they would learn that unless the tribunitian power was restored there could be no concord in the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The armies left the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> and, going out by the Nomentan &mdash;or, as it was then called, the Ficulan &mdash;road, they encamped on the Sacred Hill, imitating the moderation of their fathers by abstaining from all injury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The plebeian civilians followed the army, no one whose age allowed him to go hung back. Their wives and children followed them, asking in piteous tones, to whom would they leave them in a City where neither modesty nor liberty were respected?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The unwonted solitude gave a dreary and deserted look to every part of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; in the Forum there were only a few of the older patricians, and when the senate was in session it was wholly deserted. Many besides Horatius and Valerius were now angrily asking, <q direct="unspecified">What are you waiting for, senators?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If the decemvirs do not lay aside their obstinacy, will you allow everything to go to wrack and ruin? And what, pray, is that authority, decemvirs, to which you cling so closely? Are you going to administer justice to walls and roofs? Are you not ashamed to see a greater number of lictors in the Forum than of all other citizens put together?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What will you do if the enemy approach the City? What if the plebs seeing that their secession has no effect, come shortly against us in arms? Do you want to end your power by the fall of the City?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Either you will have to do without the plebeians or you will have to accept their tribunes; sooner than they will go without their magistrates, we shall have to go without ours.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> That power which they wrested from our fathers, when it was an untried novelty, they will not submit to be deprived of, now that they have tasted the sweets of it, especially as we are not making that moderate use of our power which would prevent their needing its protection.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Remonstrances like these came from all parts of the House; at last the decemvirs, overborne by the unanimous opposition, asserted that since it was the general wish, they would submit to the authority of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> All they asked for was that they might be protected against the popular rage; they warned the senate against the plebs becoming by their death habituated to inflicting punishment on the patricians.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Valerius and Horatius were then sent to the plebs with terms which it was thought would lead to their return and the adjustment of all differences; they were also instructed to procure guarantees for the protection of the decemvirs against popular violence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were welcomed in the camp with every expression of delight, for they were unquestionably regarded as liberators from the commencement of the disturbance to its close. Thanks therefore were offered to them on their arrival. Icilius was the spokesman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A policy had been agreed upon before the arrival of the envoys, so when the discussion of the terms commenced, and the envoys asked what the demands of the plebs were, Icilius put forward proposals of such a nature as to show clearly that their hopes lay in the justice of their cause rather than in an appeal to arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They demanded the re-establishment of the tribunitian power and the right of appeal, which before the institution of decemvirs had been their main security. They also demanded an amnesty for those who had incited the soldiers or the plebs to recover their liberties by a secession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The only vindictive demand made was with reference to the punishment of the decemvirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They insisted, as an act of justice, that they should be surrendered, and they threatened to burn them alive. The envoys replied to these demands as follows: <q direct="unspecified">The demands you have put forward as the result of your deliberations are so equitable that they would have been voluntarily conceded, for you ask for them as the safeguards of your liberties, not as giving you licence to attack others.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Your feelings of resentment are to be excused rather than indulged; for it is through hatred of cruelty that you are actually hurrying into cruelty, and almost before you are free yourselves you want to act the tyrant over your adversaries.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Is our State never to enjoy any respite from punishments inflicted either by the patricians on the Roman plebs, or by the plebs on the patricians?
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> You need the shield rather than the sword. He is humble enough who lives in the State under equal laws, neither inflicting nor suffering injury.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Even if the time should come when you will make yourselves formidable, when, after recovering your magistrates and your laws, you will have judicial power over our lives and property &mdash;even then you will decide each case on its merits, it is enough now that your liberties are won back.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Permission having been unanimously granted them to do as they thought best, the envoys announced that they would return shortly after matters were arranged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they laid the demands of the plebs before the senate, the other decemvirs, on finding that no mention was made of inflicting punishment on them, raised no objection whatever.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The stern Appius, who was detested most of all, measuring the hatred of others towards him by his hatred towards them, said, <q direct="unspecified">I am quite aware of the fate that is hanging over me.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I see that the struggle against us is only postponed till our weapons are handed over to our opponents. Their rage must be appeased with blood. Still, even I do not hesitate to lay down my decemvirate.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A decree was passed for the decemvirs to resign office as soon as possible, Q. Furius, the Pontifex Maximus, to appoint tribunes of the plebs, and an amnesty to be granted for the secession of the soldiers and the plebs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After these decrees were passed, the senate broke up, and the decemvirs proceeded to the Assembly and formally laid down their office, to the immense delight of all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This was reported to the plebs on the Sacred Hill. The envoys who carried the intelligence were followed by everybody who was left in the City; this mass of people was met by another rejoicing multitude who issued from the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They exchanged mutual congratulations on the restoration of liberty and concord. The envoys, addressing the multitude as an Assembly, said, <q direct="unspecified">Prosperity, fortune, and happiness to you and to the State! Return to your fatherland, your homes, your wives, and your children! But carry into the City the same self-control which you have exhibited here, where no man's land has been damaged, notwithstanding the need of so many things necessary for so large a multitude.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Go to the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>, whence you came; there, on the auspicious spot where you laid the beginnings of your liberty, you will appoint your tribunes; the Pontifex Maximus will be present to hold the election.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Great was the delight and eagerness with which they applauded everything. They plucked up the standards and started for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, outdoing those they met in their expressions of joy. Marching under arms through the City in silence, they reached the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There the Pontifex Maximus at once proceeded to hold the election for tribunes. The first to be elected was L. Verginius; next, the organisers of the secession, L. Icilius and.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> P. Numitorius, the uncle of Verginius; then, C. Sicinius, the son of the man who is recorded as the first to be elected of the tribunes on the Sacred Hill, and M. Duillius, who had filled that office with distinction before the appointment of the decemvirs, and through all the struggles with them had never failed to support the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After these came M. Titinius, M. Pomponius, C. Apronius, Appius Villius, and Caius Oppius, all of whom were elected rather in hope of their future usefulness than for any services actually rendered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>When he had entered on his tribuneship L. Icilius at once proposed a resolution which the plebs accepted, that no one should suffer for the secession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Marcus Duillius immediately carried a measure for the election of consuls and the right to appeal from them to the people. All these measures were passed in a council of the plebs which was held in the Flaminian Meadows, now called the Circus Flaminius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">New Laws proposed by the Consuls.</note> election of consuls took place under the presidency of an <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">interrex</foreign>.</q> Those elected were L. Valerius and. M. Horatius, and they at once assumed office.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their consulship was a popular one, and inflicted no injustice upon the patricians, though they regarded it with suspicion, for whatever was done to safeguard the liberties of the plebs they looked upon as an infringement of their own powers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>First of all, as it was a doubtful legal point whether the patricians were bound by the ordinances of the plebs, they carried a law in the Assembly of Centuries that what the plebs had passed in their Tribes should be binding on the whole people.<note anchored="yes" n="22" resp="ed">On the relation between the Assembly of Tribes and the Assembly of Centuries, see <bibl>Mommsen, Vol. I. p. 272</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By this law a very effective weapon was placed in the hands of the tribunes. Then another consular law, confirming the right of appeal, as the one defence of liberty, which had been annulled by the decemvirs, was not only restored but strengthened for the future by a fresh enactment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This forbade the appointment of any magistrate from whom there was no right of appeal, and provided that any one who did so appoint might be rightly and lawfully put to death, nor should the man who put him to death be held guilty of murder.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When they had sufficiently strengthened the plebs by the right of appeal on the one hand and the protection afforded by the tribunes on the other, they proceeded to secure the personal inviolability of the tribunes themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The memory of this had almost perished, so they renewed it with certain sacred rites revived from a distant past, and in addition to securing their inviolability by the sanctions of religion, they enacted a law that whoever offered violence to the magistrates of the plebs, whether tribunes, aediles, or decemviral judges, his person should
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> be devoted to <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, his possessions sold and the proceeds assigned to the temple of <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>, Liber, and Libera, Jurists say that by this law no one was actually <q direct="unspecified">sacrosanct,</q> but that when injury was offered to any of those mentioned above the offender was <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">sacer</foreign></q>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If an aedile, therefore, were arrested and sent to prison by superior magistrates, though this could not be done by law &mdash;for by this law it would not be lawful for him to be injured &mdash;yet
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> it is a proof that an aedile is not held to be <q direct="unspecified">sacrosanct</q> whereas the tribunes of the plebs were <q direct="unspecified">sacrosanct</q> by the ancient oath taken by the plebeians when that office was first created.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There were some who interpreted the law as including even the consuls in its provisions, and the praetors, because they were elected under the same auspices as the consuls, for a consul was called a <q direct="unspecified">judge.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This interpretation is refuted by the fact that in those times it was the custom for a judge to be called not <q direct="unspecified">consul</q> but <q direct="unspecified">praetor.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>These were the laws enacted by the consuls. They ordered that the decrees of the senate, which used formerly to be suppressed and tampered with at the pleasure of the consuls should henceforth be taken to the aediles at the temple of <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Marcus Duillius, the tribune, then proposed a resolution which the plebs adopted, that any one who should leave the plebs without tribunes, or who should create a magistrate from whom there was no appeal; should be scourged and beheaded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All these transactions were distasteful to the patricians, but they did not actively oppose them, as none of them had yet been marked out for vindictive proceedings.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The power of the tribunes and the liberties of the plebs were now on a secure basis. The next step was taken by the tribunes, who thought the time had come when they might safely proceed against individuals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They selected Verginius to take up the first prosecution, which was that of Appius. When the day had been fixed, and Appius had come down to the Forum with a bodyguard of young patricians, the sight of him and his satellites reminded all present of the power he had used so vilely.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Verginius began: <q direct="unspecified">Oratory was invented for doubtful cases. I will not, therefore, waste time by a long indictment before you of the man from whose cruelty you have vindicated yourselves by force of arms, nor will I allow him to add to his other crimes an impudent defence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So I will pass over, Appius Claudius, all the wicked and impious things that you had the audacity to do, one after another, for the last two years. One charge only will I bring against you, that contrary to law you have adjudged a free person to be a slave, and unless you name an umpire before whom you can prove your innocence,<note anchored="yes" n="23" resp="ed">In questions ofsimple fact, each side was at liberty to propose an umpire to sift the evidence on both sides. If they failed to agree the praetor appointed a single umpire. Appius was offered the chance of formally proving his innocence</note> I shall order you to be taken to prison.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Appius had nothing to hope for in the protection of the tribunes or the verdict of the people. Nevertheless he called upon the tribunes, and when none intervened to stay proceedings and he was seized by the apparitor, he said, <q direct="unspecified">I appeal.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This single word, the protection of liberty, uttered by those lips which had so lately judicially deprived a person of her freedom, produced a general silence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then the people remarked to one another that there were gods after all who did not neglect the affairs of men; arrogance and cruelty were visited by punishments which, though lingering, were not light;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that man was appealing who had taken away the power of appeal; that man was imploring the protection of the people who had trampled underfoot all their rights; he was losing his own liberty and being carried off to prison who had sentenced a free person to slavery. Amidst the murmur of the Assembly the voice of Appius himself was heard imploring <q direct="unspecified">the protection of the Roman people.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>He began by enumerating the services of his ancestors to the State, both at home and in the field; his own unfortunate devotion to the plebs, which had led him to resign his consulship in order to enact equal laws for all, giving thereby the greatest offence to the patricians; his laws which were still in force, though their author was being carried to prison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As to his own personal conduct and his good and evil deeds, however, he would bring them to the test when he had the opportunity of pleading his cause. For the present he claimed the common right of a Roman citizen to be allowed to plead on the appointed day and submit himself to the judgment of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He was not so apprehensive of the general feeling against him as to abandon all hope in the impartiality and sympathy of his fellow-citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If he was to be taken to prison before his case was heard, he would once more appeal to the tribunes, and warn them not to copy the example of those whom they hated. If they admitted that they were bound by the same agreement to abolish the right of appeal which they accused the decemvirs of having formed, then he would appeal to the people and invoke the laws which both consuls and tribunes had enacted that very year to protect that right.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For if before the case is heard and judgment given there is no power of appeal, who would appeal? What plebeian, even the humblest, would find protection in the laws, if Appius Claudius could not? His case would show whether it was tyranny or freedom that was conferred by the new laws, and whether the right of challenge and appeal against the injustice of magistrates was only displayed in empty words or was actually granted.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Verginius replied. Appius Claudius, he said, alone was outside the laws, outside all the bonds that held states or even human society together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Let men cast their eyes on that tribunal, the fortress of all villainies, where that perpetual decemvir, surrounded by hangmen not lictors, in contempt of gods and men alike, wreaked his vengeance on the goods, the backs, and the lives of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> citizens, threatening all indiscriminately with the rods and axes, and then when his mind was diverted from rapine and murder to lust, tore a free-born maiden from her father's arms, before the eyes of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and gave her to a client, the minister of his intrigues &mdash;that
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> tribunal where by cruel decree and infamous judgment he armed the father's hand against the daughter, where he ordered those who took up the maiden's lifeless body &mdash; her betrothed lover and her grandfather &mdash;to be thrown into prison, moved less by her death than by the check to his criminal gratification. For him as much as for others was that prison built which he used to call <q direct="unspecified">the domicile of the Roman plebs.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Let him appeal again and again, he (the speaker) would always refer him to an umpire on the charge of having sentenced a free person to slavery. If he would not go before an umpire he should order him to be imprisoned as though found guilty.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He was accordingly thrown into prison, and though no one actually opposed this step, there was a general feeling of anxiety, since even the plebeians themselves thought it an excessive use of their liberty to inflict punishment on so great a man. The tribune adjourned the day of trial.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>During these proceedings ambassadors came from the Latins and Hernicans to offer their congratulations on the restoration of harmony between the patriciate and the plebs. As a memorial of it, they brought an offering to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, in the shape of a golden crown. It was not a large one, as they were not wealthy States; their religious observances were characterised by devotion rather than magnificence. They also brought information that the Aequi and.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Volscians were devoting all their energies to preparing for war. The consuls were thereupon ordered to arrange their respective commands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Sabines fell to Horatius, the Aequi to Valerius They proclaimed a levy for these wars, and so favourable was the attitude of the plebs that not only did the men liable for service promptly give in their names, but a large part of the levy consisted of men who had served their time and came forward as volunteers. In this way the army was strengthened not only in numbers but in the quality of the soldiers, as veterans took their places in the ranks.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Before they left the City, the laws of the decemvirs, known as the <q direct="unspecified">Twelve Tables,</q> were engraved in brass and publicly exhibited; some writers assert that the aediles discharged this task under orders from the tribunes.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Suicide of Appius and Sp.

Though advanced in years, he now returned to the City, to deprecate the dangers threatening the man whose vicious practices had driven him into retirement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Going down to the Forum in mourning garb, accompanied by the members of his house and by his clients, he appealed to the citizens individually, and implored them not to stain the house of the Claudii with such an indelible disgrace as to deem them worthy of bonds and imprisonment.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> many. So far he himself would go for the honour of his family and his name, but he was not reconciled to the man whose distressed condition he was anxious to
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> relieve. By courage their liberties had been recovered, by clemency the harmony of the orders in the State could be strengthened.</p> <p>Some were moved, but it was more by the affection he showed for his nephew than by any regard for the man for whom he was pleading. But Verginius begged them with tears to keep their compassion for him and his daughter, and not to listen to the prayers of the Claudii, who had assumed sovereign power over the plebs, but to the three tribunes, kinsmen of Verginia, who, after being elected to protect the plebeians, were now seeking their
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> protection. This appeal was felt to have more justice in
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> it. All hope being now cut off, Appius put an end to his life before the day of trial came.</p> <p>Soon after Sp. Oppius was arraigned by P. Numitorius. He was only less detested than Appius, because he had been in the City when his colleague pronounced the iniquitous
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> judgment. More indignation, however, was aroused by an atrocity which Oppius had committed than by his not having prevented one. A witness was produced, who after reckoning up twenty-seven years of service, and eight occasions on which he had been decorated for conspicuous bravery, appeared before the people wearing all his decorations. Tearing open his dress he exhibited his back lacerated with stripes. He asked for nothing but a proof on Oppius' part of any single charge against him; if such proof were forthcoming, Oppius, though now only a private citizen, might repeat all his cruelty towards
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> him. Oppius was taken to prison and there, before the day of trial, he put an end to his life. His property and that of Claudius were confiscated by the tribunes. Their colleagues changed their domicile by going into exile; their property also was
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> confiscated. M. Claudius, who had been the claimant of Verginia, was tried and condemned. Verginius himself, however, refused to press for the extreme penalty, so he was allowed to go into exile to
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>. Verginia was more fortunate after her death than in her lifetime; her shade, after wandering through so many houses in quest of expiatory penalties, at length found rest, not one guilty person being now left.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Great alarm seized the patricians; the looks of the tribunes were now as menacing as those of the decemvirs had been. M. Duillius the tribune imposed a salutary check upon their excessive exercise of authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <q direct="unspecified">They have gone,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">far enough in the assertion of our liberty and the punishment of our opponents, so for this year I will allow no man to be brought to trial or cast into prisons.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I disapprove of old crimes, long forgotten, being raked up, now that the recent crimes have been atoned for by the punishment of the decemvirs. The unceasing care which both the consuls are taking to protect your liberties is a guarantee that nothing will be done which will call for the power of the tribunes.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This spirit of moderation shown by the tribune relieved the fears of the patricians, but it also intensified their resentment against the consuls, for they seemed to be so wholly devoted to the plebs, that the safety and liberty of the patricians were a matter of more immediate concern to the plebeian than they were to the patrician magistrates. It seemed as though their adversaries would grow weary of inflicting punishment on them sooner than the consuls would curb their insolence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was pretty generally asserted that they had shown weakness, since their laws had been sanctioned by the senate, and no doubt was entertained that they had yielded to the pressure of circumstances.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Sabines, Aequi, and Volscians.</note>After matters had been settled in the City and the position of the plebs firmly assured, the consuls left for their respective provinces. Valerius wisely suspended operations against the combined forces of the Aequi and Volscians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If he had at once hazarded an engagement, I question whether, considering the temper of both <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and the enemy after the inauspicious leadership of the decemvirs, he would not have incurred a serious defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Taking up a position about a mile from the enemy, he kept his men in camp. The enemy formed up for battle, and filled the space between the camps, but their challenge met with no response from the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Tired at last of standing and vainly waiting for battle, and regarding victory as practically conceded to them, the two nations marched away to ravage the territories of the Hernici and Latins. The force left behind was sufficient to guard the camp, but not to sustain an action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On seeing this the consul made them in their turn feel the terror which they had inspired, drew up his men in order of battle and challenged them to fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As, conscious of their reduced strength, they declined an engagement, the courage of the Romans at once rose, and they looked upon the men who kept timidly within their lines as already defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After standing the whole day eager to engage, they retired at nightfall; the enemy in a very different state of mind sent men hurriedly in all directions to recall the plundering parties; those in the neighbourhood hastened back to camp, the more distant ones were not traced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As soon as it grew light, the Romans marched out, prepared to storm their camp if they did not give them the chance of a battle. When the day was far advanced without any movement on the part of the enemy, the consul gave the order to advance. As the line moved forward, the Aequi and Volscians, indignant at the prospect of their victorious armies being protected by earthworks rather than by courage and arms, clamoured for the signal for battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was given, and part of their force had already emerged from the gate of the camp, whilst others were coming down in order and taking up their allotted positions, but before the enemy could mass his whole strength in the field the Roman consul delivered his attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They had not all marched out of the camp, those who had done so were not able to deploy into line, and crowded together as they were, they began to waver and sway. Whilst they looked round helplessly at each other, undecided what to do, the Romans raised their war-cry, and at first the enemy
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> gave ground, then, when they had recovered their presence of mind and their generals were appealing to them not to give way before those whom they had defeated, the battle was restored.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the other side the consul bade the Romans remember that on that day for the first time they were fighting as free men on behalf of a free <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. It was for themselves that they would conquer, the fruits of their victory would not go to decemvirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The battle was not being fought under an Appius, but under their consul Valerius, a descendant of the liberators of the Roman people, and a liberator himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They must show that it was owing to the generals, not to the soldiers, that they had failed to conquer in former battles; it would be a disgrace if they showed more courage against their own citizens than against a foreign foe, or dreaded slavery at home more than abroad.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was only Verginia whose chastity was imperilled, only Appius whose licentiousness was dangerous, in a time of peace, but if the fortune of war should turn against them, every one's children would be in danger from all those thousands of enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He would not forebode disasters which neither <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> nor Mars their Father would permit to a City founded under those happy auspices. He reminded them of the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> and the Sacred Hill, and besought them to carry back unimpaired dominion to that spot where a few months before they had won their liberties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They must make it clear that Roman soldiers possessed the same qualities now that the decemvirs were expelled which they had before they were created, and that Roman courage was not weakened by the fact that the laws were equal for all.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After this address to the infantry, he galloped up to the cavalry. <q direct="unspecified">Come, young men,</q> he shouted, <q direct="unspecified">prove yourselves superior to the infantry in courage, as you are superior to them in honour and rank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They dislodged the enemy at the first onset, do you ride in amongst them and drive them from the field. They will not stand your charge, even now they are hesitating rather than resisting.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> With slackened rein, they spurred their horses against the enemy already shaken by the infantry encounter, and sweeping through their broken ranks were carried to the rear. Some, wheeling round in the open ground, rode across and headed off the fugitives who were everywhere making for the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The line of infantry with the consul in person and the whole of the battle rolled in the same direction; they got possession of the camp with an immense loss to the enemy, but the booty was still greater than the carnage.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The news of this battle was carried not only to the City, but to the other army amongst the Sabines. In the City it was celebrated with public rejoicings, but in the other camp it fired the soldiers to emulation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> By employing them in incursions and testing their courage in skirmishes, Horatius had trained them to put confidence in themselves instead of brooding over the disgrace incurred under the leadership of the decemvirs, and this had gone far to make them hope for ultimate success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Sabines, emboldened by their success of the previous year were incessantly provoking them and urging them to fight, and wanting to know why they were wasting their time in petty incursions and retreats like bandits, and frittering away the effort of one decisive action in a number of insignificant engagements.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Why, they tauntingly asked, did they not meet them in a pitched battle and trust once for all to the fortune of war?</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="62"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Romans had not only recovered their courage, but they were burning with indignation. The other army, they said, was about to return to the City in triumph, whilst they were exposed to the taunts of an insolent foe. When would they ever be a match for the enemy if they were not now?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul became aware of these murmurings of discontent, and after summoning the soldiers to an assembly, addressed them as follows: <q direct="unspecified">How the battle was fought on Algidus, soldiers, I suppose you have heard. The army behaved as the army of a free people ought to behave. The victory was won by the generalship of my colleague and the bravery of his soldiers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As far as I am concerned, I am ready to adopt that plan of operations which you, my soldiers, have the courage to execute. The war may either be prolonged with advantage, or brought to an early close.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If it is to be protracted I shall continue the method of training which I have begun, so that your spirits and courage may rise day by day. If you want it brought to a decisive issue, come now, raise such a shout as you will raise in battle as a proof of your willingness and courage.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After they had raised the shout with great alacrity, he assured them that, with the blessing of heaven, he would comply with their wishes and lead them out to battle on the morrow. The rest of the day was spent in getting their armour and weapons ready.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>No sooner did the Sabines see the Romans forming in order of battle the next morning than they also advanced to an engagement which they had long been eager for. The battle was such as would be expected between armies both of which were full of self-confidence &mdash;the one proud of its old and unbroken renown, the other flushed with its recent victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Sabines called strategy to their aid, for, after giving their line an extent equal to that of the enemy, they kept 2000 men in reserve to make an impression on the Roman left when the battle was at its height.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> By this flank attack they had almost surrounded and were beginning to overpower that wing, when the cavalry of the two legions &mdash;about 600 strong- -sprang from their horses and rushed to the front to support their comrades, who were now giving way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They checked the enemy's advance and at the same time roused the courage of the infantry by sharing their danger, and appealing to their sense of shame, by showing that whilst the cavalry could fight either mounted or on foot, the infantry, trained to fight on foot, were inferior even to dismounted cavalry.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="63"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So they resumed the struggle which they were giving up and recovered the ground they had lost, and in a moment not only was the battle restored but the Sabines on that wing were even forced back.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The cavalry returned to their horses, protected by the infantry through whose ranks they passed, and galloped off to the other wing to announce their success to their comrades. At the same time they made a charge on the enemy, who were now demoralised through the defeat of their strongest wing. None showed more brilliant courage in that battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consul's eyes were everywhere, he commended the brave, had words of rebuke wherever the battle seemed to slacken. Those whom he censured displayed at once the energy of brave men, they were stimulated by a sense of shame, as much as the others by his commendation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The battle-cry was again raised, and by one united effort on the part of the whole army they repulsed the enemy; the Roman attack could no longer be withstood. The Sabines were scattered in all directions through the fields, and left their camp as a spoil to the enemy. What the Romans found there was not the property of their allies, as had been the case on Algidus, but their own, which had been lost in the ravaging of their homesteads.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For this double victory, won in two separate battles, the senate decreed thanksgivings on behalf of the consuls, but their jealousy restricted them to one day. The people, however, without receiving orders, went on the second day also in vast crowds to the temples, and this unauthorised and spontaneous thanksgiving was celebrated with almost greater enthusiasm than the former.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The consuls had mutually agreed to approach the City during these two days and convene a meeting of the senate in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst they were making their report there on the conduct of the campaigns, the leaders of the senate entered a protest against their session being held in the midst of the troops, in order to intimidate them. To avoid any ground for this charge the consuls immediately adjourned the senate to the Flaminian Meadows, where the temple of Apollo &mdash;then called the <foreign lang="la">Apollinare</foreign> &mdash;now stands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate by a large majority refused the consuls the honour of a triumph, whereupon L. Icilius, as tribune of the plebs, brought the question before the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Many came forward to oppose it, particularly C. Claudius, who exclaimed in excited tones that it was over the senate, not over the enemy, that the consuls wished to celebrate their triumph. It was demanded as an act of gratitude for a private service rendered to a tribune, not as an honour for merit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Never before had a triumph been ordered by the people, it had always lain with the senate to decide whether one was deserved or not; not even kings had infringed the prerogative of the highest order in the State. The tribunes must not make their power pervade everything, so as to render the existence of a council of State impossible. The State will only be free, the laws equal, on condition that each order preserves its own rights, its own power and dignity.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Much to the same effect was said by the senior members of the senate, but the tribes unanimously adopted the proposal. That was the first instance of a triumph being celebrated by order of the people without the authorisation of the senate.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="64"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This victory of the tribunes and the plebs very nearly led to a dangerous abuse of power. A secret understanding was come to amongst the tribunes that they should all be reappointed and to prevent their factious purpose from being too noticeable they were to secure a continuance of the consuls in office also.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They alleged as a reason the agreement of the senate to undermine the rights of the plebs by the slight they had cast on the consuls:
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">What,</q> they argued, <q direct="unspecified">would happen if, before the laws were yet securely established, the patricians should attack fresh tribunes through consuls belonging to their own party?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For the consuls would not always be men of the stamp of Valerius and Horatius, who subordinated their own interests to the liberty of the plebs.</q></p> <p>By a happy chance it fell to the lot of M. Duillius to preside over the elections.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was a man of sagacity, and foresaw the obloquy that would be incurred by the continuance in office of the present magistrates. On his declaring that he would accept no votes for the former tribunes his colleagues insisted that he should either leave the tribes free to vote for whom they chose, or else resign the control of the elections to his colleagues who would conduct them according to law rather than at the will of the patricians.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As a contention had arisen, Duillius sent for the consuls and asked them what they intended to do about the consular elections. They replied that they should elect fresh consuls. Having thus gained popular supporters for a measure by no means popular, he proceeded in company with them into the Assembly.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Here the consuls were brought forward to the people and the question was put to them, <q direct="unspecified">If the Roman people, remembering how you have recovered their liberty for them at home, remembering, too, your services and achievements in war, should make you consuls a second time, what do you intend to do?</q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They declared their resolution unchanged, and Duillius, applauding the consuls for maintaining to the last an attitude totally unlike that of the decemvirs, proceeded to hold the election. Only five tribunes were elected, for owing to the efforts of the nine tribunes in openly pushing their canvass, the other candidates could not get the requisite majority of votes.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He dismissed the Assembly and did not hold a second election, on the ground that he had satisfied the requirements of the law, which nowhere fixed the number of tribunes, but merely enacted that the office of tribune should not be left vacant.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He ordered those who had been elected to co-opt colleagues, and recited the formula which governed the case as follows: <q direct="unspecified">If I require you to elect ten tribunes of the plebs; if on this day you have elected less than ten, then those whom they co-opt shall be lawful tribunes of the plebs by the same law, in like manner as those whom you have this day made tribunes of the plebs.</q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Duillius persisted in asserting to the last that the commonwealth could not possibly have fifteen tribunes, and he resigned office, after having won the goodwill of patricians and plebeians alike by his frustration of the ambitious designs of his colleagues.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="65"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><emph>Fresh Internal Dissensions.</emph>The new tribunes of the plebs studied the wishes of the senate in coopting colleagues; they even admitted two patricians of consular rank, Sp. Tarpeius and A. Aeternius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The new consuls were Spurius Herminius and T. Verginius Caelimontanus, who were not violent partisans of either the patricians or the plebeians. They maintained peace both at home and abroad.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> L. Trebonius, a tribune of the plebs, was angry with the senate because, as he said, he had been hoodwinked by them in the cooptation of tribunes, and left in the lurch by his colleagues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He brought in a measure providing that when tribunes of the plebs were to be elected, the presiding magistrate should continue to hold the election until ten tribunes were elected. He spent his year of office in worrying the patricians, which led to his receiving the nickname of <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">Asper</foreign>,</q> (i.e. <q direct="unspecified">the Cantankerous</q>).</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The next consuls were M. Geganius Macerinus and C. Julius. They appeased the quarrels which had broken out between the tribunes and the younger members of the nobility without interfering with the powers of the former or compromising the dignity of the patricians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A levy had been decreed by the senate for service against the Volscians and Aequi, but they kept the plebs quiet by holding it over, and publicly asserting that when the City was at peace everything abroad was quiet, whereas civil discord encouraged the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Their care for peace led to harmony at home. But the one order was always restless when the other showed moderation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whilst the plebs was quiet it began to be subjected to acts of violence from the younger patricians. The tribunes tried to protect the weaker side, but they did little good at first, and soon even they them- selves were not exempt from ill-treatment, especially in later months of their year of office. Secret combinations amongst the stronger party resulted in lawlessness, and the exercise of the tribunitian authority usually slackened towards the close of the year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Any hopes the plebeians might place in their tribunes depended upon their having men like Icilius; the last two years they had had mere names.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On the other hand, the older patricians realised that their younger members were too aggressive, but if there were to be excesses they preferred that their own side should commit them rather than their opponents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> So difficult is it to observe moderation in the defence of liberty, while each man under the pretence of equality raises himself only by keeping others down, and by their very precautions against fear men make themselves feared, and in repelling injury from ourselves we inflict it on others as though there were no alternative between doing wrong and suffering it.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="66"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>T.<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Volscians.</note> Quinctius Capitolinus and Agrippa Curius were the next consuls elected &mdash;the former for the fourth time. They found on entering office no disturbances at home nor any war abroad, though both were threatening.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The dissensions of the citizens could now no longer be checked, as both the tribunes and the plebs were exasperated against the patricians, owing to the Assembly being constantly disturbed by fresh quarrels whenever one of the nobility was prosecuted.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At the first bruit of these outbreaks, the Aequi and Volscians, as though at a given signal, took up arms. Moreover their leaders, eager for plunder, had persuaded them that it had been impossible to raise the levy ordered two years previously, because the plebs refused to obey, and it was owing to this that no armies had been sent against them;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> military discipline was broken up by insubordination; <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was no longer looked upon as the common fatherland; all their rage against foreign foes was turned against one another. Now was the opportunity for destroying these wolves blinded by the madness of mutual hatred.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>With their united forces they first completely desolated the Latin territory; then, meeting with none to check their depredations, they actually approached the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to the great delight of those who had fomented the war. Extending their ravages in the direction of the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> gate, they plundered and harried, through sheer insolence, in the sight of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After they had marched back unmolested with their plunder to Corbio, the consul Quinctius convoked the people to an Assembly.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="67"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I find that he spoke there as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Though, Quirites, my own conscience is clear, it is, nevertheless, with feelings of the deepest shame that I have come before you. That you should know &mdash;that it will be handed down to posterity &mdash;that the Aequi and Volscians, who were lately hardly a match for the Hernici, have in the fourth consulship of T. Quinctius come in arms up to the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with impunity!
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although we have long been living in such a state, although public affairs are in such a condition, that my mind augurs nothing good, still, had I known that this disgrace was coming in this year, of all others, I would have avoided by exile or by death, had there been no other means of escape, the honour of a consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So then, if those arms which were at our gates had been in the hands of men worthy of the name, <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> could have been taken whilst I was consul! I had enough of honours, enough and more than enough of life, I ought to have died in my third consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Who was it that those most dastardly foes felt contempt for, us consuls, or you Quirites? If the fault is in us, strip us of an office which we are unworthy to hold, and if that is not enough, visit us with punishment. If the fault is in you, may there be no one, either god or man, who will punish your sins; may you repent of them!
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was not your cowardice that provoked their contempt, nor their valour that gave them confidence; they have been too often defeated, put to flight, driven out of their entrenchments, deprived of their territory, not to know themselves and you. It is the dissensions between the two orders, the quarrels between patricians and plebeians that is poisoning the life of this City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As long as our power respects no limits, and your liberty acknowledges no restraints, as long as you are impatient of patrician, we of plebeian magistrates, so long has the courage of our enemies been rising. What in heaven's name do you want? You set your hearts on having tribunes of the plebs, we yielded, for the sake of peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> You yearned for decemvirs, we consented to their appointment; you grew utterly weary of them, we compelled them to resign. Your hatred pursued them into private life; to satisfy you, we allowed the noblest and most distinguished of our order to suffer death or go into exile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> You wanted tribunes of the plebs to be appointed again; you have appointed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Although we saw how unjust it was to the patricians that men devoted to your interests should be elected consuls, we have seen even that patrician office conferred by favour of the plebs The tribunes' protective authority, the right of appeal to the people, the resolutions of the plebs made binding on the patricians, the suppression of our rights and privileges under the pretext of making the laws equal for all &mdash;these things we have submitted to, and do submit to.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> What term is there to be to our dissensions? When shall we ever be allowed to have a united City, when will this ever be our common fatherland?
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> We who have lost, show more calmness and evenness of temper than you who have won. Is it not enough that you have made us fear you? It was against us that the <placeName key="tgn,4012809">Aventine</placeName> was seized, against us the Sacred Hill occupied. When the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> is all but captured and the Volscian is trying to scale the rampart, no one dislodges <emph>him</emph>. Against <emph>us</emph> you show yourselves men; against us you take <emph>up</emph> arms.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="68"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, then, now that you have beleaguered the Senate-house, and treated the Forum as enemies' ground, and filled the prison with our
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> foremost men, display the same daring courage in making a sortie from the <placeName key="tgn,4012794">Esquiline</placeName> gate, or if you have not the courage even for this, mount the walls and watch your fields disgracefully laid waste with fire and sword, plunder carried off and smoke rising everywhere from your burning dwellings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But I may be told it is the common interests of all that are being injured by this; the land is burned, the City besieged, all the honours of war rest with the enemy. Good heavens! In what condition are your own private interests? Every one of you will have losses reported to him from the fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> What, pray, is there at home from which to make them good? Will the tribunes restore and repay you for what you have lost? They will contribute any amount you like of talk and words and accusations against the leading men, and law after law, and meetings of the Assembly. But from those meetings not a single one of you will ever go home the richer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Who has ever brought back to his wife and children anything but resentment and hatred, party strife and personal quarrels, from which you are to be protected not by your own courage and honesty of purpose, but by the help of others?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But, let me tell you, when you were campaigning under us your consuls, not under tribunes, in the camp not in the Forum, and your battle-cry appalled the enemy in the field, not the patricians of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in the Assembly then you obtained booty, took territory from the enemy, and returned to your homes and household gods in triumph, laden with wealth and covered with glory both for the State and for yourselves. Now you allow the enemy to depart laden with your property.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Go on, stick to your Assembly meetings, pass your lives in the Forum, still the necessity, which you shirk, of taking the field follows you. It was too much for you to go out against the Aequi and Volscians; now the war is at your gates. If it is not beaten back, it will be within the walls, it will scale the Citadel and the Capitol and follow you into your homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is two years since the senate ordered a levy to be raised and an army led out to Algidus; we are still sitting idly at home, wrangling with one another like a troop of women, delighted with the momentary peace, and shutting our eyes to the fact that we shall very soon have to pay for our inaction many times over in war.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><q direct="unspecified">I know that there are other things pleasanter to speak about than these, but necessity compels me, even if a sense of duty did not, to say what is true instead of what is agreeable. I should only be too glad, Quirites, to give you pleasure, but I would very much rather have you safe, however you may feel towards me for the future.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nature has so ordered matters that the man who addresses the multitude for his own private ends is much more popular than the man who thinks of nothing but the public good. Possibly, you imagine that it is in your interest that those demagogues who flatter the plebs and do not suffer you either to take up arms or live in peace, excite you and make you restless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They only do so to win notoriety or to make something out of it, and because they see that when the two orders are in harmony they are nowhere, they are willing to be leaders in a bad cause rather than in none, and get up disturbances and seditions.</q></p>

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="69"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Seldom if ever was speech of popular tribune more favourably received by the plebeians than that of this stern consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The men of military age who in similar emergencies had made refusal to be enrolled their most effective weapon against the senate, began now to turn their thoughts to arms and war. The fugitives from the country districts, those who had been plundered and wounded in the fields, reported a more terrible state of things than what was visible from the walls, and filled the whole City with a thirst for vengeance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the senate met, all eyes turned to Quinctius as the one man who could uphold the majesty of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The leaders of the House declared his speech to be worthy of the position he held as consul, worthy of the many consulships he had previously held, worthy of his whole life, rich as it was in honours, many actually enjoyed, many more deserved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Other consuls, they said, had either flattered the plebs by betraying the authority and privileges of the patricians, or, by insisting too harshly upon the rights of their order, had intensified the opposition of the masses. Titus Quinctius, in his speech, had kept in view the authority of the senate, the concord of the two orders, and, above all, the circumstances of the hour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They begged him and his colleague to take over the conduct of public affairs, and appealed to the tribunes to be of one mind with the consuls in wishing to see the war rolled back from the walls of the City, and inducing the plebs, at such a crisis, to yield to the authority of the senate. Their common fatherland was, they declared, calling on the tribunes and imploring their aid now that their fields were ravaged and the City all but attacked.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>By universal consent a levy was decreed and held. The consuls gave public notice that there was no time for investigating claims for exemption, and all the men liable for service were to present themselves the next day in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the war was over they would give time for inquiry into the cases of those who had not given in their names, and those who could not prove justification would be held to be deserters.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> All who were liable to serve appeared on the following day.</p> <p>Each of the cohorts selected their own centurions, and two senators were placed in command of each cohort. We understand that these arrangements were so promptly carried out that the standards, which had been taken from the treasury and carried down to the Campus Martius by the quaestors in the morning, left the Campus at 10 o'clock that same day, and the army, a newly-raised one with only a few cohorts of veterans following as volunteers, halted at the tenth milestone.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The next day brought them within sight of the enemy, and they entrenched their camp close to the enemy's camp at Corbio.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Romans were fired by anger and resentment; the enemy, conscious of their guilt after so many revolts, despaired of pardon. There was consequently no delay in bringing matters to an issue.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="70"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the Roman army the two consuls possessed equal authority. Agrippa, however, voluntarily resigned the supreme command to his colleague &mdash;a very beneficial arrangement where matters of great importance are concerned &mdash;and the latter, thus preferred by the ungrudging self-suppression of his colleague, courteously responded by imparting to him his plans, and treating him in every way as his equal.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When drawn up in battle order, Quinctius commanded the right wing, Agrippa the left. The centre was assigned to Sp. Postumius Albus, lieutenant-general; the other lieutenant-general, P. Sulpicius, was given charge of the cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The infantry on the right wing fought splendidly, but met with stout resistance on the side of the Volscians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> P. Sulpicius with his cavalry broke the enemy's centre. He could have got back to the main body before the enemy reformed their broken ranks, but he decided to attack from the rear, and would have scattered the enemy in a moment, attacked as they were in front and rear, had not the cavalry of the Volscians and Aequi, adopting his own tactics, intercepted him and kept him for some time engaged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He shouted to his men that there was no time to lose, they would be surrounded and cut off from their main body if they did not do their utmost to make a finish of the cavalry fight;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> it was not enough simply to put them to flight, they must dispose of both horses and men, that none might return to the field or renew the fighting. They could not resist those before whom a serried line of infantry had given way.</p> <p>His words did not fall on deaf ears.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In one shock they routed the whole of the cavalry, hurled a vast number from their seats, and drove their lances into the horses.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> That was the end of the cavalry fight. Next they made a rear attack on the infantry, and when their line began to waver they sent a report to the consuls of what they had done. The news gave fresh courage to the Romans, who were now winning, and dismayed the retreating Aequi.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Their defeat began in the centre, where the cavalry charge had thrown them into disorder. Then the repulse of the left wing by the consul Quinctius commenced.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The right wing gave more trouble. Here Agrippa, whose age and strength made him fearless, seeing that things were going better in all parts of the field than with him, seized standards from the standard-bearers and advanced with them himself, some he even began to throw amongst the masses of the enemy. Roused at the fear and disgrace of losing them, his men made a fresh charge on the enemy, and in all directions the Romans were equally successful.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>At this point a message came from Quinctius that he was victorious, and was now threatening the enemy's camp, but would not attack it till he knew that the action on the left wing was decided.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If Agrippa had defeated the enemy he was to join him, so that the whole army might together take possession of the spoil. The victorious Agrippa, amidst mutual congratulations, proceeded to his colleague and the enemy's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The few defenders were routed in a moment and the entrenchment forced without any resistance. The army was marched back to camp after securing immense spoil and recovering their own property which had been lost in the ravaging of their lands.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>I cannot find that a triumph was either demanded by the consuls or granted by the senate; nor is any reason recorded for this honour having been either not expected or not thought worth asking for.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> As far as I can conjecture after such an interval of time, the reason would appear to be that as a triumph was refused by the senate to the consuls Valerius and Horatius, who, apart from the Volscians and Aequi, had won the distinction of bringing the Sabine war to a close, the present consuls were ashamed to ask for a triumph for doing only half as much, lest, if they did obtain it, it might appear to be out of consideration for the men more than for their services.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> standing, when the war was going on against Corioli. He therefore alleged as a fact, forgotten through lapse of time, but deeply imprinted in his own memory, that the disputed land formed part of the territory of Corioli, and when that city was taken, became by the right of war part of the State domain of Rome. The Ardeates and Aricians had never claimed it while Corioli was unconquered, and he was wondering how they could hope to filch it from the people of Rome,
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> whom they had made arbiters instead of rightful owners. He had not long to live, but he could not, old as he was, bring himself to refrain from using the only means in his power, namely, his voice, in order to assert the right to that territory which as a soldier he had done his best to win. He earnestly advised the people not to pronounce, from a false feeling of delicacy, against a cause which was really their own.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="72"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the consuls saw that Scaptius was listened to not only in silence but even with approval, they called gods and men to witness that a monstrous injustice was being perpetrated, and sent for the leaders of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accompanied by them they went amongst the tribes and implored them not to commit the worst of crimes and establish a still worse precedent by perverting justice to their own advantage. Even supposing it were permissible for a judge to look after his own interest, they would certainly never gain by appropriating the disputed territory as much as they would lose by estranging the feelings of their allies through their injustice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The damage done to their good name and credit would be incalculable. Were the envoys to carry back this to their home, was it to go out to the world, was it to reach the ears of their allies and of their enemies? With what pain the former would receive it, with what joy the latter!
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Did they suppose that the surrounding nations would fix the responsibility for it on Scaptius, a mob-orator in his dotage? To him it might be a patent of nobility, but on the Roman people it would stamp a character for trickery and fraud.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For what judge has ever dealt with a private suit so as to adjudge to himself the property in dispute? Even Scaptius would not do that, although he has outlived all sense of shame.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In spite of these earnest appeals which the consuls and senators made, cupidity and Scaptius its instigator prevailed. The tribes, when called upon to vote, decided that it was part of the public domain of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is not denied that the result would have been the same had the case gone before other judges, but as it is, the disgrace attaching to the judgment is not in the least degree lightened by any justice in the case, nor did it appear more ugly and tyrannical to the people of Aricia and Ardea than it did to the Roman senate.</p> <p>The rest of the year remained undisturbed both at home and abroad.</p></div1>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Law respecting the Intermarriage of Patricians and Plebeians.</note> consuls who succeeded were M. Genucius and C. Curtius. The year was a troubled one both at home and abroad. In the beginning of the year C. Canuleius, a tribune of the plebs, introduced a law with regard to the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The patricians considered that their blood would be contaminated by it and the special rights of the houses thrown into confusion.<note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed"><emph>rights of houses.</emph> The <foreign lang="la">curies</foreign> each possessed their own religious ceremonies (see note 7, Book III.), and as an order they alone possessed the auspices, the qualifications for priesthood, and juristic knowledge; whilst each house had its own sacrifices.</note></p><p>Then the tribunes began to throw out hints about one consul being elected from the plebs, and matters advanced so far that nine tribunes brought in a measure empowering the people to elect consuls from the plebeians or the patricians as they chose.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The patricians believed that, if this were carried, the supreme power would not only be degraded by being shared with the lowest of the people, but would entirely pass away from the chief men in the State into the hands of the plebs.</p><p>The senate were not sorry, therefore,
							<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> to hear that Ardea had revolted as a consequence of the unjust decision about the territory, that the Veientines had ravaged the districts on the Roman frontier, and that the Volscians and Aequi were protesting against the fortifying of Verrugo;
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> so much did they prefer war, even when unsuccessful, to an ignominious peace.</p><p>On receiving these reports-which were somewhat exaggerated-the senate tried to drown the voice of the tribunes in the uproar of so many wars by ordering a levy to be made and all preparations for war pushed on with the utmost vigour, more so, if possible, than during the consulship of T. Quinctius.
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thereupon C. Canuleius addressed the senate in a short and angry speech. It was, he said, useless for the consuls to hold out threats in the hope of distracting the attention of the plebs from the proposed law; as long as he was alive they should never hold a levy until the plebs had adopted the measures brought forward by himself and his colleagues. He at once convened an Assembly.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls began to rouse the senate to take action against the tribunes, and at the same time the tribunes were getting up an agitation against the consuls. The consuls declared that the revolutionary proceedings of the tribunes could no longer be tolerated, matters had come to a crisis, there was a more bitter war going on at home than abroad.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This was not the fault of the plebs so much as of the senate, nor of the tribunes more than of the consuls. Those things in a State which attain the highest development are those which are encouraged by rewards;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it is thus that men become good citizens in times of peace, good soldiers in times of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In Rome the greatest rewards are won by seditious agitations, these have always brought honour to men both individually and in the mass. Those present should reflect upon the greatness and dignity of the senate as they had received it from their fathers, and consider what they were going to hand on to their children, in order that they might be able to feel pride in the extension and growth of its influence, as the plebs felt pride in theirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was no final settlement in sight, nor would there be as long as agitators were honoured in proportion to the success of their agitation. What enormous questions had C. Canuleius raised!
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was advocating the breaking up of the houses, tampering with the auspices, both those of the State and those of individuals, so that nothing would be pure, nothing free from contamination, and in the effacing of all distinctions of rank, no one would know either himself or his kindred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What other result would mixed marriages have except to make unions between patricians and plebeians almost like the promiscuous association of animals? The offspring of such marriages would not know whose blood flowed in his veins, what sacred rites he might perform; half of him patrician, half plebeian, he would not even be in harmony with himself. And as though it were a small matter for all things human and divine to be thrown into confusion, the disturbers of the people were now making an onslaught on the consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At first the question of one consul being elected from the plebs was only mooted in private conversations, now a measure was brought forward giving the people power to elect consuls from either patricians or plebeians as they chose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> And there was no shadow of doubt that they would elect all the most dangerous revolutionaries in the plebs; the Canuleii and the Icilii would be consuls. Might Jupiter Optimus Maximus never allow a power truly royal in its majesty to sink so low! They would rather die a thousand deaths than suffer such an ignominy to be perpetrated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Could their ancestors have divined that all their concessions only served to make the plebs more exacting, not more friendly, since their first success only emboldened them to make more and more urgent demands, it was quite certain that they would have gone any lengths in resistance sooner than allow these laws to be forced upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Because a concession was once made in the matter of tribunes, it had been made again; there was no end to it. Tribunes of the plebs and the senate could not exist in the same State, either that office or this order (i.e. the nobility) must go. Their insolence and recklessness must be opposed, and better late than never.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Were they to be allowed with impunity to stir up our neighbours to war by sowing the seeds of discord and then prevent the State from arming in its defence against those whom they had stirred up, and after all but summoning the enemy not allow armies to be enrolled against the enemy?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Was Canuleius, forsooth, to have the audacity to give out before the senate that unless it was prepared to accept his conditions, like those of a conqueror, he would stop a levy being held? What else was that but threatening to betray his country and allowing it to be attacked and captured? What courage would his words inspire, not in the Roman plebs but in the Volscians and Aequi and Veientines!
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Would they not hope, with Canuleius as their leader, to be able to scale the Capitol and the Citadel, if the tribunes, after stripping the senate of its rights and its authority, deprived it also of its courage? The consuls were ready to be their leaders against criminal citizens before they led them against the enemy in arms.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the very time when this was going on in the senate, Canuleius delivered the following speech in defence of his laws and in opposition to the consuls:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <q direct="unspecified">I fancy, Quirites, that I have often noticed in the past how greatly the patricians despise you, how unworthy they deem you to live in the same City, within the same walls, as they.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now, however, it is perfectly obvious, seeing how bitter an opposition they have raised to our proposed laws. For what is our purpose in framing them except to remind them that we are their fellow-citizens, and though we do not possess the same power, we still inhabit the same country?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In one of these laws we demand the right of intermarriage, a right usually granted to neighbours and foreigners-indeed we have granted citizenship, which is more than intermarriage,
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> even to a conquered enemy-in the other we are bringing forward nothing new, but simply demanding back what belongs to the people and claiming that the Roman people should confer its honours on whom it will.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What possible reason is there why they should embroil heaven and earth, why recently in the Senate-house I was on the point of being subjected to personal violence, why they declare they will not keep their hands off, and threaten to attack our inviolable authority?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Will this City be no longer able to stand, is our dominion at an end, if a free vote is allowed to the Roman people so that they may entrust the consulship to whomsoever they will, and no plebeian may be shut out from the hope of attaining the highest honour if only he be worthy of the highest honour?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Does the phrase <q direct="unspecified">Let no plebeian be made consul</q> mean just the same as <q direct="unspecified">No slave or freedman shall be consul</q>? Do you ever realise in what contempt you are living? They would rob you of your share in this daylight, if they could.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They are indignant because you breathe and utter speech and wear the form of men. Why! Heaven forgive me, they actually say that it would be an act of impiety for a plebeian to be made consul! Though we are not allowed access to the <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">Fasti</foreign></q> or the records of the pontiffs, do we not, pray, know what every stranger knows, that the consuls have simply taken the place of the kings, and possess no right or privilege which was not previously vested in the kings?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> I suppose you have never heard tell that Numa Pompilius, who was not only no patrician but not even a Roman citizen, was summoned from the land of the Sabines, and after being accepted by the people and confirmed by the senate, reigned as king of Rome?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Or that, after him, L. Tarquinius, who belonged to no Roman house, not even to an Italian one, being the son of Demaratus of Corinth, who had settled in Tarquinii, was made king while the sons of Ancus were still alive?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Or that, after him again, Servius Tullius, the illegitimate son of a female slave captured at Corniculum, gained the crown by sheer merit and ability? Why need I mention the Sabine Titus Tatius, with whom Romulus himself, the Father of the City, shared his throne?
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As long as no class of person in which conspicuous merit appeared was rejected, the Roman dominion grew. Are you then to regard a plebeian consul with disgust, when our ancestors showed no aversion to strangers as their kings?
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Not even after the expulsion of the kings was the City closed to foreign merit. The Claudian house, at all events, who migrated from the Sabines, was received by us not only into citizenship, but even into the ranks of the patricians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Shall a man who was an alien become a patrician and afterwards consul, and a Roman citizen, if he belongs to the plebs, be cut off from all hope of the consulship?
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Do we believe that it is impossible for a plebeian to be brave and energetic and capable both in peace and war, or if there be such a man, are we not to allow him to touch the helm of the State;
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> are we to have, by preference, consuls like the decemvirs, those vilest of mortals-who, nevertheless, were all patricians-rather than men who resemble the best of the kings, new men though they were?</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">But, I may be told, no consul, since the expulsion of the kings, has ever been elected from the plebs. What then? Ought no innovation ever to be introduced; and because a thing has not yet been done-and in a new community there are many things which have not yet been done- ought they not to be done, even when they are advantageous?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the reign of Romulus there were no pontiffs, no college of augurs; they were created by Numa Pompilius. There was no census in the State, no register of the centuries and classes; it was made by Servius Tullius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were never any consuls; when the kings had been expelled they were created. Neither the power nor the name of Dictator was in existence; it originated with the senate. There were no tribunes of the plebs, no aediles, no quaestors; it was decided that these offices should be created. Within the last ten years we appointed decemvirs to commit the laws to writing and then we abolished their office.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Who doubts that in a City built for all time and without any limits to its growth new authorities have to be established, new priesthoods, modifications in the rights and privileges of the houses as well as of individual citizens?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Was not this very prohibition of intermarriage between patricians and plebeians, which inflicts such serious injury on the commonwealth and such a gross injustice on the plebs, made by the decemvirs within these last few years?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Can there be a greater or more signal disgrace than for a part of the community to be held unworthy of intermarriage, as though contaminated? What is this but to suffer exile and banishment within the same walls? They are guarding against our becoming connected with them by affinity or relationship, against our blood being allied with theirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Why, most of you are descended from Albans and Sabines, and that nobility of yours you hold not by birth or blood, but by co-optation into the patrician ranks, having been selected for that honour either by the kings, or after their expulsion by the mandate of the people. If your nobility is tainted by union with us, could you not have kept it pure by private regulations, by not seeking brides from the plebs, and not suffering your sisters or daughters to marry outside your order?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No plebeian will offer violence to a patrician maiden, it is the patricians who indulge in those criminal practices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> None of us would have compelled any one to enter into a marriage contract against his will. But, really, that this should be prohibited by law and the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians made impossible is indeed insulting to the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Why do you not combine to forbid intermarriage between rich and poor? Everywhere and in all ages there has been an understanding that a woman might marry into any house in which she has been betrothed, and a man might marry from any house the woman to whom he has become engaged, and this understanding you are fettering by the manacles of a most insolent law, through which you may break up civil society and rend one State into two.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Why do you not enact a law that no plebeian shall live in the neighbourhood of a patrician, or go along the same road, or take his place at the same banquet, or stand in the same Forum? For, as a matter of fact, what difference is there, if a patrician marries a plebeian woman or a plebeian marries a patrician?
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> What rights are infringed, pray? Of course, the children follow the father. There is nothing that we are seeking in intermarriage with you, except that we may be reckoned amongst men and citizens; there is nothing for you to fight about, unless you delight in trying how far you can insult and degrade us.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">In a word, does the supreme power belong to you or to the Roman people? Did the expulsion of the kings mean absolute ascendancy for you or equal liberty for all?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Is it right and proper for the Roman people to enact a law, if it wishes to do so, or are you going, whenever a measure is proposed, to order a levy by way of punishment? Am I to call the tribes up to vote, and as soon as I have begun, are you, the consuls, going to compel those who are liable for service to take the military oath, and then march them off to camp, threatening alike the plebs and the tribunes?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Why, have you not on two occasions found out what your threats are worth against a united plebs? Was it, I wonder, in our interest that you abstained from an open conflict, or was it because the stronger party was also the more moderate one that there was no fighting?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Nor will there be any conflict now, Quirites;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> they will always try your courage, they will not test your strength.</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">And so, consuls, the plebeians are ready to follow you to these wars, whether real or imaginary, on condition that by restoring the right of intermarriage you at last make this commonwealth a united one, that it be in their power to be allied with you by family ties, that the hope of attaining high office be granted to men of ability and energy, that it be open to them to be associated with you in taking their share of the government, and-which is the essence of equal liberty-to rule and obey in turn, in the annual succession of magistrates.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> If any one is going to obstruct these measures, you may talk about wars and exaggerate them by rumour, no one is going to give in his name, no one is going to take up arms, no one is going to fight for domineering masters with whom they have in public life no partnership in honours, and in private life no right of intermarriage.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the two consuls had come forward into the Assembly, set speeches gave place to a personal altercation. The tribune asked why it was not right for a plebeian to be elected consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consuls gave a reply which, though perhaps true, was an unfortunate one in view of the present controversy. They said, <q direct="unspecified">Because no plebeian could have the auspices, and the reason why the decemvirs had put an end to intermarriage was to prevent the auspices from being vitiated through the uncertainty of descent.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This bitterly exasperated the plebeians, for they believed that they were held incompetent to take the auspices because they were hateful to the immortal gods. As they had got a most energetic leader in their tribune and were supporting him with the utmost determination, the controversy ended in the defeat of the patricians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They consented to the intermarriage law being passed, mainly in the belief that the tribunes would either abandon the struggle for plebeian consuls altogether, or would at least postpone it till after the war, and that the plebeians, contented with what they had gained, would be ready to enlist.</p><p>Owing to his victory over the patricians Canuleius was now immensely popular.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fired by his example, the other tribunes fought with the utmost energy to secure the passing of their measure, and though the rumours of war became more serious every day they obstructed the enlistment.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As no business could be transacted in the senate owing to the intervention of the tribunes, the consuls held councils of the leaders at their own houses.</p><p>It was evident that they would have to yield the victory either to their foreign foes or to their own countrymen.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Valerius and Horatius were the only men of consular rank who did not attend these councils. C. Claudius was in favour of empowering the consuls to use armed force against the tribunes; the Quinctii, Cincinnatus and Capitolinus, were averse from bloodshed or injury to those whom in their treaty with the plebs they had agreed to hold inviolable.</p><p>The result of their deliberations was that they allowed tribunes of the soldiers with consular powers to be elected from the patricians and plebeians indiscriminately;
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> no change was made in the election of consuls. This arrangement satisfied the tribunes and it satisfied the plebs. Notice was published that an Assembly would be held for the election of three tribunes with consular powers.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> No sooner was this announcement made than everybody who had ever acted or spoken as a fomenter of sedition, especially those who had been tribunes, came forward as candidates, and began to bustle about the Forum, canvassing for votes.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The patricians were at first deterred from seeking election, as in the exasperated mood of the plebeians they regarded their chances as hopeless, and they were disgusted at the prospect of having to hold office with these men. At last, under compulsion from their leaders, lest they should appear to have withdrawn from any share in the government, they consented to stand.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The result of the election showed that when men are contending for liberty and the right to hold office their feelings are different from what they are when the contest is over and they can form an unbiased judgment. The people were satisfied now that votes were allowed for plebeians, and they elected none but patricians.

Their names were Aulus Sempronius Atratinus, L. Atilius, and T. Caecilius, and during their tenure of office concord at home procured peace abroad.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Some writers omit all mention of the proposal to elect consuls from the plebs, and assert that the creation of three military tribunes invested with the insignia and authority of consuls was rendered necessary by the inability of two consuls to cope at the same time with the Veientine war in addition to the war with the Aequi and Volscians and the defection of Ardea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The jurisdiction of that office was not yet, however, firmly established, for in consequence of the decision of the augurs they resigned office after three months, owing to some irregularity in their election.

Owing to a dispute whether consuls or military tribunes should be elected, the interregnum lasted several days.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The interrex and the senate tried to secure the election of consuls; the plebs and their tribunes that of military tribunes.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The senate conquered, for the plebeians were sure to confer either honour on the patricians and so refrained from an idle contest, whilst their leaders preferred an election in which no votes could be received for them to one in which they would be passed over as unworthy to hold office. The tribunes, too, gave up the fruitless contest out of complaisance to the leaders of the senate.

This is the sole proof that they were the consuls for that year, for they are not found in the ancient annals nor in the official list of magistrates.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whether<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Institution of the Censorship.</note> there were tribunes this year, or whether they were replaced by consuls, there is no doubt that the following year the consuls were M.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the former consul for the second time, the latter for the fifth time.</p><p>This year saw the beginning of the censorship, an office which, starting from small beginnings, grew to be of such importance that it had the regulation of the conduct and morals of Rome, the control of the senate and the equestrian order; the power of honouring and degrading was also in the hands of these magistrates; the legal rights connected with public places and private property, and the revenues of the Roman people, were under their absolute control.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Its origin was due to the fact that no census had been taken of the people for many years, and it could no longer be postponed, whilst the consuls, with so many wars impending, did not feel at liberty to undertake the task.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was suggested in the senate that as the business would be a complicated and laborious one, not at all suitable for the consuls, a special magistrate was needed who should superintend the registrars and have the custody of the lists and assessment schedules and fix the valuation of property and the status of citizens at his discretion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Though the suggestion was not of great importance, the senate gladly adopted it, as it would add to the number of patrician magistrates in the State, and I think that they anticipated what actually happened, that the influence of those who held the office would soon enhance its authority and dignity.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The tribunes, too, looking more at the need which certainly existed for such an office than at the lustre which would attend its administration, offered no opposition, lest they should appear to be raising troublesome difficulties even in small matters.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The foremost men of the State declined the honour, so Papirius and Sempronius-about whose consulship doubts were entertained-were elected by the suffrages of the people to conduct the census. Their election to this magistracy made up for the incompleteness of their consulship. From the duties they had to discharge they were called Censors.</p>

						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> One of them, the girl's equal in point of birth, was encouraged by her guardians, who belonged to the same class; the other, a young noble captivated solely by her beauty, was supported by the sympathy and good-will of the nobility.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Party feeling had even penetrated into the girl's home, for the mother, who wanted her daughter to make as splendid a match as possible, preferred the young noble, whilst the guardians, carrying their partisanship even into such a matter as this, were working for the man of their own class.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As the matter could not be settled within the four walls of the house, they brought it into court. After hearing the appeals of the mother and of the guardians, the magistrates granted the disposal of the girl's hand in accordance with the mother's wishes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But violence won the day, for the guardians, after haranguing a number of their partisans in the Forum on the iniquity of the verdict, collected a body of men and carried off the maiden from her mother's house.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were met by a still more determined troop of nobles, assembled to follow their young comrade, who was furious at the outrage. A desperate fight ensued and the plebeians got the worst of it. In a very different spirit from the Roman plebs they marched, fully armed, out of the city and took possession of a hill from which they raided the lands of the nobles and laid them waste with fire and sword.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A multitude of artisans who had previously taken no part in the conflict, excited by the hope of plunder, joined them, and preparations were made to besiege the city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All the horrors of war were present in the city, as though it had been infected with the madness
						<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> of the two young men who were seeking fatal nuptials out of their country's ruin.</p><p>Both sides felt the need of an addition to their strength; the nobles prevailed on the Romans to come to the relief of their beleaguered city;
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the plebs induced the Volscians to join them in attacking Ardea.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Volscians, under the leadership of Cluilius, the Aequian, were the first to come, and drew lines of circumvallation round the enemy's walls. When news of this reached Rome the consul M. Geganius at once left with an army and fixed his camp three miles distant from the enemy, and as the day was declining he ordered his men to rest. At the fourth watch he ordered an advance, and so expeditiously was the task undertaken and completed, that at sunrise the Volscians saw themselves enclosed by a stronger circumvallation than the one which they had themselves carried round the city.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed">This description is identical with the one in Book III. chap. xxviii. Even the name of the Volscian commander is the same.</note>In another direction the consul constructed a covered way up to the wall of Ardea by which his friends in the city could go to and fro.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Up to that time the Volscian commander had not laid in any stock of provisions, as he had been able to maintain his army upon the corn carried off each day from the surrounding country. Now, however, that he was suddenly shut in by the Roman lines, he found himself destitute of everything. He invited the consul to a conference, and said that if the object for which the Romans had come was to raise the siege, he would withdraw the Volscians. The consul replied that it was for the defeated side to submit to terms, not to impose them, and as the Volscians had come at their own pleasure to attack the allies of Rome, they should not depart on the same terms. He required them to lay down their arms, surrender their general, and make acknowledgment of their defeat by placing themselves under his orders; otherwise, whether they remained or departed, he would prove a relentless foe, and would rather carry back to Rome a victory over them than a faithless peace.</p><p>The only hope of the Volscians lay in their arms, and slight as it was they risked it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The ground was unfavourable to them for fighting, still more so for flight. As they were being cut down in all directions, they begged for quarter, but they were only allowed to get away after their general had been surrendered, their arms given up, and they themselves sent under the yoke. Covered with disgrace and disaster, they departed with only one garment apiece. They halted not far from the city of Tusculum, and owing to an old grudge which that city had against them, they were suddenly attacked, and defenceless as they were, suffered severe punishment, few being left to carry the news of the disaster.</p><p>The consul settled the troubles in Ardea by beheading the ringleaders of the disturbance and confiscating their property to the treasury of the city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The citizens considered that the injustice of the recent decision was removed by the great service that Rome had rendered, but the senate thought that something ought still to be done to wipe out the record of national avarice.</p><p>The consul Quinctius achieved the difficult task of rivalling in his civil administration the military renown of his colleague. He showed such care to maintain peace and concord by tempering justice equally for the highest and the lowest, that whilst the senate looked upon him as a stern consul, the plebeians regarded him as a lenient one.
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He held his ground against the tribunes more by personal authority than by active opposition. Five consulships marked by the same even tenor of conduct, a whole lifetime passed in a manner worthy of a consul, invested the man himself with almost more reverence than the office he filled. Whilst these two men were consuls there was no talk of military tribunes.</p><p>The new consuls were Marcus Fabius Vibulanus and Postumius Aebutius Cornicinen. The previous year was regarded by the neighbouring peoples, whether friendly or hostile, as chiefly memorable because of the trouble taken to help Ardea in its peril. The new consuls, aware that they were succeeding men distinguished both at home and abroad, were all the more anxious to obliterate from men's minds the infamous judgment.<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed">See end of Book III.</note> Accordingly, they obtained a senatorial decree ordering that as the population of Ardea had been seriously reduced through the internal disturbances, a body of colonists should be sent there as a protection against the Volscians. This was the reason alleged in the text of the decree, to prevent their intention of rescinding the judgment from being suspected by the plebs and tribunes.
								<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They had, however, privately agreed that the majority of the colonists should consist of Rutulians, that no land should be allotted other than what had been appropriated under the infamous judgment, and that not a single sod should be assigned to a Roman till all the Rutulians had received their share. So the land went back to the Ardeates. Agrippa Menenius, T. Cluilius Siculus, and M. Aebutius Helva were the triumvirs appointed to superintend the settlement of the colony. Their office was not only extremely unpopular, but they gave great offence to the plebs by assigning to allies land which the Roman people had formally adjudged to be their own.
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even with the leaders of the patricians they were out of favour, because they had refused to allow themselves to be influenced by any of them. The tribunes impeached them, but they avoided all further vexatious proceedings by enrolling themselves amongst the settlers and remaining in the colony which they now possessed as a testimony to their justice and integrity.</p><p>XII.There was peace abroad and at home during this and the following year when C. Furius Pacilus and M. Papirius Crassus were consuls. The Sacred Games, which in accordance with a decree of the senate had been vowed by the decemvirs on the occasion of the secession of the plebs, were celebrated this year. Poetilius, who had again raised the question of the division of territory, was made tribune. He made fruitless efforts to create sedition, and was unable to prevail upon the consuls to bring the question before the senate.
									<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After a great struggle he succeeded so far that the senate should be consulted as to whether the next elections should be held for consuls or for consular tribunes. They ordered consuls to be elected. The tribune's menaces were laughed at when he threatened to obstruct the levy at a time when all the neighbouring States were quiet and there was no necessity for war or for any preparations for war.</p><p>Proculus<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Internal Troubles.</note> Geganius Macerinus and Lucius Menenius Lanatus were the consuls for the year which followed this state of tranquillity; a year remarkable for a multiplicity of disasters and dangers, seditions, famine, and the imminent risk of the people being bribed to bow their necks to despotic power.
										<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A foreign war alone was wanting. Had this come to aggravate the universal distress, resistance would hardly have been possible even with the help of all the gods.</p><p>The misfortunes began with a famine, owing either to the year being unfavourable to the crops, or to the cultivation of the land being abandoned for the attractions of political meetings and city life; both causes are assigned. The senate blamed the idleness of the plebeians, the tribunes charged the consuls at one time with dishonesty, at another with negligence. At last they induced the plebs, with the acquiescence of the senate, to appoint as Prefect of the Corn-market L. Minucius.
											<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In that capacity he was more successful in guarding liberty than in the discharge of his office, though in the end he deservedly won gratitude and reputation for having relieved the scarcity. He despatched numerous agents by sea and land to visit the surrounding nations, but as, with the sole exception of Etruria, who furnished a small supply, their mission was fruitless, he made no impression on the market. He then devoted himself to the careful adjustment of the scarcity, and obliged all who possessed any corn to declare the amount, and after retaining a month's supply for themselves, sell the rest to the Government. By cutting down the daily rations of the slaves to one half, by holding up the corn-merchants to public execration, by rigorous and inquisitorial methods, he revealed the prevailing distress more than he relieved it. Many of the plebs lost all hope, and rather than drag on a life of misery muffled their heads<note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">Veiling the head by throwing a part of the toga over it was an act of reverence on the part of all who sought to approach the gods in prayer or sacrifice, and also before death, which was the passage to the gods of the under world.

So Suetonius tells us that when Julius Caesar <q direct="unspecified">found himself attacked on all sides with naked daggers, he muffled his head in his toga and with his left hand let the rest drop to his feet that he might fall the more decorously.</q></note> and threw themselves into the Tiber.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Treason and Death of Spurius Maelius.</note> was at that time that Spurius Maelius, a member of the equestrian order and a very wealthy man for those days, entered upon an undertaking, serviceable in itself, but forming a very bad precedent and dictated by still worse motives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Through the instrumentality of his clients and foreign friends he purchased corn in Etruria, and this very circumstance, I believe, hampered the Government in their efforts to cheapen the market.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He distributed this corn gratis, and so won the hearts of the plebeians by this generosity that wherever he moved, conspicuous and consequential beyond an ordinary mortal, they followed him, and this popularity seemed to his hopes a sure earnest of a consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But the minds of men are never satisfied with Fortune's promises, and he began to entertain loftier and unattainable aims; he knew the consulship would have to be won in the teeth of the patricians, so he began to dream of royalty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After all his grand schemes and efforts he looked upon that as the only fitting reward which owing to its greatness must be won by the greatest exertions.</p><p>The consular elections were now close at hand, and as his plans were not yet matured, this circumstance proved his ruin.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> T. Quinctius Capitolinus, a very awkward man for any one meditating a revolution, was chosen consul for the sixth time, and Agrippa Menenius, surnamed Lanatus, was assigned to him as his colleague.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Lucius Minucius was either reappointed prefect of the corn-market, or his original appointment was for an indefinite period as long as circumstances required; there is nothing definitely stated beyond the fact that the name of the prefect was entered on the <q direct="unspecified">Linen Rolls</q> among the magistrates for both years.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Minucius was discharging the same function as a State official which Maelius had undertaken as a private citizen, and the same class of people frequented both their houses.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He made a discovery which he brought to the notice of the senate, viz., that arms were being collected in Maelius' house, and that he was holding secret meetings at which plans were being undoubtedly formed to establish a monarchy. The moment for action was not yet fixed, but everything else had been settled; the tribunes had been bought over to betray the liberties of the people, and these leaders of the populace had had their various parts assigned to them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He had, he said, delayed making his report till it was almost too late for the public safety, lest he should appear to be the author of vague and groundless suspicions.</p><p>On hearing this the leaders of the senate censured the consuls of the previous year for having allowed those free distributions of corn and secret meetings to go on, and they were equally severe on the new consuls for having waited till the prefect of the corn-market had made his report, for the matter was of such importance that the consuls ought not only
							<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> to have reported it, but also dealt with it.</p><p>In reply, Quinctius said that the censure on the consuls was undeserved, for, hampered as they were by the laws giving the right of appeal, which were passed to weaken their authority, they were far from possessing as much power as will to punish the atrocious attempt with the severity it deserved. What was wanted was not only a strong man, but one who was free to act, unshackled by the laws.
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He should therefore nominate Lucius Quinctius as Dictator, for he had the courage and resolution which such great powers demanded. This met with universal approval. Quinctius at first refused and asked them what they meant by exposing him at the close of his life to such a bitter struggle.
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At last, after well-merited commendations were showered upon him from all parts of the House and he was assured that <q direct="unspecified">in that aged mind there was not only more wisdom but more courage than in all the rest,</q> whilst the consul adhered to his decision, he yielded.
								<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> After a prayer to heaven that in such a time of danger his old age might not prove a source of harm or discredit to the republic, Cincinnatus was made Dictator. He appointed Caius Servilius Ahala as his Master of the Horse.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day, after posting guards at different points, he came down to the Forum. The novelty and mystery of the thing drew the attention of the plebs towards him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Maelius and his confederates recognised that this tremendous power was directed against them, whilst those who knew nothing of the plot asked what disturbance or sudden outbreak of war called for the supreme authority of a Dictator or required Quinctius, after reaching his eightieth year, to assume the government of the republic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Servilius, the Master of the Horse, was despatched by the Dictator to Maelius with the message: <q direct="unspecified">The Dictator summons you.</q> Alarmed at the summons, he inquired what it meant. Servilius explained that he had to stand his trial and clear himself of the charge brought against him by Minucius in the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On this Maelius retreated amongst his troop of adherents, and looking round at them began to slink away, when an officer by order of the Master of the Horse seized him and began to drag him away. The bystanders rescued him, and as he fled he implored <q direct="unspecified">the protection of the Roman plebs,</q> and said that he was the victim of a conspiracy amongst the patricians, because he had acted generously towards the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He entreated them to come to his help in this terrible crisis, and not suffer him to be butchered before their eyes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Whilst he was making these appeals, Servilius overtook him and slew him. Besprinkled with the dead man's blood, and surrounded by a troop of young patricians, he returned to the Dictator and reported that Maelius after being summoned to appear before him had driven away his officer and incited the populace to riot, and had now met with the punishment he deserved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <q direct="unspecified">Well done!</q> said the Dictator, <q direct="unspecified">C. Servilius, you have delivered the republic.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The populace did not know what to make of the deed and were becoming excited. The Dictator ordered them to be summoned to an Assembly. He declared that Maelius had been lawfully slain, even if he were guiltless of treason, because he had refused to come to the Dictator when summoned by the Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He, Cincinnatus, had sat to investigate the case, after it had been investigated Maelius would have been treated in accordance with the result.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was not to be dealt with like an ordinary citizen. For, though born amongst a free people under laws and settled rights, in a City from which he knew that royalty had been expelled, and in the very same year, the sons of the king's sister, children of the consul who liberated his country, had, on the discovery of a conspiracy for restoring royalty, been beheaded by their own father-a City from which Collatinus
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> Tarquin the consul had been ordered to lay down his office and go into exile, because the very name of Tarquin was detested-a City in which some years later Spurius Cassius had been punished for entertaining designs of sovereignty-a City in which recently the decemvirs had been punished by confiscation, exile, and death because of a tyranny as despotic as that of kings-in <emph>that</emph> City Maelius had conceived hopes of sovereignty!
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And who was this man? Although no nobility of birth, no honours, no services to the State paved the way for any man to sovereign power, still it was their consulships, their decemvirates, the honours achieved by them and their ancestors and the splendour of their families that raised the ambitions of the Claudii and the Cassii to an impious height.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But Spurius Maelius, to whom the tribuneship of the plebs was a thing to be wished for rather than hoped for, a wealthy corn-factor, hoped to buy the liberty of his fellow-citizens for a couple of pounds of spelt, and imagined that by throwing a little corn to
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> them he could reduce to slavery the men who had conquered all the neighbouring States, and that he whom the State could hardly stomach as a senator would be tolerated as a king, possessing the power and insignia of Romulus, who had sprung from the gods and been carried back to the gods!
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> His act must be regarded as a portent quite as much as a crime; for that portent his blood was not sufficient expiation, those walls within which such madness had been conceived must be levelled to the ground, and his property, contaminated by the price of treason, confiscated to the State.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So far the Dictator. He then gave orders for the house to be forthwith razed to the ground, that the place where it stood might be a perpetual reminder of impious hopes crushed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was afterwards called the Aequimaelium. L. Minucius was presented with the Image of a golden ox set up outside the Trigeminan gate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As he distributed the corn which had belonged to Maelius at the price of one <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">as</foreign></q> per bushel, the plebs raised no objection to his being thus honoured.</p><p>I find it stated in some authorities that this Minucius went over from the patricians to the plebeians and after being co-opted as an eleventh tribune quelled a disturbance which arose in consequence of the death of Maelius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is, however, hardly credible that the senate would have allowed this increase in the number of the tribunes, or that such a precedent, above all others, should have been introduced by a patrician, or that if that concession had been once made, the plebs should not have adhered to it, or at all events tried to do so.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the most conclusive refutation of the lying inscription on his image is to be found in a provision of the law passed a few years previously that it should not be lawful for tribunes to co-opt a colleague.</p><p>Q. Caecilius, Q. Junius, and Sex.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Titinius were the only members of the college of tribunes who did not support the proposal to honour Minucius, and they never ceased to attack Minucius and Servilius in turn before the Assembly and charge them with the undeserved death of Maelius. They succeeded in securing the creation of military tribunes instead of consuls at the next election, for they felt no doubt that for the six vacancies- that number could now be elected-some of the plebeians, by giving out that they would avenge the death of Maelius, would be elected.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But in spite of the excitement amongst the plebeians owing to the numerous commotions through the year, they did not create more than three tribunes with consular powers; amongst them L. Quinctius the son of the Cincinnatus who as Dictator incurred such odium that it was made the pretext for disturbances.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Mam. Aemilius polled the highest number of votes, L. Julius came in third.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Revolt of Fidenae.</note> their magistracy Fidenae, where a body of Romans were settled, revolted to Lars Tolumnius, king of the Veientines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The revolt was made worse by a crime. C. Fulcinius, Cloelius Tullus, Sp. Antius, and L. Roscius, who were sent as envoys to ascertain the reasons for this change of policy, were murdered by order of Tolumnius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some try to exculpate the king by alleging that whilst playing at dice he made a lucky throw and used an ambiguous expression which might be taken to be an order for death, and that the Fidenates took it so, and this was the reason of the death of the envoys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This is incredible; it is impossible to believe that when the Fidenates, his new allies, came to consult him as to committing a murder in defiance of the law of nations, he should
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> not have turned his thoughts from the game, or should afterwards have imputed the crime to a misunderstanding.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is much more probable that he wished the Fidenates to be implicated in such an awful crime in order to make it impossible for them to hope for any reconciliation with Rome. The statues of the murdered envoys were set up in the Rostra.</p><p>Owing to the proximity of the Veientines and Fidenates, and still more to the heinous crime with which they began the war, the struggle threatened to be a desperate one.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Anxiety for the national safety kept the plebs quiet, and their tribunes raised no difficulties in the election of M. Geganius Macerinus as consul for the third time, and L. Sergius Fidenas, who, I believe, was so called from the war which he afterwards conducted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was the first who fought a successful action with the king of Veii on this side of the Anio. The victory he gained was by no means a bloodless one; there was more mourning for their countrymen who were lost than joy over the defeat of the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Owing to the critical aspect of affairs, the senate ordered Mamercus Aemilius to be proclaimed Dictator. He chose as his Master of the Horse L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, who had been his colleague in the college of consular tribunes the previous year, a young man worthy of his father.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To the force levied by the consuls were added a number of war-seasoned veteran centurions, to fill up the number of those lost in the late battle. The Dictator ordered Quinctius Capitolinus and M. Fabius Vibulanus to accompany him as seconds in command.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The higher power of the Dictator, wielded by a man quite equal to it, dislodged the enemy from Roman territory and sent him across the Anio. He occupied the line of hills between Fidenae and the Anio, where he entrenched himself, and did not go down into the plains until the legions of Falerii had come to his support.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Then the camp of the Etruscans was formed in front of the walls of Fidenae. The Roman Dictator chose a position not far from them at the junction of the Anio and the Tiber, and extended his lines as far as possible from the one river to the other. The next day he led his men out to battle.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amongst the enemy there was diversity of opinion. The men of Falerii, impatient at serving so far from home, and full of self-confidence, demanded battle; those of Veii and Fidenae placed more hope in a prolongation of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Although Tolumnius was more inclined to the opinion of his own men, he announced that he would give battle the next day, in case the Faliscans should refuse to serve through a protracted campaign.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This hesitation on the part of the enemy gave the Dictator and the Romans fresh courage.</p><p>The next day, whilst the soldiers were declaring that unless they had the chance of fighting they would attack the enemy's camp and city, both armies advanced on to the level ground between their respective camps.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Veientine general, who was greatly superior in numbers, sent a detachment round the back of the hills to attack the Roman camp during the battle. The armies of the three States were stationed thus: The Veientines were on the right wing, the Faliscans on the left, the Fidenates in the centre.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Dictator led his right wing against the Faliscans, Capitolinus Quinctius directed the attack of the left against the Veientines, whilst the Master of the Horse advanced with his cavalry against the enemy's centre.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For a few moments all was silent and motionless, as the Etruscans would not commence the fight unless they were compelled, and the Dictator was watching the Citadel of Rome <note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed">The augurs were on the <foreign lang="la">auguraculum</foreign> (note 6, Book I), and their signal could easily be seen from the battle-field, which was between three and four miles distant</note>and waiting for the agreed signal from the augurs as soon as the omens should prove favourable.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No sooner had he caught sight of it than he let loose the cavalry, who, raising a loud battle-cry, charged; the infantry followed with a furious onslaught.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In no quarter did the legions of Etruria stand the Roman charge; their cavalry offered the stoutest resistance, and the king, himself by far the bravest of them, charged the Romans whilst they were scattered everywhere in pursuit of the enemy, and so prolonged the contest.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was in the cavalry, on that day, a military tribune named A. Cornelius Cossus, a remarkably handsome man, and equally distinguished for strength and courage, and proud of his family name, which, illustrious as it was when he inherited it, was rendered still more so when he left it to his posterity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he saw the Roman squadrons shaken by the repeated charges of Tolumnius in whatever direction he rode, and recognised him as he galloped along the entire line, conspicuous in his royal habiliments, he exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">Is this the breaker of treaties between man and man, the violator of the law of nations?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If it is the will of heaven that anything holy should exist on earth, I will slay this man and offer him as a sacrifice to the <foreign lang="la">manes</foreign> of the murdered envoys.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Putting spurs to his horse he charged with levelled spear against this single foe, and having struck and unhorsed him, he leaped with the aid of his spear to the ground.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As the king was attempting to rise he pushed him back with the boss of his shield, and with repeated spear-thrusts pinned him to the earth. Then he despoiled the lifeless body, and cutting off his head stuck it on his spear, and carrying it in triumph routed the enemy, who were panic-struck at the king's death. So the enemy's cavalry, who had alone made the issue of the contest doubtful, now shared in the general rout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Dictator hotly pursued the flying legions and drove them to their camp with great slaughter. Most of the Fidenates, who were familiar with the country, escaped to the hills. Cossus with the cavalry crossed the Tiber and brought to the City an enormous amount of booty from the country of the Veientines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> During the battle there was also an engagement at the Roman camp with the detachment which, as already stated, Tolumnius had sent to attack it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Fabius Vibulanus at first confined himself to the defence of the circuit of his lines; then, while the enemy's attention was wholly directed to forcing the stockade, he made a sortie from the <foreign lang="la">Porta Principalis</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">Porta Principalis</foreign> &mdash;See T plan of Roman camp in <bibl>Class. Dict.</bibl></note> on the right, and this unexpected attack produced such consternation among the enemy, that though there were fewer killed, owing to the smaller number engaged, the flight was just as disorderly as in the main battle.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Successful in all directions, the Dictator returned home to enjoy the honour of a triumph granted him by decree of the senate and resolution of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By far the finest sight in the procession was Cossus bearing the <foreign lang="la">spolia opima</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed">See note 5, Book I.</note> of the king he had slain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The soldiers sang rude songs in his honour and placed him on a level with Romulus. He solemnly dedicated the spoils to Jupiter Feretrius, and hung them in his temple near those of Romulus, which were the only ones which at that time were called <foreign lang="la">spolia opima prima</foreign>. All eyes were turned from the chariot of the Dictator to him; he almost monopolised the honours of the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> By order of the people, a crown of gold, a pound in weight, was made at the public expense and placed by the Dictator in the Capitol as an offering to Jupiter.</p><p>In stating
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> that Cossus placed the <foreign lang="la">spolia opima secunda</foreign> in the temple of Jupiter Feretrius when he was a military tribune I have followed all the existing authorities.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But not only is the designation of <foreign lang="la">spolia opima</foreign> restricted to those which a commander-in-chief has taken from a commander-in-chief &mdash;and we know of no commander-in-chief but the one under whose auspices the war is conducted &mdash;but I and my authorities are also confuted by the actual inscription on the spoils, which states that Cossus took them when he was consul.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Augustus Caesar, the founder and restorer of all the temples, rebuilt the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, which had fallen to ruin through age, and I once heard him say that after entering it he read that inscription on the linen cuirass with his own eyes. After that I felt it would be almost a sacrilege to withhold from Cossus the evidence as to his spoils given by the Caesar who restored that very temple.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whether the mistake, if there be one, may have arisen from the fact that the ancient annals, and the <q direct="unspecified">Linen Rolls</q> &mdash;the lists of magistrates preserved in the temple of Moneta which Macer Licinius frequently quotes as authorities &mdash; have an A. Cornelius Cossus as consul with T. Quinctius Poenus, ten years later-of this every man must judge for himself.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> For there is this further reason why so famous a battle could not be transferred to this later date, namely, that during the three years which preceded and followed the consulship of Cossus war was impossible owing to pestilence and famine, so that some of the annals, as though they were records of deaths, supply nothing but the names of the consuls.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The third year after his consulship has the name of Cossus as a consular tribune, and in the same year he is entered as Master of the Horse, in which capacity he fought another brilliant cavalry action.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Every one is at liberty to form his own conjecture; these doubtful points, in my belief, can be made to support any opinion. The fact remains that the man who fought the battle placed the newly-won spoils in the sacred shrine near Jupiter himself, to whom they were consecrated, and with Romulus in full view &mdash;two witnesses to be dreaded by any forger &mdash;and that he described himself in the inscription as <q direct="unspecified">A. Cornelius Cossus, Consul.</q><note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed">The latter part of this chapter is as a piece of historical criticism unique in classical literature.

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Conquest of Fidenae</note>M. Cornelius Maluginensis and L. Papirius Crassus were the next consuls. Armies were led into the territories of the Veientines and Faliscans and men and cattle were carried off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The enemy was nowhere found in the open, nor was there any opportunity of fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their cities, however, were not attacked, for the people were visited by an epidemic.</p><p>Spurius Maelius, a tribune of the plebs, tried to get up disturbances, but failed to do so. Relying upon the popularity of the name he bore, he had impeached Minucius and brought forward a proposal for the confiscation of the property of Servilius Ahala on the plea that Maelius had been the
						<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> victim of false charges by Minucius, whilst Servilius had been guilty of putting a citizen to death without trial.<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed">The Maelius whom Ahala had killed was regarded by the plebs as a martyr to their cause.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> people paid less attention to these accusations than even to their author; they were much more concerned about the increasing virulence of the epidemic and the terrifying portents; most of all about the reports of frequent earthquakes which laid the houses in the country districts in ruins.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A solemn supplication, therefore, was offered up by the people, led by the duumvirs.</p><p>The following year, in which the consuls were C. Julius, for the second time, and L. Verginius, was still more fatal, and created such alarming desolation in town and country that no plundering parties left Roman territory, nor did either senate or plebs entertain any idea of taking the offensive.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Fidenates, however, who had at first confined themselves to their mountains and walled villages, actually came down into the Roman territory and ravaged it.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As the Faliscans could not be induced to renew the war, either by the representations of their allies or by the fact that Rome was prostrated by the epidemic, the Fidenates sent to invite the Veientine army, and the two States crossed the Anio and displayed their standards not far from the Colline gate.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The alarm was as great in the City as in the country districts. The consul Julius disposed his troops on the rampart and the walls; Verginius convened the senate in the temple of Quirinus.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They decreed that Q. Servilius should be nominated Dictator. According to one tradition he was surnamed Priscus, according to another, Structus. Verginius waited till he could consult his colleague; on gaining his consent, he nominated the Dictator at night. The Dictator appointed Postumius Aebutius Helva as Master of the Horse.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Dictator issued an order for all to muster outside the Colline gate by daybreak. Every man strong enough to bear arms was present. The standards were quickly brought to the Dictator from the treasury.</p><p>While these arrangements were being made, the enemy withdrew to the foot of the hills.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Dictator followed them with an army eager for battle, and engaged them not far from Nomentum. The Etruscan legions were routed and driven into Fidenae; the Dictator surrounded the place with lines of circumvallation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But, owing to its elevated positron and strong fortifications, the city could not be carried by assault, and a blockade was quite ineffective, for there was not only corn enough for their actual necessities, but even for a lavish supply from what had been stored up beforehand. So all hope of either storming the place or starving it into surrender was abandoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As it was near Rome, the nature of the ground was well known, and the Dictator was aware that the side of the city remote from his camp was weakly fortified owing to its natural strength. He determined to carry a mine through from that side to the citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He formed his army into four divisions, to take turns in the fighting, and by keeping up a constant attack upon the walls in all directions, day and night, he prevented the enemy from noticing the work.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At last the hill was tunnelled through and the way lay open from the Roman camp up to the citadel. Whilst the attention of the Etruscans was being diverted by feigned attacks from their real danger, the shouts of the enemy above their
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> heads showed them that the city was taken.</p><p>In that year the censors C. Furius Pacilus and M.

But amongst the many points obscure through lapse of time, this also is left unsettled.</p><p>The capture of Fidenae created alarm in Etruria.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not only were the Veientines apprehensive of a similar fate, but the Faliscans too had not forgotten the war which they had commenced in alliance with them, though they had taken no part in its renewal.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The two States sent round envoys to the twelve cantons, and in compliance with their request a meeting was proclaimed of the national council of Etruria, to be held at the temple of Voltumna. As a great struggle seemed imminent, the senate ordered that Mamercus Aemilius should be again nominated Dictator.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A. Postumius Tubertus was appointed Master of the Horse. Preparations for war were made with all the greater energy now than on the last occasion, as the danger to be apprehended from the whole of Etruria was greater than from only two of its towns</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Limitation of the Censorship.</note> occasion passed off more quietly than anybody expected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Information was brought by traders that help had been refused to the Veientines; they were told to prosecute with their own resources a war which they had commenced on their own initiative, and not, now that they were in difficulties, to look for allies amongst those whom in their prosperity they refused to take into their confidence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Dictator was now deprived of any opportunity of acquiring fame in war, but he was anxious to achieve some work which might be a memorial of his dictatorship and prevent it from appearing an unnecessary appointment, so he made preparations for abridging the censorship, either because he considered its power excessive, or because he objected not so much to the greatness as the length of
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> duration of the office.</p><p>Accordingly he convened the Assembly and said that as the gods had undertaken the conduct of the State in external affairs and made everything safe, he would do what required to be done within the walls, and take counsel for the liberties of the Roman people. Those liberties were most securely guarded when those who held great powers did not hold them long, and when offices which could not be limited in their jurisdiction were limited in their tenure.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whilst the other magistracies were annual, the censorship was a quinquennial one. It was a distinct grievance to have to live at the mercy of the same men for so many years, in fact for a considerable part of one's life.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was going to bring in a law that the censorship should not last longer than eighteen months. He carried the law the next day amidst the enthusiastic approval of the people, and then made the following announcement: <q direct="unspecified">That you may really know, Quirites, how much I disapprove of prolonged rule, I now lay down my dictatorship.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After thus resigning his own magistracy and limiting the other one, he was escorted home amidst the hearty good-will and congratulations of the people.</p><p>The censors were extremely angry with Mamercus for having limited the power of a Roman magistrate, they struck him out of his tribe, increased his assessment eightfold, and disfranchised him.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is recorded that he bore this most magnanimously, thinking more of the cause which led to the ignominy being inflicted upon him than of the ignominy itself. The leading men amongst the patricians, though disapproving of the limitation imposed on the censorial jurisdiction, were shocked at this instance of the harsh exercise of its power, for each recognised that he would be subject to the censors more frequently and for a longer time than he would be censor himself.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At all events the people, it is said, felt so indignant that no one but Mamercus possessed sufficient authority to protect the censors from violence.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Pestilence in Rome &mdash;Plebeian Grievances.</note> tribunes of the plebs held constant meetings of the Assembly with a view to preventing the election of consuls, and after bringing matters almost to the appointment of an interrex, they succeeded in getting consular tribunes
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> elected. They looked for plebeians to be elected as a reward for their exertions, but not a single one came in; all who were elected were
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> patricians. Their names were M. Fabius Vibulanus, M. Folius, and L. Sergius Fidenas.</p><p>The pestilence that year kept everything quiet. The duumvirs did many things prescribed by the sacred books to appease the wrath of the gods and remove the pestilence from the
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> people. The mortality, notwithstanding, was heavy both in the City and in the country districts; men and beasts alike perished. Owing to the losses amongst the cultivators of the soil, a famine was feared as the result of the pestilence, and agents were despatched to Etruria and the Pomptine territory and Cumae, and at last even to Sicily, to procure
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> corn.</p><p>No mention was made of the election of consuls; consular tribunes were appointed, all patricians. Their names were L. Pinarius Mamercus, L. Furius Medullinus, and Sp. Postumius
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Albus. In this year the violence of the epidemic abated and there was no scarcity of corn, owing to the provision that had been made. Projects of war were discussed in the national councils of the Volscians and Aequi, and in Etruria at the temple of
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Voltumna. There the question was adjourned for a year and a decree was passed
							<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> that no council should be held till the year had elapsed, in spite of the protests of the Veientines, who declared that the same fate which had overtaken Fidenae was threatening
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> them.</p><p>At Rome, meantime, the leaders of the plebs, finding that their cherished hopes of higher dignity were futile whilst there was peace abroad, got up meetings in the houses of the tribunes, where they discussed their plans in
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> secret. They complained that they had been treated with such contempt by the plebs, that though consular tribunes had now been elected for many years, not a single plebeian had ever found his way to that
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> office. Their ancestors had shown much foresight in taking care that the plebeian magistracies should not be open to patricians, otherwise they must have had patricians as tribunes of the plebs, for so insignificant were they in the eyes of their own order that they were looked down upon by plebeians quite as much as by the
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> patricians.</p><p>Others threw the blame on the patricians, it was owing to their unscrupulous cleverness in pushing their canvassing that the path to honour was closed to the plebeians. If the plebs were allowed a respite from their menaces and entreaties, they would think of their own party when they went to vote, and by their united efforts would win office and
									<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> power.</p><p>It was decided that, with a view to doing away with the abuses of canvassing, the tribunes should bring in a law forbidding any one to whiten his toga<note anchored="yes" n="14" resp="ed">The toga was the natural color of the wool of which it was made; those who sought election whitened their togas with chalk or some similar substance, and hence were called <foreign lang="la">candidati</foreign> (<q direct="unspecified">dressed in white robes</q>).</note>, when he appeared as a candidate. To us now the matter may appear trivial and hardly worth serious discussion, but it kindled a tremendous conflict between patricians and
										<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> plebeians. The tribunes, however, succeeded in carrying their law, and it was clear that, irritated as they were, the plebeians would support their own men. That they might not be free to do so, a resolution was passed in the senate that the forthcoming elections should be held for the appointment of consuls.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Volscians and Aequi.</note> reason for this decision was the report sent in by the Latins and Hernicans of a sudden rising amongst the Volscians and Aequi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> T. Quinctius Cincinnatus &mdash;surnamed Poenus &mdash;the son of Lucius, and Gnaeus Julius Mento were made consuls.</p><p>War very soon broke out.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After a levy had been raised under the Lex Sacrata<note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">Lex Sacrata.</foreign> &mdash;A law, the violation of which exposed the offender, his family and property, to be devoted (<foreign lang="la">sacer</foreign>) to some deity, and whoever killed him was held to have sacrificed him to that deity. Such was the Law of Publicola; as also that which secured the inviolability of the tribunes of the plebs and subsequently of other magistrates. In the present case everyone who refused to serve was so <q direct="unspecified">devoted,</q> probably by a priest of Mars.</note>, which was the most powerful means they possessed of compelling men to serve, the armies of both nations advanced and concentrated on Algidus, where they entrenched themselves, each in a separate
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> camp. Their generals showed greater care than on any previous occasion in the construction of their lines and the exercising of the troops. The reports of this increased the alarm in
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Rome. In view of the fact that these two nations after their numerous defeats were now renewing the war with greater energy than they had ever done before, and, further, that a considerable number of the Romans fit for active service had been carried off by the epidemic, the senate decided upon the nomination of a
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Dictator. But the greatest alarm was caused by the perverse obstinacy of the consuls and their incessant wranglings in the senate. Some authorities assent that these consuls fought an unsuccessful action at Algidus and that this was the reason why a Dictator was
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> nominated. It is at all events generally agreed that whilst at variance in other matters, they were at one in opposing the senate and preventing the appointment of a Dictator. At last, when each report that came in was more alarming than the last, and the consuls refused to accept the authority of the senate, Quintus Servilius Priscus, who had filled the highest offices in the State with distinction, said, <q direct="unspecified">Tribunes of the
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> plebs! now that matters have come to extremities, the senate calls upon you in this crisis of the commonwealth, by virtue of the authority of your office, to compel the consuls to nominate a Dictator.</q></p><p>On hearing this appeal, the tribunes considered that a favourable opportunity presented itself for augmenting their authority, and they retired to
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> deliberate. Then they formally declared in the name of the whole college of tribunes that it was their determination that the consuls should bow to the will of the senate; if they offered any further opposition to the unanimous decision of that most august order, they, the tribunes, would order them to be thrown into
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> prison.<note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="ed">This marks an important stage in the growth of the tribunitian power. Hitherto they could only control the consul's acts by inhibition and the protection of those who refused obedience to the consul's orders; now they assumed executive power. But, illegal though the proceeding would have been, they had the support of all the citizens &mdash;plebs and senate alike &mdash;hence the resistance of the consuls was futile.</note> The consuls preferred defeat at the hands of the tribunes rather than at those of the senate. If, they said, the consuls could be coerced by the tribunes in virtue of their authority, and even sent to prison &mdash;and what more than this had ever a private citizen to fear? &mdash;then the senate had betrayed the rights and privileges of the highest office in the State, and made an ignominious surrender, putting the consulship under the yoke of
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the tribunitian power. They could not even agree as to who should nominate the Dictator, so they cast lots and the lot fell to T. Quinctius. He nominated A. Postumius Tubertus, his father-in-law, a stern and resolute commander. The Dictator named L. Julius as the Master
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> of the Horse.</p><p>Orders were issued for a levy to be raised and for all business, legal and otherwise, to be suspended in the City, except the preparations for war. The investigation of claims for exemption from military service was postponed till the end of the war, so even in doubtful cases men preferred to give in their names. The Hernici and the Latins were ordered to furnish troops; both nations carried out the Dictator's orders most zealously.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>All these preparations were completed with extraordinary despatch. The consul Gn. Julius was left in charge of the defences of the City; L. Julius, the Master of the Horse, took command of the reserves to meet any sudden emergency, and to prevent operations from being delayed through inadequacy of supplies at the front.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As the war was such a serious one, the Dictator vowed, in the form of words prescribed by the Pontifex Maximus, A. Cornelius, to celebrate the Great Games if he were victorious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He formed the army into two divisions, one of which he assigned to the consul Quinctius, and their joint force advanced up to the enemies' position.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As they saw that the hostile camps were separated by a short distance from each other, they also formed separate camps, about a mile from the enemy, the Dictator fixing his in the direction of Tusculum, the consul nearer Lanuvium.</p><p>The four armies had thus separate entrenched positions,
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> with a plain between them broad enough not only for small skirmishes, but for both armies to be drawn out in battle order.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Ever since the camps had confronted each other there had been no cessation of small fights, and the Dictator was quite content for his men to match their strength against the enemy, in order that through the issues of these contests they might entertain the hope of a decisive and final victory. The enemy, hopeless of winning a regular battle, determined to stake everything on the chances of a night attack on the consul's camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The shout which suddenly arose not only startled the consul's outposts and the whole army, but even woke the Dictator.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Everything depended on prompt action; the consul showed equal courage and coolness; part of his troops reinforced the guards at the camp gates, the rest lined the entrenchments. As the Dictator's camp was not attacked, it was easier for him to see what had to be done. Supports were at once sent to the consul under Sp. Postumius Albus, lieutenant-general, and the Dictator in person with a portion of his force made for a place away from the actual fighting, from which to make an attack on the enemy's rear.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He left Q. Sulpicius, lieutenant-general, in charge of the camp, and gave the command of the cavalry to M. Fabius, lieutenant-general, with orders not to move their troops before daylight, as it was difficult to handle them in the confusion of a night attack.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Besides taking every measure which any other general of prudence and energy would have taken under the circumstances, the Dictator gave a striking instance of his courage and generalship, which deserves especial praise, for, on ascertaining that the enemy had left his camp with the greater part of his force, he sent M. Geganius with some picked cohorts to storm it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The defenders were thinking more of the issue of their comrades' dangerous enterprise than of taking precautions for their own safety, even their outposts and picket-duty were neglected, and he stormed and captured the camp almost before the enemy realised that it was attacked.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the Dictator saw the smoke &mdash;the agreed signal &mdash;he called out that the enemy's camp was taken, and ordered the news to be spread everywhere.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was now growing light and everything lay open to view. Fabius had delivered his attack with the cavalry and the consul had made a sortie against the enemy, who were now wavering.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Dictator from the other side had attacked the second line of reserves, and whilst the enemy faced about to meet the sudden charges and confused shouts, he had thrown his victorious horse and foot across their front.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were now hemmed in, and would, to a man, have paid the penalty for renewing the war, had not a Volscian, Vettius Messius, a man more distinguished by his exploits than by his pedigree, remonstrated loudly with his comrades, who were being rolled up into a helpless mass. <q direct="unspecified">Are you going,</q> he shouted, <q direct="unspecified">to make yourselves a mark for the enemies' javelins, unresisting, defenceless?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Why then have you got arms, why did you begin an unprovoked war; you who are ever turbulent in peace and laggards in war? What do you expect to gain by standing here? Do you suppose that some deity will protect you and snatch you out of danger? A path must be made by the sword.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Come on in the way you see me go. You who are hoping to visit your homes and parents and wives and children, come with me. It is not a wall or a stockade which is in your way; arms are met by arms. Their equals in courage, you are their superiors by force of necessity, which is the last and greatest weapon.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then rushed forward and his men followed him, raising again their battle-shout, and flung the weight of their charge where Postumius Albus had interposed his cohorts. They forced the victors back, until the Dictator came up to his retreating men, and all the battle rolled to this part of the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The fortunes of the enemy rested solely on Messius. Many were wounded, many killed in all directions. By this time even the Roman generals were not unhurt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Postumius, whose skull was fractured by a stone, was the only one who left the field. The Dictator was wounded in the shoulder, Fabius had his thigh almost pinned to his horse, the consul had his arm cut off, but they refused to retire while the battle was undecided.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Messius with a body of their bravest troops charged through heaps of slain and was carried on to the Volscian camp, which was not yet taken; the entire army followed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul followed them up in their disordered flight as far as the stockade and began to attack the camp, whilst the Dictator brought up his troops to the other side of it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The storming of the camp was just as furious as the battle had been. It is recorded that the consul actually threw a standard inside the stockade to make the soldiers more eager to assault it, and in endeavouring to recover it the first breach was made. When the stockade was torn down and the Dictator had now carried the fighting into the camp, the enemy began everywhere to throw away their arms and surrender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After the capture of this camp, the enemy, with the exception of the senators, were all sold as slaves. A part of the booty comprised the plundered property of the Latins and Hernicans, and after being identified, was restored to them, the rest the Dictator sold <q direct="unspecified">under the spear</q>.<note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="ed"><emph>under the spear.</emph> The sale of property captured in war was conducted by the general commanding, with a spear fixed upright beside him, as a sign that it had been won by the spear. The usage was after-wards extended to all sales of government property. The mode of selling corresponded to our sale by auction.</note> After placing the consul in command of the camp, he entered the City in triumph and then laid down his dictatorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some writers have cast a gloom over the memory of this glorious dictatorship by handing down a tradition that the Dictator's son, who, seeing an opportunity for fighting to advantage, had left his post against orders, was beheaded by his father, though victorious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I prefer to disbelieve the story, and am at liberty to do so, as opinions differ. An argument against it is that such cruel displays of authority are called <q direct="unspecified">Manlian</q> not <q direct="unspecified">Postumian,</q> for it is the first man who practiced such severity to whom the stigma would have been affixed. Moreover, Manlius received the soubriquet of <q direct="unspecified">Imperiosus</q>; Postumius was not distinguished by any invidious epithet.<note anchored="yes" n="18" resp="ed"><emph>Manlius.</emph> The incident alluded to is recorded by Livy in his eighth book.

His son, who was also called Titus Manlius, provoked by the challenge of a Tusculan officer, engaged him in single combat and slew him. In spite of this brilliant display of courage his father ordered him, as a punishment for his disobedience, to be beheaded. <q direct="unspecified">Manlian orders</q> became subsequently a proverbial expression for intolerably harsh military discipline.</note></p><p>The other consul, C.

Envoys came from the Aequi to ask from the senate a treaty as between independent States; instead of this they were offered peace on condition they acknowledged the supremacy of Rome; they obtained a truce for eight
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> years. After the defeat which the Volscians had sustained on Algidus, their State was distracted by obstinate and bitter quarrels between the advocates of war and those of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> peace. There was quiet for Rome in all
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> quarters. The tribunes were preparing a popular measure to fix the scale of fines, but one of their body betrayed the fact to the consuls, who anticipated the tribunes by bringing it in themselves.</p><p>The new consuls were L. Sergius Fidenas, for the second time, and Hostius Lucretius Tricipitinus. Nothing worth recording took place in their
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> consulship.</p><p>They were followed by A. Cornelius Cossus, and T. Quinctius Poenus for the second time. The Veientines made inroads into the Roman territory, and it was rumoured that some of the Fidenates had taken part in
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> them. L. Sergius, Q. Servilius, and Mamercus Aemilius were commissioned to investigate the affair. Some were interned at Ostia, as they were unable to account satisfactorily for their absence from Fidenae at that
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> time. The number of colonists was increased, and the lands of those who had perished in the war were assigned to them.</p><p>Very great distress was caused this year by a
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> drought. Not only was there an absence of water from the heavens, but the earth, through lack of its natural moisture, barely sufficed to keep the rivers flowing. In some cases the want of water made the cattle die of thirst round the dried-up springs and brooks, in others they were carried off by the
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> mange. This disease spread to the men who had been in contact with them; at first it attacked the slaves and agriculturists, then the City was infected. Nor was it only the body that was affected by the pest, the minds of men also became a prey to all kinds of superstitions, mostly foreign
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> ones. Pretended soothsayers went about introducing new modes of sacrificing, and did a profitable trade amongst the victims of
								<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> superstition, until at last the sight of strange un-Roman modes of propitiating the wrath of the gods in the streets and chapels brought home to the leaders of the commonwealth the public scandal which was being
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> caused. The aediles were instructed to see to it that none but Roman deities were worshipped, nor in any other than the established fashion.</p><p>Hostilities<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Veii.</note> with the Veientines were postponed till the following year, when Caius Servilius Ahala and L. Papirius Mugilanus were the
									<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> consuls. Even then the formal declaration of war and the despatch of troops were delayed on religious grounds; it was considered necessary that the fetials should first be sent to demand
									<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> satisfaction. There had been recent battles with the Veientines at Nomentum and Fidenae, and a truce had been made, not a lasting peace, but before the days of truce had expired they had renewed hostilities. The fetials, however, were sent, but when they presented their demands, in accordance with ancient usage<note anchored="yes" n="19" resp="ed">For a full descripton of this, see Book I, chap. xxxii.</note>, they were refused a
									<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> hearing. A question then arose whether war should be declared by the mandate of the people, or whether a resolution passed by the senate was sufficient. The tribunes threatened to stop the levying of troops and succeeded in forcing the consul Quinctius to refer the question to the
									<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> people. The centuries decided unanimously for war. The plebs gained a further advantage in preventing the election of consuls for the next year.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Four consular tribunes were elected-T. Quinctius Poenus, who had been consul, C. Furius, M. Postumius, and A. Cornelius Cossus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Cossus was warden of the City, the other three after completing the levy advanced against Veii, and they showed how useless a divided command is in war. By each insisting on his own plans, when they all held different views, they gave the enemy his opportunity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For whilst the army was perplexed by different orders, some giving the signal to advance, whilst the others ordered a retreat, the Veientines seized the opportunity for an attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Breaking into a disorderly flight, the Romans sought refuge in their camp which was close by; they incurred more disgrace than loss. The commonwealth, unaccustomed to defeat, was plunged in grief; they hated the tribunes and demanded a Dictator; all their hopes rested on that. Here too a religious impediment was met with, as a Dictator could only be nominated by a consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The augurs were consulted and removed the difficulty. A. Cornelius nominated Mamercus Aemilius as Dictator, he himself was appointed by him Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This proved how powerless the action of the censors was to prevent a member of a family unjustly degraded from being entrusted with supreme control when once the fortunes of the State demanded real courage and ability.<note anchored="yes" n="20" resp="ed">This was that Mamercus who, now nominated Dictator, had been degraded by the censors.</note></p><p>Elated by their success, the Veientines sent envoys round to the cantons of Etruria, boasting that three Roman generals had been defeated by them in a single battle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As, however, they could not induce the national council to join them, they collected from all quarters volunteers who were attracted by the prospect of booty.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Fidenates alone decided to take part in the war, and as though they thought it impious to begin war otherwise than with a crime, they stained their weapons with the blood of the new colonists, as they had previously with the blood of the Roman ambassadors.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then they joined the Veientines. The chiefs of the two peoples consulted whether they should make Veii or Fidenae the base of operations. Fidenae appeared the more suitable; the Veientines accordingly crossed the Tiber and transferred the war to Fidenae.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Capture and Destruction of Fidenae</note>Very great was the alarm in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The army, demoralised by its ill-success, was recalled from Veii; an entrenched camp was formed in front of the Colline gate, the walls were manned, the shops and law courts closed, and a cessation of all business in the Forum ordered. The whole City wore the appearance of a camp.</p><p>The Dictator despatched criers through the streets to summon the anxious citizens to an Assembly.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they were gathered together he reproached them for allowing their feelings to be so swayed by slight changes of fortune that, after meeting with an insignificant reverse, due not to the courage of the enemy or the cowardice of the Roman army, but simply to want of harmony amongst the generals, they should be in a state of panic over the Veientines, who had been defeated six times, and Fidenae, which had been captured almost more frequently than it had been attacked.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Both the Romans and the enemy were the same that they had been for so many centuries, their courage, their prowess, their arms were what they had always been. They had as Dictator the same Mamercus Aemilius who at Nomentum defeated the combined forces of Veii and Fidenae supported by the Faliscans;
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the Master of the Horse would in future battles be the same A. Cornelius who killed Lars Tolumnius, king of Veii, before the eyes of the two armies and carried the <foreign lang="la">spolia opima</foreign> to the temple of Jupiter Feretrius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They must take up arms, remembering that on their side were triumphs and the spoils of victory, on the side of the enemy, the crime against the law of nations in the assassination of the ambassadors and the massacre of the colonists at Fidenae in a time of peace, a broken truce, a seventh unsuccessful revolt &mdash; remembering all this, they must take up arms.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When once they were in touch with their enemy, he was confident that the guilt-stained foe would not long rejoice over the disgrace that had overtaken the Roman army, and the people of Rome would see how much better service was rendered to the republic by those who
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> had, for the third time, nominated him Dictator, than by those who had cast a slur upon his second dictatorship because he had deprived the censors of their autocratic power.</p><p>After reciting
							<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the usual vows, he marched out and fixed his camp a mile and a half on this side of Fidenae, with the hills on his right and the Tiber on his left.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He ordered T. Quinctius to secure the hills and to seize, by a concealed movement, the ridge in the enemies' rear.</p><p>On the following day, the Etruscans advanced to battle in high spirits at their success the previous day, which had been due rather to good luck than good fighting. After waiting a short time till the scouts reported that Quinctius had gained the height near the citadel of Fidenae, the Dictator ordered the attack and led the infantry at a quick double against the enemy.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He gave instructions to the Master of the Horse not to begin fighting till he got orders; when he needed the assistance of the cavalry he would give him the signal, then he must take his part in the action, inspired by the memory of his combat with Tolumnius, of the <foreign lang="la">spolia opima</foreign>, and of Romulus and Jupiter Feretrius.
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The legions charged with great impetuosity. The Romans expressed their burning hatred in words as much as in deeds; they called the Fidenates <q direct="unspecified">traitors,</q> the Veientines <q direct="unspecified">brigands,</q> <q direct="unspecified">breakers of truces,</q> <q direct="unspecified">stained with the horrible murder of the ambassadors and the blood of Roman colonists,</q> <q direct="unspecified">faithless as allies, cowardly as soldiers.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The enemy were shaken at the very first onset, when suddenly the gates of Fidenae were flung open and a strange army sallied forth, never seen or heard of before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> An immense multitude, armed with firebrands, and all waving blazing torches, rushed like men possessed on the Roman line. For a moment this extraordinary mode of fighting put the Romans into a fright.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Then the Dictator called up the Master of the Horse with his cavalry, and sent to order Quinctius back from the hills, whilst he himself, encouraging his men, rode up to the left wing, which looked more like a conflagration than a body of combatants, and had given way through sheer terror at the flames.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He shouted to them: <q direct="unspecified">Are you overcome with smoke, like a swarm of bees? Will you let an unarmed enemy drive you from your ground? Will you not put the fire out with your swords?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If you must fight with fire, not with arms, will you not snatch those torches away and attack them with their own weapons? Come! remember the name of Rome and the courage you have inherited from your fathers; turn this fire upon the enemies' city, and destroy with its own flames the Fidenae which you could not conciliate by your kindness.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The blood of ambassadors and colonists, your fellow-countrymen, and the devastation of your borders call upon you to do this.</q></p><p>At the Dictator's command the whole line advanced; some of the torches were caught as they were thrown, others were wrenched from the bearers; both armies were armed with fire.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Master of the Horse, too, on his part, invented a new mode of fighting for his cavalry.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He ordered his men to take the bits off the horses, and, giving his own horse his head and putting spurs to it, he was carried into the midst of the flames, whilst the other horses, urged into a hard gallop, carried their riders against the enemy. The dust they raised, mixed with the smoke, blinded both horses and men. The sight which had terrified the infantry had no terrors for the horses.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Wherever the cavalry moved they left the slain in heaps.</p><p>At this moment fresh shouts were heard, creating astonishment in both armies. The Dictator called out that Quinctius and his men had attacked the enemy in the rear, and on the shouts being renewed, he pressed his own attack with more vigour.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When the two bodies in two distinct attacks had forced the Etruscans back both in front and rear and hemmed them in, so that there was no way of escape either to their camp or to the hills &mdash;for in that direction the fresh enemy had intercepted them &mdash;and the horses, with their reins loose, were carrying their riders about in all directions, most of the Veientines made a wild rush for the Tiber; the survivors amongst the Fidenates made for their city.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The flight of the terrified Veientines carried them into the midst of slaughter, some were killed on the banks, others were driven into the river and swept away by the current; even good swimmers were carried down by wounds and fright and exhaustion, few out of the many got across.
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The other body made their way through their camp to their city with the Romans in close pursuit, especially Quinctius and his men, who had just come down from the hills, and having arrived towards the close of the struggle, were fresher for the work.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The latter entered the gates pell-mell with the enemy, and as soon as they had mounted the walls they signalled to their friends that the city was taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Dictator had now reached the enemies' abandoned camp, and his soldiers were anxious to disperse in quest of booty, but when he saw the signal he reminded them that there was richer spoil in the city, and led them up to the gate. Once within the walls he proceeded to the citadel, toward which he saw the crowd of fugitives rushing.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The slaughter in the city was not less than there had been in the battle, until, throwing down their arms, they surrendered to the Dictator and begged that at least their lives might be spared.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The city and camp were plundered. The following day the cavalry and centurions each received one prisoner, selected by lot, as their slave, those who had shown conspicuous gallantry, two; the rest were sold <q direct="unspecified">under the chaplet.</q><note anchored="yes" n="21" resp="ed">When prisoners of war were to be sold as slaves, chaplets or garlands were placed on their heads to indicate their destination. The proceeds of the sale went into the national exchequer.</note></p><p>The Dictator led back in triumph to Rome his victorious army laden with spoil.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After ordering the Master of the Horse to resign his office, he resigned office himself on the sixteenth day after his nomination, surrendering amidst peace
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the sovereign power which he had assumed at a time of war and danger.</p><p>Some of the annalists have recorded a naval engagement with the Veientines at Fidenae, an incident as difficult as it is incredible.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even to-day the river is not broad enough for this, and we learn from ancient writers that it was narrower then. Possibly, in their desire for a vain-glorious inscription, as often happens, they magnified a gathering of ships to prevent the passage of the river into a naval victory.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Peace abroad &mdash;Domestic Politics.</note> following year had for consular tribunes A. Sempronius Atratinus, L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, L. Furius Medullinus, and L. Horatius
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Barbatus. A truce for eighteen years was granted to the Veientines and one for three years to the Aequi, though they had asked for a longer one. There was also a respite from civic
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> disturbances.</p><p>The following year, though not marked by either foreign war or domestic troubles, was rendered memorable by the celebration of the Games vowed on the occasion of the war seven years before, which were carried out with great magnificence by the consular tribunes, and attended by large numbers from the surrounding
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> cities. The consular tribunes were Ap. Claudius Crassus, Spurius Nautius Rutilus, L. Sergius Fidenas, and Sex. Julius Julus. The spectacle was made more attractive to the visitors by the courteous reception which it had been publicly decided to give
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> them.</p><p>When the Games were over, the tribunes of the plebs began to deliver inflammatory
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> harangues. They reproached the populace for allowing their stupid admiration of those whom they really hated to keep them in perpetual servitude. Not only did they lack the courage to claim their share in the chance of preferment to the consulship, but even in the election of consular tribunes, which was open to both patricians and plebeians, they never thought of their tribunes or their
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> party. They need be no longer surprised that no one interested himself in the welfare of the plebs. Toil and danger were incurred for those objects from which profit and honour might be expected. There was nothing which men would not attempt if rewards were held out proportionate to the greatness of the
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> effort. But that any tribune of the plebs should rush blindly into contests which involved enormous risks and brought no advantage, which he might be certain would make the patricians whom he opposed persecute him with relentless fury, whilst amongst the plebeians on whose behalf he fought he would not be in the slightest degree more honoured, was a thing neither to be expected nor demanded. Great honours made great
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> men. When the plebeians began to be respected, every plebeian would respect himself. Surely they might now try the experiment in one or two cases, to prove whether any plebeian is capable of holding high office, or whether it would be little short of a miracle for any one sprung from the plebs to be at the same time a strong and energetic
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> man. After a desperate fight, they had secured the election of military tribunes with consular powers, for which plebeians were eligible. Men of tried ability, both at home and in the field, became candidates. For the first few years they were knocked about, rejected, treated with derision by the patricians; at last they declined to expose themselves to these
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> affronts. They saw no reason why a law should not be repealed which simply legalised what would never happen. They would have less to be ashamed of in the injustice of the law than in being passed over in the elections as though unworthy to hold office.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Harangues of this sort were listened to with approval, and some were induced to stand for a consular tribuneship, each of them promising to bring in some measure in the interest of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Hopes were held out of a division of the State domain and the formation of colonies, whilst money was to be raised for the payment of the soldiers by a tax on the occupiers of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the public land.</p><p>The consular tribunes waited till the usual exodus from the City allowed a meeting of the senate to be held in the absence of the tribunes of the plebs, the members who were in the country being recalled by private notice.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A resolution was passed that owing to rumours of an invasion of the Hernican territory by the Volscians the consular tribunes should go and find out what was happening, and that at the forthcoming elections consuls should be chosen.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On their departure they left Appius Claudius, the son of the decemvir, to act as warden of the City, a young man of energy, and imbued from his infancy with a hatred of the plebs and its tribunes. The tribunes had nothing on which to raise a contest either with the consular tribunes, who were absent, the authors of the decree, or with Appius, as the matter had been settled.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The seiure of Capua &mdash;War with the Volscians.</note> consuls elected were C. Sempronius Atratinus and Q. Fabius Vibulanus.</p><p>There is recorded under this year an incident which occurred in a foreign country, but still important enough to be mentioned, namely, the capture of Volturnus, an Etruscan city, now called Capua, by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Samnites. It is said to have been called Capua from their general, but it is more probable that it was so called from its situation in a champaign country (<foreign lang="la">campus</foreign>). It was after the Etruscans, weakened by a long war, had granted them a joint occupancy of the city and its territory that they seized
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> it. During a festival, whilst the old inhabitants were overcome with wine and sleep, the new settlers attacked them in the night and massacred them.</p><p>After the proceedings described in the last chapter, the above-named consuls entered on office in the middle of
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> December. By this time intelligence as to the imminence of a Volscian war had been received not only from those who had been sent to investigate, but also from the Latins and Hernicans, whose envoys reported that the Volscians were devoting greater energy than they had ever done before to the selection of their generals and the levying of their
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> forces. The general cry amongst them was that either they must consign all thoughts of war to eternal oblivion and submit to the yoke, or else they must in courage, endurance, and military skill be a match for those with whom they were fighting for
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> supremacy.</p><p>These reports were anything but groundless, but not only did the senate treat them with comparative indifference, but C. Sempronius, to whom that field of operations had fallen, imagined that as he was leading the troops of a victorious people against those whom they had vanquished, the fortune of war could never
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> change. Trusting to this, he displayed such rashness and negligence in all his measures that there was more of the Roman discipline in the Volscian army than there was in the Roman army
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> itself.</p><p>As often happens, fortune waited upon desert. In the very first battle Sempronius made his dispositions without plan or forethought, the fighting line was not strengthened by reserves, nor were the cavalry placed in a suitable
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> position. The war-cries were the first indication as to how the action was going; that of the enemy was more animated and sustained; on the side of the Romans the irregular, intermittent shout, growing feebler at each repetition, betrayed their waning
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> courage. Hearing this, the enemy attacked with greater vigour, pushed with their shields and brandished their swords. On the other side their helmets drooped as the men looked round for supports; men wavered and faltered and crowded together for mutual protection; at one moment the standards while holding their ground were abandoned by the front rank, the next they retreated between their respective
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> maniples.<note anchored="yes" n="22" resp="ed">The standard-bearers were posted immediately behind the front line; when this was forced back they retired to the rear of the maniples immediately behind them.</note> As yet there was no actual flight, no decided victory.

The senior <foreign lang="la">decurio</foreign> in each squadron commanded it, the others being his subordinates.</note>, retrieved by his ready courage the desperate position of affairs. He shouted to the cavalry to leap down from their horses if they wished the commonwealth to be safe, and all the troops of cavalry followed his direction as though it were the order of the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <q direct="unspecified">Unless,</q> he continued, <q direct="unspecified">this bucklered cohort check the enemies' attack, there is an end of our sovereignty.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This stirring appeal was answered by shouts of approval, and he strode on, holding his spear erect. Wherever they went they forced their way; holding their bucklers in front, they made for that part of the field where they saw their comrades in the greatest difficulty;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> in every direction where their onset carried them, they restored the battle, and undoubtedly, if so small a body could have attacked the entire line at once, the enemy would have been routed.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As it was impossible to check them in any direction, the Volscian commander gave a signal for a passage to be opened for this novel cohort of targeteers, until by the impetus of their charge they should be cut off from the main body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As soon as this happened, they were unable to force their way back in the same directional they had advanced, as the enemy had massed in the greatest force there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the consul and the Roman legions no longer saw anywhere the men who had just been the shield of the whole army, they endeavoured at all risks to prevent so many brave fellows from being surrounded and overwhelmed by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Volscians formed two fronts, in one direction they met the attack of the consul and the legions, from the opposite front they pressed upon Tempanius and his troopers. As these latter after repeated attempts found themselves unable to break through to their main body, they took possession of some rising ground, and forming a circle defended themselves, not without inflicting losses on the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The battle did not terminate till nightfall. The consul too kept the enemy engaged without any slackening
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> of the fight as long as any light remained.</p><p>Night at last put an end to the indecisive action, and through ignorance as to the result such a panic seized each of the camps that both armies, thinking themselves defeated, left their wounded behind and the greater part of their baggage and retired to the nearest hills.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The eminence, however, which Tempanius had seized was surrounded till after midnight, when it was announced to the enemy that their camp was abandoned. Looking upon this as a proof that their army was defeated, they fled in all directions wherever their fears carried them in the darkness.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Tempanius, fearing a surprise, kept his men together till daylight. Then he came down with a few of his men to reconnoitre, and after ascertaining from the enemies' wounded that the Volscian camp was abandoned, he joyfully called his men down and made his way to the Roman camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Here he found a dreary solitude; everything presented the same miserable spectacle as in the enemies' camp. Before the discovery of their mistake could bring the Volscians back again, he collected all the wounded he could carry with him, and as he did not know what direction the Dictator had taken, proceeded by the most direct road to the City.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rumours<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Excitement in Rome.</note> of an unfavourable battle and the abandonment of the camp had already been brought. Most of all was the fate of the cavalry deplored, the whole community felt the loss as keenly as their families.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was general alarm throughout the City, and the consul Fabius was posting pickets before the gates when cavalry were descried in the distance. Their appearance created alarm, as it was doubtful who they were; presently they were recognised, and the fears gave place to such great joy that the City rang with shouts of congratulation at the cavalry having returned safe and victorious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> People flocked into the streets out of houses which had just before been in mourning and filled with wailings for the dead; anxious mothers and wives, forgetting decorum in their joy, ran to meet the column of horsemen, each embracing her own friends and hardly able

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The speech which Tempanius made in reply is said to have been unpolished, but marked by soldierly dignity, free from the vanity of self-praise, and showing no pleasure in the inculpation of others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <q direct="unspecified">It was not,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">a soldier's place to criticise his commander, or judge how much military skill he possessed; that was for the Roman people to do when they elected him consul.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They must not therefore demand of him what tactics a commander should adopt, or what military capacity a consul should display; these were matters which even great minds and intellects would have to weigh very carefully. He could, however, relate what he saw.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Before he was cut off from the main body he saw the consul fighting in the front line, encouraging his men, going to and fro between the Roman standards and the missiles of the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After he, the speaker, was carried out of sight of his comrades, he knew from the noise and shouting that the combat was kept up till night; and he did not believe that a way could have been made to the eminence which he had occupied, owing to the numbers of the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Where the army was he knew not; he thought that as he found protection for himself and his men at a moment of extreme peril in the nature of the ground, so the consul had selected a stronger position for his camp, to save his army.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He did not believe that the Volscians were in any better plight than the Romans; the varying fortunes of the fight and the fall of night had led to all sorts of mistakes on both sides.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He then begged them not to keep him any longer, as he was exhausted with his exertions and his wounds, and thereupon was dismissed amidst loud praises of his modesty no less than his courage.</p><p>Whilst this was going on the consul had reached the Labican road and was at the chapel of <foreign lang="la">Quies</foreign>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Wagons and draught-cattle were despatched thither from the City for the conveyance of the army, who were worn out by the battle and night march. Shortly afterwards the consul entered the City, quite as anxious to give Tempanius the praise he so
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> well deserved as to remove the blame from his own shoulders.</p><p>Whilst the citizens were mourning over their reverses and angry with their generals, M. Postumius, who as consular tribune had commanded at Veii, was brought before them for trial.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He was sentenced to a fine of 10,000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>.</q> His colleague, T. Quinctius, who had been successful against the Volscians under the auspices of the Dictator Postumius Tubertus, and at Fidenae as second in command under the other Dictator, Mam. Aemilius, threw all the blame for the disaster at Veii on his colleague who had been previously sentenced. He was acquitted by the unanimous vote of the tribes.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is said that the memory of his venerated father, Cincinnatus, stood him in good stead, as also did the now aged Capitolinus Quinctius, who earnestly entreated them not to allow him, with so brief a span of life left to him, to be the bearer of such sad tidings to Cincinnatus.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The plebs elected as their tribunes, in their absence, Sex. Tempanius, A. Sellius, Sextus Antistius, and Sp. Icilius, all of whom had, on the advice of Tempanius, been selected by the cavalry to act as centurions.<note anchored="yes" n="24" resp="ed">The cavalry had dismounted in the battle and formed themselves into maniples of infantry, their officerrs for the time being therefore acted as centurions.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The exasperation against Sempronius made the very name of consul offensive, the senate therefore ordered consular tribunes to be elected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their names were L. Manlius Capitolinus, Q. Antonius Merenda, and L. Papirius Mugilanus.</p><p>At the very beginning of the year, L. Hortensius, a tribune of the plebs, appointed a day for the trial of C. Sempronius, the consul of the previous year. His four colleagues begged him, publicly, in full view of the Roman people, not to prosecute their unoffending commander, against whom nothing but ill-luck could be alleged.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Hortensius was angry, for he looked upon this as an attempt to test his resolution, he regarded the entreaties of the tribunes as meant simply to save appearances, and
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> he was convinced that it was not to these the consul was trusting, but to their interposing their veto. Turning to Sempronius he asked: <q direct="unspecified">Where is your patrician spirit, and the courage which is supported by the consciousness of innocence?
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> An ex-consul actually sheltering under the wing of the tribunes!</q> Then he addressed his colleagues: <q direct="unspecified">You, what will you do, if I carry the prosecution through?
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Are you going to deprive the people of their jurisdiction and subvert the power of the tribunes?</q> They replied that the authority of the people was supreme over Sempronius and over everybody else;
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> they had neither the will nor the power to do away with the people's right to judge, but if their entreaties on behalf of their commander, who was a second father to them, proved unavailing, they would appear by his side in suppliant garb.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then Hortensius replied: <q direct="unspecified">The Roman plebs shall not see its tribunes in mourning; I drop all proceedings against C. Sempronius, since he has succeeded, during his command, in becoming so dear to his soldiers.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Both plebeians and patricians were pleased with the loyal affection of the four tribunes, and quite as much so with the way in which Hortensius had yielded to their just remonstrances.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Aequi.</note> consuls for the next year were Numerius Fabius Vibulanus and T. Quinctius Capitolinus, the son of Capitolinus.</p><p>The Aequi had claimed the doubtful victory of the Volscians as their own, but fortune no longer favoured them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The campaign against them fell to Fabius, but nothing worth mention took place. Their dispirited army had but shown itself when it was routed and put to a disgraceful flight, without the consul gaining much glory from it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A triumph was in consequence refused him, but as he had removed the disgrace of Sempronius' defeat he was allowed to enjoy an ovation.<note anchored="yes" n="25" resp="ed"><emph>ovation</emph> &mdash;See note 8, Book III.</note> As, contrary to expectation, the war had been brought to a close with less fighting than had been feared, so in the City the calm was broken by unlooked-for and serious disturbances between the plebs and the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> patricians. It began with the doubling of the number of quaestors. It was proposed to create in addition to the two City quaestors two others to assist the consuls in the various duties arising from a state of war. When this proposal was laid by the consuls before the senate and had received the warm support of that body, the tribunes of the plebs insisted that half the number should be taken from the plebeians; up to that time only patricians had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> chosen. This demand was at first opposed most resolutely by the consuls and the senate; afterwards they yielded so far as to allow the same freedom of choice in the election of quaestors as the people already enjoyed in that of consular tribunes. As they gained nothing by this, they dropped the proposal to augment the number
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> altogether. The tribunes took it up, and many revolutionary proposals, including the Agrarian Law, were set on foot in quick succession. In consequence of these commotions the senate wanted consuls to be elected rather than tribunes, but owing to the veto of the tribunes a formal resolution could not be carried, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> on the expiry of the consuls' year of office an interregnum followed, and even this did not happen without a tremendous struggle, for the tribunes vetoed any meeting of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> patricians.</p><p>The greater part of the following year was wasted in contests between the new tribunes of the plebs and some of the interreges. At one time the tribunes would intervene to prevent the patricians from meeting together to appoint an interrex, at another they would interrupt the interrex and prevent him from obtaining a decree for the election of
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> consuls. At last L. Papirius Mugilanus, who had been made interrex, sternly rebuked the senate and the tribunes, and reminded them that upon the truce with Veii and the dilatoriness of the Aequi, and upon these alone, depended the safety of the commonwealth, which was deserted and forgotten by men, but protected by the providential care of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> gods. Should any alarm of war sound from that quarter, was it their wish that the State should be taken by surprise while without any patrician magistrate; that there should be no army, no general to enrol
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> one? Were they going to repel a foreign war by a civil one? If both these should come together, the destruction of Rome could hardly be averted even with the help of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> gods. Let them rather try to establish concord by making concessions on both sides-the patricians by allowing military tribunes to be elected instead of consuls; the tribunes of the plebs by not interfering with the liberty of the people to elect the four quaestors from patricians or plebeians indiscriminately.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The election of consular tribunes was the first to be held. They were all patricians; L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, for the third time, L. Furius Medullinus, for the second, M. Manlius, and A. Sempronius Atratinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The last-named conducted the election of the quaestors. Amongst other plebeian candidates were the son of Antistius, tribune of the plebs, and a brother of Sextus Pompilius, another tribune. Their authority and interest were not, however, strong enough to prevent the voters from preferring on the ground of their high birth those whose fathers and grandfathers they had seen in the consul's chair.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All the tribunes of the plebs were furious, Pompilius and Antistius, more especially, were incensed at the defeat of their relations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <q direct="unspecified">What,</q> they angrily exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">is the meaning of all this? In spite of our good offices, in spite of the wrongs done by the patricians, with all the freedom you now enjoy of exercising powers you did not possess before, not a single member of the plebs has been raised to the quaestorship, to say nothing of the consular tribuneship!
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The appeals of a father on behalf of a son, of a brother on behalf of a brother, have been unavailing, though they are tribunes, invested with an inviolable authority to protect your liberties. There has certainly been dishonesty somewhere; A. Sempronius has shown more adroitness than straightforwardness.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They accused him of having kept their men out of office by illegal means. As they could not attack him directly, protected as he was by his innocence and his official position, they turned their resentment against Caius Sempronius, the uncle of Atratinus, and having obtained the support of their colleague, M. Canuleius,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> they impeached him upon the ground of the disgrace incurred in the Volscian war.</p><p>These same tribunes frequently mooted the question in the senate of a distribution of the public domain, a proposal which C. Sempronius always stoutly resisted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They thought, and rightly as the event proved, that when the day of trial came, he would either abandon his opposition and so lose influence with the patricians, or by persisting in it give offence to the plebeians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He chose the latter, and preferred to incur the odium of his opponents and injure his own cause than prove false to the cause of the State. He insisted that <q direct="unspecified">there should be no grants of land, which would only increase the influence of the three tribunes; what they wanted now was not land for the plebs, but to wreak their spite upon him.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He, like others, would meet the storm with a stout heart; neither he nor any other citizen ought to stand so high with the senate that any leniency shown to an individual might be disastrous to the commonwealth.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the day of trial came there was no lowering of his tone, he undertook his own defence, and though the patricians tried every means to soften the plebeians, he was condemned to pay a fine of 15,000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>.</q></p><p>In this same year Postumia, a Vestal virgin, had to answer a charge of unchastity.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Though innocent, she had given grounds for suspicion through her gay attire and unmaidenly freedom of manner. After she had been remanded and finally acquitted, the Pontifex Maximus, in the name of the whole college of priests, ordered her to abstain from
							<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> frivolity and to study sanctity rather than smartness in her appearance.</p><p>In the same year, Cumae, at that time held by the Greeks, was captured by the Campanians.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following year had as consular tribunes Agrippa Menenius Lanatus, P. Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Spurius Nautius Rutilus. Thanks to the good fortune of Rome, the year was marked by serious danger more than by actual disaster.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The slaves had formed a plot to fire the City in various spots, and whilst the people were everywhere intent on saving their houses, to take armed possession of the Capitol. Jupiter frustrated their nefarious project; two of their number gave information, and the actual culprits were arrested and punished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The informers received a reward of 10,000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign></q> &mdash;a large sum in those days &mdash;from the public treasury, and their freedom.</p><p>After this the Aequi began to prepare for a renewal of hostilities, and it was reported on good authority at Rome that a new enemy, the Labicans, were forming a coalition with their old foes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The commonwealth had come to look upon hostilities with the Aequi as almost an annual occurrence. Envoys were sent to Labici. The reply they brought back was evasive; it was evident that whilst there were no immediate preparations for war, peace would not last long.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Tusculans were requested to be on the watch for any fresh movement on the part of the Labicans.</p><p>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Aequi.</note> consular tribunes for the following year were Lucius Sergius Fidenas, M. Papirius Mugilanus, and C. Servilius, the son of the Priscus in whose dictatorship Fidenae had been taken.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At the very beginning of their term of office, envoys came from Tusculum and reported that the Labicans had taken up arms and in conjunction with the Aequi had, after ravaging the Tusculan territory, fixed their camp on Algidus.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> War was thereupon proclaimed and the senate decreed that two tribunes should leave for the war, and one remain in charge of the City. This at once led to a quarrel amongst the tribunes. Each urged his superior claims to command in the war and looked down upon the charge of the City as distasteful and inglorious.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Whilst the senators were watching with astonishment this unseemly strife amongst colleagues, Q. Servilius said, <q direct="unspecified">Since no respect is shown either to this House or to the State, the authority of a father shall put an end to this altercation. My son, without having recourse to lots, shall take charge of the City. I trust that those who are so anxious for the command in the war will conduct it in a more considerate and amicable spirit than they have shown in their eagerness to obtain it.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was decided that the levy should not be raised from the whole population indiscriminately; ten tribes were drawn by lot; from these the two tribunes enlisted the men of military age and led them to the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The quarrels which had begun in the City became much more heated in the camp through the same eagerness to secure the command. They agreed on no single point, they fought for their own opinions, each wanted his own plans and orders carried out exclusively, they felt mutual contempt for each other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At length, through the remonstrances and reproofs of the lieutenants-general, matters were so far arranged that they agreed to hold the command in chief on alternate days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When this state of things was reported at Rome it is said that Q. Servilius, taught by years and experience, offered up a solemn prayer that the disagreement of the tribunes might not prove more hurtful to the State than it had been at Veii; then, as though disaster were undoubtedly impending, he urged his son to enrol troops and prepare arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was not a false prophet.</p><p>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Defeat of the Romans.</note> happened to be the turn of L. Sergius to hold command, and the enemy by a pretended flight had drawn his troops on to unfavourable ground close to their camp, in the vain hope of storming it. Then the Aequi made a sudden charge and drove them down a steep valley where numbers were overtaken and killed in what was not so much a flight as a tumbling over each other.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It was with difficulty that they held their camp that day; the next day, after the enemy had surrounded a considerable part of it, they evacuated it in a disgraceful flight through the rear gate.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The commanders and lieutenants-general and as much of the army as remained with the standards made for Tusculum, the others, straggling in all directions through the fields, hurried on to Rome and spread the news of a more serious defeat than had been actually incurred.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was less consternation felt because the result was what every one had feared and the reinforcements which they could look to in the hour of danger had been got ready beforehand by the consular tribune.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> By his orders, after the excitement had been allayed by the inferior magistrates, scouting parties were promptly sent out to reconnoitre, and they reported that the generals and the army were at Tusculum, and that the enemy had not shifted his camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> What did most to restore confidence was the nomination, by a senatorial decree, of Q. Servilius Priscus as Dictator. The citizens had had previous experience of his political foresight in many stormy crises, and the issue of this war afforded a fresh proof, for he alone suspected danger from the differences of the tribunes before the disaster occurred.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He appointed as his Master of the Horse the tribune by whom he had been nominated Dictator, namely, his own son.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This at least is the statement of some authorities, others say that Ahala Servilius was Master of the Horse that year. With his fresh army he proceeded to the seat of war, and after recalling the troops who were at Tusculum, he selected a position for his camp two miles distant from the enemy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Capture of Labici.</note> arrogance and carelessness which the Roman generals had shown had now passed over to the Aequi in the hour of their success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The result appeared in the very first battle. After shaking the enemies' front with a cavalry charge, the Dictator ordered the standards of the legions to be rapidly advanced, and as one of his standard-bearers hesitated, he slew him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So eager were the Romans to engage that the Aequi did not stand the shock. Driven from the field in headlong flight they made for their camp; the storming of the camp took less time and involved less fighting than the actual battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The spoils of the captured camp the Dictator gave up to the soldiers. The cavalry who had pursued the enemy as they fled from the camp brought back intelligence that the whole of the defeated
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> Labicans and a large proportion of the Aequi had fled to Labici.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On the morrow the army marched to Labici, and after the town was completely invested it was captured and plundered.</p><p>After leading his victorious army home, the Dictator laid down his office just a week after he had been appointed. Before the tribunes of the plebs had time to get up an agitation about the division of the Labican territory, the senate in a full meeting passed a resolution that a body of colonists should be settled at Labici.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> One thousand five hundred colonists were sent, and each received two <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="26" resp="ed"><foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign>. &mdash;One and a quarter acres, nearly. The <foreign lang="la">jugerum</foreign>=nearly 5/8 of an acre.</note> of land.</p><p>In the year following the capture of Labici the consular tribunes were Menenius Lanatus, L. Servilius Structus, P. Lucretius Tricipitinus-each for the second time- and Spurius Veturius
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Crassus. For the next year they were A. Sempronius Atratinus-for the third time- and M. Papirius Mugilanus and Sp. Nautius Rutilus- each for the second time. During these two years foreign affairs were quiet, but at home there were contentions over the agrarian laws.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Agrarian Proposals.</note> fomenters of the disturbance were Sp. Maecilius, who was tribune of the plebs for the fourth time, and M. Metilius, tribune for the third time; both had been elected in their absence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They brought forward a measure providing that the territory taken from an enemy should be assigned to individual owners. If this were passed the fortunes of a large number of the nobility would be confiscated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For as the City itself was founded upon foreign soil, it possessed hardly any territory which had not been won by arms, or which had become
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> private property by sale or assignment beyond what the plebeians possessed.<note anchored="yes" n="27" resp="ed">Only land fit for garden tillage or fruit trees was assigned to individual owners, i. e., plebeians. The forests, wastes, and pastures were State lands, i. e., occupied (not owned) by the patricians. As only land for tillage was allotted, a common pasture was absolutely necessary.</note></p><p>There seemed every prospect of a bitter conflict between the plebs and the patricians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consular tribunes, after discussing the matter in the senate and in private gatherings of patricians, were at a loss what to do, when Appius Claudius, the grandson of the old decemvir and the youngest senator present, rose to speak.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He is represented as saying that he was bringing from home an old device well known to his house. His grandfather, Appius Claudius, had pointed out to the senate the only way of breaking down the power of the tribunes, namely, through the interposition of their colleagues' veto.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Men who had risen from the masses were easily induced to change their opinions by the personal authority of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> leaders of the State if only they were addressed in language suitable to the occasion rather than to the rank of the speaker. Their feelings changed with their fortunes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they saw that those of their colleagues who were the first to propose any measure took the whole credit of it with the plebs and left no place for them, they would feel no hesitation in coming over to
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the cause of the senate, and so win the favour not only of the leaders but of the whole order.</p><p>His views met with universal approval; Q. Servilius Priscus was the first to congratulate the youth on his not having degenerated from the old Claudian stock.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The leaders of the senate were charged to persuade as many tribunes as they could to interpose their veto. After the close of the sitting they canvassed the tribunes. By the use of persuasion, warning, and promises, they showed how acceptable that action would be to them individually and to the whole senate.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They succeeded in bringing over six.</p><p>The next day, in accordance with a previous understanding, the attention of the senate was drawn to the agitation which Maecilius and Metilius were causing by proposing a bribe of the worst possible type.
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Speeches were delivered by the leaders of the senate, each in turn declaring that he was unable to suggest any course of action, and saw no other resource but the assistance of the tribunes. To the protection of that power the State in its embarrassment, like a private citizen in his helplessness, fled for succour.
								<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> It was the glory of the tribunes and of the authority they wielded that they possessed as much strength to withstand evil-minded colleagues as to harass the senate and create dissension between the two orders.
								<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Cheers arose from the whole senate and the tribunes were appealed to from every quarter of the House. When silence was restored, those tribunes who had been won over made it clear that since the senate was of opinion that the proposed measure tended to the break-up of the republic, they should interpose their veto on it.
								<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They were formally thanked by the senate.</p><p>The proposers of the measure convened a meeting in which they showered abuse on their colleagues, calling them <q direct="unspecified">traitors to the interests of the plebs</q> and <q direct="unspecified">slaves of the consulars,</q> with other insulting epithets. Then they dropped all further proceedings.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Capture of Bolae &mdash;Assassination of Postumius.</note> consular tribunes for the following year were P. Cornelius Cossus, C. Valerius Potitus, Q. Quinctius Cincinnatus, and Numerius Fabius Vibulanus.</p><p>There would have been two wars this year if the Veientine leaders had not deferred hostilities owing to religious scruples. Their lands had suffered from an inundation of the Tiber chiefly through the destruction of their farm
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> buildings. The Bolani, a people of the same nationality as the Aequi, had made incursions into the adjoining territory of Labici and attacked the newly-settled colonists, in the hope of averting the consequences by receiving the unanimous support of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Aequi. But the defeat they had sustained three years before made them disinclined to render
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> assistance; the Bolani, abandoned by their friends, lost both town and territory after a siege and one trifling engagement in a war which is not even worth
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> recording.</p><p>An attempt was made by L. Sextius, a tribune of the plebs, to carry a measure providing that colonists should be sent to Bolae as they had been to Labici, but it was defeated by the intervention of his colleagues, who made it clear that they would not allow any resolution of the plebs to take effect except on the authorisation of the senate.</p><p>The consular tribunes for the following year were Cnaeus Cornelius Cossus, L. Valerius Potitus, Q. Fabius Vibulanus-for the second time-and M. Postumius
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Regillensis.</p><p>The Aequi recaptured Bolae and strengthened the town by introducing fresh colonists. The war against the Aequi was entrusted to Postumius, a man of violent and obstinate temper, which, however, he displayed more in the hour of victory than during the war. After marching with his hastily-raised army to Bolae and crushing the spirit of the Aequi in some insignificant actions, he at length forced his way into the town. Then he diverted the contest from the enemy to his own
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> fellow-citizens. During the assault he had issued an order that the plunder should go to the soldiers, but after the capture of the town he broke his word. I am led to believe that this was the real ground for the resentment felt by the army rather than that in a city which had been recently sacked and where a new colony had been settled, the amount of booty was less than the tribune had given
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> out. After he had returned to the City on the summons of his colleagues owing to the commotions excited by the tribunes of the plebs, the feeling against him was intensified by a stupid and almost insane utterance in a meeting of the
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Assembly. Sextius was introducing an agrarian law, and stated that one of its provisions was that colonists be settled at Bolae. <q direct="unspecified">Those,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">who had captured Bolae deserved that the city and its territory should belong to them.</q> Postumius exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">It will be a bad thing for my soldiers if they do not keep quiet.</q> This exclamation was quite as offensive to the senators, when they heard of it, as it was to the
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Assembly. The tribune of the plebs was a clever man and not a bad speaker; he had now got amongst his opponents a man of insolent temper and hot tongue, whom he could irritate and provoke into saying things which would bring odium not only upon himself, but upon his cause and upon the whole of his order. There was no one amongst the consular tribunes whom he oftener drew into argument before the Assembly than
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Postumius. After the above quoted coarse and brutal utterance Sextius said, <q direct="unspecified">Do you hear, Quirites, this man threatening his soldiers with punishment, as if they were slaves? Shall this monster appear in your eyes more worthy of his high office than the men who are trying to send you out as colonists to receive as a free gift city and land, and provide a resting-place for your old age; who are fighting gallantly for your interests against such savage and insolent opponents? Now you can begin to wonder why it is that so few take up your cause. What have they to hope for from you? Is it high office? You would rather confer it on your opponents than on the champions of the Roman people. You broke out into indignant murmurs just now when you heard what this man said. What difference does it
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> make? If you had to give your votes now, you would prefer this man who threatens you with punishment to those who want to secure for you lands and houses and property.</q></p><p>When this exclamation of Postumius was reported to the soldiers it aroused much more indignation in the camp. <q direct="unspecified">What!</q> they said, <q direct="unspecified">is the embezzler of the spoils, the robber, actually threatening his soldiers with punishment?</q> Open as the expressions of resentment were, the quaestor P. Sestius still thought that the excitement could be repressed by the same exhibition of violence by which it had been aroused. A lictor was sent to a soldier who was shouting, this led to uproar and
									<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> disorder. The quaestor was struck by a stone and got out of the crowd, the man who had hurt him exclaimed that the quaestor had got what the commander had threatened the
									<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> soldiers.</p><p>Postumius was sent for to deal with the outbreak; he aggravated the general irritation by the ruthless way in which he made his investigations and the cruelty of the punishments he inflicted. At last, when his rage exceeded all bounds, and a crowd had gathered at the cries of those whom he had ordered to be put to death <q direct="unspecified">under the hurdle,</q><note anchored="yes" n="28" resp="ed">See description of execution of Turnus Herdonius in Book I. chap. li.

										<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> army.</p><p>When this dreadful deed was reported at Rome, the consular tribunes urged the senate to order an inquiry into the circumstances of the death of their colleague, but the tribunes of the plebs interposed their veto. That matter was closely connected with another subject of
											<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> dispute. The senate were apprehensive lest the plebeians, either through dread of an investigation or from feelings of resentment, should elect the consular tribunes from their own body, and they did their utmost accordingly to secure the election of consuls. As the tribunes of the plebs would not allow the senate to pass a decree, and also vetoed the election of consuls, matters passed to an interregnum. The victory rested finally with the senate.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Capture of Ferentinum</note>Q. Fabius Vibulanus, as interrex, presided over the elections. The consuls elected were A. Cornelius Cossus and L. Furius Medullinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the beginning of their year of office, a resolution was adopted by the senate empowering the tribunes to bring before the plebs at the earliest possible date the subject of an inquiry into the circumstances of the death of Postumius, and allowing the plebs to choose whom they would to preside over the inquiry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The plebs by a unanimous vote left the matter to the consuls. They discharged their task with the greatest moderation and clemency; only a few suffered punishment, and there are good grounds for believing that these died by their own hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were quite unable, however, to prevent their action from being bitterly resented by the plebeians, who complained that whilst measures brought forward in their own interests were abortive, one which involved the punishment and death of members of their order was meanwhile passed and put into immediate execution.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After justice had been meted out for the mutiny, it would have been a most politic step to appease their resentment by distributing the conquered territory of Bolae. Had the senate done this they would have lessened the eagerness for an agrarian law which proposed to expel the patricians from their unjust occupation of the State domains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As it was, the sense of injury was all the keener because the nobility were not only determined to keep the public land, which they already held, by force, but actually refused to distribute the vacant territory recently conquered, which would soon, like everything else, be appropriated by a few.</p><p>During this year the consul Furius led the legions against the Volscians, who were ravaging the Hernican territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As they did not find the enemy in that quarter they advanced against Ferentinum, to which place a large number of Volscians had retreated, and took it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was less booty there than they had expected to find, for as there was little hope of defending the place, the Volscians carried off their property and evacuated it by night. The next day, when captured, it was almost deserted. The town and its territory were given to the Hernici.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Pestilence and Famine.</note> year which, owing to the moderation of the tribunes, had been free from disturbances, was followed by one in which L. Icilius was tribune, the consuls being Q. Fabius Ambustus and C. Furius Pacilus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the very beginning of the year he took up the work of agitation, as though it were the allotted task of his name and family, and announced proposals for dealing with the land question.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Owing to the outbreak of a pestilence which, however, created more alarm than mortality, the thoughts of men were diverted from the political struggles of the Forum to their homes and the necessity of nursing the sick.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The pestilence was regarded as less baneful than the agrarian agitation would have been. The community escaped with very few deaths considering the very large number of cases.</p><p>As usually happens, the pestilence brought a famine the following year, owing to the fields lying uncultivated.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The new consuls were M. Papirius Atratinus and C. Nautius Rutilus. The famine would have been more fatal than the pestilence had not the scarcity been relieved by the despatch of commissioners to all the cities lying on the Etruscan sea and the Tiber.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Samnites, who occupied Capua and Cumae, refused in insolent terms to have any communication with the commissioners; on the other hand, assistance was generously given by the Sicilian Tyrant.<note anchored="yes" n="29" resp="ed">Livy seems to have Dionysius I. in his mind, but apparently his chronology is at fault, as Dionysius was tyrant some years later.</note> The largest supplies were brought down the Tiber, through the ungrudging exertions of the Etruscans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In consequence of the prevalence of sickness in the republic, the consuls found hardly any men available; as only one senator could be obtained for each commission, they were compelled to attach two knights to it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Apart from the pestilence and the famine, there was no trouble either at home or abroad during these two years, but as soon as these causes of anxiety had disappeared, all the usual sources of disturbance in the commonwealth &mdash;dissensions at home, wars abroad &mdash;broke out afresh.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Manlius<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Agrarian Disputes &mdash;Capture of Carventum.</note> Aemilius and C. Valerius Potitus were the new consuls. The Aequi made preparations for war, and the Volscians, without the sanction of their government, took up arms and assisted them as
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> volunteers. On the report of these hostile movements &mdash;they had already crossed over into the Latin and Hernican territories &mdash;the consul Valerius commenced to levy troops. He was obstructed by M. Menenius, the proposer of an agrarian law, and under the protection of this tribune, no one who objected to serve would take the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> oath. Suddenly the news came that the citadel of Carventum had been seized by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> enemy. This humiliation gave the senate an opening for stirring up popular resentment against Menenius, while it afforded to the other tribunes, who were already prepared to veto his agrarian law, stronger justification for opposing their
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> colleague. A long and angry discussion took place. The consuls called gods and men to witness that Menenius by obstructing the levy was solely responsible for whatever defeat and disgrace at the hands of the enemy had already been incurred or was
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> imminent. Menenius on the other hand loudly protested that if those who occupied the public land would give up their wrongful possession of it, he would place no hindrance in the way of the levy. The nine tribunes put an end to the quarrel by interposing a formal resolution and declaring that it was the intention of the college
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> to support the consul, in spite of their colleague's veto, whether he imposed fines or adopted other modes of coercion on those who refused to serve in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> field. Armed with this decree the consul ordered a few who were claiming the tribune's protection to be seized and brought before him; this cowed the rest and they took the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> oath.</p><p>The army was marched to the citadel of Carventum, and though disaffected and embittered against the consul, they no sooner arrived at the place than they drove out the defenders and recaptured the citadel. The attack was facilitated by the absence of some of the garrison, who had through the laxity of their generals stolen away on a plundering
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> expedition. The booty which had been gathered in their incessant raids and stored here for safety was considerable. This the consul ordered to be sold <q direct="unspecified">under the spear,</q><note anchored="yes" n="30" resp="ed">See note chap. xxix.</note> the proceeds to be paid by the quaestors into the treasury. He announced that the army would only have a share in the spoils when they had not declined to
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> serve. This increased the exasperation of the plebs and the soldiers against the consul. The senate decreed him an <q direct="unspecified">ovation,</q> and whilst he made his formal entry into the City, rude verses were bandied by
						<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> the soldiers with their accustomed licence in which the consul was abused and Menenius extolled in alternate couplets, whilst at every mention of the tribune the voices of the soldiers were drowned in the cheers and applause of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> bystanders. This latter circumstance occasioned more anxiety to the senate than the licence of the soldiers, which was almost a regular practice, and as there was no doubt that if Menenius became a candidate he would be elected as a consular tribune, he was shut out by the election of consuls.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Plebeian Quaestors.</note> two who were elected were Cnaeus Cornelius Cossus and L. Furius Medullinus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On no other occasion had the plebs been more indignant at not being allowed to elect consular tribunes. They showed their indignation in the election of quaestors, and they had their revenge, for that was the first time that plebeians were elected quaestors, and so far did they carry their resentment, that out of the four who were elected one place only was left open for a patrician, viz.,
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Kaeso Fabius Ambustus. The three plebeians, Q. Silius, P. Aelius, and P. Pupius, were chosen in preference to scions of the most illustrious families.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was the Icilii, I find, who induced the people to show this independence at the poll; that family was most bitter against the patricians, and three of its members were elected tribunes for this year by holding out hopes of numerous important reforms on which the people had set their hearts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They declared that they would not take a single step if the people had not sufficient courage even in electing quaestors to secure the end which they had long desired and which the laws had put within their reach, seeing that this was the only office which the senate had left open to patricians and plebeians alike.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The plebeians regarded this as a splendid victory; they valued the quaestorship not by what it was in itself, but as opening the path for men who had risen from the ranks to consulships and triumphs. The patricians on the other hand were indignant; they felt that they were not so much giving a share of the honours of the State as losing them altogether.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <q direct="unspecified">If,</q> they said, <q direct="unspecified">this is the state of things, children must no longer be reared, since they will only be banished from the station their ancestors filled, and whilst seeing others in possession of the dignity which is theirs by right, they will be left, deprived of all authority and power, to act as Salii or Flamens, with no other duty than that of offering sacrifices for the people.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Both parties were exasperated, and as the spirit of the plebs was rising and they had three leaders bearing a name illustrious in the popular cause, the patricians saw that the results of all the elections would be the same as that for quaestors in which the plebs had a free choice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They exerted themselves, therefore, to secure the election of consuls, which was not yet open to both orders; whilst the Icilii on the other hand said that consular tribunes must be elected, and that the highest honours must sooner or later be shared by the plebs.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But so far no action had been taken by the consuls to give an opening for obstruction and the wresting of the desired concessions from the patricians. By a marvellous piece of good luck, news came that the Volscians and Aequi had made a predatory inroad into the Latin and Hernican territories.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The senate decreed a levy for this war, but when the consuls began to raise it the tribunes vigorously opposed them, and declared that they themselves and the plebs had now got their opportunity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were three of them, all very energetic, who might be considered of good family as far as plebeians could be. Two of them assumed the task of keeping a close watch on each of the consuls; to the third was assigned the duty of alternately restraining and urging on the plebeians by his harangues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls could not get through with the levy, nor the tribunes with the election which they were so anxious for.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fortune at last took the side of the plebs, for tidings came that whilst the troops who were holding the citadel of Carventum were dispersed in quest of plunder, the Aequi had attacked it, and after killing the few left on guard, had cut to pieces some who were hastening back and others whilst straggling in the fields. This incident, so unfortunate for the State, strengthened the hands of the tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Fruitless attempts were made to induce them in this emergency to desist from opposing the war, but they would not give way either in view of the threatening danger to the State or the odium which might fall upon themselves, and finally succeeded in forcing the senate to pass a decree for the election of consular tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was, however, expressly stipulated that none of the present tribunes of the plebs should be eligible for that post, or should be re-elected as plebeian tribunes for the next year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This was undoubtedly aimed at the Icilii, whom the senate suspected of aiming at the consulship as a reward for their exertions as tribunes.</p><p>Then, with the consent of both orders, the levy was raised and preparations for war commenced. Authorities differ as to whether both consuls proceeded to the citadel of Carventum, or whether one remained behind to conduct the elections. There is no dispute, however, as to the Romans retiring from the citadel of Carventum after a long and ineffectual siege, and recovering Verrugo after committing great depredations and securing much booty in both the Volscian and Aequian territories.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="56"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Operations against the Volscians.</note> Rome, whilst the plebs had been so far victorious as to secure the election which they preferred, the result of that election was a victory for the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Contrary to all expectation, three patricians were elected consular tribunes, viz., C. Julius Julus, P. Cornelius Cossus, and C. Servilius Ahala. It was stated that the patricians had recourse to a trick; the Icilii actually accused them of it at the time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were charged with having introduced a crowd of unsuitable candidates amongst those who were worthy of being elected, and the disgust felt at the notoriously low character of some of these candidates alienated the people from the plebeian
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> candidates as a body.</p><p>After this a report was received that the Volscians and Aequi were devoting their utmost energies to getting ready for war. Either the fact that they had kept possession of the citadel of Carventum had raised their hopes, or the loss of the detachment at Verrugo had roused their ire.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Antiates were stated to be the prime movers; their ambassadors had gone the round of the cities of both nations reproaching them with cowardice in having skulked behind their walls the year before and allowing the Romans to harry their fields in all directions and the garrison at Verrugo to be destroyed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not only were armies despatched, but even colonists were being settled in their territories. Not only had the Romans distributed their property amongst themselves, but they had even made a present to the Hernici of Ferentinum, after they had taken it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> These reproaches kindled the war spirit in each city as they came to it, and a large number of fighting men were enrolled. A force gathered from all the States was concentrated at Antium; there they fixed their camp and awaited the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These proceedings were reported at Rome, and created greater excitement than the facts warranted, and the senate at once ordered a Dictator to be nominated-the last resource in imminent
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> danger.</p><p>It is stated that Julius and Cornelius were extremely angry at thus step, and matters proceeded amidst much bitterness on both sides.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The leaders of the senate censured the consular tribunes for not recognising the authority of the senate, and finding their protests useless, actually appealed at last to the tribunes of the plebs and reminded them how on a similar occasion their authority had acted as a check on the consuls.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The tribunes, delighted at the dissension amongst the senators, said that they could render no assistance to those in whose eyes they were not regarded as citizens or even as men.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If the honours of the State were ever open to both orders, and they had their share in the government, then they would take measures to prevent the decisions of the senate from being nullified by the arrogance of any magistrate;
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> till then the patricians, devoid as they were of any respect for magistrates or laws, might deal with the consular tribunes by themselves.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="57"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This controversy preoccupied men's thoughts at a most inopportune moment, when such a serious war was on their hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At last, after Julius and Cornelius had, one after the other, argued at great length that as they were quite competent to conduct that war, it was unjust to deprive them of the honour which the people had conferred upon them, Ahala Servilius, the other consular tribune, intervened in the dispute.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had, he said, kept silent so long, not because he had any doubt in his own mind, &mdash;for what true patriot could separate his own interest from that of the State? &mdash;but because he would rather have had his colleagues yield voluntarily to the authority of the senate than allow the power of the plebeian tribunes to be invoked against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even now he would have gladly given them time to abandon their unyielding attitude if circumstances allowed. But the necessities of war do not wait on the counsels of men, and the commonwealth was more to him than the goodwill of his colleagues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If, therefore, the senate adhered to its decision, he would nominate a Dictator the next night, and if any one vetoed the passing of a senatorial decree he should be content to act simply on their resolution.</p><p>By taking this course he won the well-deserved praise and sympathy of all, and after nominating P. Cornelius as Dictator, he was himself appointed Master of the Horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He furnished an example to his colleagues, as they compared his position with their own, of the way in which high office and popularity come sometimes most readily to those who do not covet them.</p><p>The war was far from being a memorable one.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The enemy were defeated with great slaughter at Antium in a single easily-won battle. The victorious army devastated the Volscian territory. The fort at Lake Fucinus was stormed, and the garrison of 3000 men taken prisoners, whilst the rest of the Volscians were driven into their walled towns, leaving their fields at the mercy of the enemy.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After making what use he could of Fortune's favours in the conduct of the war<note anchored="yes" n="31" resp="ed">Livy's meaning appears to be that though the general seized every opportunity, the war was not arduous enough to enhance his reputation. But the sentence is obscure.</note>, the Dictator returned home with more success than glory and
							<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> laid down his office.</p><p>The consular tribunes waived all proposals for the election of consuls &mdash;owing, I believe, to their resentment at the appointment of a Dictator &mdash;and issued orders for the election of consular tribunes.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This increased the anxiety of the senators, for they saw that their cause was being betrayed by men of their own party.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Accordingly, as in the previous year they had excited disgust against all plebeian candidates, however worthy, by means of those who were perfectly worthless, so now the leaders of the senate appeared as candidates, surrounded by everything that could lend distinction or strengthen personal influence.
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They secured all the places and prevented the entrance of any plebeian. Four were elected, all of whom had previously held office, viz., L. Furius Medullinus, C. Valerius Potitus, N. Fabius Vibulanus, and C. Servilius Ahala. The latter owed his continuance in office to the popularity he had won by his singular moderation as much as to his other merits.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="58"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Hostilities threatened with Veii.</note> this year the armistice with Veii expired, and ambassadors and <foreign lang="la">fetials</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="32" resp="ed">For their procedure, see Book I. chap. xxxii.</note> were sent to demand satisfaction. When they reached the frontier they were met by a deputation from Veii, who begged them not to go there before they themselves had an audience of the Roman senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They obtained from the senate the withdrawal of the demand for satisfaction, owing to the internal troubles from which Veii was suffering. So far were the Romans from seeking their opportunity in the misfortunes of others!</p><p>A disaster was incurred on Volscian ground in the loss of the garrison at Verrugo.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So much depended here upon a few hours that the soldiers who were being besieged by the Volscians and begging for assistance could have been relieved if prompt measures had been taken. As it was, the relieving force only arrived in time to surprise the enemy, who, fresh from the massacre of the garrison, were scattered in quest of plunder.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The responsibility for the delay rested more with the senate than with the consular tribunes; they heard that the garrison were offering a most determined resistance, and they did not reflect that there are limits to human strength which no amount of courage can transcend.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The gallant soldiers were not unavenged either in their lives or their deaths.</p><p>The following year the consular tribunes were P. Cornelius Cossus, Cnaeus Cornelius Cossus, Numerius Fabius Ambustus, and L. Valerius Potitus.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Owing to the action of the senate of Veii, a war with that city was threatened.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The envoys whom Rome had sent to demand satisfaction received the insolent reply that unless they speedily departed from the city and crossed the frontiers the Veientines would give them what Lars Tolumnius had given.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate were indignant and passed a decree that the consular tribunes should bring before the people at the earliest possible day a proposal to declare war against Veii.</p><p>No sooner was the subject brought forward than the men who were liable for service protested.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They complained that the war with the Volscians had not been brought to a close, the garrisons of two forts had been annihilated, and the forts, though recaptured, were held with difficulty,
								<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> there was not a single year in which there was not fighting, and now, as if they had not enough work on hand, they were preparing for a fresh war with a most powerful neighbour who would rouse the whole of Etruria.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This disaffection amongst the plebs was fanned by their tribunes,
								<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> who were continually giving out that the most serious war was the one going on between the senate and the plebs, who were purposely harassed by war and exposed to be butchered by the enemy and kept as it were in banishment far from their homes lest the quiet of city life might awaken memories of their liberties and lead them to discuss schemes for distributing the State lands amongst colonists and securing a free exercise of their franchise.
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They got hold of the veterans, counted up each man's campaigns and wounds and scars, and asked what blood was still left in him which could be shed for the State.
								<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> By raising these topics in public speeches and private conversations they produced amongst the plebeians a feeling of opposition to the projected war. The subject was therefore dropped for the time, as it was evident that in the then state of opinion it would, if brought forward, be rejected.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="59"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meantime<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Capture of Anxur.</note> the consular tribunes decided to lead the army into the territory of the Volscians; Cnaeus Cornelius was left in charge of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The three tribunes ascertained that there was no camp of the Volscians anywhere, and that they would not risk a battle, so they divided into three separate forces to ravage the country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Valerius made Antium his objective; Cornelius, Ecetrae. Wherever they marched they destroyed the homesteads and crops far and wide to divide the forces of the Volscians. Fabius marched to Anxur, which was the chief objective, without losing time in devastating the country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This city is now called Terracina; it was built on the side of a hill and sloped down to the marshes. Fabius made a show of attacking the city on that side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Four cohorts were despatched with C. Servilius Ahala by a circuitous route to seize the hill which overhung the town on the other side. After doing so they made an attack amidst loud shouts and uproar from their higher position upon that part of the town where there was no defence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Those who were holding the lower part of the city against Fabius were stupefied with astonishment at the noise, and this gave him time to plant his scaling ladders. The Romans were soon in all parts of the city, and for some time a ruthless slaughter went on of fugitives and fighters, armed and unarmed alike.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As there was no hope of quarter, the defeated enemy were compelled to keep up the fight, till suddenly an order was issued that none but those taken with arms should be injured. On this the whole of the population threw down their arms; prisoners to the number of 2500 were taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Fabius would not allow his men to touch
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the other spoils of war until the arrival of his colleagues, for those armies too had taken their part in the capture of Anxur, since they had prevented the Volscians from coming to its relief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On their arrival the three armies sacked the town, which, owing to its long-continued prosperity, contained much wealth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This generosity on the part of the generals was the first step towards the reconciliation of the plebs and the senate.<note anchored="yes" n="33" resp="ed">Instead of giving the spoil to the soldiers, they might have, as in other cases, sold it for the public treasury.</note></p><p>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Institution of Military Pay.</note> was followed by a boon which the senate, at a most opportune moment, conferred on the plebeians. Before the question was mooted either by the plebs or their tribunes, the senate decreed that the soldiery should receive pay from the public treasury. Previously, each man had served at his own expense.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="60"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nothing, it is recorded, was ever welcomed by the plebs with such delight; they crowded round the Senate-house, grasped the hands of the senators as they came out, acknowledged that they were rightly called <q direct="unspecified">Fathers,</q> and declared that after what they had done no one would ever spare his person or his blood, as long as any strength remained, for so generous a country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They saw with pleasure that their private property at all events would rest undisturbed at such times as they were impressed and actively employed in the public service, and the fact of the boon being spontaneously offered, without any demand on the part of their tribunes, increased their happiness and gratitude immensely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The only people who did not share the general feeling of joy and goodwill were the tribunes of the plebs. They asserted that the arrangement would not turn out such a pleasant thing for the senate or such a benefit to the whole community as they supposed. The policy was more attractive at first sight than it would prove in actual practice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From what source, they asked, could the money be raised; except by imposing a tax on the people? They were generous at other people's expense. Besides, those who had served their time would not, even if the rest approved, permit others to serve on more favourable terms than they themselves had done and after having had to provide for their own expenses, now provide for those of others.</p><p>These arguments influenced some of the plebeians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At last, after the tax had been imposed, the tribunes actually gave notice that they would protect any one who refused to contribute to the war tax.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senators were determined to uphold a measure so happily inaugurated, they were themselves the first to contribute, and as coined money was not yet introduced, they carried the copper by weight in wagons to the treasury, thereby drawing public attention to the fact of their contributing.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After the senators had contributed most conscientiously the full amount at which they were assessed, the leading plebeians, personal friends of the nobles, began, as had been agreed, to pay in their share.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the crowd saw these men applauded by the senate and looked up to by the men of military age as patriotic citizens, they hastily rejected the proffered protection of the tribunes and vied with one another in their
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> eagerness to contribute.</p><p>The proposal authorising the declaration of war against Veii was carried, and the new consular tribunes marched thither an army composed to a large extent of men who volunteered for service.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="61"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Beginning of the War against Veii.</note> tribunes were T. Quinctius Capitolinus, Q. Quinctius Cincinnatus, C. Julius Julus &mdash;for the second time &mdash;Aulus Manlius, L. Furius Medullinus &mdash;for the third time &mdash;and Manius Aemilius Mamercus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was by them that Veii was first invested. Immediately after the siege had commenced, a largely-attended meeting of the national council of the Etruscans was held at the fane of Voltumna, but no decision was arrived at as to whether the Veientines should be defended by the armed strength of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> the whole nation.</p><p>The following year the siege was prosecuted with less vigour owing to some of the tribunes and a portion of the army being called off to the Volscian war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consular tribunes for the year were C. Valerius Potitus &mdash;for the third time &mdash;Manius Sergius Fidenas, P. Cornelius Maluginensis, Cnaeus Cornelius Cossus, Kaeso Fabius Ambustus, and Spurius Nautius Rutilus &mdash;for the second time.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A pitched battle was fought with the Volscians between Ferentinum and Ecetrae, which resulted in favour of the Romans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the tribunes commenced the siege of Artena, a Volscian town. In attempting a sortie the enemy were driven back into the town, giving thereby an opportunity to the Romans of forcing an entrance, and with the exception of the citadel the whole place was captured.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A body of the enemy retired into the citadel, which was protected by the nature of its position; below the citadel many were killed or taken prisoners. The citadel was then invested, but it could not be taken by assault as the defenders were quite sufficient for the extent of the fortifications, nor was there any hope of its surrendering, as all the corn from the public magazines had been conveyed there before the city was taken.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Romans would have retired in disgust had not a slave betrayed the place to them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The soldiers, guided by him up some steep ground, effected its capture, and after they had massacred those on guard, the rest, panic-struck, surrendered.</p><p>After the town and citadel had been demolished, the legions were withdrawn from Volscian territory and the whole strength of Rome was directed against Veii.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The traitor was rewarded not only with his freedom, but also with the property of two households, and was called Servius Romanus.</p><p>Some suppose that Artena belonged to the Veientines, not the Volscians.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The mistake arises from the fact that there was a city of the same name between Caere and Veii, but it was destroyed in the time of the kings of Rome, and it belonged to Caere, not Veii. The other town of the same name whose destruction I have mentioned was in the Volscian territory.</p></div1>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Siege of Veii &mdash;Appius and the Plebeian Tribunes.</note> peace prevailed elsewhere, Rome and Veii were confronting each other in arms, animated by such fury and hatred that utter ruin clearly awaited the vanquished. Each elected their magistrates, but on totally different
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> principles. The Romans increased the number of their consular tribunes to eight &mdash;a larger number than had ever been elected before. They were Manius Aemilius Mamercus &mdash;for the second time &mdash;L. Valerius Potitus &mdash;for the third time &mdash;Appius Claudius Crassus, M. Quinctilius Varus, L. Julius Julus, M. Postumius, M. Furius Camillus, and M. Postumius Albinus. The Veientines, on the other hand, tired of the annual canvassing for office, elected a
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> king. This gave great offence to the Etruscan cantons, owing to their hatred of monarchy and their personal aversion to the one who was
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> elected. He was already obnoxious to the nation through his pride of wealth and overbearing temper, for he had put a violent stop to the festival of the Games, the interruption of which is an act of
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> impiety. His candidature for the priesthood<note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed"><emph>priesthood.</emph> A national priest was elected annually to organise the Games and other State solemnities.</note> had been unsuccessful, another being preferred by the vote of the twelve cantons, and in revenge he suddenly withdrew the performers, most of whom were his own slaves, in the middle of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Games. The Etruscans as a nation were distinguished above all others by their devotion to religious observances, because they excelled in the knowledge and conduct of them, and they decided, in consequence, that no assistance should be given to the Veientines as long as they were under a
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> king. The report of this decision was suppressed at Veii through fear of the king; he treated those who mentioned anything of the kind, not as authors of an idle tale, but as ringleaders of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> sedition.</p><p>Although the Romans had received intelligence that there was no movement on the part of the Etruscans, still, as it
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> was reported that the matter was being discussed in all their councils, they so constructed their lines as to present a double face, the one fronting Veii to prevent sorties from the city, the other looking towards Etruria to intercept any succour from that side.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the Roman generals placed more reliance on a blockade than on an assault, they began to build huts for winter quarters, a novelty to the Roman soldier. Their plan was to keep up the war through the winter.</p><p>The tribunes of the plebs had for a long time been unable to find any pretext for creating a revolt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When, however, news of this was brought to Rome, they dashed off to the Assembly and produced great excitement by declaring that this was the reason why it had been settled to pay the troops. They, the tribunes, had not been blind to the fact that this gift from their adversaries would prove to be tainted with poison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The liberties of the plebs had been bartered away, their able-bodied men had been permanently sent away, banished from the City and the State, without any regard to winter or indeed to any season of the year, or to the possibility of their visiting their homes or looking after their property. What did they think was the reason for this continuous campaigning?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They would most assuredly find it to be nothing else but the fear that if a large body of these men, who formed the whole strength of the plebs, were present, it would be possible to discuss reforms in favour of the plebeians. Besides, they were suffering much more hardship and oppression than the Veientines, for these passed the winter under their own roofs in a city protected by its magnificent walls and the natural strength of its position, whilst the Romans, amidst labour and toil, buried in frost and snow, were roughing it patiently under their skin-covered tents, and could not lay aside their arms even in the season of winter, when there is a respite from all wars, whether by land or sea.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This form of slavery, making military service perpetual, was never imposed either by the kings, or by the consuls who were so domineering before the institution of the tribuneship, or during the stern rule of the Dictator, or by the unscrupulous decemvirs &mdash;it was the consular tribunes who were exercising this regal despotism over the Roman plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What would these men have done had they been consuls or Dictators, seeing that they have made their proconsular authority, which is only a shadow of the other, so outrageously cruel? But the commons had got what they had deserved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Amongst all the eight consular tribunes not a single plebeian had found a place. Hitherto, with their utmost efforts, the patricians had usually filled only three places at a time; now a team of eight were bent on maintaining their power. Even in such a crowd not a single plebeian could get a footing, to warn his colleagues, if he could do nothing else, that those who were serving as soldiers were free men, their own fellow-citizens, and not slaves, and that they ought to be brought back, at all events in the winter, to their houses and their homes, and during some part of the year visit their parents and wives and children, and exercise their rights as free citizens in electing the magistrates.</p><p>Whilst indulging in declamations of this sort, they found an opponent who was quite a match for them in Appius Claudius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He had from early manhood taken his part in the contests with the plebs, and as stated above, had some years previously recommended the senate to break down the power of the tribunes by securing the intervention of their colleagues. He was not only a man of ready and versatile mind, but by this time an experienced debater.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He delivered the following speech on this occasion: &mdash;</p><p><q direct="unspecified">If, Quirites, there has ever been any doubt as to whether it was in your interest or their own that the tribunes have always been the advocates of sedition, I feel quite certain that this year all doubt has ceased to exist. Whilst I rejoice that an end has at last been put to a long-standing delusion, I congratulate you, and on your behalf the whole State, that its removal has been effected just at the time when your circumstances are most prosperous.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Is there any one who doubts that whatever wrongs you may have at any time suffered, they never annoyed and provoked the tribunes so much as the generous treatment of the plebs by the senate, in establishing the system of pay for the soldiers?
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> What else do you suppose it was that they were afraid of at that time, and would today gladly upset, except the harmony of the two orders, which they look upon as most of all calculated to destroy their power? They are, really, like so many quack doctors looking for work, always anxious to find some diseased spot in the republic that there may be something which you can call them in to cure.</q> Then, turning to the tribunes, <q direct="unspecified">Are you defending or attacking the plebs? Are you trying to injure the men on service or are you pleading their cause?
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Or perhaps this is what you are saying, <q direct="unspecified">Whatever the senate does, whether in the interest of the plebs or against them, we object to.</q>
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Just as masters forbid strangers to hold any communication with their slaves, and think it right that they should abstain from showing them either kindness or unkindness, so you interdict the patricians from all dealings with the plebs, lest we should appeal to their feelings by our graciousness and generosity and secure their loyalty and obedience. How much more dutiful it would have been in you, if you had had a spark &mdash;I will not say of patriotism, but &mdash;of common humanity, to have viewed with favour, and as far as in you lay, to have fostered the kindly feelings of the patricians and the grateful goodwill of the plebeians!
								<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> And if this harmony should prove to be lasting, who would not be bold enough to guarantee that this empire will in a short time be the greatest among the neighbouring States?</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">I shall subsequently show not only the expediency but even the necessity of the policy which my colleagues have adopted of refusing to withdraw the army from Veii until their object was effected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For the present I prefer to speak of the actual conditions under which it is serving, and if I were speaking not before you only but in the camp as well, I think that what I say would appear just and fair in the judgment of the soldiers themselves. Even if no arguments presented themselves to my mind, I should find those of my opponents quite sufficient for my purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were saying lately that pay ought not to be given to the soldiers because it never had been given. How then can they now profess indignation at those who have gained additional benefits being required to undergo additional exertion in proportion? Nowhere do we find labour without its reward, nor, as a rule, reward without some expenditure of labour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Toil and pleasure, utterly dissimilar by nature, have been brought by nature into a kind of partnership with each other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Formerly, the soldier felt it a grievance that he gave his services to the State at his own cost, he had the satisfaction, however, of cultivating his land for a part of the year, and acquiring the means of supporting himself and his family whether he were at home or on service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Now he has the pleasure of knowing that the State is a source of income to him, and he is glad to receive his pay. Let him therefore take it patiently that he is a little longer absent from his home and his property, on which no heavy expense now falls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If the State were to call him to an exact reckoning, would it not be justified in saying, <q direct="unspecified">You receive a year's pay, put in a year's work. Do you think it fair to receive a whole twelve-month's pay for six months' service?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is with reluctance, Quirites, that I dwell on this topic, for it is those who employ mercenaries who ought to deal thus with them, but we want to deal with you as with fellow-citizens, and we think it only fair that you should deal with us as with your fatherland.</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">Either the war ought not to have been undertaken, or
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> it ought to be conducted as befits the dignity of Rome and brought to a close as soon as possible.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It will certainly be brought to a close if we press on the siege, but not if we retire before we have fulfilled our hopes by the capture of Veii. Why, good heavens! if there were no other reason, the very discredit of the thing ought to inspire us with perseverance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A city was once besieged by the whole of Greece for ten years, for the sake of one woman, and at what a distance from home, how many lands and seas lay between!
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Are we growing tired of keeping up a siege for one year, not twenty miles off, almost within sight of the City? I suppose you think the reason for the war is a trivial one, and we do not feel enough just resentment to urge us to persevere.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Seven times have they recommenced war against us; they have never loyally kept to the terms of peace; they have ravaged our fields a thousand times; they forced the Fidenates to revolt;
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> they slew the colonists whom we settled there; they instigated the impious murder of our ambassadors in violation of the law of nations; they wanted to raise the whole of Etruria against us, and they are trying to do so today; when we sent ambassadors to demand satisfaction, they very nearly outraged them.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">Are these the men with whom war ought to be carried on in a half-hearted and dilatory fashion? If such just reasons for resentment have no force with us, do not the following considerations, I pray you, possess any weight?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The city is hemmed in by immense siege-works which confine the enemy within his walls. He has not tilled his land, and what was tilled before has been devastated by war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> If we bring our army back again, has anybody the slightest doubt that they will invade our territory not only from a thirst for revenge, but also through the sheer necessity they are under of plundering other people's property since they have lost their own?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If we adopt your policy we do not postpone the war, we simply carry it within our own frontiers.</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">Well, now, what about the soldiers in whom these worthy tribunes have suddenly become interested after vainly endeavouring to rob them of their pay; what about them?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They have carried a rampart and a fosse &mdash;each requiring enormous labour &mdash;over all that extent of ground; they have built forts, few at first, but after the army was increased, very numerous; they have raised defences not only against the city, but also as a barrier against Etruria in case any succours came from there.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What need to describe the towers, the <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign>, the <foreign lang="la">testudines</foreign>, and the other engines used in storming cities? Now that so much labour has been spent and the work of investment at last completed, do you think that they ought to be abandoned in order that by next summer we may be again exhausted by the toil of constructing them all afresh?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> How much less trouble to defend the works already constructed, to press on and persevere, and so bring our cares and labours to an end! For assuredly the undertaking is not a lengthy one, if it is carried through by one continuous effort, if we do not by our own interruptions and stoppages delay the fulfilment of our hopes.</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">I have been speaking of the work and the loss of time.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now there are frequent meetings of the national council of Etruria to discuss the question of sending succours to Veii. Do these allow us to forget the danger we incur by prolonging the war?
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As matters now stand, they are angry, resentful, and say that they will not send any &mdash;Veii may be captured, as far as they are concerned. But who will guarantee that if the war is prolonged they will continue in the same mind?
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> For if you give the Veientines a respite they will send a more numerous and influential embassy, and what now gives such displeasure to the Etruscans, namely, the election of a king, may after a time be annulled either by the unanimous act of the citizens in order to win the sympathies of Etruria, or by voluntary abdication on the part of the king himself, through his unwillingness to allow his
							<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> crown to endanger the safety of his people.</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">See how many disastrous consequences follow from the policy you recommend &mdash;the sacrifice of works constructed with so much trouble; the threatening devastation of our borders;
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> a war with the whole of Etruria instead of one with Veii alone.</q></p><p>This, tribunes, is what your proposals amount to; very much, upon my word, as if any one were to tempt a sick person, who by submitting to strict treatment could speedily recover, to indulge in eating and drinking, and so lengthen his illness and perhaps make it incurable.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">Though it might not affect this present war, it would, you may depend upon it, be of the utmost importance to our military training that our soldiers should be habituated not only to enjoy a victory when they have won one, but also, when a campaign progresses slowly, to put up with its tediousness and await the fulfilment of their hopes though deferred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If a war has not been finished in the summer they must learn to go through the winter, and not, like birds of passage, look out for roofs to shelter them the moment autumn comes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The passion and delight of hunting carries men through frost and snow to the forests and the mountains. Pray tell me, shall we not bring to the exigencies of war the same powers of endurance which are generally called out by sport or pleasure?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Are we to suppose that the bodies of our soldiers are so effeminate and their spirits so enfeebled that they cannot hold out in camp or stay away from their homes for a single winter? Are we to believe that like those engaged in naval warfare, who have to watch the seasons and catch the favourable weather, so these men cannot endure times of heat and cold?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They would indeed blush if any one laid this to their charge, and would stoutly maintain that both in mind and body they were capable of manly endurance, and could go through a campaign in winter as well as in summer. They would tell you that they had not commissioned their tribunes to act as protectors of the effeminate and the indolent, nor was it in cool shade or under sheltering roofs that their ancestors had instituted this very tribunitian power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The valour of your soldiers, the dignity of Rome, demand that we should not limit our view to Veii and this present war, but seek for reputation in time to come in respect of other wars and amongst all other nations.</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">Do you imagine that the opinion men form of us in this crisis is a matter of slight importance?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Is it a matter of indifference whether our neighbours regard Rome in such a light that when any city has sustained her first momentary attack it has nothing more to fear from her, or whether
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> on the other hand, the terror of our name is such that no weariness of a protracted siege, no severity of winter, can dislodge a Roman army from any city which it has once invested, that it knows no close to a war but victory, and that it conducts its campaigns by perseverance as much as by dash?
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Perseverance is necessary in every kind of military operation, but especially in the conduct of sieges, for the majority of cities are impregnable, owing to the strength of their fortifications and their position, and time itself conquers them with hunger and thirst, and captures them as it will capture Veii unless the tribunes of the plebs extend their protection to the enemy and the Veientines find in Rome the support which they are vainly seeking in Etruria.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Can anything happen to the Veientines more in accordance with their wishes than that the City of Rome should be filled with sedition and the contagion of it spread to the camp?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But amongst the enemy there is actually so much respect for law and order that they have not been goaded into
						<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> revolution either by weariness of the siege or even aversion to absolute monarchy, nor have they shown exasperation at the refusal of succours by Etruria. The man who advocates sedition will be put to death on the spot, and no one will be allowed to say the things which are uttered amongst you with impunity.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> With us the man who deserts his standard or abandons his post is liable to be cudgelled to
						<milestone unit="section" n="14??"/> death, but those who urge the men to abandon the standards and desert from the camp are listened to, not by one or two only; they have the whole army for an audience.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> To such an extent have you habituated yourselves to listen calmly to whatever a tribune of the plebs may say, even if it means the betrayal of your country and the destruction of the republic. Captivated by the attraction which that office has for you, you allow all sorts of mischief to lurk under its shadow.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The one thing left for them is to bring forward in the camp, before the soldiers, the same arguments which they have so loudly urged here, and so corrupt the army that they will not allow it to obey its commanders.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> For evidently liberty in Rome simply means that the soldiers cease to feel any reverence for either the senate, or the magistrates, or the laws, or the traditions of their ancestors, or the institutions of their fathers, or military discipline.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Appius<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The siege of Veii pressed with greater Vigour.</note> was already quite a match for the tribunes even on the platform, and now his victory over them was assured by the sudden intelligence of a most unexpected disaster, the effect of which was to unite all classes in an ardent resolve to prosecute the siege of Veii more vigorously.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A raised way had been carried up to the city, and the <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign> had almost been placed in contact with the walls, but more attention had been devoted to their construction by day than to their protection by night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Suddenly the gates were flung open and an enormous multitude, armed mostly with torches, flung the flaming missiles on to the works, and in one short hour the flames consumed both the raised way<note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="ed"><emph>raised way.</emph> A slanting approach constructed of stones and earth kept in place by a framework of timber, along which the <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign> and battering-rams were brought to the level of the walls.</note> and the <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign>, the work of so many days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Many poor fellows who vainly tried to render assistance perished either in the flames or by the sword.</p><p>When the news of this reached Rome there was universal mourning, and the senate were filled with apprehension lest disturbances should break out in the City and the camp beyond their power to repress, and the tribunes of the plebs exult over the vanquished republic.</p><p>Suddenly, however, a number of
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> men who, though assessed as knights, had not been provided with horses, after concerting a common plan of action, went to the Senate-house, and on permission being given to address the senate, they engaged to serve as cavalry on their own horses.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate thanked them in the most complimentary terms. When the news of this incident had circulated through the Forum and the City, the plebeians hastily assembled at the Senate-house and declared that they were now
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> part of the infantry force, and though it was not their turn to serve, they promised to give their services to the republic to march to Veii or wherever else they were led. If, they said, they were led to Veii they would not return till the city was taken.</p><p>On hearing this it was with difficulty that the senate restrained their delight.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They did not, as in the case of the knights, pass a resolution of thanks to
							<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> be conveyed through the presiding magistrates, nor were any summoned into the House to receive their reply, nor did they themselves remain within the precincts of their House.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They came out on the raised space in front and each independently signified by voice and gesture to the people standing in the <foreign lang="la">comitium</foreign> the joy they all felt, and expressed their confidence that this unanimity of feeling would make Rome a blessed City, invincible and eternal. They applauded the knights, they applauded the commons, they showered encomiums on the very day itself, and frankly admitted that the senate had been outdone in courtesy and kindness.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Senators and plebeians alike shed tears of joy.</p><p>At last the sitting was resumed, and a resolution was carried that the consular tribunes
								<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> should convene a public meeting and return thanks to the infantry and the knights, and say that the senate would never forget this proof of their affection for their country. They further decided that pay should be reckoned from that day for those who, though not called out, had volunteered to serve.
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A fixed sum was assigned to each knight; this was the first occasion on which the knights received military pay.</p><p>The army of volunteers marched to Veii, and not only reconstructed the works that had been lost, but constructed new ones. More care was taken in bringing up supplies from the City, that nothing might be wanting for the use of an army that had behaved so well.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Disaster incurred before Veii.</note> consular tribunes for the following year were C. Servilius Ahala &mdash;for the third time &mdash;Q. Servilius, Lucius Verginius, Q. Sulpicius, Aulus Manlius &mdash;for the second time &mdash;and Manius Sergius &mdash;also for the second time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> During their term of office, whilst every one was preoccupied with the Veientine war, Anxur was lost. The garrison had become weakened through the absence of men on furlough, and Volscian traders were admitted indiscriminately, with the result that the guard before the gates were surprised and the fortified post taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The loss in men was slight, as with the exception of the sick, they were all scattered about the fields and neighbouring towns, driving bargains like so many camp-followers.</p><p>At Veii, the chief point of interest, things went no better.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not only were the Roman commanders opposing one another more vigorously than they opposed the enemy, but the war was rendered more serious by the sudden arrival of the Capenates and the Faliscans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As these two States were nearest in point of distance, they believed that if Veii fell they would be the next on whom Rome would make war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Faliscans had their own reasons for fearing hostilities, since they were mixed up in the previous war against Fidenae. So both States, after mutually despatching commissioners for the purpose, swore alliance with each other, and their two armies arrived unexpectedly at Veii.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It so happened that they attacked the entrenchments on the side where Manius Sergius was in command, and they created great alarm, for the Romans were convinced that all Etruria had risen and was present in great force. The same conviction roused the Veientines in the city to action, so the Roman lines of investment were attacked from within and from without.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Rushing from side to side to meet first the one attack, then the other, they were unable to confine the Veientines sufficiently within their fortifications or repel the assault from their own works and defend themselves from the enemy outside. Their only hope was if help came from the main camp so that the legions might fight back to back, some against the Capenates and Faliscans, and others against the sortie from the town.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But Verginius was in command of that camp, and he and Sergius mutually detested each other.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When it was reported to him that most of the forts had been attacked and the connecting lines surmounted, and that the enemy were forcing their way in from both sides, he kept his men halted under arms, and repeatedly declared that if his colleague needed assistance he would send to him.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This selfishness on his part was matched by the other's obstinacy, for Sergius, to avoid the appearance of having sought help from a personal foe, preferred defeat at the hands of the enemy rather than owe success to a fellow-countryman.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For some time the soldiers were being slaughtered between the two attacking forces; at last a very small number abandoned their lines and reached the main camp; Sergius himself, with the greatest part of his force, made his way to Rome. Here he threw all the blame on his colleague, and it was decided that Verginius should be summoned from the camp and his lieutenants put in command during his absence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The case was then discussed in the senate; few studied the interests of the republic, most of the senators supported one or other of the disputants as their party feeling or private sympathy prompted them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The leaders of the senate gave it as their opinion that whether it was through the fault or the misfortune of the commanders that such a disgraceful defeat had been incurred, they ought not to wait until the regular time for the elections, but proceed at once to appoint
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> new consular tribunes, to enter office on October 1. On their proceeding to vote on this proposal, the other consular tribunes offered no opposition, but strange to say, Sergius and Verginius &mdash;the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> very men on whose account obviously the senate were dissatisfied with the magistrates for that year &mdash;after protesting against such humiliation, vetoed the resolution. They declared that they would not resign office before December 13, the usual day for new magistrates to take office.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On hearing this, the tribunes of the plebs, who had maintained a reluctant silence while the State was enjoying concord and prosperity, now made a sudden attack upon the consular tribunes, and threatened, if they did not bow to the authority of the senate, to order them to be imprisoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There upon C. Servilius Ahala, the consular tribune, replied: <q direct="unspecified">As for you and your menaces, tribunes of the plebs, I should very much like to put it to the proof how your threats possess as little legality as you possess courage to carry them out, but it is wrong to storm against the authority of the senate.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Cease, therefore, to look for a chance of making mischief by meddling in our disputes; either my colleagues will act upon the senate's resolution, or if they persist in their obstinacy, I shall at once nominate a Dictator that he may compel them to resign.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This speech was received with universal approval, and the senate were glad to find that without bringing in the bugbear of the plebeian tribunes' power, another and a more effectual method existed for bringing pressure to bear on the magistrates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In deference to the universal feeling, the two recalcitrant tribunes held an election for consular tribunes who entered office on October 1, they themselves having previously resigned office.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Internal Troubles &mdash;Impeachment of Sergius and Verginius.</note> newly elected tribunes were L. Valerius Potitus &mdash;for the fourth time &mdash;M. Furius Camillus-for the second time &mdash;Manius Aemilius Mamercus &mdash;for the third time &mdash;Cnaeus Cornelius Cossus &mdash;for the second time &mdash; Kaeso Fabius Ambustus, and L. Julius Julus. Their year of office was marked by many incidents at home and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> abroad. There was a multiplicity of wars going on at once &mdash;at Veii, at Capena, at Falerii, and against the Volscians for the recovery of
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Anxur. In Rome the simultaneous demands of the levy and the war-tax created distress; there was a dispute about the co-opting of tribunes of the plebs, and the trial of two men who had recently held consular power caused great excitement.</p><p>The consular tribunes made it their first business to raise a
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> levy. Not only were the <q direct="unspecified">juniors</q> enrolled, but the <q direct="unspecified">seniors</q> were also compelled to give in their names that they might act as City guards. But the increase in the number of soldiers necessitated a corresponding increase in the amount required for their pay, and those who remained at
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> home were unwilling to contribute their share because, in addition, they were to be harassed by military duties in defence of the City, as servants of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> State. This was in itself a serious grievance, but it was made to appear more so by the seditious harangues of the tribunes of the plebs, who asserted that the reason why military pay had been established was that one half of the plebs might be crushed by the war-tax, and the other by military
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> service. One single war was now dragging along into its third year, and it was being badly managed deliberately in order that they might have it the longer to manage. Then, again, armies had been enrolled for four separate wars in one levy, and even boys and old men had been torn from their
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> homes. There was no difference made now between summer and winter, in order that the wretched plebeians might never have any
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> respite. And now, to crown all, they even had to pay a war-tax, so that when they returned, worn out by toil and wounds, and last of all by age, and found all their land untilled through want of the owner's care, they had to meet this demand out of their wasted property and return to the State their pay as soldiers many times over, as though they had borrowed it on
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> usury.</p><p>What with the levy and the war-tax and the preoccupation of men's minds with still graver anxieties, it was found impossible to get the full number of plebeian tribunes elected. Then a struggle began to secure the co-optation of patricians into the vacant
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> places. This proved to be impossible, but in order to weaken the authority of the Trebonian Law, it was arranged, doubtless through the influence of the patricians, that C. Lucerius and M. Acutius should be co-opted as tribunes of the plebs.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As chance would have it, Cnaeus Trebonius was tribune of the plebs that year, and he came forward as a champion of the Trebonian Law, as a duty apparently to his family and the name he bore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He declared in excited tones that the position which the senate had assailed, though they had been repulsed in their first attack, had been at last carried by the consular tribunes. The Trebonian Law had been set aside and the tribunes of the plebs had not been elected by the vote of the people, but co-opted at the command of the patricians, matters had now come to
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> this pass, that they must have either patricians or the hangers-on to patricians as tribunes of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Sacred Laws were being wrested from them, the power and authority of their tribunes was being torn away. This, he contended, was done through the craft and cunning of the patricians and the treacherous villainy of his colleagues.</p><p>The flame of popular indignation was now beginning to scorch not only the senate, but even the tribunes of the plebs, co-opted and co-opters alike, when three members of the tribunitian college &mdash;P. Curatius, M. Metilius, and M. Minucius &mdash;trembling for their own safety, instituted proceedings against Sergius and Verginius, the consular tribunes of the preceding year.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> By fixing a day for their trial, they diverted from themselves on to these men the rage and resentment of the plebs. They reminded the people that those who had felt the burden of the levy, the war-tax, and the long duration of the war, those who were distressed at the defeat sustained at Veii, those whose homes were in mourning for
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the loss of children, brothers, and relations, had every one of them the right and the power to visit upon two guilty heads their own personal grief and that of the whole State.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The responsibility for all their misfortunes rested on Sergius and Verginius; this was not more clearly proved by the prosecutor than admitted by the defendants, for whilst both were guilty, each threw the blame on the other, Verginius denouncing the flight of Sergius, and Sergius the treachery of Verginius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They had behaved with such incredible madness that it was in all probability a concerted plan earned out with the general connivance of the patricians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> These men had previously given the Veientines an opening for firing the siege works, now they had betrayed the army and delivered a Roman camp up to the Faliscans. Everything was being done to compel their young men to grow old at Veii, and to make it impossible for their tribunes to secure the support of a full Assembly in
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the City either in their resistance to the concerted action of the senate, or for their proposals regarding the distribution of land and other measures in the interest of the plebs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Judgment had already been passed upon the accused by the senate, the Roman people, and their own colleagues, for it was a vote of the senate which removed them from office, it was their own colleagues who upon their refusal to resign, compelled them to do so by the threat of a Dictator, whilst it was the people who had elected consular tribunes to enter upon office, not on the usual day, December 13, but immediately after their election, on October 1, for the republic could no longer be safe if these men remained in office.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And yet, shattered as they were by so many adverse verdicts, and condemned beforehand, they were presenting themselves for trial, and fancying that they had purged their offence and suffered an adequate punishment because they had been relegated to private life two months before the time.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They did not understand that this was not the infliction of a penalty, but simply the depriving them of power to do further mischief, since their colleagues also had to resign, and they, at all events, had committed no offence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The tribunes continued. <q direct="unspecified">Recall the feelings, Quirites, with which you heard of the disaster which we sustained and watched the army staggering through the gates, panic-stricken fugitives, covered with wounds, accusing not Fortune or any of the gods, but these generals of theirs.
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> We are confident that there is not a man in this Assembly who did not on that day call down curses on the persons and homes and fortunes of L. Verginius and Manius Sergius.
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> It would be utterly inconsistent for you not to use your power, when it is your right and duty to do so, against the men on whom each of you has called down the wrath of heaven. The gods never lay hands themselves on the guilty; it is enough when they arm the injured with the opportunity for vengeance.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The passions of the plebs were roused by these speeches, and they sentenced the accused to a fine of 10,000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign></q> each, in spite of Sergius' attempt to throw the blame on Fortune and the chances of war, and Verginius'
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> appeal that he might not be more unfortunate at home than he had been in the field.</p><p>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The First Plebeian Consular Tribune.</note> turning of the popular indignation in
						<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> this direction threw into the shade the memories of the co-optation of tribunes and the evasion of the Trebonian Law.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As a reward to the plebeians for the sentence they had passed, the victorious tribunes at once gave notice of an agrarian measure. They also prevented contributions being paid in for the war-tax, though pay was required for all those armies, and such successes as had been gained only served to prevent any of the wars from being brought to a close.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The camp at Veii which had been lost was recaptured and strengthened with forts and men to hold them. The consular tribunes, Manius Aemilius and Kaeso Fabius, were in command. M. Furius in the Faliscan territory and Cnaeus Cornelius in that of Capenae found no enemy outside his walls; booty was carried off and the territories were ravaged, the farms and crops being burnt.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The towns were attacked, but not invested; Anxur, however, in the Volscian territory, and situated on high ground, defied all assaults, and after direct attack had proved fruitless, a regular investment by rampart and fosse was commenced.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The conduct of the Volscian campaign had fallen to Valerius Potitus.</p><p>Whilst military affairs were in this position, internal troubles were more difficult to manage than the foreign wars. Owing to the tribunes, the war-tax could not be collected, nor the necessary funds remitted to the commanders; the soldiers clamoured for their pay, and it seemed as though the camp would be polluted by the contagion of the seditious spirit which prevailed in the City.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Taking advantage of the exasperation of the plebs against the senate, the tribunes told them that the long wished for time had come for securing their liberties and transferring the highest office in the State from people like Sergius and Verginius to strong and energetic plebeians.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They did not, however, get further in the exercise of their rights than to secure the election of one member of the plebs as consular tribune, viz.,
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> P. Licinius Calvus &mdash;the rest were patricians &mdash;P. Manlius, L. Titinus, P. Maelius, L. Furius Medullinus, and L. Popilius Volscus.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The plebeians were no less surprised at such a success than the tribune-elect himself; he had not previously filled any high office of State, and was only a senator of long standing, and now advanced in years.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Our authorities are not agreed as to the reason why he was selected first and foremost to taste the sweets of this new dignity. Some believe that he was thrust forward to so high a position through the popularity of his brother, Cnaeus Cornelius, who had been consular tribune the previous year, and had given triple pay to the <q direct="unspecified">knights.</q><note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed">i. e., three times as much as the legionary or foot soldier received.</note> Others attribute it to a well-timed speech he delivered on the agreement of the two orders, which was welcomed by both patricians and plebeians.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In their exultation over this electoral victory, the tribunes of the plebs gave way over the war-tax, and so removed the greatest political difficulty. It was paid in without a murmur and remitted to the army.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Recovery of Anxur &mdash;Pestilence in Rome &mdash;Battle before Veii.</note> Volscian Anxur was recaptured owing to the laxity of the guard during a festival.</p><p>The year was remarkable for such a cold and snowy winter that the roads were blocked and the Tiber rendered unnavigable. There was no change in the price of corn, owing to a previous accumulation
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> of supplies.</p><p>P. Licinius had won his position without exciting any disturbance, more to the delight of the people than to the annoyance of the senate, and he discharged his office in such a way that there was a general desire to choose the consular tribunes out of the plebeians at the
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> next election. The only patrician candidate who secured a place was M. Veturius. The rest, who were plebeians, received the support of nearly all the centuries. Their names were M. Pomponius, Cnaeus Duilius, Volero Publilius, and
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Cnaeus Genucius. In consequence either of the unhealthy weather occasioned by the sudden change from cold to heat, or from some other cause, the severe winter was followed by a pestilential summer, which proved fatal to man
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> and beast. As neither a cause nor a cure could be found for its fatal ravages, the senate ordered the Sibylline Books to be consulted. The priests who had charge of them appointed for the first time in Rome
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> a <foreign lang="la">lectisternium</foreign>. Apollo and Latona, Diana and Hercules, Mercury and Neptune were for eight days propitiated on three couches decked with the most magnificent coverlets that could be obtained. Solemnities were conducted also in
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> private houses. It is stated that throughout the City the front gates of the houses were thrown open and all sorts of things placed for general use in the open courts, all comers, whether acquaintances or strangers, being brought in to share
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the hospitality. Men who had been enemies held friendly and sociable conversations with each other and abstained from all litigation, the manacles even were removed from prisoners during this period, and afterwards it seemed an act of impiety that men to whom the gods had brought such relief should be put in chains again.</p><p>In the meanwhile, at Veii there was increased alarm, created by the three wars being combined
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> in one. For the men of Capenae and Falerii had suddenly arrived to relieve the city, and as on the former occasion, the Romans had to fight a back to back battle round the entrenchments against three armies. What helped them most of all was the recollection of the condemnation of Sergius
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> and Verginius. From the main camp, where on the former occasion there had been inaction, forces were rapidly brought round and attacked the Capenates in the rear while their attention was concentrated on the
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Roman lines. The fighting which ensued created panic in the Faliscan ranks also, and whilst they were wavering, a well-timed charge from the camp routed them, and the victors, following them up, caused immense losses
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> amongst them. Not long afterwards the troops who were devastating the territory of Capenae came upon them whilst straggling in disorder as though safe from attack, and those whom the battle had spared
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> were annihilated. Of the Veientines also, many who were fleeing to the city were killed in front of the gates, which were closed to prevent the Romans from breaking in, and so the hindmost of the fugitives were shut out.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These were the occurrences of the year. And now the time for the election of consular tribunes was approaching. The senate was almost more anxious about this than about the war, for they recognised that they were not simply sharing the supreme power with the plebs, but had almost completely lost it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> An understanding was come to by which their most distinguished members were to come forward as candidates; they believed that for very shame they would not be passed over. Besides this, they resorted to every expedient, just as if they were every one of them candidates, and called to their aid not men alone, but even the gods. They made a religious question of the last two elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the former year, they said, an intolerably severe winter had occurred which seemed to be a divine warning; in the last year they had not warnings only but the judgments themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The pestilence which had visited the country districts and the City was undoubtedly a mark of the divine displeasure, for it had been found in the Books of Fate that to avert that scourge the gods must be appeased.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The auspices were taken before an election, and the gods deemed it an insult that the highest offices should be made common and the distinction of classes thrown into confusion.</p><p>Men were awestruck not only by the dignity and rank of the candidates, but by the religious aspect of the question, and they elected all the consular tribunes from the patricians, the great majority being all men of high distinction.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Those elected were L. Valerius Potitus &mdash;for the fifth time &mdash;M. Valerius Maximus, M. Furius Camillus &mdash;for the second time &mdash;L. Furius Medullinus &mdash;for the third time &mdash;Q. Servilius Fidenates &mdash;for the second time &mdash;and Q. Sulpicius Camerinus &mdash;for the second time.</p><p>During their year of office nothing of any importance was done at Veii; their whole activity was confined to raids.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Two of the commanders-in-chief carried off an enormous quantity of plunder &mdash;Potitus from Falerii and Camillus from Capenae. They left nothing behind which fire or sword could destroy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Rise of the Alban Lake.</note> this period many portents were announced, but as they rested on the testimony of single individuals, and there were no soothsayers to consult as to how to expiate them, owing to the hostile attitude of the Etruscans, these reports were generally disbelieved and disregarded.</p><p>One incident, however, caused universal anxiety.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Alban Lake rose to an unusual height, without any rainfall or other cause which could prevent the phenomenon from appearing supernatural. Envoys were sent to the oracle of Delphi to ascertain why the gods sent the portent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But an explanation was afforded nearer at hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> An aged Veientine was impelled by destiny to announce, amidst the jeers of the Roman and Etruscan outposts, in prophetic strain, that the Romans would never get possession of Veii until the water had been drawn off from the Alban Lake. This was at first treated as a wild utterance, but afterwards it began to be talked about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Owing to the length of the war, there were frequent conversations between the troops on both sides, and a Roman on outpost duty asked one of the townsmen who was nearest to him who the man was who was throwing out such dark hints about the Alban Lake.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he heard that he was a soothsayer, being himself a man not devoid of religious fears, he invited the prophet to an interview on the pretext of wishing to consult him, if he had time, about a portent which demanded his own personal expiation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the two had gone some distance from their respective lines, unarmed, apprehending no danger, the Roman, a young man of immense strength, seized the feeble old man in the sight of all, and in spite of the outcry of the Etruscans, carried him off to his own side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was brought before the commander-in-chief and then sent to the senate in Rome. In reply to inquiries as to what he wanted people to understand by his remark about the Alban Lake, he said that the gods must certainly have been wroth
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> with the people of Veii on the day when they inspired him with the resolve to disclose the ruin which the Fates had prepared for his native city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> What he had then predicted under divine inspiration he could not now recall or unsay, and perhaps he would incur as much guilt by keeping silence about things which it was the will of heaven should be revealed as by uttering what ought to be concealed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It stood recorded in the Books of Fate, and had been handed down by the occult science of the Etruscans, that whenever the water of the Alban Lake overflowed and the Romans drew it off in the appointed way, the victory over the Veientines would be granted them; until that happened the gods would not desert the walls of Veii. Then he explained the prescribed mode of drawing off the water.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The senate, however, did not regard their informant as sufficiently trustworthy in a matter of such importance, and determined to wait for the return of their embassy with the oracular reply of the Pythian god.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Previous<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Tarquinii &mdash;The Answer of the Oracle.</note> to their return, and before any way of dealing with the Alban portent was discovered, the new consular tribunes entered upon office. They were L. Julius Julus, L. Furius Medullinus &mdash;for the fourth time &mdash;L. Sergius Fidenas, A. Postumius Regillensis, P. Cornelius Maluginensis, and A. Manlius.</p><p>This year a new enemy
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> arose. The people of Tarquinii saw that the Romans were engaged in numerous campaigns &mdash;against the Volscians at Anxur, where the garrison was blockaded; against the Aequi at Labici, who were attacking the Roman colonists, and, in addition to these, at Veii, Falerii, and Capenae, whilst, owing to the contentions between the plebs and the senate, things were no quieter within the walls of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> City. Regarding this as a favourable opportunity for mischief, they despatched some light-armed cohorts to harry the Roman territory, in the belief that the Romans would either let the outrage pass unpunished to avoid having another war on their shoulders, or would resent it with a small and weak
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> force. The Romans felt more indignation than anxiety at the raid, and without making any great effort, took prompt steps to avenge it. A. Postumius and L. Julius raised a force, not by a regular levy &mdash;for they were obstructed by the tribunes of the plebs &mdash;but consisting mostly of volunteers whom they had induced by strong appeals to come
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> forward. With this they advanced by cross marches through the territory of Caere and surprised the Tarquinians as they were returning heavily laden with
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> booty. They slew great numbers, stripped the whole force of their baggage, and returned with the recovered possessions from their farms to Rome. Two days were allowed for the owners to identify their
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> property; what was unclaimed on the third day, most of it belonging to the enemy, was sold <q direct="unspecified">under the spear,</q><note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="ed">See note in chap. xxix, Book IV.</note> and the proceeds distributed amongst the
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> soldiers.</p><p>The issues of the other wars, especially of that against Veii, were still undecided, and the Romans were already despairing of success through their own efforts, and were looking to the Fates and the gods, when the embassy returned from Delphi with the sentence of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> oracle. It was in accord with the answer given by the Veientine soothsayer, and ran as follows: &mdash;</p><p><q direct="unspecified">See to it, Roman, that the rising flood At Alba flow not o'er its banks and shape Its channel
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> seawards. Harmless through thy fields Shalt thou disperse it, scattered into rills. Then fiercely press upon thy foeman's walls, For now the Fates have given thee victory. That city which long years thou hast besieged Shall now be
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> thine. And when the war hath end, Do thou, the victor, bear an ample gift Into my temple, and the ancestral rites Now in disuse, see that thou celebrate Anew with all their wonted pomp.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From that time the captive prophet began to be held in very high esteem, and the consular tribunes, Cornelius and Postumius, began to make use of him for the expiation of the Alban portent and the proper method of appeasing the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At length it was discovered why the gods were visiting men for neglected ceremonies and religious duties unperformed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was in fact due to nothing else but the fact that there was a flaw in the election of the magistrates, and consequently they had not proclaimed the Festival of the Latin League and the sacrifice on the Alban Mount with the due formalities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There was only one possible mode of expiation, and that was that the consular tribunes should resign office, the auspices to be taken entirely afresh, and an interrex appointed. All these measures were earned out by a decree of the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were three interreges in succession &mdash;L. Valerius, Q. Servilius Fidenas, and M. Furius Camillus.</p><p>During all this time there were incessant disturbances owing to the tribunes of the plebs hindering the elections until
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> an understanding was come to that the majority of the consular tribunes should be elected from the plebeians.</p><p>Whilst this was going on the national council of Etruria met at the Fane of Voltumna.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Capenates and the Faliscans demanded that all the cantons of Etruria should unite in common action to raise the siege of Veii; they were told in reply that assistance had been previously refused to the Veientines because they had no right to seek help from those whose advice they had not sought in a matter of such importance.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now, however, it was their unfortunate circumstances and not their will that compelled them to refuse. The Gauls, a strange and unknown race, had recently overrun the greatest part of Etruria, and they were not on terms of either assured peace or open war with them.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They would, however, do this much for those of their blood and name, considering the imminent danger of their kinsmen &mdash;if
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> any of their younger men volunteered for the war they would not prevent their going.</p><p>The report spread in Rome that a large number had reached Veii, and in the general alarm the internal dissensions, as usual, began to calm down.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The prerogative centuries elected P. Licinius Calvus consular tribune, though he was not a candidate. His appointment was not at all distasteful to the senate, for when in office before he had shown himself a man of moderate views.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was, however, advanced in years. As the voting proceeded it became clear that all who had been formerly his colleagues in office were being reappointed one after another. They were L. Titinius, P. Maenius, Q. Manlius, Cnaeus Genucius, and L. Atilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After the tribes had been duly summoned to hear the declaration of the poll, but before it was actually published, P. Licinius Calvus, by permission of the interrex, spoke as follows: <q direct="unspecified">I see, Quirites, that from what you remember of our former tenure of office, you are seeking in these elections an omen of concord for the coming year, a thing most of all helpful in the present state of affairs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, whilst you are re-electing my old comrades, who have become wiser and stronger by experience, you see in me not the man I was, but only a mere shadow and name of P. Licinius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> My bodily powers are worn out, my sight and hearing are impaired, my memory is failing, my mental vigour is dulled. Here,</q> he said, holding his son by the hand, <q direct="unspecified">is a young man, the image and counterpart of him whom in days gone by you elected as the first consular tribune taken from the ranks of the plebs.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This young man whom I have trained and moulded I now hand over and dedicate to the republic to take my place, and I beg you, Quirites, to confer this honour which you have bestowed unsought on me, on him who is seeking it, and whose candidature I would fain support and further by my prayers.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His request was granted, and his son P. Licinius was formally announced as consular tribune with those above mentioned.</p><p>Titinius and Genucius marched against the Faliscans and Capenates, but they proceeded with more courage than caution and fell into an ambuscade.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Genucius atoned for his rashness by an honourable death, and fell fighting amongst the foremost. Titinius rallied his men from the disorder into which they had fallen and gained some rising ground where he reformed his line, but would not come down to continue the fight on level terms.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> More disgrace was incurred than loss, but it almost resulted in a terrible disaster, so great was the alarm it created not only in Rome, where very exaggerated accounts were received, but also in the camp before Veii.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Here a rumour had gained ground that after the destruction of the generals and their army, the victorious Capenates and Faliscans and the whole military strength of Etruria had proceeded to Veii and were at no great distance; in consequence of this the soldiers were with difficulty restrained from taking to flight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Still more disquieting rumours were current in Rome; at one moment they imagined that the camp before Veii had been stormed, at another that a part of the enemies' forces was in full march to the City.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They hurried to the walls; the matrons, whom the general alarm had drawn from their homes, made prayers and supplications in the temples; solemn petitions were offered up to the gods that they would ward off destruction from the houses and temples of the City and from the walls of Rome, and divert the fears and alarms to Veii if the sacred rites had been duly restored and the portents expiated.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Capture of Veii.</note> this time the Games and the Latin Festival had been celebrated afresh, and the water drawn off from the Alban Lake on the fields, and now the fated doom was closing over Veii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accordingly the commander destined by the Fates for the destruction of that city and the salvation of his country &mdash;M. Furius Camillus &mdash;was nominated Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He appointed as his Master of the Horse P. Cornelius Scipio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> With the change in the command everything else suddenly changed; men's hopes were different, their spirits were different, even the fortunes of the City wore a different aspect.</p><p>His first measure was to execute military justice upon those who had fled during the panic from the camp, and he made the soldiers realise that it was not the enemy who was most to be feared.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then appointed a day for the enrolment of troops, and in the interim went to Veii to encourage the soldiers, after which he returned to Rome to raise a fresh army. Not a man tried to escape enlistment. Even foreign troops &mdash;Latins and Hernicans &mdash;came to offer assistance for the war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Dictator formally thanked them in the senate, and as all the preparations for war were now sufficiently advanced, he vowed, in pursuance of a senatorial decree, that on the capture of Veii he would celebrate the Great Games and restore and dedicate the temple of Matuta the Mother, which had been originally dedicated by Servius Tullius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He left the City with his army amid a general feeling of anxious expectation rather than of hopeful confidence on the part of the citizens, and his first engagement was with the Faliscans and Capenates in the territory of Nepete.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As usual where everything was managed with consummate skill and prudence, success followed. He not only defeated the enemy in the field, but he stripped them of their camp and secured immense booty. The greater part was sold and the proceeds paid over to the quaestor, the smaller share was given to the soldiers.</p><p>From there the army was led to Veii.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The forts were constructed more closely together. Frequent skirmishes had occurred at random in the space between the city wall and the Roman lines, and an edict was issued that none should fight without orders, thereby keeping the soldiers to the construction of the siege works.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By far the greatest and most difficult of these was a mine which was commenced, and designed to lead into the enemies' citadel.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That the work might not be interrupted, or the troops exhausted by the same men being continuously employed in underground labour, he formed the army into six divisions. Each division was told off in rotation to work for six hours at a time; the work went on without any intermission until they had made a way into the citadel.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the Dictator saw that victory was now within his grasp, that a very wealthy city was on the point of capture, and that there would be more booty than had been amassed in all the previous wars taken together, he
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> was anxious to avoid incurring the anger of the soldiers through too niggardly a distribution of it on the one hand, and the jealousy of the senate through too lavish a grant of it on the other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He sent a despatch to the senate in which he stated that through the gracious favour of heaven, his own generalship, and the persevering efforts
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> of his soldiers, Veii would in a very few hours be in the power of Rome, and he asked for their decision as to the disposal of the booty.</p><p>The senate were divided. It is reported that the aged P. Licinius, who was the first to be asked his opinion by his son, urged that the people should receive public notice that whoever wanted to share in the spoils should go to the camp at Veii.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Appius Claudius took the opposite line. He stigmatised the proposed largesse as unprecedented, wasteful, unfair, reckless. If, he said, they once thought it sinful for money taken from the enemy to lie in the treasury, drained as it had been by the wars, he would advise that the pay of the soldiers be supplied from that source, so that the plebs might have so much less tax to pay.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <q direct="unspecified">The homes of all would feel alike the benefit of a common boon, the rewards won by brave warriors would not be filched by the hands of city loafers, ever greedy for plunder, for it so constantly happens that those who usually seek the foremost place in toil and danger are the least active in appropriating the spoils.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Licinius on the other hand said that <q direct="unspecified">this money would always be regarded with suspicion and aversion, and would supply material for indictments before the plebs, and consequently bring about disturbances and revolutionary measures.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was better, therefore, that the plebs should be conciliated by this gift, that those who had been crushed and exhausted by so many years of taxation should be relieved and get some enjoyment from the spoils of a war in which they had almost become old men. When any one brings home something he has taken from the enemy with his own hand, it affords him more pleasure and gratification than if he were to receive many times its value at the bidding of another.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Dictator had referred the question to the senate because he wanted to avoid the odium and misrepresentations which it might occasion; the senate, in its turn, ought to entrust it to the plebs and allow each to keep what the fortune of war has given him.</q></p><p>This was felt to be the safer course, as it would make the senate popular.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Notice accordingly was given that those who thought fit should go to the Dictator in camp to share in the plunder of Veii.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>An enormous crowd went and filled the camp. After the Dictator had taken the auspices and issued orders for the soldiers to arm for battle, he uttered this prayer:
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <q direct="unspecified">Pythian Apollo, guided and inspired by thy will I go forth to destroy the city of Veii, and a tenth part of its spoils I devote to thee.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thee too, Queen Juno, who now dwellest in Veii, I beseech, that thou wouldst follow us, after our victory, to the City which is ours and which will soon be thine, where a temple worthy of thy majesty will receive thee.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After this prayer, finding himself superior in numbers, he attacked the city on all sides, to distract the enemies' attention from the impending danger of the mine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Veientines, all unconscious that their doom had already been sealed by their own prophets and by oracles in foreign lands, that some of the gods had already been invited to their share in the spoils, whilst others, called upon in prayer to leave their city, were looking to new abodes in the temples of their foes;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> all unconscious that they were spending their last day, without the slightest suspicion that their walls had been undermined and their citadel already filled with the enemy, hurried with
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> their weapons to the walls, each as best he could, wondering what had happened to make the Romans, after never stirring from their lines for so many days, now run recklessly up to the walls as though struck with sudden
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> frenzy.</p><p>At this point a tale is introduced to the effect that whilst the king of the Veientines was offering sacrifice, the soothsayer announced that victory would be granted to him who had cut out the sacrificial parts of the victim. His words were heard by the soldiers in the mine, they burst through, seized the parts and carried them to the Dictator.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But in questions of such remote antiquity I should count it sufficient if what bears the stamp of probability be taken as true.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Statements like this, which are more fitted to adorn a stage which delights in the marvellous than to inspire belief, it is not worth while either to affirm or deny.</p><p>The mine, which was now full of picked soldiers, suddenly discharged its armed force in the temple of Juno, which was inside the citadel of Veii. Some attacked the enemy on the walls from behind, others forced back the bars of the gates, others again set fire to the houses from which stones and tiles were being hurled by women and slaves.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Everything resounded with the confused noise of terrifying threats and shrieks of despairing anguish blended with the wailing of women and children.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In a very short time the defenders were driven from the walls and the city gates flung open.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Some rushed in in close order, others scaled the deserted walls; the city was filled with Romans; fighting went on everywhere. At length, after great carnage, the fighting slackened, and the Dictator ordered the heralds to proclaim that the unarmed were to be spared.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> That put a stop to the bloodshed, those who were unarmed began to surrender, and the soldiers dispersed with the Dictator's permission in quest of booty.
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> This far surpassed all expectation both in its amount and its value, and when the Dictator saw it before him he is reported to have raised his hands to heaven and prayed that if any of the gods deemed the good fortune which had befallen him and the Romans to be too great, the jealousy which it caused might be allayed by such a calamity as would be least injurious to him and to Rome.
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The tradition runs that whilst he was turning round during this devotion he stumbled and fell. To those who judged after the event it appeared as if that omen pointed to Camillus' own condemnation and the subsequent capture of Rome which occurred a few years 
							<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/>later.</p><p>That day was spent in the massacre of the enemy and the sack of the city with its enormous wealth.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following day the Dictator sold all freemen who had been spared, as slaves. The money so realised was the only amount paid into the public treasury, but even that proceeding roused the ire of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As for the spoil they brought home with them, they did not acknowledge themselves under any obligation for it either to their general, who, they thought, had referred a matter within his own competence to the senate in the hope of getting their authority for his niggardliness, nor did they feel any gratitude to the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was the Licinian family to whom they gave the credit, for it was the father who had advocated the popular measure and the son who had taken the opinion of the senate upon it.</p><p>When all that belonged to man had been carried away from Veii, they began to remove from the temples the votive gifts that had been made to the gods, and then the gods themselves;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but this they did as worshippers rather than as plunderers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The deportation of Queen Juno to Rome was entrusted to a body of men selected from the whole army, who after performing their ablutions and arraying themselves in white vestments, reverently entered the temple and in a spirit of holy dread placed their hands on the statue, for it was as a rule only the priest of one particular house who, by Etruscan usage, touched it. Then one of them, either under a sudden inspiration, or in a spirit of youthful mirth, said, <q direct="unspecified">Art thou willing, Juno, to go to Rome?</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The rest exclaimed that the goddess nodded assent. An addition to the story was made to the effect that she was heard to say, <q direct="unspecified">I am willing.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At all events we have it that she was moved from her place by appliances of little power, and proved light and easy of transport, as though she were following of her own accord.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> She was brought without mishap to the Aventine, her everlasting seat, whither the prayers of the Roman Dictator had called her, and where this same Camillus afterwards dedicated the temple which he had vowed. Such was the fall of Veii, the most wealthy city of the Etruscan league, showing its greatness even in its final overthrow, since after being besieged for ten summers and winters and inflicting more loss than it sustained, it succumbed at last to destiny, being after all carried by a mine and not by direct assault.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although the portents had been averted by due expiation and the answers given by the soothsayer and the oracle were matters of common knowledge, and all that man could do had been done by the selection of M. Furius, the greatest of all commanders &mdash;notwithstanding
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> all this, when the capture of Veii was announced in Rome, after so many years of undecided warfare and numerous defeats, the rejoicing was as great as if there had been no hope of success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Anticipating the order of the senate, all the temples were filled with Roman mothers offering thanksgivings to the gods. The senate ordered that the public thanksgivings should be continued for four days, a longer period than for any previous war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The arrival of the Dictator, too, whom all classes poured out to meet, was welcomed by a greater concourse than that of any general before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> His triumph went far beyond the usual mode of celebrating the day; himself the most conspicuous object of all, he was drawn into the City by a team of white horses, which men thought unbecoming even for a mortal man, let alone a Roman citizen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They saw with superstitious alarm the Dictator putting himself on a level in his equipage with Jupiter and Sol, and this one circumstance made his triumph more brilliant than popular.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After this he signed a contract for building the temple of Queen Juno on the Aventine and dedicated one to Matuta the Mother. After having thus discharged his duties to gods and men he resigned his Dictatorship.</p><p>Subsequently a difficulty arose about the offering to Apollo.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Camillus stated that he had vowed a tenth of the spoils to the deity, and the college of pontiffs decided that the people must fulfil their religious obligation.<note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed">Camillus had made his vow in the name of the State, as Dictator, and so the whole people were bound to take their share in redeeming it.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But it was not easy to find a way of ordering the people to restore their share of booty so that the due proportion might be set apart for sacred purposes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At length recourse was had to what seemed the smoothest plan, namely, that any one who wished to discharge the obligation for himself and his household should make a valuation of his share and contribute the value of a tenth of it to the public treasury, in
						<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> order that out of the proceeds a golden crown might be made, worthy of the grandeur of the temple and the august divinity of the god, and such as the honour of the Roman people demanded.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This contribution still further estranged the feelings of the plebeians from Camillus.</p><p>During these occurrences envoys from the Volscians and Aequi came to sue for peace. They succeeded in obtaining it, not so much because they deserved it as that the commonwealth, wearied with such a long war, might enjoy repose.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Internal Dissensions arising from the Conquest of Veii.</note> year following the capture of Veii had for the six consular tribunes two of the Publii Cornelii, namely, Cossus and Scipio, M. Valerius Maximus &mdash;for the second time &mdash;Caeso Fabius Ambustus &mdash;for the third time &mdash;L. Furius Medullinus &mdash;for the fifth time &mdash;and Q. Servilius &mdash;for the third time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The war against the Faliscans was allotted to the Cornelii, that against Capenae to Valerius and Servilius. They did not make any attempt to take cities either by assault or investment, but confined themselves to ravaging the country and carrying off the property of the agriculturists; not a single fruit tree, no produce whatever, was left on the land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These losses broke the resistance of the Capenates, they sued for peace and it was granted them. Amongst the Faliscans the war went on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In Rome, meanwhile, disturbances arose on various matters. In order to quiet them it had been decided to plant a colony on the Volscian frontier, and the names of 3000 Roman citizens were entered for it. Triumvirs appointed for the purpose had divided the land into lots of 3 7/12 <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign> per man.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This grant began to be looked upon with contempt, they regarded it as a sop offered to them to divert them from hoping for something better. <q direct="unspecified">Why,</q> they asked, <q direct="unspecified">were plebeians to be sent into banishment amongst the Volscians when the splendid city of Veii and the territory of the Veientines was within view, more fertile and more ample than the territory of Rome?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Whether in respect of its situation or of the magnificence of its public and private buildings and its open spaces, they gave that city the preference over Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They even brought forward a proposal, which met with still more support after the capture of Rome by the Gauls, for migrating to Veii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They intended, however, that Veii should be inhabited by a portion of the plebs and a part of the senate;
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> they thought it a feasible project that two separate cities should be inhabited by the Roman people and form one State.</p><p>In opposition to these proposals, the nobility went so far as to declare that they would sooner die before the eyes of the Roman people than that any of those schemes should be put to the vote.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If, they argued, there was so much dissension in one city, what would there be in two? Could any one possibly prefer a conquered to a conquering city, and allow Veii to enjoy a greater good fortune after its capture than while it stood safe?
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was possible that in the end they might be left behind in their native City by their fellow-citizens, but no power on earth would compel them to abandon their native City and their fellow-citizens in order to follow T. Sicinius &mdash;the proposer of this measure &mdash;to Veii as its new founder, and so abandon Romulus, a god and the son of a god, the father and creator of the City of Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This discussion was attended by disgraceful quarrels, for the senate had drawn over a section of the tribunes of the plebs to their
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> view, and the only thing that restrained the plebeians from offering personal violence was the use which the patricians made of their personal influence. Whenever shouts were raised to get up a brawl, the leaders of the senate were the first to go into the crowd and tell them to vent their rage on them, to beat and kill them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The mob shrank from offering violence to men of their age and rank and distinction, and this feeling prevented them from attacking the other patricians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Camillus went about delivering harangues everywhere, and saying that it was no wonder that the citizens had gone mad, for though bound by a vow, they showed more anxiety about everything than about discharging their religious obligations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He would say nothing about the contribution, which was really a sacred offering rather than a tithe, and since each individual bound himself to a tenth, the State, as such, was free from the obligation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But his conscience would not allow him to keep silence about the assertion that the tenth only applied to movables, and that no mention was made of the city and its territory, which were also really included in the vow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As the senate considered the question a difficult one to decide, they referred it to the pontiffs, and Camillus was invited to discuss it with them. They decided that of all that had belonged to the Veientines before the vow was uttered and had subsequently passed into the power of Rome, a tenth part was sacred to Apollo. Thus the city and territory came into the estimate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The money was drawn from the treasury, and the consular tribunes were commissioned to purchase gold with it. As there was not a sufficient supply, the matrons, after meeting to talk the matter over, made themselves by common consent responsible to the tribunes for the gold, and sent all their trinkets to the treasury.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The senate were in the highest degree grateful for this, and the tradition goes that in return for this munificence the matrons had conferred upon them the honour of driving to sacred festivals and games in a carriage, and on holy days and work days in a two-wheeled car.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The gold received from each was appraised in order that the proper amount of money might be paid for it, and it was decided that a golden bowl should be made and carried to Delphi as a gift to Apollo.</p><p>When the religious question no longer claimed their attention, the tribunes of the plebs renewed their agitation;
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the passions of the populace were aroused against all the leading men, most of all against Camillus.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They said that by devoting the spoils of Veii to the State and to the gods he had reduced them to nothing. They attacked the senators furiously in their absence;
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> when they were present and confronted their rage, shame kept them silent.</p><p>As soon as the plebeians saw that the matter would be carried over into the following year, they reappointed the supporters of the proposal as their tribunes; the patricians devoted themselves to securing the same support for those who had vetoed the proposal. Consequently, nearly all the same tribunes of the plebs were re-elected.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Conquest of Falerii.</note> the election of consular tribunes the patricians succeeded by the utmost exertions in securing the return of M. Furius Camillus. They pretended that in view of the wars they were providing themselves with a general; their real object was to get a man who would oppose the corrupt policy of the plebeian tribunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His comrades in the tribuneship were L. Furius Medullinus &mdash;for the sixth time &mdash;C. Aemilius, L. Valerius Publicola, S. Postumius, and P. Cornelius &mdash;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> for the second time.</p><p>At the beginning of the year the tribunes of the plebs made no move until Camillus left for operations against the Faliscans, the theatre of war assigned to him. This delay took the heart out of their agitation, whilst Camillus, the adversary whom they most dreaded, was gaining fresh glory amongst the Faliscans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At first the enemy kept within their walls, thinking this the safest course, but by devastating their fields and burning their farms he compelled them to come outside their city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They were afraid to go very far, and fixed their camp about a mile away; the only thing which gave them any sense of security was the difficulty of approaching it, as all the country round was rough and broken, and the roads narrow in some parts, in others steep. Camillus, however, had gained information from a prisoner captured in the neighbourhood, and made him act as guide.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After breaking up his camp in the dead of night, he showed himself at daybreak in a position considerably higher than the enemy. The Romans of the third line<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed">For the <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign>, see note, chap xlvii, Book II.</note> began to entrench, the rest of the army stood ready for battle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the enemy attempted to hinder the work of entrenchment, he defeated them and put them to flight, and such a panic seized the Faliscans that in their disorderly flight they were carried past their own camp, which was nearer to them, and made for their city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many were killed and wounded before they could get inside their gates. The camp was taken, the booty sold, and the proceeds paid over to the quaestors, to the intense indignation of the soldiers, but they were overawed by the sternness of their general's discipline, and though they hated his firmness, at the same time they admired it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The city was now invested and regular siege-works were constructed. For some time the townsmen used to attack the Roman outposts whenever they saw an opportunity, and frequent skirmishes took place. Time went on and hope inclined to neither side; corn and other supplies had been previously collected, and the besieged were better provisioned than the besiegers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The task seemed likely to be as long as it had been at Veii, had not fortune given the Roman commander an opportunity of displaying that greatness of mind which had already been proved in deeds of war, and so secured him an early victory.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was the custom of the Faliscans to employ the same person as the master and also as the attendant of their children, and several boys used to be entrusted to one man's care; a custom which prevails in Greece at the present time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Naturally, the man who had the highest reputation for learning was appointed to instruct the children of the principal men. This man had started the practice, in the time of peace, of taking the boys outside the gates for games and exercise, and he kept up the practice after the war had begun, taking them sometimes a shorter, sometimes a longer distance from the city gate. Seizing a favourable opportunity, he kept up the games and the conversations longer than usual, and went on till he was in the midst of the Roman outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then took them into the camp and up to Camillus in the headquarters tent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There he aggravated his villainous act by a still more villainous utterance. He had, he said, given Falerii into the hands of the Romans, since those boys, whose fathers were at the head of affairs in the city, were now placed in their power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> On hearing this Camillus replied, <q direct="unspecified">You, villain, have not come with your villainous offer to a nation or a commander like yourself.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Between us and the Faliscans there is no fellowship based on a formal compact as between man and man, but the fellowship which is based on natural instincts exists between us, and will continue to do so. There are rights of war as there are rights of peace, and we have learnt to wage our wars with justice no less than with courage.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We do not use our weapons against those of an age which is spared even in the capture of cities, but against those who are armed as we are, and who without any injury or provocation from us attacked the Roman camp at Veii.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These men you, as far as you could, have vanquished by an unprecedented act of villainy; I shall vanquish them as I vanquished Veii, by Roman arts, by courage and strategy and force of arms.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then ordered him to be stripped and his hands tied behind his back, and delivered him up to the boys to be taken back to Falerii, and gave them rods with which to scourge the traitor into the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The people came in crowds to see the sight, the magistrates thereupon convened the senate to discuss the extraordinary incident, and in the end such a revulsion of feeling took place that the very people who in the madness of their rage and hatred would almost sooner have shared the fate of Veii than obtained the peace which Capena enjoyed, now found themselves in company with the whole city asking for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Roman sense of honour, the commander's love of justice, were in all men's mouths in the forum and in the senate, and in accordance with the universal wish, ambassadors were despatched to Camillus in the camp, and with his sanction to the senate in Rome, to make the surrender of Falerii.</p><p>On being introduced to the senate, they are reported to have made the following speech: <q direct="unspecified">Senators!

The Faliscans were ordered to supply the pay of the troops for that year, in order that the Roman people might be free from the war-tax. After the peace was granted, the army was marched back to Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After thus subduing the enemy by his justice and good faith, Camillus returned to the City invested with a much nobler glory than when white horses drew him through it in his triumph. The senate could not withstand the delicate reproof of his silence, but at once proceeded to free him from his vow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> L. Valerius, L. Sergius, and A. Manlius were appointed as a deputation to carry the golden bowl, made as a gift to Apollo, to Delphi, but the solitary warship in which they were sailing was captured by Liparean pirates not far from the Straits of Sicily, and taken to the islands of Liparae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Piracy was regarded as a kind of State institution, and it was the custom for the government to distribute the plunder thus acquired. That year the supreme magistracy was held by Timasitheus, a man more akin to the Romans in character than to his own countrymen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As he himself reverenced the name and office of the ambassadors, the gift they had in charge and the god to whom it was being sent, so he inspired the multitude, who generally share the views of their ruler, with a proper religious sense of their duty. The deputation were conducted to the State guest-house, and from there sent on their way to Delphi with a protecting escort of ships, he then brought them back safe to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Friendly relations were established with him on the part of the State, and presents bestowed upon him.</p><p>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Aequi.</note> this year there was war with the Aequi of so undecided a character that it was a matter of uncertainty, both in the armies themselves and in Rome, whether they were victorious or vanquished.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The two consular tribunes, C. Aemilius and Spurius Postumius, were in command of the Roman army.</p><p>At first they carried on joint operations; after the enemy had been routed in the field, they arranged that Aemilius should hold Verrugo whilst Postumius devastated their territory.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst he was marching somewhat carelessly after his success, with his men out of order, he was attacked by the Aequi, and such a panic ensued that his troops were driven to the nearest hills, and the alarm spread even to the other army at Verrugo.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After they had retreated to a safe position, Postumius summoned his men to assembly and severely rebuked them for their panic and flight, and for having been routed by such a cowardly and easily defeated foe. With one voice the army exclaimed that his reproaches were deserved; they had, they confessed, behaved disgracefully, but they would themselves repair their fault, the enemy would not long have cause for rejoicing.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They asked him to lead them at once against the enemy's camp &mdash;it was in full view down in the plain &mdash;and no punishment would be too severe if they failed to take it before nightfall.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He commended their eagerness, and ordered them to refresh themselves and to be ready by the fourth watch. The enemy, expecting the Romans to attempt a nocturnal flight from their hill, were posted to cut them off from the road leading to Verrugo. The action commenced before dawn, but as there was a moon all night, the battle was as clearly visible as if it had been fought by day.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The shouting reached Verrugo, and they believed that the Roman camp was being attacked. This created such a panic that in spite of all the appeals of Aemilius in his efforts to restrain them, the garrison broke away and fled in scattered groups to Tusculum.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thence the rumour was carried to Rome that Postumius and his army were slain.</p><p>As soon as the rising dawn had removed all apprehensions of a surprise in case the pursuit was carried too far, Postumius rode down the ranks demanding the fulfilment of their promise.
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The enthusiasm of the troops was so roused that the Aequi no longer withstood the attack. Then followed a slaughter of the fugitives, such as might be expected where men are actuated by rage even more than by courage; the army was destroyed. The doleful report from Tusculum and the groundless fears of the City were followed by a laurelled despatch<note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">The despatch in which a victorious general announced his success was wrapped in a wreath of bay leaves.</note> from Postumius announcing the victory of Rome and the annihilation of the Aequian army.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Domestic Politics.</note> the agitation of the tribunes of the plebs had so far been without result, the plebeians exerted themselves to secure the continuance in office of the proposers of the land measure, whilst the patricians strove for the re-election of those who had vetoed it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The plebeians, however, carried the election, and the senate in revenge for this mortification passed a resolution for the appointment of consuls, the magistracy which the plebs detested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After fifteen years, consuls were once more elected in the persons of L. Lucretius Flavus and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus.</p><p>At the beginning of the year, as none of their college was disposed to interpose his veto, the tribunes were combined in a determined effort to carry their measure, while the consuls, for the same reason, offered a no less strenuous resistance.</p><p>Whilst all the citizens were preoccupied with this struggle, the Aequi successfully attacked the Roman colony at Vitellia, which was situated in their territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Most of the colonists were uninjured, for the fact of its treacherous capture taking place in the night gave them the chance of escaping in the opposite direction from the enemy and reaching Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That field of operations fell to L. Lucretius. He advanced against the enemy and defeated them in a regular engagement, and then came back victorious to Rome, where a still more serious contest awaited him.</p><p>A day had been fixed for the prosecution of A. Verginius and Q. Pomponius, who had been tribunes of the plebs two years previously.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate unanimously agreed that their honour was concerned in defending them, for no one brought any charge against them touching their private life or their public action; the only ground of indictment was that it was to please the senate that they had exercised their veto.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The influence of the senate, however, was overborne by the angry temper of the plebeians, and a most vicious precedent was set by the condemnation of those innocent men to a fine of 10,000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign></q> each.</p><p>The senate were extremely distressed.
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Camillus openly accused the plebeians of treason in turning against their own magistrates because they did not see that through this iniquitous judgment they had taken from their tribunes the power of veto, and in depriving them of that had overthrown their power.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They were deceived if they expected the senate to put up with the absence of any restraint upon the licence of that magistracy. If the violence of tribunes could not be met by the veto of tribunes, the senate would find another weapon.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He poured blame on the consuls also for having silently allowed the honour of the State to be compromised in the case of tribunes who had followed the instructions of the senate. By openly repeating these charges he embittered the feeling of the populace more every day.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The senate, on the other hand, he was perpetually inciting to oppose the measure.<note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed">i. e., the proposal to make Veii a second Rome.</note> They must not, he said, go down to the Forum, when the day came for voting on it, in any other temper than that of men who realised that they would have to fight for their hearths and altars, for the temples of the gods, and even for the soil on which they had been born.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As for himself, if he dared to think of his own reputation when his country's existence was at stake, it would be indeed an honour to him that the city which he had taken should become a popular resort, that that memorial of his glory should give him daily delight, that he should have before his eyes the city which had been caried in his triumphal procession,<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed">Livy is thinking here of the custom, at a later time, of carrying pictures or models of conquered towns in the triumphal procession.</note> and that all should tread in the track of his renown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But he considered it an offence against heaven for a city to be repeopled after it had been deserted and abandoned by the gods, or for the Roman people to dwell on a soil enslaved and
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> change the conquering country for a conquered one.</p><p>Roused by these appeals of their leader, the senators, old and young, came down in a body to the Forum when the proposal was being put to the vote.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They dispersed among the tribes, and each taking his fellow-tribesmen by the hand, implored them with tears not to desert the fatherland, for which they and their fathers had fought so bravely and so successfully.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They pointed to the Capitol, the temple of Vesta, and the other divine temples round them, and besought them not to drive the Roman people, as homeless exiles, from their ancestral soil and their household gods into the city of their foes. They even went so far as to say that it were better that Veii had never been taken than that Rome should be deserted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As they were having recourse not to violence but to entreaties, and were interspersing their entreaties with frequent mention of the gods, it became for the majority of voters a religious question and the measure was defeated by a majority of
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> one tribe.</p><p>The senate were so delighted at their victory that on the following day a resolution was passed, at the instance of the consuls, that seven <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign> of the Veientine territory should be allotted to each plebeian, and not to the heads of families only, account was taken of all the children in the house, that men might be willing to bring up children in the hope that they would receive their share.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Various Wars.</note> bounty soothed the feelings of the plebs, and no opposition was offered to the election of consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The two elected were L. Valerius Potitus and M. Manlius, who afterwards received the title of Capitolinus. They celebrated the <q direct="unspecified">Great Games</q> which M. Furius had vowed when Dictator in the Veientine war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the same year the temple of Queen Juno, which he had also vowed at the same time, was dedicated, and the tradition runs that this dedication excited great interest amongst the matrons, who were present in large numbers.</p><p>An unimportant campaign was conducted against the Aequi on Algidus;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the enemy were routed almost before they came to close quarters. Valerius had shown greater energy in following up the fugitives; he was accordingly decreed a triumph; Manlius an ovation.</p><p>In the same year a new enemy appeared in the Volsinians.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Owing to famine and pestilence in the district round Rome, in consequence of excessive heat and drought, it was impossible for an army to march. This emboldened the Volsinians in conjunction with the Salpinates to make inroads upon Roman territory. Thereupon war was declared against the two States.</p><p>C. Julius, the censor, died, and M. Cornelius was appointed in his place.
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This proceeding was afterwards regarded as an offence against religion because it was during that <foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign> that Rome was taken, and no one has ever since been appointed as censor in the room of one deceased.
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consuls were attacked by the epidemic, so it was decided that the auspices should be taken afresh by an interrex.
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls accordingly resigned office in compliance with a resolution of the senate, and M. Furius Camillus was appointed interrex. He appointed P. Cornelius Scipio as his successor, and Scipio appointed L. Valerius Potitus.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The last named appointed six consular tribunes, so that if any of them became incapacitated through illness there might still be a sufficiency of magistrates to administer the republic.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These were L. Lucretius, Servius Sulpicius, M. Aemilius, L. Furius Medullinus &mdash;for the seventh time &mdash;Agrippa Furius, and C. Aemilius &mdash;for the second time. They entered upon office on the 1st of July.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> L. Lucretius and C. Aemilius were charged with the campaign against the Volsinians; Agrippa Furius and Servius Sulpicius with the one against the Salpinates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The first action took place with the Volsinians; an immense number of the enemy were engaged, but the fighting was by no means severe. Their line was scattered at the first shock; 8000 who were surrounded by the cavalry laid down their arms and surrendered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On hearing of this battle the Salpinates would not trust themselves to a regular engagement in the field, but sought the protection of their walls. The Romans carried off plunder in all directions from both the Salpinate and Volsinian territories without meeting any resistance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At last the Volsinians, tired of the war, obtained a truce for twenty years on condition that they paid an indemnity for their previous raid and supplied the year's pay for the army.</p><p>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Banishment of Camillus.</note> was in this year that Marcus Caedicius, a member of the plebs, reported to the tribunes that whilst he
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> was in the Via Nova where the chapel now stands, above the temple of Vesta, he heard in the silence of the night a voice more powerful than any human voice bidding the magistrates be told that the Gauls were approaching.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No notice was taken of this, partly owing to the humble rank of the informant, and partly because the Gauls were a distant and therefore an unknown nation.</p><p>It was not the monitions of the gods only that were set at nought in face of the coming doom. The one human aid which they had against it, M. Furius Camillus, was removed from the City.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He was impeached by the plebeian tribune L. Apuleius for his action with reference to the spoils of Veii, and at the time had just been bereaved of his son. He invited the members of his tribe and his clients, who formed a considerable part of the plebs, to his house and sounded their feelings towards him. They told him that they would pay whatever fine was imposed, but it was impossible for them to acquit him.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thereupon he went into exile, after offering up a prayer to the immortal gods that if he were suffering wrongfully as an innocent man, they would make his ungrateful citizens very soon feel the need of him. He was condemned in his absence to pay a fine of15,000 <q direct="unspecified"><foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>.</q></p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Migrations of the Gauls into Italy.</note> the expulsion of that citizen whose presence, if there is anything certain in human affairs, would have made the capture of Rome impossible, the doom of the fated City swiftly approached. Ambassadors came from Clusium begging for assistance against the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The tradition is that this nation, attracted by the report of the delicious fruits and especially of the wine &mdash;a novel pleasure to them &mdash;crossed the Alps and occupied the lands formerly cultivated by the Etruscans, and that Arruns of Clusium imported wine into Gaul in order to allure them into Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His wife had been seduced by a Lucumo, to whom he was guardian, and from whom, being a young man of considerable influence, it was impossible to get redress without getting help from abroad.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In revenge, Arruns led the Gauls across the Alps and prompted them to attack Clusium.</p><p>I would not deny that the Gauls were conducted to Clusium by Arruns or some one else living there, but it is quite clear that those who attacked that city were not the first who crossed the Alps.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As a matter of fact, Gauls crossed into Italy two centuries before they attacked Clusium and took Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nor were the Clusines the first Etruscans with whom the Gaulish armies came into conflict; long before that they had fought many battles with the Etruscans who dwelt between the Apennines and the Alps.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Before the Roman supremacy, the power of the Tuscans was widely extended both by sea and land. How far it extended over the two seas by which Italy is surrounded like an island is proved by the names, for the nations of Italy call the one the <q direct="unspecified">Tuscan Sea,</q> from the general designation of the people, and the other the <q direct="unspecified">Atriatic,</q> from Atria, a Tuscan colony.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Greeks also call them the <q direct="unspecified">Tyrrhene</q> and the <q direct="unspecified">Adriatic.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The districts stretching towards either sea were inhabited by them. They first settled on this side the Apennines by the western sea in twelve cities, afterwards they founded twelve colonies beyond the Apennines, corresponding to the number of the mother cities.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> These colonies held the whole of the country beyond the Po as far as the Alps, with the exception of the corner inhabited by the Veneti, who dwelt round an arm of the sea.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Alpine tribes are undoubtedly of the same stock, especially the Raetii, who had through the nature of their country become so uncivilised that they retained no trace of their original condition except their language, and even this was not free from corruption.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the passage of the Gauls into Italy we have received the following account. Whilst Tarquinius Priscus was king of Rome, the supreme power amongst the Celts, who formed a third part of the whole of Gaul, was in the hands of the Bituriges; they used to furnish the king for the whole Celtic race.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Ambigatus was king at that time, a man eminent for his own personal courage and prosperity as much as for those of his dominions. During his sway the harvests were so abundant and the population increased so rapidly in Gaul that the government of such vast numbers seemed almost impossible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He was now an old man, and anxious to relieve his realm from the burden of over-population. With this view he signified his intention of sending his sister's sons Bellovesus and Segovesus, both enterprising young men, to settle in whatever locality the gods should by augury assign to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They were to invite as many as wished to accompany them, sufficient to prevent any nation from repelling their approach. When the auspices were taken, the Hercynian forest was assigned to Segovesus; to Bellovesus the gods gave the far pleasanter way into Italy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He invited the surplus population of six tribes &mdash;the Bituriges, the Averni, the Senones, the Aedui, the Ambarri, the Carnutes, and the Aulerci.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Starting with an enormous force of horse and foot, he came to the Tricastini.</p><p>Beyond stretched the barrier of the Alps, and I am not at all surprised that they appeared insurmountable, for they had never yet been surmounted by any route, as far at least as unbroken memory reaches, unless you choose to believe the fables about Hercules.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst the mountain heights kept the Gauls fenced in as it were there, and they were looking everywhere to see by what path they could cross the peaks which reached to heaven and so enter a new world, they were also prevented from advancing by a sense of religious obligation, for news came that some strangers in quest of territory were being attacked by the Salyi.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These were Massilians who had sailed from Phocaea. The Gauls, looking upon this as an omen of their own fortunes, went to their assistance and enabled them to fortify the spot where they had first landed, without any interference from the Salyi.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After crossing the Alps by the passes of the Taurini and the valley of the Douro, they defeated the Tuscans in battle not far from the Ticinus, and when they learnt that the country in which they had settled belonged to the Insubres, a name also borne by a canton of the Haedui, they accepted the omen of the place and built a city which they called Mediolanum.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Subsequently another body, consisting of the Cenomani, under the leadership of Elitovius, followed the track of the former and crossed the Alps by the same pass, with the goodwill of Bellovesus. They had their settlements where the cities of Brixia and Verona now stand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Libui came next and the Saluvii; they settled near the ancient tribe of the Ligurian Laevi, who lived about the Ticinus. Then the Boii and Lingones crossed the Pennine Alps, and as all the country between the Po and the Alps was occupied, they crossed the Po on rafts and expelled not only the Etruscans but the Umbrians as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They remained, however, north of the Apennines. Then the Senones, the last to come, occupied the country from the Utis to the Aesis. It was this last tribe, I find, that came to Clusium, and from there to Rome;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> but it is uncertain whether they came alone or helped by contingents from all the Cisalpine peoples.</p><p>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Destruction of Rome.</note> people of Clusium were appalled by this strange war, when they saw the numbers, the extraordinary appearance of the men, and the kind of weapons they used, and heard that the legions of Etruria had been often routed by them on both sides of the Po. Although they had no claim on Rome, either on the ground of alliance or friendly relations, unless it was that they had not defended their kinsmen at Veii against the Romans, they nevertheless sent ambassadors to ask the senate for assistance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Active assistance they did not obtain. The three sons of M. Fabius Ambustus were sent as ambassadors to negotiate with the Gauls and warn them not to attack those from whom they had suffered no injury, who were allies and friends of Rome, and who, if circumstances compelled them, must be defended by the armed force of Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They preferred that actual war should be avoided, and that they should make acquaintance with the Gauls, who were strangers to them, in peace rather than in arms.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A peaceable enough mission, had it not contained envoys of a violent temper, more like Gauls than Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After they had delivered their instructions in the council of the Gauls, the following reply was given: <q direct="unspecified">Although we are hearing the name of Romans for the first time, we believe nevertheless that you are brave men, since the Clusines are imploring your assistance in their time of danger.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since you prefer to protect your allies against us by negotiation rather than by armed force, we on our side do not reject the peace you offer, on condition that the Clusines cede to us Gauls, who are in need of land, a portion of that territory which they possess to a greater extent than they can cultivate.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On any other conditions peace cannot be granted. We wish to receive their reply in your presence, and if territory is refused us we shall fight, whilst you are still here, that you may report to those at home how far the Gauls surpass all other men in courage.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans asked them what right they had to demand, under threat of war, territory from those who were its owners, and what business the Gauls had in Etruria. The haughty answer was returned that they carried their right in their weapons, and that everything belonged to the brave. Passions were kindled on both sides; they flew to arms and joined battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thereupon, contrary to the law of nations, the envoys seized their weapons, for the Fates were already urging Rome to its ruin. The fact of three of the noblest and bravest Romans fighting in the front line of the Etruscan army could not be concealed, so conspicuous was the valour of the strangers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And what was more, Q. Fabius rode forward at a Gaulish chieftain, who was impetuously charging right at the Etruscan standards, ran his spear through his side and slew him. Whilst he was in the act of despoiling the body the Gauls recognised him, and the word was passed through the whole army that it was a Roman ambassador.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Forgetting their rage against the Clusines, and breathing threats against the Romans, they sounded the retreat.</p><p>Some were for an instant advance on Rome. The older men thought that ambassadors should first be sent to Rome to make a formal complaint and demand the surrender of the Fabii as satisfaction for the violation of the law of nations.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After the ambassadors had stated their case, the senate, whilst disapproving of the conduct of the Fabii, and recognising the justice of the demand which the barbarians made, were prevented by political interests from placing their convictions on record in the form of a decree in the case of men of such high rank.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In order, therefore, that the blame for any defeat which might be incurred in a war with the Gauls might not rest on them alone, they referred the consideration of the Gauls' demands to the people. Here personal popularity and influence had so much more weight that the very men whose punishment was under discussion were elected consular tribunes for the next year.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Gauls regarded this procedure as it deserved to be regarded, namely, as an act of hostility, and after openly threatening war, returned to their people. The other consular tribunes elected with the Fabii were Q. Sulpicius Longus, Q. Servilius &mdash;for the fourth timeand P. Cornelius Maluginensis.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To such an extent does Fortune blind men's eyes when she will not have her threatened blows parried, that though such a weight of disaster was hanging over the State, no special steps were taken to avert it. In the wars against Fidenae and Veii and other neighbouring States, a Dictator had on many occasions been nominated as a last resource.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But now when an enemy, never seen or even heard of before, was rousing up war from ocean and the furthest corners of the world, no recourse was had to a Dictator, no extraordinary efforts were made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Those men through whose recklessness the war had been brought about were in supreme commands as tribunes, and the levy they raised was not larger than had been usual in ordinary campaigns, they even made light of
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the resorts as to the seriousness of the war.</p><p>Meantime the Gauls learnt that their embassy had been treated with contempt, and that honours had actually been conferred upon men who had violated the law of nations. Burning with rage &mdash;as a nation they cannot control their passions &mdash;they seized their standards and hurriedly set out on their march.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At the sound of their tumult as they swept by, the affrighted cities flew to arms and the country folk took to flight. Horses and men, spread far and wide, covered an immense tract of country; wherever they went they made it understood by loud shouts that they were going to Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But though they were preceded by rumours and by messages from Clusium, and then from one town after another, it was the swiftness of their approach that created most alarm in Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> An army hastily raised by a levy <foreign lang="fr">en masse</foreign> marched out to meet them. The two forces met hardly eleven miles from Rome, at a spot where the Alia, flowing in a very deep channel from the Crustuminian mountains, joins the river Tiber a little below the road to Crustumerium.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The whole country in front and around was now swarming with the enemy, who, being as a nation given to wild outbreaks, had by their hideous howls and discordant clamour filled everything with dreadful noise.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consular tribunes had secured no position for their camp, had constructed no entrenchments behind which to retire, and had shown as much disregard of the gods as of the enemy, for they formed their order of battle without having obtained favourable auspices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They extended their line on either wing to prevent their being outflanked, but even so they could not make their front equal to the enemy's, whilst by thus thinning their line they weakened the centre so that it could hardly keep in touch. On their right was a small eminence which they decided to hold with reserves, and this disposition, though it was the beginning of the panic and flight, proved to be the only means of safety to the fugitives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For Bennus, the Gaulish chieftain, fearing some ruse in the scanty numbers of the enemy, and thinking that the rising ground was occupied in order that the reserves might attack the flank and rear of the Gauls while their front was engaged with the legions,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> directed his attack upon the reserves, feeling quite certain that if he drove them from their position, his overwhelming numbers would give him an easy victory on the level ground. So not only Fortune but tactics also were on the side of the barbarians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In the other army there was nothing to remind one of Romans either amongst the generals or the private soldiers. They were terrified, and all they thought about was flight, and so utterly had they lost their heads that a far greater number fled to Veii, a hostile city, though the Tiber lay in their way, than by the direct road to Rome, to their wives and children.</p><p>For a short time the reserves were protected by their position.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In the rest of the army, no sooner was the battle-shout heard on their flank by those nearest to the reserves, and then by those at the other end of the line heard in their rear, than they fled, whole and unhurt, almost before they had seen their untried foe, without any attempt to fight or even to give back the battle-shout.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> None were slain while actually fighting; they were cut down from behind whilst hindering one another's flight in a confused, struggling mass.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Along the bank of the Tiber, whither the whole of the left wing had fled, after throwing away their arms, there was great slaughter. Many who were unable to swim or were hampered by the weight of their cuirasses and other armour were sucked down by the current.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The greater number, however, reached Veii in safety, yet not only were no troops sent from there to defend the City, but not even was a messenger despatched to report the defeat to Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All the men on the right wing, which had been stationed some distance from the river, and nearer to the foot of the hill, made for Rome and took refuge in the Citadel without even closing the City gates.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Gauls for their part were almost dumb with astonishment at so sudden and extraordinary a victory. At first they did not dare to move from the spot, as though puzzled by what had happened, then they began to fear a surprise, at last they began to despoil the dead, and, as their custom is, to pile up the arms in heaps.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Finally, as no hostile movement was anywhere visible, they commenced their march and reached Rome shortly before sunset. The cavalry, who had ridden on in front, reported that the gates were not shut, there were no pickets on guard in front of them, no troops on the walls. This second surprise, as extraordinary as the previous one, held them back, and fearing a nocturnal conflict in the streets of an unknown City, they halted and bivouacked between Rome and the Anio.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Reconnoitring parties were sent out to examine the circuit of the walls and the other gates, and to ascertain what plans their enemies were forming in their desperate plight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As for the Romans, since the greater number had fled from the field in the direction of Veii instead of Rome, it was universally believed that the only survivors were those who had found refuge in Rome, and the mourning for all who were lost, whether living or dead, filled the whole City with the cries of lamentation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But the sounds of private grief were stifled by the general terror when it was announced that the enemy were at hand. Presently the yells and wild war-whoops of the squadrons were heard as they rode round the walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> All the time until the next day's dawn the citizens were in such a state of suspense that they expected from moment to moment an attack on the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They expected it first when the enemy approached the walls, for they would have remained at the Alia had not this been their object; then just before sunset they thought the enemy would attack because there was not much daylight left; and then when night was fallen they imagined that the attack was delayed till then to create all the greater terror.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Finally, the approach of the next day deprived them of their senses; the entrance of the enemy's standards within the gates was the dreadful climax to fears that had known no respite.</p><p>But all through that night and the following day the citizens afforded an utter contrast to those who had fled in such terror at the Alia.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Realising the hopelessness of attempting any defence of the City with the small numbers that were left, they decided that the men of military age and the able-bodied amongst the senators should, with their wives and children, withdraw into the Citadel and the Capitol, and after getting in stores of
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> arms and provisions, should from that fortified position defend their gods, themselves, and the great name of Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Flamen and priestesses of Vesta were to carry the sacred things of the State far away from the bloodshed and the fire, and their sacred cult should not be abandoned as long as a single person survived to observe it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If only the Citadel and the Capitol, the abode of gods; if only the senate, the guiding mind of the national policy; if only the men of military age survived the impending ruin of the City, then the loss of the crowd of old men left behind in the City could be easily borne; in any case, they were certain to perish.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> To reconcile the aged plebeians to their fate, the men who had been consuls and enjoyed triumphs gave out that they would meet their fate side by side with them, and not burden the scanty force of fighting men with bodies too weak to carry arms or defend their country.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus they sought to comfort one another &mdash;these aged men doomed to death. Then they turned with words of encouragement to the younger men on their way to the Citadel and Capitol, and solemnly commended to their strength and courage all that was left of the fortunes of a City which for 360 years had been victorious in all its wars.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As those who were carrying with them all hope and succour finally separated from those who had resolved not to survive the fall of the City the misery of the scene was heightened by the distress of the women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their tears, their distracted running about as they followed first their husbands then their sons, their imploring appeals to them not to leave them to their fate, made up a picture in which no element of human misery was wanting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A great many of them actually followed their sons into the Capitol, none forbidding or inviting them, for though to diminish the number of non-combatants would have helped the besieged, it was too inhuman a step to take.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Another crowd, mainly of plebeians, for whom there was not room on so small a hill or food enough in the scanty store of corn, poured out of the City in one continuous line and made for the Janiculum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From there they dispersed, some over the country, others towards the neighbouring cities, without any leader or concerted action, each following his own aims, his own ideas and all despairing of the public safety.</p><p>While all this was going on, the Flamen of Quirinus and the Vestal virgins,
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> without giving a thought to their own property, were deliberating as to which of the sacred things they ought to take with them, and which to leave behind, since they had not strength enough to carry all, and also what place would be the safest for their custody.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They thought best to conceal what they could not take in earthen jars and bury them under the chapel next to the Flamen's house, where spitting is now forbidden. The rest they divided amongst them and carried off, taking the road which leads by the <foreign lang="la">Pons Sublicius</foreign> to the Janiculum.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whilst ascending that hill they were seen by L. Albinius, a Roman plebeian who with the rest of the crowd who were unfit for war was leaving the City. Even in that critical hour the distinction between sacred and profane was not forgotten.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He had his wife and children with him in a wagon, and it seemed to him an act of impiety for him and his family to be seen in a vehicle whilst the national priests should be trudging along on foot, bearing the sacred vessels of Rome. He ordered his wife and children to get down, put the virgins and their sacred burden in the wagon, and drove them to Caere, their destination.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After all the arrangements that circumstances permitted had been made for the defence of the Capitol, the old men returned to their respective homes and, fully prepared to die, awaited the coming of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Those who had filled curule offices resolved to meet their fate wearing the insignia of their former rank and honour and distinctions. They put on the splendid dress which they wore when conducting the chariots of the gods or riding in triumph through the City, and thus arrayed, they seated themselves in their ivory chairs in front of their houses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Some writers record that, led by M. Fabius, the Pontifex Maximus, they recited the solemn formula in which they devoted themselves
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> to death for their country and the Quirites.</p><p>As the Gauls were refreshed by a night's rest after a battle which had at no point been seriously contested, and as they were not now taking the City by assault or storm, their entrance the next day was not marked by any signs of excitement or anger. Passing the Colline gate, which was standing open, they came to the Forum and gazed round at the temples and at the Citadel, which alone wore any appearance of war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They left there a small body to guard against any attack from the Citadel or Capitol whilst they were scattered, and then they dispersed in quest of plunder through streets in which they did not meet a soul. Some poured in a body into all the houses near, others made for the most distant ones, expecting to find them untouched and full of spoils.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Appalled by the very desolation of the place and dreading lest some stratagem should surprise the stragglers, they returned to the neighbourhood of the Forum in close order.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The houses of the plebeians were barricaded, the halls of the patricians stood open, but they felt greater hesitation about entering the open houses than those which were closed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They gazed with feelings of real veneration upon the men who were seated in the porticoes of their mansions, not only because of the superhuman magnificence of their apparel and their whole bearing and demeanour, but also because of the majestic expression of their countenances, wearing the very aspect of gods.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So they stood, gazing at them as if they were statues, till, as it is asserted, one of the patricians, M. Papirius, roused the passion of a Gaul, who began to stroke his beard &mdash;which in those days was universally worn long &mdash;by smiting him on the head with his ivory staff. He was the first to be killed, the others were butchered in their chairs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After this slaughter of the magnates, no living being was thenceforth spared; the houses were rifled, and then set on fire.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now &mdash;whether it was that the Gauls were not all animated by a passion for the destruction of the City, or whether their chiefs had decided on the one hand to present the spectacle of a few fires as a means of intimidating the besieged into surrender from a
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> desire to save their homes, and on the other, by abstaining from a universal conflagration, hold what remained of the City as a pledge by which to weaken their enemies' determination &mdash;certain it is that the fires were far from being so indiscriminate or so extensive as might be expected on the first day of a captured city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As the Romans beheld from the Citadel the City filled with the enemy who were running about in all the streets, while some new disaster was constantly occurring, first in one quarter then in another, they could no longer control their eyes and ears, let alone their thoughts and feelings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In whatever direction their attention was drawn by the shouts of the enemy, the shrieks of the women and boys, the roar of the flames, and the crash of houses falling in, thither they turned their eyes and minds as though set by Fortune to be spectators of their country's fall, powerless to protect anything left of all they possessed beyond their lives.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Above all others who have ever stood a siege were they to be pitied, cut off as they were from the land of their birth and seeing all that had been theirs in the possession of the enemy.</p><p>The day which had been spent in
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> such misery was succeeded by a night not one whit more restful, this again by a day of anguish, there was not a single hour free from the sight of some ever fresh calamity.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> And yet, though, weighed down and overwhelmed with so many misfortunes, they had watched everything laid low in flame and ruin, they did not for a moment relax their determination to defend by their courage the one spot still left to freedom, the hill which they held, however small and poor it might be.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At length, as this state of things went on day by day, they became as it were hardened to misery, and turned their thoughts from the circumstances round them to their arms and the sword in their right hand, which they gazed upon as the only things left to give them hope.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Unsuccessful Attack on the Citadel.</note> some days the Gauls had been making useless war merely upon the houses of the City. Now that they saw nothing surviving amidst the ashes and ruin of the captured City except an armed foe whom all these disasters had failed to appal, and who would entertain no thought of surrender unless force were employed, they determined as a last resort to make an assault on the Citadel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At daybreak the signal was given and the whole of their number formed up in the Forum. Raising their battle-shout and locking their shields together over their heads, they advanced. The Romans awaited the attack without excitement or fear, the detachments were strengthened to guard all the approaches, and in whatever direction they saw the enemy advancing, there they posted a picked body of men and allowed the enemy to climb up, for the steeper the ground they got on to, the easier they thought it would be to fling them down the slope.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> About midway up the hill the Gauls halted; then from the higher ground, which of itself almost hurled them against the enemy, the Romans charged, and routed the Gauls with such loss and overthrow that they never again attempted that mode of fighting either with detachments or in full strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All hope, therefore, of forcing a passage by direct assault being laid aside, they made preparations for a blockade. Up to that time they had never thought of one; all the corn in the City had been destroyed in the conflagrations, whilst that in the fields around had been hastily carried off to Veii since the occupation of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> So the Gauls decided to divide their forces; one division was to invest the Citadel, the other to forage amongst the neighbouring States so that they could supply corn to those who were keeping up the investment.</p><p>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Camillus at Ardea.</note> was
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> Fortune herself who led the Gauls after they left the City to Ardea, that they might have some experience of Roman courage.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Camillus was living there as an exile, grieving more over his country's fortunes than his own, eating his heart out in reproaches to gods and men, asking in indignant wonder where the men were with whom he had taken Veii and Falerii; men whose valour in all their wars was greater even than their success.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Suddenly he heard that the Gaulish army was approaching, and that the Ardeates were engaged in anxious deliberation about it. He had generally avoided the council meetings, but now, seized with an inspiration nothing short of divine, he hastened to the assembled councillors and addressed them as follows:</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">Men of Ardea! friends of old, and now my fellow-citizens &mdash;for this your kindness has granted, this my fortunes have compelled &mdash;let none of you imagine that I have come here in forgetfulness of my position.<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed">As a refugee he did not posess full civic rights, and had therefore no place in their Assembly.</note> The force of circumstances and the common danger constrain every man to contribute what help he can to meet the crisis. When shall I ever be able to show my gratitude for all the obligations you have conferred if I fail in my duty now?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When shall I ever be of any use to you if not in war? It was by that that I held my position in my native City as having never known defeat; in times of peace my ungrateful countrymen banished me.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now the chance is offered to you, men of Ardea, of proving your gratitude for all the kindness that Rome has shown you &mdash;you have not forgotten how great it is, nor need I bring it up against those who so well remember it &mdash;the chance of winning for your city a vast reputation for war at the expense of our common foe. Those who are coming here in loose and disorderly fashion are a race to whom nature has given bodies and minds distinguished by bulk rather than by resolution and endurance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is for this reason that they bring into every battle a terrifying appearance rather than real force. Take the disaster of Rome as a proof.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They captured the City because it lay open to them; a small force repelled them from the Citadel and Capitol. Already the irksomeness of an investment has proved too much for them, they are giving it up and wandering through the fields in straggling parties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When they are gorged with food and the wine they drink so greedily, they throw themselves down like wild beasts, on the approach of night, in all directions by the streams, without entrenching themselves, or setting any outposts or pickets on guard. And now after their success they are more careless than ever.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If it is your intention to defend your walls and not to allow all this country to become a second Gaul, seize your arms and muster in force by the first watch and follow me to what will be a massacre, not a battle. If I do not deliver them, whilst enchained by sleep, into your hands to be slaughtered like cattle, I am ready to accept the same fate in Ardea which I met with in Rome.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Friends<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Reverses of the Gauls and Etruscans.</note> and foes were alike persuaded that nowhere else was there at that time so great a master of war. After the council broke up they refreshed themselves and waited eagerly for the signal to be given. When it was given in the silence of the night they were at the gates ready for Camillus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After marching no great distance from the city they came upon the camp of the Gauls, unprotected, as he had said, and carelessly open on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They raised a tremendous shout and rushed in; there was no battle, it was everywhere sheer massacre; the Gauls, defenceless and dissolved in sleep, were butchered as they lay. Those in the furthest part of the camp, however, startled from their lairs, and not knowing whence or what the attack was, fled in terror, and some actually rushed, unawares, amongst their assailants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A considerable number were carried into the neighbourhood of Antium, where they were surrounded by the townsmen.</p><p>A similar slaughter of Etruscans took place in the district of Veii. So far were these people from feeling sympathy with a City which for almost four centuries had been their neighbour, and was now crushed by an enemy never seen or heard of before, that they chose that time for making forays into Roman territory, and after loading themselves with plunder, intended to attack Veii, the bulwark and only surviving hope of the Roman name.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman soldiers at Veii had seen them dispersed through the fields, and afterwards, with their forces collected, driving their booty in front of them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their first feelings were those of despair, then indignation and rage took possession of them. <q direct="unspecified">Are even the Etruscans,</q> they exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">from whom we have diverted the arms of Gaul on to ourselves, to find amusement in our disasters?</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With difficulty they restrained themselves from attacking them. Caedicius, a centurion whom they had placed in command, induced them to defer operations till nightfall.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The only thing lacking was a commander like Camillus, in all other respects the ordering of the attack and the success achieved were the same as if he had been present. Not content with this, they made some prisoners who had survived the night's massacre act as guides, and, led by them, surprised another body of Tuscans at the salt works and inflicted a still greater loss upon them. Exultant at this double victory they returned to Veii.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Camillus appointed Dictator.</note> these days there was little going on in Rome; the investment was maintained for the most part with great slackness; both sides were keeping quiet, the Gauls being mainly intent on preventing any of the enemy from slipping through their lines. Suddenly a Roman warrior drew upon himself the admiration of foes and friends alike.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Fabian house had an annual sacrifice on the Quirinal, and C. Fabius Dorsuo, wearing his toga in the <q direct="unspecified">Gabine cincture,</q><note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed">In the <emph>Gabine cincture</emph> the loose flowing toga was gathered up and wound round the body, allowing freer movement for the limbs. It was adopted in certain cults, especially those which were accompanied by marches and solemn dances.</note> and bearing in his hands the sacred vessels, came down from the Capitol, passed through the middle of the hostile pickets, unmoved by either challenge or threat, and reached the Quirinal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There he duly performed all the solemn rites and returned with the same composed expression and gait, feeling sure of the divine blessing, since not even the fear of death had made him neglect the worship of the gods; finally he re-entered the Capitol and rejoined his comrades. Either the Gauls were stupefied at his extraordinary boldness, or else they were restrained by religious feelings, for as a nation they are by no means inattentive to the claims of religion.</p><p>At Veii there was a steady accession of strength as well as courage.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not only were the Romans who had been dispersed by the defeat and the capture of the City gathering there, but volunteers from Latium also flocked to the place that they might be in for a share of the booty. The time now seemed ripe for the recovery of their native City out of the hands of the enemy.</p><p>But though the body was strong it lacked a head.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The very place reminded men of Camillus, the majority of the soldiers had fought successfully under his auspices and leadership, and Caedicius declared that he would give neither gods nor men any pretext for terminating his command;
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he would rather himself, remembering his subordinate rank, ask for a commander-in-chief.</p><p>It was decided by general consent that Camillus should be invited from Ardea, but the senate was to be consulted first; to such an extent was everything regulated by reverence for law;
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> the proper distinctions of things were observed, even though the things themselves were almost lost.</p><p>Frightful risk would have to be incurred in passing through the enemies' outposts. Pontius Cominius, a fine soldier, offered himself for the task.
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Supporting himself on a cork float, he was carried down the Tiber to the City. Selecting the nearest way from the bank of the river, he scaled a precipitous rock which, owing to its steepness, the enemy had left unguarded, and found his way into the Capitol.
									<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On being brought before the supreme magistrates he delivered his instructions from the army.
									<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After receiving the decree of the senate, which was to the effect that after being recalled from exile by the <foreign lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign>, Camillus should be forthwith nominated Dictator by order of the people, and the soldiers should have the commander they wanted, the messenger returned by the same route and made the best of his way to Veii. A deputation was sent to Ardea to conduct Camillus to Veii.
									<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The law was passed in the <foreign lang="la">comitia curiata</foreign> annulling his banishment and nominating him Dictator, and it is, I think, more likely that he did not start from Ardea until he learnt that this law had been passed, because he could not change his domicile without the sanction of the people, nor could he take the auspices in the name of the army until he had been duly nominated Dictator.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Unsuccessful Attack on the Capitol &mdash;M. Manlius.</note> these proceedings were taking place at Veii, the Citadel and Capitol of Rome were in imminent
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> danger. The Gauls had either noticed the footprints left by the messenger from Veii, or had themselves discovered a comparatively easy ascent up the cliff to the temple of Carmentis. Choosing a night when there was a faint glimmer of light, they sent an unarmed man in advance to try the road; then handing one another their arms where the path was difficult, and supporting each other or dragging each other up as the ground required, they finally reached the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> summit. So silent had their movements been that not only were they unnoticed by the sentinels, but they did not even wake the dogs, an animal peculiarly sensitive to nocturnal
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> sounds. But they did not escape the notice of the geese, which were sacred to Juno and had been left untouched in spite of the extremely scanty supply of food. This proved the safety of the garrison, for their clamour and the noise of their wings aroused M. Manlius, the distinguished soldier, who had been consul three years before. He snatched up his weapons and ran to call the rest to arms, and while the rest hung back he struck with the boss of his shield a Gaul who had got a foothold on the summit and knocked him
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> down. He fell on those behind and upset them, and Manlius slew others who had laid aside their weapons and were clinging to the rocks with their hands. By this time others had joined him, and they began to dislodge the enemy with volleys of stones and javelins till the whole body fell helplessly down to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> bottom. When the uproar had died away, the remainder of the night was given to sleep, as far as was possible under such disturbing circumstances, whilst their peril, though past, still made them
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> anxious.</p><p>At daybreak the soldiers were summoned by sound of trumpet to a council in the presence of the tribunes, when the due rewards for good conduct and for bad would be
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> awarded. First, Manlius was commended for his bravery, and rewarded not by the tribunes alone but by the soldiers as a body, for every man brought to him at his quarters, which were in the Citadel, half a pound of meal and a quarter of a pint of wine. This does not sound much, but the scarcity made it an overwhelming proof of the affection felt for him, since each stinted himself of food and contributed in honour of that one man what had to be taken from his necessaries of
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> life. Next, the sentinels who had been on duty at the spot where the enemy had climbed up without their noticing it were called forward. Q. Sulpicius, the consular tribune, declared that he should punish them all by martial
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> law. He was, however, deterred from this course by the shouts of the soldiers, who all agreed in throwing the blame upon one man. As there was no doubt of his guilt, he was amidst general approval flung from the top of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> cliff.</p><p>A stricter watch was now kept on both sides; by the Gauls because it had become known that messengers were passing between Rome and Veii; by the Romans, who had not forgotten the danger they were in that night.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="48"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Final Surrender of the Defenders.</note> the greatest of all the evils arising from the siege and the war was the famine which began to afflict both armies, whilst the Gauls were also visited with pestilence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had their camp on low-lying ground between the hills, which had been scorched by the fires and was full of malaria, and the least breath of wind raised not dust only but ashes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Accustomed as a nation to wet and cold, they could not stand this at all, and tortured as they were by heat and suffocation, disease became rife among them, and they died off like sheep. They soon grew weary of burying their dead singly, so they piled the bodies into heaps and burned them indiscriminately, and made the locality notorious; it was afterwards known as the <foreign lang="la">Busta Gallica</foreign>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Subsequently a truce was made with the Romans, and with the sanction of the commanders, the soldiers held conversations with each other. The Gauls were continually bringing up the famine and calling upon them to yield to necessity and surrender. To remove this impression it is said that bread was thrown in many places from the Capitol into the enemies' pickets.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But soon the famine could neither be concealed nor endured any longer. So, at the very time that the Dictator was raising his own levy at Ardea, and ordering his Master of the Horse, L. Valerius, to withdraw his army from Veii, and making preparations for a sufficient force with which to attack
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> the enemy on equal terms, the army of the Capitol, worn out with incessant duty, but still superior to all human ills, had nature not made famine alone insuperable by them, were day by day eagerly watching for signs of any help from the Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At last not only food but hope failed them. Whenever the sentinels went on duty, their feeble frames almost crushed by the weight of their armour, the army insisted that they should either surrender or purchase their ransom on the best terms they could, for the Gauls were throwing out unmistakable hints that they could be induced to abandon the siege for a moderate consideration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A meeting of the senate was now held, and the consular tribunes were empowered to make terms. A conference took place between Q. Sulpicius, the consular tribune, and Brennus, the Gaulish chieftain, and an agreement was arrived at by which 1000 lbs. of gold was fixed as the ransom of a people destined ere long to rule the world.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This humiliation was great enough as it was, but it was aggravated by the despicable meanness of the Gauls, who produced unjust weights, and when the tribune protested, the insolent Gaul threw his sword into the scale, with an exclamation intolerable to Roman ears, <q direct="unspecified"><emph>Woe to the vanquished!</emph></q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="49"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Camillus saves Rome.</note> gods and men alike prevented the Romans from living as a ransomed people. By a dispensation of Fortune it came about that before the infamous ransom was completed and all the gold weighed out, whilst the dispute was still going on, the Dictator appeared on the scene and ordered the gold to be carried away and the Gauls to move off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As they declined to do so, and protested that a definite compact had been made, he informed them that when he was once appointed Dictator no compact was valid which was made by an inferior magistrate without his sanction.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then warned the Gauls to prepare for battle, and ordered his men to pile their baggage into a heap, get their weapons ready, and win their country back by steel, not by gold. They must keep before their eyes the temples of the gods, their wives and children, and their country's soil, disfigured by the ravages of war &mdash;everything, in a word, which it was their duty to defend, to recover or to avenge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then drew up his men in the best formation that the nature of the ground, naturally uneven and now half burnt, admitted, and made every provision that his military skill suggested for securing the advantage of position and movement for his men.</p><p>The Gauls, alarmed at the turn things had taken, seized their weapons and rushed upon the Romans with more rage than method.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fortune had now turned, divine aid and human skill were on the side of Rome. At the very first encounter the Gauls were routed as easily as they had conquered at the Alia.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In a second and more sustained battle at the eighth milestone on the road to Gabii, where they had rallied from their flight, they were again defeated under the generalship and auspices of Camillus.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Here the carnage was complete; the camp was taken, and not a single man was left to carry tidings of the disaster.</p><p>After thus recovering his country from the enemy, the Dictator returned in triumph to the City, and amongst the homely jests which soldiers are wont to bandy, he was called in no idle words of praise, <q direct="unspecified">A Romulus,</q> <q direct="unspecified">The Father of his country,</q> <q direct="unspecified">The Second Founder of the City.</q></p><p>He had saved his country in war, and now that peace was restored, he proved, beyond all doubt, to be its saviour again, when he prevented the migration to Veii.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The tribunes of the plebs were urging this course more strongly than ever now that the City was burnt, and the plebs were themselves more in favour of it.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This movement and the pressing appeal which the senate made to him not to abandon the republic while the position of affairs was so doubtful, determined him not to lay down his dictatorship after his triumph.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="50"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Rebuilding of Rome &mdash;Regulations touching Religion.</note> he was most scrupulous in discharging religious obligations, the very first measures he introduced into the senate were those relating to the immortal
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> gods. He got the senate to pass a resolution containing the following provisions: All the temples, so far as they had been in possession of the enemy, were to be restored and purified, and their boundaries marked out afresh; the ceremonies of purification were to be ascertained from the sacred books by the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> duumvirs. Friendly relations as between State and State were to be established with the people of Caere, because they had sheltered the sacred treasures of Rome and her priests, and by this kindly act had prevented any interruption to the divine
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> worship. Capitoline Games were to be instituted, because Jupiter Optimus Maximus had protected his dwelling-place and the Citadel of Rome in the time of danger, and the Dictator was to form a college of priests for that object from amongst those who were living on the Capitol and in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Citadel. Mention was also made of offering propitiation for the neglect of the nocturnal Voice which was heard announcing disaster before the war began, <note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed">See chap. xxxii.</note>and orders were given for a temple to be built in the <foreign lang="la">Nova Via</foreign> to <foreign lang="la">AIUS
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> LOCUTIUS</foreign>. The gold which had been rescued from the Gauls and that which during the confusion had been brought from the other temples, had been collected in the temple of Jupiter. As no one remembered what proportion ought to be returned to the other temples, the whole was declared sacred, and ordered to be deposited under the throne of
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Jupiter. The religious feeling of the citizens had already been shown in the fact that when there was not sufficient gold in the treasury to make up the sum agreed upon with the Gauls, they accepted the contribution of the matrons, to avoid touching that which was sacred. The matrons received public thanks, and the distinction was conferred upon them of having funeral orations pronounced over them as in the case of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> men.</p><p>It was not till after those matters were disposed of which concerned the gods, and which therefore were within the province of the senate, that Camillus' attention was drawn to the tribunes, who were making incessant harangues to persuade the plebs to leave the ruins and migrate to Veii, which was ready for them. At last he went up to the Assembly, followed by the whole of the senate, and delivered the following speech: &mdash;</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="51"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Speech of Camillus against migrating to Veii.</note> <q direct="unspecified">So painful to me, Quirites, are controversies with the tribunes of the plebs, that all the time I lived at Ardea my one consolation in my bitter exile was that I was far removed from these conflicts. As far as they are concerned I would never have returned even if you recalled me by a thousand senatorial decrees and popular votes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> And now that I am returned, it was not change of mind on my part but change of fortune on yours that compelled me. The question at stake was whether my country was to remain unshaken in her seat, not whether I was to be in my country at any cost. Even now I would gladly remain quiet and hold my peace, if I were not fighting another battle for my country. To be wanting to her, as long as life shall last, would be for other men a disgrace, for Camillus a downright sin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Why did we win her back, why did we, when she was beset by foes, deliver her from their hands, if, now that she is recovered, we desert her? Whilst the Gauls were victorious and the whole of the City in their power, the gods and men of Rome still held, still dwelt in, the Capitol and the Citadel. And now that the Romans are victorious and the City recovered, are the Citadel and Capitol to be abandoned? Shall our good fortune inflict greater desolation on this City than our evil fortune wrought?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even had there been no religious institutions established when the City was founded and passed down from hand to hand, still, so clearly has Providence been working in the affairs of Rome at this time, that I for one would suppose that all neglect of divine worship has been banished from human life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Look at the alternations of prosperity and adversity during these late years; you will find that all went well with us when we followed the divine guidance, and all was disastrous when we neglected it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Take first of all the war with Veii. For what a number of years and with what immense exertions it was carried on! It did not come to an end before the water was drawn off from the Alban Lake at the bidding of the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What, again, of this unparalleled disaster to our City? Did it burst upon us before the Voice sent from heaven announcing the approach of the Gauls was treated with contempt, before the law of nations had been outraged by our ambassadors, before we had, in the same irreligious spirit, condoned that outrage when we ought to have punished it?
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And so it was that, defeated, captured, ransomed, we received such punishment at the hands of gods and men that we were a lesson to the whole world. Then, in our adversity, we bethought us of our religious duties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> We fled to the gods in the Capitol, to the seat of Jupiter Optimus Maximus; amidst the ruin of all that we possessed we concealed some of the sacred treasures in the earth, the rest we carried out of the enemies' sight to neighbouring cities; abandoned as we were by gods and men, we still did not intermit the divine worship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is because we acted thus that they have restored to us our native City, and victory and the renown in war which we had lost; but against the enemy, who, blinded by avarice, broke treaty and troth in the weighing of the gold, they have launched terror and rout and death.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="52"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">When you see such momentous consequences for human affairs flowing from the worship or the neglect of the gods, do you not realise, Quirites, how great a sin we are meditating whilst hardly yet emerging from the shipwreck caused by our former guilt and fall?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> We possess a City which was founded with the divine approval as revealed in auguries and auspices; in it there is not a spot which is not full of religious associations and the presence of a god; the regular sacrifices have their appointed places no less than they have their appointed days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Are you, Quirites, going to desert all these gods &mdash;those whom the State honours, those whom you worship, each at your own altars? How far does your action come up to that of the glorious youth C. Fabius, during the siege, which was watched by the enemy with no less admiration than by you, when he went down from the Citadel through the missiles of the Gauls and celebrated the appointed sacrifice of his house on the Quirinal?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whilst the sacred rites of the patrician houses are not interrupted even in time of war, are you content to see the State offices of religion and the gods of Rome abandoned in a time of peace?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Are the Pontiffs and Flamens to be more neglectful of their public functions than a private individual is of the religious obligations of his house?</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">Some one may possibly reply that we can either discharge these duties at Veii or send priests to discharge them here.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But neither of these things can be done if the rites are to be duly performed. Not to mention all the ceremonies or all the deities individually, where else, I would ask, but in the Capitol can the couch of Jupiter be prepared on the day of his festal banquet?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What need is there for me to speak about the perpetual fire of Vesta, and the Image &mdash;the pledge of our dominion &mdash; which is in the safe keeping of her temple? And you, Mars Gradivus, and you, Father Quirinus, what need to speak of your sacred shields? Is it your wish that all these holy things, coeval with the City, some of even greater antiquity, should be abandoned and left on unhallowed soil?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> See, too, how great the difference between us and our ancestors. They left to us certain rites and ceremonies which we can only duly perform on the Alban Mount or at Lavinium. If it was a matter of religion that these rites should not be transferred from cities which belonged to an enemy to us at Rome, shall we transfer them from here to the enemies' city, Veii, without offending heaven?
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Call to mind, I pray you, how often ceremonies are repeated, because through negligence or accident some detail of the ancestral ritual has been omitted. What remedy was there for the republic, when crippled by the war with Veii after the portent of the Alban Lake, except the revival of sacred rites and the taking of fresh auspices?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> And more than that, as though after all we reverenced the ancient faiths, we have transferred foreign deities to Rome, and have established new ones. Queen Juno was lately carried from Veii and dedicated on the Aventine, and how splendidly that day was celebrated through the grand enthusiasm of our matrons!
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> We ordered a temple to be built to Aius Locutius because of the divine Voice which was heard in the Via Nova. We have added to our annual festivals the Capitoline Games, and on the authority of the senate we have founded a college of priests to superintend them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> What necessity was there for all these undertakings if we intended to leave the City of Rome at the same time as the Gauls, if it was not of our own free will that we remained in the Capitol through all those months, but the fear of the enemy which shut us up there?</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">We are speaking about the temples and the sacred rites and ceremonies.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But what, pray, about the priests? Do you not realise what a heinous sin will be committed? For the Vestals surely there is only that one abode, from which nothing has ever removed them but the capture of the City. The Flamen of Jupiter is forbidden by divine law to stay a single night outside the City.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Are you going to make these functionaries priests of Veii instead of priests of Rome? Will thy Vestals desert thee, Vesta? Is the Flamen to bring fresh guilt upon himself and the State for every night he sojourns abroad?
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Think of the other proceedings which, after the auspices have been duly taken, we conduct almost entirely within the City boundaries-to what oblivion, to what neglect are we consigning them!
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Assembly of the Curies, which confers the supreme command, the Assembly of the Centuries, in which you elect the consuls and consular tribunes &mdash;where can they be held and the auspices taken except where they are wont to be held?
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Shall we transfer these to Veii, or are the people, when an Assembly is to be held, to meet at vast inconvenience in this City after it has been deserted by gods and men?</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="53"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">But, you may say, it is obvious that the whole City is polluted, and no expiatory sacrifices can purify it; circumstances themselves compel us to quit a City devastated by fire, and all in ruins, and migrate to Veii where everything is untouched. We must not distress the poverty-stricken plebs by building here.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> I fancy, however, Quirites, that it is evident to you, without my telling you, that this suggestion is a plausible excuse rather than a true reason. You remember how this same question of migrating to Veii was mooted before the Gauls came, whilst public and private buildings were still safe and the City stood secure. And mark you, tribunes, how widely my view differs from yours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Even supposing it ought not to have been done then, you think that at any rate it ought to be done now, whereas &mdash;do not express surprise at what I say before you have grasped its purport &mdash;I am of opinion that even had it been right to migrate then when the City was wholly unhurt, we ought not to abandon these ruins now.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For at that time the reason for our migrating to a captured city would have been a victory glorious for us and for our posterity, but now this migration would be glorious for the Gauls, but for us shame and bitterness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> For we shall be thought not to have left our native City as victors, but to have lost it because we were vanquished; it will look as though it was the flight at the Alia, the capture of the City, the beleaguering of the Capitol, which had laid upon us the necessity of deserting our household gods and dooming ourselves to banishment from a place which we were powerless to defend.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Was it possible for Gauls to overthrow Rome and shall it be deemed impossible for Romans to restore it?</q></p><p><q direct="unspecified">What more remains except for them to come again with fresh forces &mdash;we all know that their numbers surpass belief &mdash;and elect to live in this City which they captured, and you abandoned, and for you to allow them to do so?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Why, if it were not Gauls who were doing this, but your old enemies, the Aequi and Volscians, who migrated to Rome, would you wish them to be Romans and you Veientines? Or would you rather that this were a desert of your own than the city of your foes? I do not see what could be more infamous.</q></p><p>Are you prepared to allow this crime and endure this disgrace because of the trouble of building?
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If no better or more spacious dwelling could be put up in the whole City of Rome than that hut of our Founder, would it not be better to live in huts after the manner of herdsmen and peasants, surrounded by our temples and our gods, than to go forth as a nation of exiles?
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Our ancestors, shepherds and refugees, built a new City in a few years, when there was nothing in these parts but forests and swamps; are we shirking the labour of rebuilding what has been burnt, though the Citadel and Capitol are intact, and the temples of the gods still stand? What we would each have done in our own case, had our houses caught fire, are we as a community refusing to do now that the City has been burnt?</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="54"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">Well now, suppose that either through crime or accident a fire broke out in Veii, and the flames, as is quite possible, fanned by the wind, consumed a great part of the city, are we going to look out for Fidenae or Gabii, or any other city you please, as a place to which to migrate?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Has our native soil, this land we call our motherland, so slight a hold upon us? Does our love for our country cling only to its buildings?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Unpleasant as it is to recall my sufferings, still more your injustice, I will nevertheless confess to you that whenever I thought of my native City all these things came into my mind &mdash;the hills, the plains, the Tiber, this landscape so familiar to me, this sky beneath which I was born and bred &mdash;and I pray that they may now move you by the affection they inspire to remain in your City, rather than that, after you have abandoned it, they should make you pine with home-sickness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not without good reason did gods and men choose this spot as the site of a City, with its bracing hills, its commodious river, by means of which the produce of inland countries may be brought down and over-sea supplies obtained; a sea near enough for all useful purposes, but not so near as to be exposed to danger from foreign fleets; a district in the very centre of Italy &mdash;in a word, a position singularly adapted by nature for the expansion of a city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The mere size of so young a City is a proof of this. This is the 365th year of the City, Quirites, yet in all the wars you have for so long been carrying on amongst all those ancient nations &mdash;not to mention the separate cities &mdash;the Volscians in conjunction with the Aequi and all their strongly fortified towns, the whole of Etruria, so powerful by land and sea, and stretching across Italy from sea to sea &mdash;none have proved a match for you in war. This has hitherto been your Fortune; what sense can there be &mdash;perish the thought!
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> &mdash;in making trial of another Fortune? Even granting that your valour can pass over to another spot, certainly the good Fortune of this place cannot be transferred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Here is the Capitol where in the old days a human head was found, and this was declared to be an omen, for in that place would be fixed the head and supreme sovereign power of the world. Here it was that whilst the Capitol was being cleared with augural rites, Juventas and Terminus, to the great delight of your fathers, would not allow themselves to be moved. Here is the Fire of Vesta; here are the Shields sent down from heaven; here are all the gods, who, if you remain, will be gracious to you.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="55"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The People begin to rebuild Rome.</note> is stated that this speech of Camillus made a profound impression, particularly that part of it which appealed to the religious feelings. But whilst the issue was still uncertain, a sentence, opportunely uttered, decided the matter. The senate, shortly afterwards, were discussing the question in the <foreign lang="la">Curia Hostilia</foreign>, and some cohorts returning from guard happened to be marching through the Forum. They had just entered the <foreign lang="la">Comitium</foreign>, when the centurion shouted, <q direct="unspecified">Halt, standard-bearer! Plant the standard; it will be best for us to stop here.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On hearing these words, the senators rushed out of the Senate-house, exclaiming that they welcomed the omen, and the people crowding round them gave an emphatic approval. The proposed measure for migration was dropped, and they began to rebuild the City in a haphazard way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Tiling was provided at the public expense; every one was given the right to cut stone and timber where he pleased, after giving security that the building should be completed within the year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In their haste, they took no trouble to plan out straight streets; as all distinctions of ownership in the soil were lost, they built on any ground that happened to be vacant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> That is the reason why the old sewers, which originally were carried under public ground, now run everywhere under private houses, and why the conformation of the City resembles one casually built upon by settlers rather than one regularly planned out.</p></div1>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>THE history of the Romans from the foundation of the City to its capture, first under kings, then under consuls, dictators, decemvirs, and consular tribunes, the record of foreign wars and domestic dissensions, has been set forth in the five preceding books.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The subject matter is enveloped in obscurity; partly from its great antiquity, like remote objects which are hardly discernible through the vastness of the distance; partly owing to the fact that written records, which form the only trust- worthy memorials of events, were in those times few and scanty, and even what did exist in the pontifical commentaries and public and private archives nearly all perished in the conflagra- tion of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Starting from the second beginnings of the clty which, like a plant cut down to its roots, sprang up in greater beauty and fruitfulness, the details of its history both civil and military will now be exhibited in their proper order, with greater clearness
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> and certainty.</p><p>At first the State was supported by the same prop by which it had been raised from the ground, M. Furius, its chief, and he was not allowed to resign office until a year had 
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/>elapsed.</p><p>It was decided that the consular tribunes, during whose rule the capture of the City had taken place, should not hold the elections for the ensuing year; matters reverted to an inter- regnum.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The citizens were taken up with the pressing and laborious task of rebuilding their City, and it was during this interval that Q. Fabius, immediately on laying down his office, was indicted by Cn. Marcius, a tribune of the plebs, on the ground that after being sent as an envoy to the Gauls to speak on behalf of the Clusians, he had, contrary to the law of nations, fought against them.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was saved from the threatened pro- ceedings by death; a death so opportune that many people believed it to be a voluntary one.</p><p>The interregnum began with P. Cornelius Scipio as the first interrex; he was followed by M. Furius Camillus, under whom the election of military tribunes was conducted.
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Those elected were L. Valerius Publicola, for the second time, L. Verginius, P. Cornelius, A. Manlius, L. Aemilius, and L. Postumius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Proceedings in the Senate</note>. &mdash;They entered upon their office immediately, and their very first case was to submit to the senate measures affecting religion. Orders were made that in the first place search should be made for the treaties and laws &mdash; these latter including those of the Twelve Tables and some belonging to the time of the kings &mdash;as far as they were still extant.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Some were made accessible to the public, but those which dealt with divine worship were kept secret by the pontiff mainly in order that the people might remain dependent on them for religious guidance. Then they entered upon a discussion of the <q direct="unspecified">days of prohibition.</q><note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed"><emph>Days of prohibition.</emph> These were days marked by some great disaster to the Roman republic on which it was forbidden to transact any public business, perform any sacred fuctions, commence any undertaking (e.g. a journey), or celebrate a marriage.</note>The
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> 18th of July was marked by a double disaster, for on that day the Fabii were annihilated at the Cremera, and in after years the battle at the Alia which involved the ruin of the City was lost on the same day. From the latter disaster the day was called <q direct="unspecified">the day of the Alia,</q> and was observed by a religious abstinence from all public and private business.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The consular tribune Sulpicius had not offered acceptable sacrifices on July 16 (the day after the Ides), and without having secured the good will of the gods the Roman army was exposed to the enemy two days later. Some think that it was for this reason that on the day after the Ides in each month all religious functions were ordered to be suspended, and hence it became the custom to observe the second and the middle days of the month in the same way.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the one side, the Volscians, their ancient foes, had taken up arms in the determination to wipe out the name of Rome; on the other side, traders were bringing in reports of an assembly at the fane of Voltumna, where the leading men from all the Etruscan cantons were forming a hostile league.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Still further alarm was created by the defection of the Latins and Hernicans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After the battle of Lake Regillus these nations had never wavered for 100 years in their loyal friendship with Rome.</p><p>As so many dangers were threatening on all sides and it became evident the name of Rome was not only held in hatred by her foes, but regarded with contempt by her allies, the senate decided that the State should be defended under
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the auspices of the man by whom it had been recovered, and that M. Furius Camillus should be nominated Dictator.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He nominated as his Master of the Horse, C. Servilius Ahala, and after closing the law courts and suspending all business he proceeded to enroll all the men of military age.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those of the <q direct="unspecified">seniors</q> who still possessed some vigour were placed in separate centuries after they had taken the military oath.</p><p>When he had completed the enrollment and equipment of the army he formed it into three divisions. One he stationed in the Veientine territory fronting Etruria.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The second was ordered to form an entrenched camp to cover the City; A. Manlius, as military tribune, was in command of this division, whilst L. Aemilius in a similar capacity directed the movement against the Etruscans. The third division he led in person against the Volscians and advanced to attack their encampment at a place called Ad Mecium, not far from Lanuvium.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They had gone to war in a feeling of contempt for their enemy as they believed that almost all the Roman fighting men had been annihilated by the Gauls, but when they heard that Camillus was in command they were filled with such alarm that they raised a rampart round them and barricaded the
							<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> rampart with trees piled up round it to prevent the enemy from penetrating their lines at any point.</p> <p>As soon as he became aware of this Camillus ordered fire to be thrown on the barricade.
								<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The wind happened to be blowing strongly towards the enemy, and so it not only opened up a way through the fire, but by driving the flames into the camp it produced such consternation amongst the defenders, with the steam and smoke and crackling of the green wood as it burnt, that the Roman soldiers found less difficulty in surmounting the rampart and forcing the camp than in crossing the burnt barricade.
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The enemy were routed and cut to pieces. After the capture of the camp the Dictator gave the booty to the soldiers; an act all the more welcome to them as they did not expect it from a general by no means given to generosity.
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In the pursuit he ravaged the length and breadth of the Volscian territory, and at last after seventy years of war forced them to surrender.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>From his conquest of the Volscians he marched across to the Aequi who were also preparing for war, surprised their army at Bolae, and in the first assault captured not only their camp but their city.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Etruria.</note> these successes were occurring in the field of operations where Camillus was the life and soul of the Roman cause, in another direction a terrible danger was threatening.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Nearly the whole of Etruria was in arms and was besieging Sutrium, a city in alliance with Rome. Their envoys approached the senate with a request for help in their desperate condition, and the senate passed a decree that the Dictator should render assistance to the Sutrines as soon as he possibly could.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their hopes were deferred, and as the circumstances of the besieged were such as to admit of no longer delay &mdash;their scanty numbers being worn out with toil, want of sleep, and fighting, which always fell upon the same persons &mdash;they made a conditional surrender of their city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As the mournful procession set forth, leaving their hearths and homes, without arms and with only one garment apiece, Camillus and his army happened just at that moment to appear on the scene. The grief-stricken crowd flung themselves at his feet; the appeals of their leaders, wrung from them by dire necessity, were drowned by the weeping of the women and children who were being dragged along as companions in exile . Camillus bade the Sutrines spare their laments, it was to the Etruscans that he was bringing grief and tears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then gave orders for the baggage to be deposited, and the Sutrines to remain where they were, and leaving a small detachment on guard ordered his men to follow him with only their arms. With his disencumbered army he marched to Sutrium, and found, as he expected, everything in disorder, as usual after a success, the gates open and unguarded, and the victorious enemy dispersed through the streets carrying plunder away from the houses.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Sutrium was captured accordingly twice in the same day; the lately victorious Etruscans were everywhere massacred by their new enemies; no time was allowed them either to concentrate their strength or seize their weapons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As they tried each to make their way to the gates on the chance of escaping to the open country they found them closed; this was the first thing the Dictator ordered to be done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then some got possession of their arms, others who happened to be armed when the tumult surprised them called their comrades together to make a stand. The despair of the enemy would have led to a fierce struggle had not criers been despatched throughout the city to order all to lay down their arms and those without arms to be spared; none were to be injured unless found in arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Those who had deter- mined in their extremity to fight to the end, now that hopes of life were offered them threw away their arms in all directions, and, since Fortune had made this the safer course, gave themselves as unarmed men to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Owing to their great number, they were distributed in various places for safe keeping. Before nightfall the town was given back to the Sutrines uninjured and untouched by all the ruin of war, since it had not been taken by storm but surrendered on conditions.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Growth of the Republic</note>. &mdash;Camillus returned in triumphal procession to the City, after having been victorious in three simultaneous wars.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> By far the greatest number of the prisoners who were led before his chariot belonged to the Etruscans. They were publicly sold, and so much was realized that after the matrons had been repaid for their gold<note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="ed">They had twice contributed toward the necessities of the commonwealth; the first time was to assist the government to discharge its responsibility under the vow of Camillus which he had made before the capture of Veii.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> These were inscribed with the name of Camillus, and it is generally believed that previous to the fire in the Capitol<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed">The Capitol was partially destroyed by fire in <date value="-83">83</date> B. C.</note> they were deposited in the chapel of Jupiter before the feet of Juno.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>During the year, those of the inhabitants of Veii, Capenae, and Fidenae who had gone over to the Romans whilst these wars were going on, were admitted into full citizenship and received an allotment of land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate passed a resolution recalling those who had repaired to Veii and taken possession of the empty houses there to avoid the labour of rebuilding. At first they protested and took no notice of the order; then a day was fixed, and those who had not returned by that date were threatened with outlawry. This step made each man fear for himself, and from being united in defiance they now showed individual obedience.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Rome was growing in population, and buildings were rising up in every part of it The State gave financial assistance; the aediles urged on the work as though it were a State undertaking; the individual citizens were in a hurry to complete their task through need of accommodation. Within the year the new City was built.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Renewed fighting in Etruria</note>. &mdash;At the close of the year elections of consular tribunes were held. Those elected were T. Quinctius Cincinnatus, Q. Servilius Fidenas (for the fifth time), L. Julius Julus, L. Aquilius Corvus, L. Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Ser. Sulpicius Rufus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> One army was led against the Aequi &mdash;not to war, for they acknowledged that they were conquered, but &mdash;to ravage their territories so that no strength might be left them for future aggression. The other advanced into the district of Tarquinii. There, Cortuosa and Contenebra, towns belonging to the Etruscans, were taken by assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At Cortuosa there was no fighting, the garrison were surprised and the place was carried at the very first assault. Contenebra stood a siege for a few days, but the incessant toil without any remission day or night proved too much for them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Roman army was formed into six divisions, each of which took its part in the fighting in turn every six hours. The small number of the defenders necessitated the same men continually coming into action against a fresh enemy; at last they gave up, and an opening was afforded the Roman for entering the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The tribunes decided that the booty should be sold on behalf of the State, but they were slower in announcing their decision than in forming it; whilst they were hesitating, the soldiery had already appropriated it, and it could not be taken from them without creating bitter resentment.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The growth of the City was not confined to private buildings. A substructure of squared stones was built beneath the Capitol during this year, which, even amidst the present magnificence of the City, is a conspicuous object.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Domestic Affairs.</note> the citizens were taken up with their building, the tribunes of the plebs tried to make the meetings of the Assembly more attractive by bringing forward agrarian proposal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They held out the prospect of acquiring the Pomptine territory, which, now that the Volscians had been reduced by Camillus, had become the indisputable possession of of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This territory, they alleged, was in much greater danger from the nobles than it had been from the Volscians, for the latter only made raids into it as long as they had
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> strength and weapons, but the nobles were putting themselves in possession of the public domain, and unless it was allotted before they appropriated everything there would be no room for plebeians
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> there.</p><p>They did not produce much impression on the plebeians, who were busy with their building and only attended the Assembly in small numbers, and as their expenses had exhausted their means, they felt no interest in land which they were unable to develop owing to want of capital.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In a community devoted to religious observances, the recent disaster had filled the leading men with superstitious fears; in order, therefore, that the auspices might be taken afresh they fell back upon an interregnum. There were three interreges in, succession &mdash;M. Manlius Capitolinus, Ser.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Sulpicius Camerinus, and L. Valerius Potitus. The last of these conducted the election of consular tribunes. Those elected were: L. Papirius, C. Cornelius, C. Sergius, L. Aemilius (for the second time), L. Menenius, and L. Valerius Publicola (for the third time). They immediately entered office.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In this year the temple of Mars, which had been vowed in the Gaulish war, was dedicated by T. Quinctius, one of the two custodians of the Sibylline Books. The new citizens were formed into four additional tribes &mdash;the Stellatine, the Tromentine, the Sabatine, and the Arnian. These brought up the number of the tribes to twenty-five.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Wars with the Volscians and Etruscans.</note> question of the Pomptine territory was again raised by L. Sicinius, a tribune of the plebs, and the people attended the Assembly in greater numbers and showed a more eager desire for land than they had done.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In the senate the subject of the Latin and Hernican wars was mentioned, but owing to the concern felt about a more serious war, it was adjourned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Etruria was in arms. They again fell back on Camillus He was made consular tribune, and five colleagues were assigned to him: Ser. Cornelius Maluginensis, Q. Servilius Fidenas (for the sixth time), L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, L. Horatius Pulvillus, and P. Valerius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At the beginning of the year public anxiety was diverted from the Etruscan war by the arrival in the City of a body of fugitives from the Pomptine territory, who reported that the Antiates were in arms, and that the Latin cantons had sent their fighting men to assist them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The latter explained in their defence that it was not in consequence of a formal act of their government; all they had done was to decline prohibiting any one from serving where he chose as a volunteer.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>It was no longer the fashion to think lightly of any wars. The senate thanked heaven that Camillus was in office, for certainly had he been a private citizen he must have been nominated Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His colleagues admitted that when any alarm arose of threatened war the supreme direction of everything must be in one man's hands, and they had made up their minds to subordinate their powers to Camillus, feeling assured that to enhance his authority in no way derogated from their own.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This action of the consular tribunes met with the hearty approval of the senate, and Camillus, in modest confusion, returned thanks to them.</p><p>He went on to say that a tremendous burden had been laid upon him by the people of Rome in making him practically Dictator for the fourth time; a heavy responsibility had been put upon him by the senate, who had passed such a flattering judgment upon him; heaviest of all by his colleagues in the honour they had done him.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If it were possible for him to show still greater activity and vigilance, he would strive so to surpass himself that he might make the lofty estimation, which his fellow-citizens had with such striking unanimity formed of him, a lasting one.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As far as war with the Antiates was concerned, the outlook was threatening rather than dangerous; at the same time he advised them, whilst fearing nothing, to treat nothing with indifference.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Rome was beset by the ill-will and hatred of its neighbours, and the interests of the State therefore required several generals and several armies.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>He proceeded: <q direct="unspecified">You, P. Valerius, I wish to associate with myself in counsel and command, and you will lead the legions in concert with me against the Antiates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> You, Q. Servilius, will keep a second army ready for instant service encamped by the City, prepared for any movement, such as recently took place, on the part of Etruria or on the side of the Latins and Hernicans who are causing us this fresh trouble. I am quite certain that you will conduct the campaign in a manner worthy of your father, your grandfather, yourself, and your six tribuneships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> A third army must be raised by L. Quinctius from the seniors, and those excused from service on grounds of health, to garrison the defences of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> L. Horatius is to provide armour, weapons, corn, and everything else required in a time of war. You, Ser. Cornelius, are appointed by us your colleagues as president of this Council of State, and guardian of everything
					<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> pertaining to religion, of the Assembly, the laws, and all matters touching the City.</q></p><p>All gladly promised to devote themselves to the various duties assigned them;
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Valerius, associated in the chief command, added that he should look upon M. Furius as Dictator and regard himself as his Master of the Horse, and the estimation in which they held their sole commander should be the measure of the hopes they entertained as to the issue of the war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The senators, in high delight, exclaimed that they at all events were full of hope with regard to war and peace and all that concerned the republic; there would never be any need for a Dictator when they had such men in office, with such perfect harmony of feeling, prepared equally to obey or command, conferring glory on their country instead of appropriating their country's glory to themselves.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After proclaiming a suspension of all public business and completing the enrolment of troops, Furius and Valerius proceeded to Satricum. Here the Antiates had massed not only Volscian troops drawn from a new generation <note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="ed">The fighting force of the previous generation had been practically annihilated by Camillus in the action near Lanuvium.</note> but also an immense body of Latins and Hernicans, nations whose strength had been growing through long years of peace. This coalition of new enemies with old ones daunted the spirits of the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> soldiers. Camillus was already drawing up his men for battle when the centurions brought reports to him of the discouragement of his troops, the want of alacrity in arming themselves, and the hesitation and unwillingness with which they were marching out of camp. Men were even heard saying that <q direct="unspecified">they were going to fight one against a hundred, and that such a multitude could hardly be withstood even if unarmed, much less now that they were in
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> arms.</q></p> <p>He at once sprang on his horse, faced the line and, riding along the front, addressed his men <q direct="unspecified">What is this gloom, soldiers, this extraordinary hesitation? Are you strangers to the enemy, or to me, or to yourselves? As for the enemy &mdash; what is he but the means through which you always prove your courage and win
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> renown? And as for you &mdash;not to mention the capture of Falerii and Veii and the slaughter of the Gaulish legions inside your captured City &mdash;have you not, under my leadership, enjoyed a triple triumph for a threefold victory over these very Volscians, as well as over the Aequi and over
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Etruria? Or is it that you do not recognise me as your general because I have given the battle signal not as Dictator but as a consular tribune? I feel no craving for the highest authority over you, nor ought you to see in me anything beyond what I am in myself; the Dictatorship has never increased my spirits and energy, nor did my exile diminish
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> them. We are all of us, then, the same that we have ever been, and since we are bringing just the same qualities into this war that we have displayed in all former wars, let us look forward to the same result. As soon as you meet your foe, every one will do what he has been trained and accustomed to do; you will conquer, they will fly.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then, after sounding the charge, he sprang from his horse and, catching hold of the nearest standard-bearer, he hurried with him against the enemy, exclaiming at the same time: <q direct="unspecified">On, soldier, with the standard!</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they saw Camillus, weakened as he was by age, charging in person against the enemy, they all raised the battle-cry and rushed forward, shouting in all directions, <q direct="unspecified">Follow the General!</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It is stated that by Camillus' orders the standard was flung into the enemy's lines in order to incite the men of the front rank to recover it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was in this quarter that the Antiates were first repulsed, and the panic spread through the front ranks as far as the reserves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This was due not only to the efforts of the troops, stimulated as they were by the presence of Camillus, but also to the terror which his actual appearance inspired in the Volscians, to whom he was a special object of dread.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thus, wherever be advanced he carried certain victory with him. This was especially evident in the Roman left, which was on the point of giving way, when, after flinging himself on his horse and armed with an infantry shield, he rode up to it and by simply showing himself and pointing to the rest of the line who were winning the day, restored the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The action was now decided, but owing to the crowding together of the enemy their flight was impeded and the victorious soldiers grew weary of the prolonged slaughter of such an enormous number of fugitives. A sudden storm of rain and wind put an end to what had become a decisive victory more than a battle.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The signal was given to retire, and the night that followed brought the war to a close without any further exertions on the part of the Romans, for the Latins and Hernicans left the Volscians to their fate and started for home,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> after obtaining a result correspondent to their evil counsels When the Volscians found themselves deserted by the men whom they had relied upon when they renewed hostilities, they abandoned their camp and shut themselves up in Satricum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> At first Camillus invested them with the usual siege works; but when he found that the sorties were made to impede his operations, he considered that the enemy did not possess sufficient courage to justify him in waiting for a victory of which there was only a distant prospect. After encouraging his soldiers by telling them not to wear themselves by protracted toil, as though they were attacking another Veii, for victory was already within their grasp, he planted scaling ladders all round the walls and took the place by storm. The Volscians flung away their arms and surrendered.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The general, however, had a more important object in view &mdash;Antium, the capital of the Volscians and the starting point of the last war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Owing to its strength, the capture of that city could only be effected by a considerable quantity of siege apparatus, artillery, and war machines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Camillus therefore left his colleague in command and went to Rome to urge upon the senate the necessity of destroying Antium In the middle of his speech &mdash;I think it was the will of heaven that Antium should remain some time longer &mdash;envoys arrived from Nepete and Sutrium begging for help against the Etruscans and pointing out that the chance of rendering assistance would soon be lost.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Fortune diverted Camillus' energies from Antium to that quarter, for those places, fronting Etruria, served as gates and barriers on that side, and the Etruscans were anxious to secure them whenever they were meditating hostilities, whilst the Romans were equally anxious to recover and hold them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate accordingly decided to arrange with Camillus that he should let Antium go and undertake the war with Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They assigned to him the legions in the City which Quinctius was commanding, and though he would have preferred the army which was acting against the Volsci, of which he had had experience and which was accustomed to his command, he raised no objection; all he asked for was that Valerius should share the command with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Quinctius and Horatius were sent against the Volscian in succession to Valerius.</p> <p>When they reached Sutrium, Furius and Valerius found a part of the city in the hands of the Etruscans; in the rest of the place the inhabitants were with difficulty keeping the enemy at bay behind barricades which they had erected in the streets.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The approach of succours from Rome and the name of Camillus, famous amongst allies and enemies alike, relieved the situation for the moment and allowed time to render assistance.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Camillus accordingly formed his army into two divisions and ordered his colleague to take one round to the side which the enemy were holding and commence an attack on the walls. This was done not so much in the hope that the attack would succeed as that the enemy's attention might be distracted so as to afford a respite to the wearied defenders and an opportunity for him to effect an entrance into the town without fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Etruscans, finding themselves attacked on both sides, the walls being assaulted from without and the townsmen fighting within, flung themselves in one panic-stricken mass through the only gate which happened to be clear of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A great slaughter of the fugitives took place both in the city and in the fields outside. Furious men accounted for many inside the walls, whilst Valerius' troops were more lightly equipped for pursuit, and they did not put an end to the carnage till nightfall prevented their seeing any longer.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>After the recapture of Sutrium and its restoration to our allies, the army marched to Nepete, which had surrendered to the Etruscans and of which they were in complete possession.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It looked as if the capture of that city would give more trouble, not only because the whole of it was in the hands of the enemy, but also because the surrender had been effected through the treachery of some of the townsfolk.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Camillus, however, determined to send a message to their leaders requesting them to withdraw from the Etruscans and give a practical proof of that loyalty to allies which they had implored the Roman to observe towards them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their reply was that they were powerless; the Etruscans were holding the walls and guarding the gates. At first it was sought to intimidate the townsmen by harrying their territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As, however, they persisted in adhering more faithfully to the terms of surrender than to their alliance with Rome, fascines of brushwood were collected from the surrounding country to fill up the fosse, the army advanced to the attack, the scaling ladders were placed against the walls, and at the very first attempt the town was captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Proclamation was then made that the Nepesines were to lay down their arms, and all who did so were ordered to be spared. The Etruscans, whether armed or not, were killed, and the Nepesines who had been the agents of the surrender were beheaded; the population who had no share in it received their property back, and the town was left with a garrison.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After thus recovering two cities in alliance with Rome from the enemy, the consular tribunes led their victorious army, covered with glory, home.</p> <p>During this year satisfaction was demanded from the Latins and Hernici; they were asked why they had not for these last few years furnished a contingent in accordance with the treaty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A full representative assembly of each nation was held to discuss the terms of the reply.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>This was to the effect that it was through no fault or public act of the State that some of their men had fought in the Volscian ranks; these had paid the penalty of their folly, not a single one had returned. The reason why they had supplied no troops was their incessant fear of the Volscians; this thorn in their side they had not, even after such a long succession of wars, been able to get rid of.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The senate regarded this reply as affording a justifiable ground for war, but the present time was deemed inopportune.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Treason of M. Manlius Capitolinus.</note> consular tribunes who succeeded were A. Manlius, P. Cornelius, T and L. Quinctius Capitolinus, L. Papirius Cursor (for the second time&gt;, and C. Sergius (for the second time).</p> <p>In this year a serious war broke out, and a still more serious disturbance at home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The war was begun by the Volscians, aided by the revolted Latins and Hernici. The domestic trouble arose in a quarter where it was least to be apprehended, from a man of patrician birth and brilliant reputation &mdash;M. Manlius Capitolinus .</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Full of pride and presumption, he looked down upon the foremost men with scorn; one in particular he regarded with envious eyes, a man conspicuous for his distinctions and his merits &mdash;M. Furius Camillus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He bitterly resented this man's unique position amongst the magistrates and in the affections of the army, and declared that he was now such a superior person that he treated those who had been appointed under the same auspices as himself, not as his colleagues, but as his servants, and yet if any one would form a just judgment he would see that M. Furius could not possibly have rescued his country. <note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed"><emph>His country</emph>. &mdash;The magistrates, the senators, the fighting men &mdash;all that constituted <q direct="unspecified">his country</q> &mdash;were shut up in the Capitol and owed their preservation to Manlius.</note> When it was beleaguered by the enemy had not he, Manlius, saved the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Capitol and the Citadel? Camillus attacked the Gauls while they were off their guard, their minds pre-occupied with obtaining the gold and securing peace; <emph>he</emph>, on the other hand, had driven them off when they were armed for battle and actually capturing the Citadel. Camillus' glory was shared by every man who conquered with him, whereas no mortal man could obviously claim any
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> part in <emph>his</emph> victory.</p> <p>With his head full of these notions and being unfortunately a man of headstrong and passionate nature, he found that his influence was not so powerful with the patricians as he thought it ought to be, so he went over to the plebs &mdash;the first patrician to do so &mdash;and adopted the political
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> methods of their magistrates. He abused the senate and courted the populace and, impelled by the breeze of popular favour more than by conviction or judgment,
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> preferred notoriety to respectability. Not content with the agrarian laws which had hitherto always served the tribunes of the plebs as the material for their agitation, he began to undermine the whole system of credit for he saw that the laws of debt caused more irritation than the others; they not only threatened poverty and disgrace, but they terrified the freeman with the prospect
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> of fetters and imprisonment. And, as a matter of fact, a vast amount of debt had been contracted owing to the expense of building, an expense most ruinous even to the rich.</p> <p>It became, therefore, a question of arming the government with stronger powers, and the Volscian war, serious in itself but made much more so by the defection of the Latins and Hernici, was put forward
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> as the ostensible reason. It was, however, the revolutionary designs of Manlius that mainly decided the senate to nominate a Dictator. A. Cornelius Cossus was nominated and he named T. Quinctius Capitolinus as his Master of the Horse.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Volscian War.</note> the Dictator recognised that a more difficult contest lay before him at home than abroad, he enrolled his troops and proceeded to the Pomptine territory, which, he heard, had been invaded by the Volscians. Either he considered it necessary to take prompt military measures or he hoped to strengthen his hands as Dictator by a victory and a triumph.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I have no doubt that my readers will be tired of such a long record of incessant wars with the Volscians, but they will also be struck with the same difficulty which I have myself felt whilst examining the authorities who lived nearer to the period, namely, from what source did the Volscians obtain sufficient soldiers after so many defeats?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Since this point has been passed over by the ancient writers, what can I do more than express an opinion such as any one may form from his own inferences?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Probably, in the interval between one war and another, they trained each fresh generation against the renewal of hostilities, as is now done in the enlistment of Roman troops, or their armies were not always drawn from the same districts, though it was always the same nation that carried on the war, or there must have been an innumerable free population in those districts which
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> are barely now kept from desolation by the scanty tillage of Roman slaves, with hardly so much as a miserably small recruiting ground for soldiers left.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At all events, the authorities are unanimous in asserting that the Volscians had an immense army in spite of their having been so lately crippled by the successes of Camillus. Their numbers were increased by the Latins and Hernici, as well as by a body of Circeians, and even by a contingent from Velitrae, where there was a Roman colony.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>On the day he arrived the Dictator formed his camp. On the, morrow, after taking the auspices and supplicating the favour of the gods by sacrifice and prayer, he advanced in high spirits to the soldiers who were already in the early dawn arming themselves according to orders against the moment when the signal for battle should be given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <q direct="unspecified">Ours, soldiers,</q> he exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">is the victory, if the gods and their interpreters see at all into the future. Let us then, as becomes men filled with sure hopes, who are going to engage an enemy who is no match for us, lay our javelins at our feet and arm ourselves only with our swords. I would not even have any running forward from the line; stand firm and receive the enemy's charge without stirring a foot.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they have hurled their ineffective missiles and their disordered ranks fling themselves upon you, then let your swords flash and let every man remember that it is the gods who are helping the Romans, it is the gods who have sent you into battle with favourable omens.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> You, T. Quinctius, keep your cavalry in hand and wait till the fight has begun, but when you see the lines locked together, foot to foot, then strike with the terror of your cavalry those who are already overtaken with other terrors. Charge and scatter their ranks while they are in the thick of the fight.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Cavalry and infantry alike fought in accordance with their instructions. The commander did not disappoint his soldiers, nor did Fortune disappoint the commander.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The vast host of the enemy, relying solely on their numbers and measuring the strength of each army merely by their eyes, went recklessly into the battle and as recklessly abandoned it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Courageous enough in the battle shout, in discharging their weapons, in making the first charge, they were unable to stand the foot to foot fighting and the looks of their opponents, glowing with the ardour of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their front was driven in and the demoralisation extended to the supports; the charge of the cavalry produced fresh panic; the ranks were broken in many places, the whole army was in commotion and resembled a retreating wave. When each of them saw that as those in front fell he would be the next to be cut down, they turned and fled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans pressed hard upon them, and as long as the enemy defended themselves whilst retreating, it was the infantry to whom the task of pursuit fell. When they were seen to be throwing away their arms in all directions and dispersing over the field, the signal was given for the squadrons of cavalry to be launched against them, and these were instructed not to lose time by cutting down individual fugitives and to give the main body a chance of escaping.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It would be enough to check them by hurling missiles and galloping across their front, and generally terrifying them until the infantry could come up and regularly dispatch the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The flight and pursuit did not end till nightfall. The Volscian camp was taken and plundered on the same day, and all the booty, with the exception of the prisoners, was bestowed on the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The majority of the captives belonged to the Hernici and Latins, not men of the plebeian class, who might have been regarded as only mercenaries, they were found to include some of the principal men of their fighting force, a clear proof that those States had formally assisted the enemy. Some were also recognised as belonging to Circeii and to the colony at Velitrae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They were all sent to Rome and examined by the leaders of the senate; they gave them the same replies which they had made to the Dictator, and disclosed without any attempt at evasion the defection of their respective nations.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Proceedings against Manlius.</note> Dictator kept his army permanently encamped, fully expecting that the senate would declare war against those peoples. A much greater trouble at home, however, necessitated his recall. The sedition which, owing to its ringleader's work, was exceptionally alarming, was gaining strength from day to day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For to any one who looked at his motives, not only the speeches, but still more the conduct of M. Manlius, though ostensibly in the interest of the people, would have appeared revolutionary and dangerous.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When he saw a centurion, a distinguished soldier, led away as an adjudged debtor, he ran into the middle of the Forum with his crowd of supporters and laid his hand on him. After declaiming against the tyranny of patricians and the brutality of usurers and the wretched condition of the plebs he said:
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <q direct="unspecified">It was then in vain that I with this right hand saved the Capitol and Citadel if I have to see a fellow-citizen and a comrade in arms carried off to chains and slavery just as though he had been captured by the victorious Gauls.</q> Then, before all the people, he paid the sum due to the creditors, and after thus freeing the man by <q direct="unspecified">copper and scales,</q> sent him home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The released debtor appealed to gods and men to reward Manlius, his deliverer and the beneficial protector of the Roman plebs. A noisy crowd immediately surrounded him, and he increased the excitement by displaying the scars left by wounds he had received in the wars against Veii and the Gauls and in recent campaigns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <q direct="unspecified">Whilst,</q> he cried, <q direct="unspecified">I was serving in the field and whilst I was trying to restore my desolated home,
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> I paid in interest an amount equal to many times the principal, but as the fresh interest always exceeded my capital, I was buried beneath the load of debt.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It is owing to M. Manlius that I can now look upon the light of day, the Forum, the faces of my fellow-citizens; from him I have received all the kindness which a parent can show to a child; to him I devote all that remains of my bodily powers, my blood, my life. In that one man is centred everything that binds me to my home, my country, and my country's gods.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The plebs, wrought upon by this language, had now completely espoused this one man's cause, when another circumstance occurred, still more calculated to create universal confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Manlius brought under the auctioneer's hammer an estate in the Veientine territory which comprised the principal part of his patrimony &mdash; <q direct="unspecified">In order,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">that as long as any of my property remains, I may prevent any of you Quirites from being delivered up to your creditors as judgment debtors.</q> This roused them to such a pitch that it was quite clear that they would follow the champion of their liberties through anything, right or wrong.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>To add to the mischief, he delivered speeches in his own house, as though he were haranguing the Assembly, full of calumnious abuse of the senate. Indifferent to the truth or falsehood of what he said, he declared, among other things, that the stores of gold collected for the Gauls were being hidden away by the patricians; they were no longer content with appropriating the public lands unless they could also embezzle the public funds; if that affair were brought to light, the debts of the plebs could be wiped off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> With this hope held out to them, they thought it a most shameful proceeding that whilst the gold got together to ransom the City from the Gauls had been raised by general taxation, this very gold when recovered from the enemy had become the plunder of a few.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They insisted, therefore, on finding out where this vast stolen booty was concealed, and as Manlius kept putting them off and announcing that he would choose his own time for the disclosure, the universal interest became absorbed in this question to the exclusion of everything else. There would clearly be no limit to their gratitude if his information proved correct, or to their displeasure if it turned out to be false.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst matters were in this state of suspense the Dictator had been summoned from the army and arrived in the City. After satisfying himself as to the state of public feeling he called a meeting of the senate for the following day and ordered them to remain in constant attendance upon him. He then ordered his chair of office to be placed on the tribunal in the Comitium and, surrounded by the senators as a bodyguard, sent his officer to M. Manlius. On receiving the Dictator's summons, Manlius gave his party a signal that a conflict was imminent, and appeared before the tribunal with an immense crowd round him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the one side the senate, on the other side the plebs,, each with their eyes fixed on their respective leaders, stood facing one another as though drawn up for battle.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After silence was obtained, the Dictator said: <q direct="unspecified">I wish the senate and myself could come to an understanding with the plebs on all other matters as easily as, I am convinced, we shall about you and the subject on which I am about to examine you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I see that you have led your fellow-Citizens to expect that all debts can be paid without any loss to the creditors out of the treasure recovered from the Gauls, which you say the leading patricians are secreting. I am so far from wishing to hinder this project that, on the contrary, I challenge M. Manlius, to take off from their hidden hordes those who, like sitting hens, are brooding over treasures which belong to the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If you fail to do this, either because you yourself have your part in the spoils or because your charge is unfounded, I shall order you to be thrown into prison and will not suffer the people to be excited by the false hopes which you have raised.</q></p> <p>Manlius said in reply that he had not been mistaken in his suspicions; it was not against the Volscians who were treated as enemies whenever it was in the interest of the patricians so to treat them, nor against the Latins and Hernici whom they were driving to arms by false charges, that a Dictator had been appointed, but against him and the Roman plebs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They had dropped their pretended war and were now attacking him; the Dictator was openly declaring himself the protector of the usurers against the plebeians; the gratitude and affection which the people were showing towards himself were being made the ground for charges against him which would ruin him. He proceeded: <q direct="unspecified">The crowd which I have round me is an offence in your eyes, A. Cornelius, and in yours, senators. Then why do you not each of you withdraw it from me by acts of kindness by offering security, by releasing your fellow-citizens from the stocks, by preventing them from being adjudged to their creditors, by supporting others in their necessity out of the superabundance of your own wealth?
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But why should I urge you to spend your own money? Be content with a moderate capital, deduct from the principal what has already been paid in interest, then the crowd round me will be no more noticeable than that round any one else.</q></p> <p><q direct="unspecified">But do I alone show this anxiety for my fellow-citizens? I can only answer that question as I should answer anotherWhy did I alone save the Capitol and the Citadel?
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then I did what I could to save the body of citizens as a whole, now I am doing what I can to help individuals. As to the gold of the Gauls, your question throws difficulties round a thing which is simple enough in itself. For why do you ask me about a matter which is within your own knowledge? Why do you order what is in your purse to be shaken out from it rather than surrender it voluntarily, unless there is some dishonesty at bottom?
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The more you order your conjuring tricks to be detected, the more, I fear, will you hoodwink those who are watching you. It is not I who ought to be compelled to discover your plunder for you, it is you who ought to be compelled to publicly produce it.</q></p> <p>The Dictator ordered him to drop all subterfuge, and insisted upon his either adducing trustworthy evidence or admitting that he had been guilty of concocting false accusations against the senate and exposing them to odium on a baseless charge of theft.
									<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He refused, and said he would not speak at the bidding of his enemies, whereupon the Dictator ordered him to be taken to prison. When apprehended by the officer he exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Queen Juno, Minerva, all ye gods and goddesses who dwell in the Capitol, do ye suffer your soldier and defender to be thus persecuted by his enemies? Shall this right hand with which I drove the Gauls from your shrines be manacled and fettered?</q>
									<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> None could endure to see or hear the indignity offered him, but the State, in its absolute submission to lawful authority, had imposed upon itself limits which could not be passed; neither the tribunes of the plebs nor the plebeians themselves ventured to cast an angry look or breathe a syllable against the action of the Dictator. It seems pretty certain that after Manlius was thrown into prison, a great number of plebeians went into mourning; many let their hair grow, and the vestibule of the prison was beset by a depressed and sorrowful crowd.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The Dictator celebrated his triumph over the Volscians, but his triumph increased his unpopularity; men complained that the victory was won at home, not in the field, over a citizen, not over an enemy. One thing alone was lacking in the pageant of tyranny, Manlius was not led in procession before the victor's chariot.</p> <p>Matters were rapidly drifting towards sedition, and the senate took the initiative in endeavouring to cause the prevailing unrest. Before any demand had been put forward they ordered that 2000 Roman citizens should be settled as colonists at Satricum, and each receive two and a half <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign> of land.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This was regarded as too small a grant, distributed amongst too small a number; it was looked upon, in fact, as a bribe for the betrayal of Manlius, and the proposed remedy only inflamed the disease.</p> <p>By this time the crowd of Manlian sympathisers had become conspicuous for their dirty garments <note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed">All the garments of both sexes were for many centuries made exclusively of wool, and undyed. The cleansing of these &mdash;especially the outer garments, the men's toga and the women's palla &mdash;was an important and elaborate piece of work. But, as in the present case, the neglect of personal cleanliness was one means of appealing to the sympathies of the public, the grief-stricken wearers of the dirty garments had no heart to look after their personal appearance.</note> and dejected looks. It was not till the Dictator laid down his office after his triumph and so removed the terror which he inspired that the tongues and spirits of men were once more free.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Men were heard openly reproaching the populace for always encouraging their defenders till they led them to the brink of the precipice and deserting them when the moment of danger actually came.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It was in this way, they said, that Sp. Cassius, while seeking to get the plebs on to the land, and Sp. Maelius, whilst staving off famine at his own cost from the mouths of his fellow-citizens, had both been crushed; it was in this way that M. Manlius was betrayed to his foes, whilst rescuing a part of the community who were overwhelmed and submerged by usurious extortion and bringing them back to light and liberty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The plebs fattened up their own defenders for slaughter. Was it not to be permitted that a man of consular rank should refuse to answer at the beck and call of a Dictator? Assuming that he had previously been speaking falsely, and had therefore no reply ready at the time, was there ever a slave who had been thrown into prison as a punishment for lying?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Had they forgotten that night which was all but a final and eternal night for Rome? Could they not recall the sight of the troop of Gauls climbing up over the Tarpeian rock, or that of Manlius himself as they had actually seen him, covered with blood and sweat, after rescuing, one might almost say, Jupiter himself from the hands of the enemy. Had he discharged their obligation to the saviour of their country by giving him half a pound of corn each?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Was the man whom they almost regarded as a god, whom they at all events placed, on a level with Jupiter of the Capitol by giving him the epithet of Capitolinus &mdash;was that man to be allowed to drag out his life in chains and darkness at the mercy of the executioner? Had the help of one man sufficed to save all, and was there amongst them all no help to be found for that one man?</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>By this time the crowd refused to leave the spot even at night, and were threatening to break open the prison when the senate conceded what they were going to extort by violence, and passed a resolution that Manlius should be released. This did not put an end to the seditious agitation, it simply provided it with a leader.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>During this time the Latins and Hernici, together with the colonists from Circeii and Velitrae, sent to Rome to clear themselves from the charge of being concerned in the Volscian war and to ask for the surrender of their countrymen who had been made prisoners, that they might proceed against them under their own laws. An unfavourable reply was given to the Latins and Hernici, a still more unfavourable one to the colonists, because they had entertained the impious project of attacking their mother country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Not only was the surrender of the prisoners refused, but they received a stern warning from the senate, which was withheld from the Latins and Hernici, to make their way speedily from the City out of the sight of the Roman people; otherwise they would be no longer protected by the rights of ambassadors, rights which were established for foreigners, not for citizens.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the close of the year, amidst the growing agitation headed by Manlius, the elections were held. The new consular tribunes were: Ser. Cornelius Maluginensis and P. Valerius Potitus (each for the second time), M. Furius Camillus (for the fifth time), Ser. Sulpicius Rufus (for the second time), C. Papirius Crassus and T. Quinctius Cincinnatus (for the second time).</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The year opened in peace, which was most opportune for both patricians and plebeians &mdash;for the plebs, because as they were not called away to serve in the ranks, they hoped to secure relief from the burden of debt, especially now that they had such a strong leader; for the patricians, as no external alarms would distract their minds from dealing with their domestic troubles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As each side was more prepared for the struggle it could not long be delayed. Manlius, too, was inviting the plebeians to his house and discussing night and day revolutionary plans with their leaders in a much more aggressive and resentful spirit than formerly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His resentment was kindled by the recent humiliation inflicted on a spirit unaccustomed to disgrace; his aggressiveness was encouraged by his belief that the Dictator had not ventured to treat him as Quinctius Cincinnatus had treated Sp. Maelius, for not only had the Dictator avoided the odium created by his imprisonment through resignation, but even the senate had not been able to face it.</p> <p>Emboldened and embittered by these considerations, he roused the passions of the plebs, who were already incensed enough, to a higher pitch by his harangues.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <q direct="unspecified">How long, pray,</q> he asked, <q direct="unspecified">are you going to remain in ignorance of your strength, an ignorance which nature forbids even to beasts? Do at least reckon up your numbers and those of your opponents. Even if you were going to attack them on equal terms, man for man, I believe that you would fight more desperately for freedom than they for power. But you are much more numerous, for all you who have been in attendance on your patrols as clients will now confront them as adversaries.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> You have only to make a show of war and you will have peace. Let them see you are prepared to use force, they will abate their claims.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> You must dare something as a body or you will have to suffer everything as individuals. How long will you look to me?
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I certainly shall not fail you, see to it that Fortune does not fail me. I, your avenger, when your enemies thought fit was suddenly reduced to nothing, and you watched the man carried off to prison who had warded off imprisonment from so many of you. What have I to hope for, if my enemies dare to do more to me? Am I to look for the fate of Cassius and Maelius?
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It is all very well to cry in horror, <q direct="unspecified">The gods will prevent that,</q> but they will never come down from heaven on my account. You must prevent it; they must give you the courage to do so, as they gave me courage to defend you as a soldier from the barbarian enemy and as a civilian from your tyrannical fellow-citizens. Is the spirit of this great nation so small that you will always remain contented with the aid which your tribunes now afford you against your enemies, and never know any subject of dispute with the patricians, except as to how far you allow them to lord it over you?
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This is not your natural instinct, you are the slaves of habit. For why is it that you display such spirit towards foreign nations as to think it fair and just that you should rule over them?
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Because with them you have been wont to contend for dominion, while against these domestic enemies it has been a contest for liberty, which you have mostly attempted rather than maintained.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Still, whatever leaders you have had, whatever qualities you yourselves have shown, you have so far, either by your strength or your good fortune, achieved every object, however great, on which you have set your hearts. Now it is time to attempt greater things.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If you will only put your own good fortune to the test, if you will only put me to the test, who have already been tested fortunately, I hope, for you, you will have less trouble in setting up some one to lord it over the patricians than you have had in setting up men to resist their lording it over you.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Dictatorships and consulships must be levelled to the ground in order that the Roman plebs may lift up its head. Take your places, then, in the Forum; prevent any judgment for debt from being pro- nounced.
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> I profess myself the Patron <note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">For the significance of the term <q direct="unspecified">Patron</q> here, see note 16 to Book III. The <q direct="unspecified">other title</q> which Manlius hints at is that of <q direct="unspecified">consul,</q> in which capacity he could render them much more efficient service.</note> of the plebs, a title with which my care and fidelity have invested me; if you prefer to designate your leader by any other title of honour or command, you will find in him a more powerful instrument for attaining the objects you
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> desire.</q></p><p>It is said that this was the first step in his attempt to secure kingly power, but there is no clear tradition as to his fellow- conspirators or the extent to which his plans were developed.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the other side, however, the senate were discussing this secession of the plebs to a private house, which happened to be situated on the Capitol, and the great danger with which liberty was menaced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A great many exclaimed that what was wanted was a Servilius Ahala, who would not simply irritate an enemy to the State by ordering him to be sent to prison, but would put an end to the intestine war by the sacrifice of a single citizen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They finally took refuge in a resolution which was milder in its terms but possessed equal force, viz., that <q direct="unspecified">the magistrates should see to it that the republic received no hurt from the mischievous designs of M. Manlius.</q></p><p>Thereupon the consular tribunes and the tribunes of the plebs &mdash;for
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> these latter recognised that the end of liberty would also be the end of their power, and had, therefore, placed them- selves under the authority of the senate &mdash;all consulted together as to what were the necessary steps to take.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As no one could suggest anything but the employment of force and its inevitable bloodshed, while this would obviously lead to a frightful struggle, M. Menenius and Q. Publilius, tribunes of the plebs, spoke as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Why are we making that which ought to be a contest between the State and one pestilent citizen into a conflict between patricians and plebeians?
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Why do we attack the plebs through him when it is so much safer to attack him through the plebs, so that he may sink into ruin under the weight of his own strength? It is our intention to fix a day for his trial.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Nothing is less desired by the people than kingly power. As soon as that body of plebeians become aware that the quarrel is not with them, and find that from being his supporters they have become his judges; as soon as they see a patrician on his trial, and learn that the charge before them is one of aiming at monarchy, they will not show favour to any man more than to their own liberty.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amidst universal approval they fixed a day for the trial of Manlius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was at first much perturbation amongst the plebs, especially when they saw him going about in mourning garb without a single patrician, or any of his relatives or connections and, strangest of all, neither of his brothers, Aulus and Titus Manlius, being similarly attired. For up to that day such a thing had never been known, that at such a crisis in a man's fate even those nearest to him did not put on mourning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They remembered that when Appius Claudius was thrown into prison, his personal enemy, Caius Claudius, and the whole house of the Claudii, wore mourning. They regarded it as a conspiracy to crush a popular hero, because he was the first man to go over from the patricians to the plebs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>What evidence strictly bearing out the charge of treason was adduced by the prosecution at the actual trial, beyond the gatherings at his house, his seditious utterances, and his false statement about the gold, I do not find stated by any authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But I have no doubt that it was anything but slight, for the hesitation shown by the people in finding him guilty was not due to the merits of the case, but to the locality where the trial took place. This is a thing to be noted in order that men may see how great and glorious deeds are not only deprived of all merit, but made positively hateful by a loathesome hankering after kingly power.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He is said to have produced nearly four hundred people to whom he had advanced money without interest, whom he had prevented from being sold up and having their persons adjudged to their creditors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It is stated that besides this he not only enumerated his military distinctions, but brought them forward for inspection; the spoils of as many as thirty enemies whom he had slain, gifts from commanders-in-chief to the number of forty, amongst them two mural crowns and eight civil ones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In addition to these, he produced citizens whom he had rescued from the enemy, and named C. Servilius, Master of the Horse, who was not present, as one of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After he had recalled his warlike achievements in a great speech corresponding to the loftiness of his theme, his language rising to the level of his exploits, he bared his breast, ennobled by the scars of battle, and looking towards the Capitol repeatedly invoked Jupiter and the other deities to come to the aid of his shattered fortunes. He prayed that they would, in this crisis of his fate, inspire the Roman people with the same feeling with which they inspired him when he was protecting the Citadel and the Capitol and so saving Rome. Then turning to his judges, he implored them one and all to judge his cause with their eyes fixed on the Capitol, looking towards the immortal gods.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>As it was in the <placeName key="tgn,7006964">Campus Martius</placeName> that the people were to vote in their centuries, and the defendant, stretching forth his hands towards the Capitol, had turned from men to the gods in his prayers, it became evident to the tribunes that unless they could release men's spell-bound eyes from the visible reminder of his glorious deed, their minds, wholly possessed with the sense of the service he had done them, would find no place for charges against him, however true.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>So the proceedings were adjourned to another day, and the people were summoned to an Assembly in the Peteline Grove outside the Flumentan Gate, from which the Capitol was not visible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Here the charge was established, and with hearts steeled against his appeals, they passed a dreadful sentence, abhorrent even to the judges. Some authorities assert that he was sentenced by the duumvirs, who were appointed to try cases of treason. The tribunes hurled him from the Tarpeian rock, and the place which was the monument of his exceptional glory became also the scene of his final punishment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After his death two stigmas were affixed to his memory. One by the State. His house stood where now the temple and mint of Juno Moneta stand, a measure was consequently brought before the people that no patrician should occupy a dwelling within the Citadel or on the Capitoline.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The other by the members of his house, who made a decree forbidding any one henceforth to assume the names of Marcus Manlius. Such was the end of a man who, had he not been born in a free State, would have attained distinction.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>When danger was no longer to be feared from him the people, remembering only his virtues, soon began to regret his loss. A pestilence which followed shortly after and inflicted great mortality, for which no cause could be assigned, was thought by a great many people to be due to the execution of Manlius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They imagined that the Capitol had been polluted by the blood of its deliverer, and that the gods had been displeased at a punishment having been inflicted almost before their eyes on the man by whom their temples had been wrested from an enemy's hands.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Wars with the Volscians and Latins.</note> pestilence was followed by scarcity, and the widespread rumour of these two troubles was followed the next year by a number of wars. The consular tribunes were: L. Valerius (for the fourth time), A Manlius, Ser.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sulpicius, L. Lucretius, and L. Aemilius (all for the third time), and M. Trebonius.</p><p>In addition to the Volscians, who seemed destined by some fate to keep the Roman soldiery in perpetual training; in addition to the colonies of Circeii and Velitrae, who had long been meditating revolt; in addition to Latium, which was an object of suspicion, a new enemy suddenly appeared at Lanuvium, which had hitherto been a most loyal city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate thought this was due to a feeling of contempt because the revolt of their countrymen at Velitrae had remained so long unpunished. They accordingly passed a decree that the people should be asked as soon as possible to consent to a declaration of war against them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> To make the plebs more ready to enter on this campaign, five commissioners were appointed to distribute the Pomptine territory and three to settle a colony at Nepete.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then the proposal was submitted to the people, and in spite of the protests of the tribunes the tribes unanimously declared for war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Preparations for war continued throughout the year, but, owing to the pestilence, the army was not led out. This delay allowed the colonists time for propitiating the senate, and there was a considerable party amongst them in favour of sending a deputation to Rome to ask for pardon.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But, as usual, the interest of the State was bound up with the interests of individuals, and the authors of the revolt, fearing that they alone would be held responsible and surrendered, in consequence, to appease the resentment of the Romans, turned the colonists from all thoughts of peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nor did they confine themselves to persuading their senate to veto the proposed embassy; they stirred up a large number of the plebs to make a predatory incursion on Roman territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> This fresh outrage destroyed all hopes of peace.</p> <p>This year, for the first time, there arose a rumour of a revolt at Praeneste, but when the people of Tusculum, Gabinii, and Labici, whose territories had been invaded, laid a formal complaint, the senate took it so calmly that it was evident they did believe the charge because they did not wish it to be true.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Sp. and L. Papirius, the new consular tribunes, marched with the legions to Velitrae. Their four colleagues, Ser. Cornelius Maluginensis, Q. Servilius, C. Sulpicius, and L. Aemilius were left to defend the City and to meet any fresh movement in Etruria, for danger was suspected everywhere on that side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At Velitrae, where the auxiliaries from Praeneste were almost more numerous than the colonists themselves, an engagement took place in which the Romans soon won the day, for as the city was so near, the enemy took to flight early in the battle and made for the city as their one refuge. The tribunes abstained from storming the place, for they were doubtful of success and did not think it right to reduce the colony to ruin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The dispatches to the senate announcing the victory were more severe on the Praenestines than on the Veliternians. Accordingly, by a decree of the senate confirmed by the people, war was declared against Praeneste The Praenestines joined forces with the Volscians and in the following year took by storm the Roman colony of Satricum, after an obstinate defence, and made a brutal use of their victory.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This incident exasperated the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They elected M. Furius Camillus as consular tribune for the sixth time, and gave him four colleagues, A. and L. Postumius Regillensis, L. Furius, L. Lucretius, and M. Fabius Ambustus . By a special decree of the senate the war with the Volscians was entrusted to M. Furius Camillus; the tribune chosen by lot as his coadjutor was L. Furius, not so much, as it turned out, in the interest of the State, as in the interest of his colleague, for whom he served as the means of gaining fresh renown.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He gained it on public grounds by restoring the fortunes of the State which had been brought low by the other's rashness, and on private grounds, because he was more anxious to win the other's gratitude after retrieving his error than to win glory for himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Camillus was now advanced in age, and after being elected was prepared to make the usual affidavit declining office on the grounds of health, but the people refused to allow him. His vigorous breast was still animated by an energy unweakened by age, his senses were unimpaired, and his interest in political affairs was lost in the prospect of war.</p> <p>Four legions were enrolled, each consisting of 4000 men The army was ordered to muster the next day at the Esquiline Gate and at once marched for Satricum.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Here the captors of the colony awaited him, their decided superiority of numbers inspiring them with complete confidence. When they found that the Romans were approaching they advanced at once to battle, anxious to bring matters to a decisive issue as soon as possible.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They imagined that this would prevent the inferiority in numbers of their opponents from being in any way aided by the skill of their commander, which they looked upon as the sole ground of confidence for the Romans.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The same eagerness for battle was felt by the Roman army and by Camillus' colleague. Nothing stood in the way of their hazarding an immediate engagement except the prudence and authority of one man, who was seeking an opportunity, by protracting the war, for aiding the strength of his force by strategy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This made the enemy more insistent; they not only deployed their lines in front of their camp, but even marched forward in the middle of the plain and showed their supercilious confidence in their numbers by advancing their standards close to the Roman intrenchments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This made the Romans indignant, still more so L. Furius. Young and naturally hightempered, he was now infected with the hopefulness of the rank and file whose spirits were rising with very little to justify their confidence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He increased their excitement by belittling the authority of his colleague on the score of his age, the only possible reason he had for doing so; he declared that wars were the province of the younger men, for courage grows and decays in correspondence with the bodily powers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <q direct="unspecified">Camillus,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">once a most active warrior, had now become a laggard; he, whose habit it had been, immediately on arriving at camps or cities, to take them at the first assault, was now wasting time and stagnating inside his lines. What accession to his own strength or diminution of the enemy's strength was he hoping for?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What favourable chance, what opportune moment, what ground on which to employ his strategy? The old man's plans had lost all fire and life.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Camillus had had his share of life as well as glory. What was gained by letting the strength of a State which ought to be immortal share in the senile decay of one mortal frame?</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>By speeches of this kind he had brought over the whole camp to his view and in many quarter they were demanding to be led to immediate battle. Addressing Camillus, he said: <q direct="unspecified">M. Furius, we cannot resist the impetuosity of the soldiers, and the enemy to whom we have given fresh courage by our hesitation are now showing intolerable contempt for us. You are one against all; yield to the universal desire and allow yourself to be overcome in argument that you may the sooner overcome in battle.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In his reply, Camillus said that in all the wars he had waged down to that day, as sole commander, neither he nor the Roman people had had any reason to complain of either his generalship or his good fortune. Now he was aware that he had as a colleague one who was his equal in authority and rank, his superior in physical strength and activity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As for the army, he had been accustomed to direct and not to be directed, but as for his colleague, he could not hamper his authority. Let him do with the help of heaven whatever he considered best for the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He begged that owing to his years he might be excused from being in the front line; whatever duties an old man could discharge in battle, in these he would not show himself lacking. He prayed to the immortal gods that no mischance might make them feel that his plan alter all was the best.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>His salutory advice was not listened to by men, nor was his patriotic prayer heard by the gods. His colleague who had determined on battle drew up the front line, Camillus formed a powerful reserve and posted a strong force in front of the camp. He himself took his station on some rising ground and anxiously awaited the result of tactics so different from his own.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>No sooner had their arms clashed together at the first onset than the enemy began to retire, not through fear but for tactical reasons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Behind them the ground rose gently up to their camp, and owing to their preponderance in numbers they had been able to leave several cohorts armed and drawn up for action in their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After the battle had begun these were to make a sortie as soon as the enemy were near their entrenchments. In pursuing the retiring enemy the Romans had been drawn on to the rising ground and were in some disorder. Seizing their opportunity the enemy made their charge from the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was the victors' turn now to be alarmed, and this new danger and the uphill fighting made the Roman line give ground. Whilst the Volscians who had charged from the camp pressed home their attack, the others who had made the pretended flight renewed the contest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At last the Romans no longer retired in order; forgetting their recent battle-ardour and their old renown they began to flee in all directions, and in wild disorder were making for their camp. Camillus, after being assisted to mount by those around, hastily brought up the reserves and blocked their flight. <q direct="unspecified">Is this, soldiers,</q> he cried, <q direct="unspecified">the battle which you were clamouring for? Who is the man, who is the god that you can throw the blame upon?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then you were foolhardy; now you are cowards. You have been following another captain, now follow Camillus and conquer, as you are accustomed to do, under my leadership. Why are you looking at the rampart and the camp?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Not a man of you shall enter there unless you are victorious.</q> A feeling of shame at first arrested their disorderly flight, then, when they saw the standards brought round and the line turning to face the enemy, and their leader, illustrious through a hundred triumphs and now venerable through age, showing himself amongst the fore- most ranks where the risk and toil were greatest, mutual reproaches mingled with words of encouragement were heard through the whole field till finally they burst into a ringing cheer.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The other tribune did not show himself wanting to the occasion. Whilst his colleague was rallying the infantry he was sent to the cavalry. He did not venture to censure them &mdash;his share in their fault left him too little authority for that &mdash;but dropping all tone of command be implored them one and all to clear him from the guilt of that day's misfortunes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <q direct="unspecified">In spite,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">of the refusal and opposition of my colleague I preferred to associate myself with the rashness of all rather than with the prudence of one. Whatever your fortunes may be, Camillus sees his own glory reflected in them; I, unless the day is won, shall have the utter wretchedness of sharing the fortunes of all but bearing the infamy alone.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>As the infantry were wavering it seemed best for the cavalry, after dismounting and leaving their horses to be held, to attack the enemy on foot. Conspicuous for their arms and dashing courage they went wherever they saw the infantry force pressed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Officers and men emulated each other in fighting with a determination and courage which never slackened. The effect of such strenuous bravery was shown in the result; the Volscians who a short time before had given ground in simulated fear were now scattered in real panic. A large number were killed in the actual battle and the subsequent flight, others in the camp, which was carried in the same charge; there were more prisoners, however, than slain.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On examining the prisoners, it was discovered that some were from Tusculum; these were brought separately before the tribunes and on being questioned admitted that their State authorised their taking up arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Alarmed at the prospect of a war so close to the City, Camillus said that he would at once conduct the prisoners to Rome so that the senate might not remain in ignorance of the fact that the Tusculans had abandoned the alliance with Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His colleague might, if he thought good, remain in command of the army in camp. One day's experience had taught him not to prefer his own counsels to wiser ones, but even so, neither he nor any one in the army supposed that Camillus would calmly pass over that blunder of his by which the republic had been exposed to headlong disaster.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Both in the army and at Rome it was universally remarked that in the chequered fortune which had attended the Volscian campaign, the blame for the unsuccessful battle and flight would be visited on L. Furius, the glory of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> successful one would rest with M.. Furius Camillus.</p><p>After the examination of the prisoners the senate resolved upon war with Tusculum, and entrusted the conduct of it to Camillus. He requested that he might have one coadjutor, and on receiving permission to choose whom he would, he selected, to every one's surprise, L. Furius By this act of generosity he removed the stigma attaching to his colleague and won great glory for himself.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But there was no war with the Tusculans. Unable to resist the attack of Rome by force of arms they turned it aside by a firm and lasting peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When the Romans entered their territory, there was no flight of the inhabitants from the places near their line of march, the cultivation of the fields was not interrupted, the gates of the city stood open, and the townsmen in civic attire came in crowds to meet the commanders, whilst provisions for the camp were brought ungrudgingly from town and country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Camillus fixed his camp in front of the gates and decided to ascertain for himself whether the peaceful aspect which things wore in the country prevailed within the walls as well.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Inside the city he found the doors of the houses standing open and all kinds of things exposed for sale in the stalls; the workmen all busy at their respective tasks and the schools humming with the voices of the children learning to read;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the streets filled with crowds, including women and children going in all directions about their business and wearing an expression free not only from fear but even from surprise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He looked everywhere in vain for some signs of war; there was not the slightest trace of anything having been removed or brought forward just for the moment; all things looked so calm and peaceful that it seemed hardly possible that the bruit of war could have reached them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Disarmed by the submissive demeanour of the enemy he gave orders for the senate to be summoned. He then addressed them in the following terms: <q direct="unspecified">Men of Tusculum, you are the only people who have discovered the true weapons, the true strength, with which to protect yourselves from the wrath of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Go to the senate at Rome; they will decide aright whether your past offence deserves punishment most or your present submission, pardon. I will not anticipate the grace and favour which the State may show you; you shall receive from me the permission to plead for forgiveness; the senate will vouchsafe to your supplication the answer which shall seem good to them.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After the arrival of the Tusculan senators in Rome, when the mournful countenances of those who a few weeks before had been staunch allies were seen in the vestibule of the Senate-house, the Roman senate were touched with pity and at once ordered them to be called in as guest-friends rather than as enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Dictator of Tusculum was the spokesman. <q direct="unspecified">Senators,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">we against whom you have declared and commenced hostilities, went out to meet your generals and your legions armed and equipped just as you see us now standing in the vestibule of your House.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This civilian dress has always been the dress of our order and of our plebs and ever will be, unless at any time we receive from you arms for your defence. We are grateful to your generals and to your armies because they trusted their eyes rather than their ears, and did not make enemies where none existed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> We ask of you the peace which we have ourselves observed, and pray you to turn the tide of war where a state of war exists; if we are to learn by painful experience the power which your arms can exert against us, we will learn it without using arms ourselves. This is our determination &mdash; may the gods make it as fortunate as it is dutiful!
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As for the accusations which induced you to declare war, although it is unnecessary to refute in words what has been disproved by facts, still, even supposing them to be true, we believe that it would have been safe to admit them, since we should have given such evident proofs of repentance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Let us acknowledge that we havo wronged you, if only you are worthy to receive such satisfaction.</q> This was practically what the Tusculans said. They obtained peace at the time and not long after full citizonship. The legions were marched back from Tusculum.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Unrest in the City &mdash;War with Praeneste.</note> thus distinguishing himself by his skill and courage in the Volscian war and bringing the expedition against Tusculum to such a happy termination, and on both occasions treating his colleague with singular consideration and forbearance, Camillus went out of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> office. The consular tribunes for the next year were: Lucius Valerius (for the fifth time) and Publius (for the third time), C. Sergius (also for the third time), L. Menenius (for the second time), P. Papirius, and Ser. Cornelius
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Maluginensis.</p> <p>This year it was found necessary to appoint censors, mainly owing to the vague rumours which were afloat about the burden of debt. The plebeian tribunes, in order to stir up ill-feeling, exaggerated the amount, while it was underestimated by those whose interest it was to represent the difficuity as due to the unwillingness rather than the inability of the debtor to
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> pay. The censors appointed were C. Sulpicius Camerinius and Sp. Postumius Regillensis. <note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed">These appear to have been the first censors appointed since the Gaulish invasion.</note></p> <p>They commenced a fresh assessment, but the work was interrupted by the death of Postumius, because it was doubtful whether the co-optation of a colleague, in the case of the censors,
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> was permissible. Sulpicius accordingiy resigned, and fresh magistrates were appointed, but owing to some flaw in their election did not act. Religious fears deterred them from proceding to a third election; it seemed as though the gods would not allow a censorship for
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> that year.</p> <p>The tribunes declared that such mockory was intolerable. <q direct="unspecified">The senate,</q> according to them, <q direct="unspecified">dreaded the publication of the assessment lists, which supplied information as to every man's property, because they do not wish the amount of the debtor to be brought to light for it would show how one half of the community was being ruined by the other balf, while the debt-burdened plebs were all the time being exposod to one enemy
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> after another. Excuses for war were being sought indiscriminately in every direction; the legions were marched from Antium to Satricum, from Satricum to Velitrae, from there to Tusculum. And now the Latins, the Hernici, and the Praenestines were being threatened with hostilities in order that the patricians might wreak their vongeance on their fellow-citizens more even than upon the enemy. They were wearing out the plebs by keeping them under arms and not allowing them any breathing time in the City or any leisure for thoughts of liberty, or any possibility for taking their place in the Assembly, where they might listen to the voice of a tribune urging the reduction of interest and the redress of
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> other grievances. Why, if the plebs had spirit enough to recall to mind the liberties which their fathers won, they would never suffer a Roman citizen to be made over to his creditors, nor would they permit an army to be raised until an account was taken of the existing debt and some method of reducing it discovered, so that each man might know what he actually owed, and what was left for himself &mdash;whether his person was free or whether that, too, was due to
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> the stocks.</q></p> <p>The premium thus put upon sedition made it at once more active. Many cases were occurring of men being made over to their creditors, and in view of a war with Praeneste, the senate, had resolved that fresh legions should be enrolled, but both these proceedings were arrested by the intervention of the tribunes, supported by the whole body of the plebs The tribunes refused to allow the judgment debtors to be
									<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> carried off; the men whose names were called for enrolment refused to answer. The senate was less concerned to insist upon the rights of creditors than to carry out the enlistment, for information had been received that the enemy had advanced from Praeneste and were encamped in the district
									<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> of Gabii. This intelligence however, instead of deterring the plebeian tribunes from opposition, only made them more determined, and nothing availed to quiet the agitation in the City but the approach of war to its very walls.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A report had reached Praeneste that no army had been raised in Rome and no commander-in-chief selected, and that the patricians and plebeians had turned against one another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Seizing the opportunity, their generals had led their army by rapid marches through fields which they had utterly laid waste and appeared before the Colline Gate. There was wide-spread alarm in the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A general cry arose, <q direct="unspecified">To arms!</q> and men hurried to the walls and gates. At last, abandoning sedition for war, they nominated T. Quinctius Cincinnatus as Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He named A. Sempronius Atratinus as his Master of the Horse. No sooner did they hear of this &mdash;so great was the terror which a Dictatorship inspired &mdash;than the enemy retired from the wails, and the men liable for active service assembled without any hesitation at the Dictator's orders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whilst the army was being mobilised in Rome, the camp of the enemy had been fixed not far from the Alia. From this point they spread devastation far and wide, and congratulated themselves that they had chosen a position of fatal import for the City of Rome; they expected that there would be the same panic and flight as in the Gaulish war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For, they argued if the Romans regarded with horror even the day which took its name from that spot and was under a curse, how much more would they dread the Alia itself, the memorial of that great disaster. They would most assuredly have the appalling sight of the Gauls before their eyes and the sound of their voices in their ears.</p><p>Indulging in these idle dreams, they placed all their hopes in the fortune of the place.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Romans, on the other hand, knew perfectly well that wherever he was, the Latin enemy was the same as the one who had been conquered at Lake Regillus and kept in peaceable subjection for a hundred years.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The fact that the place was associated with the memories of their great defeat would sooner stimulate them to wipe out the recollection of that disgrace than make them feel that any place on earth could be of ill omen for their success.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Even if the Gauls them- selves were to appear there, they would fight just as they fought when they recovered their City, just as they fought the next day at Gabii, when they did not leave a single enemy who had entered Rome to carry the news of their defeat and the Roman victory to their countrymen.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In these different moods, each side reached the banks of the Alia. When the enemy came into view in battle forma- tion ready for action, the Dictator turned to A. Sempronius, <q direct="unspecified">Do you see,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">how they have taken their station on the Alia relying on the fortune of the place? May heaven have given them nothing more certain to trust to, or stronger to help them!
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> You, however, placing your confidence in arms and valour, will charge their centre at full gallop, while I with the legions will attack them whilst in disorder. Ye deities who watch over treaties, assist us, and exact the penalties due from those who have sinned against you and deceived us by appealing to your divinity!</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Neither the cavalry charge nor the infantry attack was sus- tained by the Praenestines. At the first onset and battle shout their ranks were broken, and when no portion of the line any longer kept its formation they turned and fled in confusion. In their panic they were carried past their camp, and did not stop their headlong flight until they were within sight of Praeneste.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There the fugitives rallied and seized a position which they hastily fortified; they were afraid of retiring within the walls of their city lest their territory should be wasted with fire and, after everything had been devastated, the city should be in- vested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Romans, however, after spoiling the camp at the Alia, came up; this position, therefore, was also abandoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They shut themselves in Praeneste, feeling hardly safe even behind its walls.</p><p>There were eight towns under the jurisdiction of Praeneste. These were successively attacked and reduced without much fighting. Then the army advanced against Velitrae, which was successfully stormed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Finally, they arrived at Praeneste, the origin and centre of the war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was captured, not by assault, but after surrender.</p> <p>After being thus victorious in battle and capturing two camps and nine towns belonging to the enemy and receiving the surrender of Praeneste, Titus Quinctius returned to Rome. In his triumphal procession he carried up to the Capitol the image of Jupiter Imperator, which had been brought from Praeneste.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was set up in a recess between the shrines of Jupiter and Minerva, and a tablet was affixed to the pedestal recording the Dictator's successes.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The inscription ran something like this: <q direct="unspecified">Jupiter and all the gods have granted this boon to Titus Quinctius the Dictator, that he should capture nine towns.</q></p><p>On the twentieth day after his appointment he laid down the Dictatorship.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Renewed Fighting with the Volscians &mdash;When the election of Consular tribunes took place, an equal number were elected from each order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The patricians were: P. and C. Manlius, together with L. Julius; the plebeians were: C. Sextilius, M. Albinius, and L. Anstitius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As the two Manlii took precedence of the plebeians by birth and were more popular than Julius, they had the Volscians assigned to them by special resolution, without casting lots or any understanding with the other consular tribunes; a step which they themselves and the.senate who made the arrangement had cause to regret.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They sent out some cohorts to forage without previously reconnoitering. On receiving a false message that these were cut off, they started off in great haste to their support, without detaining the messenger, who was a hostile Latin and had passed himself off as a Roman soldier. Consequently, they fell straight into an ambuscade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was only the sheer courage of the men that enabled them to make a stand on unfavourable ground and offer a desperate resistance. At the same time, their camp, which lay on the plain in another direction, was attacked.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In both incidents the generals had imperiled everything by their rashness and ignorance; if by the good fortune of Rome anything was saved it was due to the steadiness and courage of the soldiers who had no one to direct operations.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>On the report of these occurrences reaching Rome, it was at first decided that a Dictator should be nominated, but on subsequent information being received that all was quiet amongst the Volscians, who evidently did not know how to make use of their victory, the armies were recalled from that quarter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the side of the Volscians peace prevailed; the only trouble that marked the close of the year was the renewal of hostilities by the Praenestines, who had stirred up the Latin cantons.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The colonists of Setia complained of the fewness of their number, so a fresh body of colonists was sent to join them.</p> <p>The misfortunes of the war were compensated by the quiet which prevailed at home owing to the influence and authority which the consular tribunes from the plebeians possessed with their party.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Domestic Troubles</note>The new consular tribunes were Sp. Furius, Q. Servilius (for the second time), L. Menenius (for the third time), P. Cloelius, M. Horatius, and L. Geganius.</p><p>No sooner had their year begun than the flames of a violent disturbance broke out, for which the distress caused by the debts supplied both cause and motive.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sp. Servilius Priscus and Q. Cloelius Siculus were appointed censors to go into the matter, but they were prevented from doing so by the outbreak of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Volscian legions invaded the Roman territory and were committing ravages in all directions. The first intimation came through panic-stricken messengers followed by a general flight from the country districts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> So far was the alarm thus created from repressing the domestic dissensions that the tribunes showed all the greater determination to obstruct the enrolment of troops. They succeeded at last in imposing two conditions on the patricians: that none should pay the war-tax until the war was over, and that no suits for debt should be brought into court.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After the plebs had obtained this relief there was no longer any delay in the enrolment. When the fresh troops had been raised they were formed into two armies, both of which were marched into the Volscian territory. Sp. Furius and M. Horatius turned to the right in the direction of Antium and the coast; Q. Servilius and L. Geganius proceeded to the left towards Ecetra and the mountain district.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In neither direction did the enemy meet them. So they commenced to ravage the country in a very different method from that which the Volscians had practised. These, emboldened by the dissensions but afraid of the courage of their enemy, had made hasty depredations like freebooters dreading a surprise, but the Romans acting as a regular army wreaked their just anger in ravages which were all the more destructive because they were continuous.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Volscians, fearing lest an army might come from Rome, confined their ravages to the extreme frontier; the Romans, on the other hand, lingered in the enemy's country to provoke him to battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After burning all the scattered houses and several of the villages and leaving not a single fruit tree or any hope of harvest for the year, and carrying off as booty all the men and cattle that remained outside the walled towns, the two armies returned to Rome.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Volscians and Latins.</note> A short breathing space had been allowed to the debtors, but as soon as hostilities ceased and quiet was restored large numbers of them were again being adjudged to their creditors, and so completely had all hopes of lightening the old load of debt vanished that new debts were being contracted to meet a tax imposed for the construction of a stone wall for which the censors had made a contract.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The plebs were compelled to submit to this burden because there was no enrolment which their tribunes could obstruct.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were even forced by the influence of the nobility to elect only patricians as consular tribunes; their names were: L. Aemilius, P. Valerius (for the fourth time), C. Veturius, Ser. Sulpicius, L. and C. Quinctius Cincinnatus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The patricians were also strong enough to effect the enrolment of three armies to act against the Latins and Volscians, who had united their forces and were encamped at Satricum. All those who were liable for active service were made to take the military oath; none ventured to obstruct.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> One of these armies was to protect the City; another was to be in readiness to be despatched wherever any sudden hostile movement might be attempted; the third, and by far the strongest, was led by P. Valerius and L. Aemilius to Satricum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Here they found the enemy drawn up for battle on favourable ground and immediately engaged him. The action, though so far not decisive, was going in favour of the Romans when it was stopped by violent storms of wind and rain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The next day it was resumed and was kept up for some time on the part of the enemy with a courage and success equal to that of the Romans, mainly by the Latin legions who through their long alliance were familiar with Roman tactics.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A cavalry charge disordered their ranks, and before they could recover, the infantry made a fresh attack and the further they pressed forward the more decided the retreat of the enemy became, and once the battle turned, the Roman attack became irresistible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The rout of the enemy was complete, and as they did not make for their camp but tried to reach Satricum, which was two miles distant, they were mostly cut down by the cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The camp was taken and plundered.</p> <p>The following night they evacuated Satricum, and in a march which was much more like a flight made their way to Antium, and though the Romans followed almost on their heels, the state of panic they were in enabled them to outstrip their pursuers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The enemy entered the city before the Romans could delay or harass their rear. Some days were spent in harrying the country as the Romans were not sufficiently provided with military engines for attacking the walls, nor were the enemy disposed to run the risk of a battle.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A quarrel now arose between the Antiates and the Latins. The Antiates, crushed by their misfortunes and exhausted by a state of war which had lasted all their lives, were contemplating peace;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the newly revolted Latins, who had enjoyed a long peace and whose spirits were yet unbroken, were all the more determined to keep up hostilities. When each side had convinced the other that it was perfectly free to act as it thought best, there was an end of the quarrel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Latins took their departure and so cleared themselves from all association with a peace which they considered dishonourable; the Antiates, when once the inconvenient critics of their salutary counsels were out of the way, surrendered their city and territory to the Romans.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The exasperation and rage of the Latins at finding themselves unable to injure the Romans in war or to induce the Volscians to keep up hostilities rose to such a pitch that they set fire to Satricum, which had been their first shelter after their defeat. They flung firebrands on sacred and profane buildings alike, and not a single roof of that city escaped except the temple of Mother Matuta.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is stated that it was not any religious scruple or fear of the gods that restrained them, bus an awful Voice which sounded from the temple threatening them with terrible punishment if they did not keep their accursed firebrands far from the shrine.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Whilst in this state of frenzy, they next attacked Tusculum, in revenge for its having deserted the national council of the Latins and not only becoming an ally of Rome but even accepting her citizenship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The attack was unexpected and they burst in through the open gates. The town was taken at the first alarm with the exception of the citadel. Thither the townsmen fled for refuge with their wives and children, after sending messengers to Rome to inform the senate of their plight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> With the promptitude which the honour of the Roman people demanded an army was marched to Tusculum under the command of the consular tribunes, L. Quinctius and Ser.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Sulpicius.</p> <p>They found the gates of Tusculum closed and the Latins, with the feelings of men who are at once besieging and being besieged, were in one direction defending the walls and in the other attacking the citadel, inspiring terror and feeling it at the same time.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The arrival of the Romans produced a change in the temper of both sides;
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> it turned the gloomy forebodings of the Tusculans into the utmost cheerfulness, whilst the confidence which the Latins had felt in a speedy capture of the citadel, as they were already in possession of the town, sank into a faint and feeble hope of even their own safety. The Tusculans in the citadel gave a cheer, it was answered by a much louder one from the Roman army.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Latins were hard pressed on both sides; they could not withstand the attack of the Tusculans charging from the higher ground, nor could they repel the Romans who were mounting the walls and forcing the gates. The walls were first taken by escalade, then the bars of the gates were burst. The double attack in front and rear left the Latins no strength to fight and no room for escape; between the two they were killed to a man.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Licinian Laws.</note> greater the tranquillity which prevailed everywhere abroad after these successful operations so much the greater became the violence of the patricians and the miseries of the plebeians, since the ability to pay their debts was frustrated by the very fact that payment had become necessary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had no means left on which to draw, and after judgment had been given against them they satisfied their creditors by surrendering their good name and their personal liberty; punishment took the place of payment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To such a state of depression had not only the humbler classes but even the leading men amongst the plebeians been reduced, that there was no energetic or enterprising individual amongst them who had the spirit to take up
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> or become a candidate even for the plebeian magistracies, still less to win a place amongst the patricians as consular tribune, an honour which they had previously done their utmost to secure. It seemed as though the patricians had for all time won back from the plebs the sole enjoyment of a dignity which for the last few years had been shared with them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As a check to any undue exaltation on the part of the patricians, an incident occurred which was slight in itself, but, as is often the case, led to important results. M. Fabius Ambustus, a patrician, possessed great influence amongst the men of his own order and also with the plebeians, because they felt that he did not in any way look down on them. His two daughters were married, the elder one to Ser. Sulpicius, the younger to C. Licinius Stolo, a distinguished man, but a plebeian.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The fact that Fabius did not regard this alliance as beneath him had made him very popular with the masses. The two sisters happened to be one day at Ser. Sulpicius' house, passing the time in conversation, when on his return from the Forum the tribune's apparitor gave the customary knocks on the door with his rod. The younger Fabia was startled at what was to her an unfamiliar custom, and her sister laughed at her and expressed surprise that she was ignorant of it. That laugh, however, left its sting in the mind of a woman easily excited by trifles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I think, too, that the crowd of attendants coming to ask for orders awoke in her that spirit of jealousy which makes every one anxious to be surpassed as little as possible by one's neighbours. It made her regard her sister's marriage as a fortunate one and her own as a mistake.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Her father happened to see her whilst she was still upset by this mortifying incident and asked her if she was well. She tried to conceal the real reason, as showing but little affection for her sister and not much respect for her own husband.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He kindly but firmly insisted upon finding out, and she confessed the real cause of her distress; she was unwed to one who was her inferior in birth, married into a house where neither honour nor political influence could enter.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Ambustus consoled his daughter and bade her keep up her spirits; she would very soon see in her own house the same honours which she saw at her sister's. From that time he began to concert plans with his son-in-law;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> they took into their counsels L. Sextius, a pushing young man who regarded nothing as beyond his ambition except patrician blood.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A favourable opportunity for making innovations presented itself in the terrible pressure of debt, a burden from which the plebs did not hope for any alleviation until they had raised men of their own order to the highest authority in the State . This, they thought, was
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> the aim which they must devote their utmost efforts to reach, and they believed that they had already, by dint of effort, secured a foothold from which, if they pushed forward, they could secure the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> highest positions, and so become the equals of the patricians in dignity as they now were in courage.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For the time being, C. Licinius and L. Sextius decided to become tribunes of the plebs; once in this office they could clear for themselves the way to all the other distinctions. All the measures which they brought forward after they were elected were directed against the power and influence of the patricians and calculated to promote the interests of the plebs One dealt with the debts, and provided that the amount paid in interest should be deducted from the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> principal and the balance repaid in three equal yearly instalments, The second restricted the occupation of land and prohibited any one from holding more than five hundred <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign>. The third provided that there should be no more consular tribunes elected, and that one consul should be elected from each order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They were all questions of immense importance, which could not be settled without a tremendous struggle.</p> <p>The prospect of a fight over those things which excite the keenest desires of men &mdash;land, money, honours &mdash;produced consternation among the patricians. After excited discussions in the senate and in private houses, they found no better remedy than the one they had adopted in previous contests, name]y, the tribunitian veto, So they won over some of the tribunes to interpose their veto against these proposals.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When they saw the tribes summoned by Licinius and Sextius to give their votes, these men, surrounded by a bodyguard of patricians, refused to allow either the reading of the bills or any other procedure which the plebs usually adopted when they came to vote.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For many weeks the Assembly was regularly summoned without any business being done, and the bills were looked upon as dead. <q direct="unspecified">Very good,</q> said Sextius, <q direct="unspecified">since it is your pleasure that the veto shall possess so much power, we will use this same weapon for the protection of the plebs.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Come then, patricians, give notice of an Assembly for the election of consular tribunes, I will take care that the word which our colleagues are now uttering in concert to your great delight, the word <q direct="unspecified">I FORBID,</q> shall not give you much pleasure.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>These were not idle threats. No elections were held beyond those of the tribunes and aediles of the plebs. Licinius and Sextius, when re-elected, would not allow any curule magistrates to be appointed, and as the plebs constantly re-elected them, and as they constantly stopped the election of consular tribunes, this dearth of magistrates lasted in the City for five years.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Fortunately, with one exception, there was a respite from foreign war. The colonists of Velitrae, becoming wanton in a time of peace and in the absence of any Roman army, made various incursions into Roman territory and began an attack on Tusculum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The citizens, allies of old, and now citizens, implored help, and their situation moved not only the senate, but the plebs as well, with a sense of shame.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The tribunes of the plebs gave way and the elections were conducted by an interrex. The consular tribunes elected were: L. Furius, A. Manlius, Ser. Sulpicius, Ser. Cornelius, P. and C. Valerius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They did not find the plebeians nearly so amenable in the enlistment as they had been in the elections; it was only after a very great struggle that an army was raised. They not only dislodged the enemy from before Tusculum, but forced him to take refuge behind his walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The siege of Velitrae was carried on with far greater vigour than that of Tusculum had been. Those commanders who had commenced the investment did not, however, effect its capture.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The new consular tribunes were: Q. Servilius, C. Veturius, A. and M. Cornelius, Q. Quinctius, and M. Fabius. Even under these tribunes nothing worth mention took place at Velitrae.</p> <p>At home affairs were becoming more critical.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Sextius and Licinius, the original proposers of the laws, who had been re-elected tribunes of the plebs for the eighth time, were now supported by Fabius Ambustus, Licinius Stolo's father-in-law. He came forward as the decided advocate of the measures which he had initiated, and whereas there had at first been eight members of the college of tribunes who had vetoed the proposals, there were now only five.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These five, as usually happens with men who desert their party, were embarrassed and dismayed, and defended their opposition by borrowed arguments privately suggested to them by the patricians. They urged that as a large number of plebeians were in the army at Velitrae the Assembly ought to be adjourned till the return of the soldiers, to allow of the entire body of the plebs voting on matters affecting their interests.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Sextius and Licinius, experts after so many years' practice in the art of handling the plebs, in conjunction with some of their
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> colleagues and the consular tribune, Fabius Ambustus, brought forward the leaders of the patrician party and worried them with questions on each of the measures they were referring to the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> <q direct="unspecified">Have you,</q> they asked, <q direct="unspecified">the audacity to demand that whilst two <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign> are allotted to each plebeian, you yourselves should each occupy more than five hundred <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign>, so that while a singe patrician can occupy the land of nearly three hundred citizens, the holding of a plebeian is hardly extensive enough for the roof he needs to shelter him, or the place where he is to be buried?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Is it your pleasure that the plebeians, crushed by debt, should surrender their persons to fetters and punishments sooner than that they should discharge their debts by repaying the principal? That, they should be led off in crowds from the Forum as the property of their creditors? That the houses of the nobility should be filled with prisoners, and wherever a patrician lives there should be a private dungeon?</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They were denouncing these indignities in the ears of men, apprehensive for their own safety, who listened to them with stronger indignation than the men who were speaking felt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They went on to assert that after all there would be no limit to the seizure of land by the patricians or the murder of the plebs by the deadly usury until the plebs
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> elected one of the consuls from their own ranks as a guardian of their liberties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tribunes of the plebs were now objects of contempt since their power was shattering itself by their own veto. There could be no fair or just administration as long as the executive power was in the hands of the other party, while they had only the right of protesting by their veto; nor would the plebs ever have an equal share in the government till the executive authority was thrown open to them; nor would it be enough, as some people might suppose, to allow plebeians to be voted for at the election of consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Unless it was made obligatory for one consul at least to be chosen from the plebs, no plebeian would ever become consul. Had they forgotten that after they had decided that consular tribunes should be elected in preference to consuls in order that the highest office might be open to plebeians, not a single plebeian was elected consular tribune for four-andforty years?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What did they suppose? Did they imagine that the men who had been accustomed to fill all the eight places when consular tribunes were elected would of their own free will consent to share two places with the plebs, or that they would allow the path to the consulship to be opened when they had so long blocked the one to the consular tribuneship?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The people would have to secure by law what they could not gain by favour, and one of the two consulships would have to be placed beyond dispute as open to the plebs alone, for if it were open to a contest it would always be the prey of the stronger party.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The old, oft-repeated taunt could no longer be made now that there were no men amongst the plebs suitable for curule magistracies. Was the government carried on with less spirit and energy after the consulship of P. Licinius Calvus., who was the first plebeian to be elected to that post, than during the years when only patricians held the office?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Nay, on the contrary, there had been some cases of patricians being impeached after their year of office, but none of plebeians. The quaestors also, like the consular tribunes, had a few years previously begun to be elected from the plebs; in no single instance had the Roman people had any cause to regret those appointments.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The one thing that was left for the plebs to strive for was the consulship. That was the pillar, the stronghold of their liberties. If they arrived at that, the Roman people would realise that monarchy had been completely banished from the City, and that their freedom was securely established, for in that day everything in which the patricians were pre-eminent would come to the plebs &mdash;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> power, dignity, military glory, the stamp of nobility; great things for themselves to enjoy, but greater still as legacies to their children.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When they saw that speeches of this kind were listened to with approval, they brought forward a fresh proposal, viz. that instead of the duumviri (the two keepers of the Sacred Books) a College of Ten should be formed, half of them plebeians and half patricians.</p> <p>The meeting of the Assembly, which was to pass these measures, was adjourned till the return of the army which was besieging Velitrae.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year passed away before the legions were brought back. Thus the new measures were hung up and left for the new consular tribunes to deal with. They were T. Quinctius, Ser. Cornelius, Ser. Sulpicius, Sp. Servilius, L. Papirius, and L. Veturius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The plebs re-elected their tribunes, at all events the same two who had brought forward the new measures.</p><p>At the very beginning of the year the final stage in the struggle was reached.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the tribes were summoned and the pro- posers refused to be thwarted by the veto of their colleagues, the patricians, now thoroughly alarmed, took refuge in their last line of defence &mdash;supreme power, and a supreme citizen to wield it. They resolved upon the nomination of a Dictator, and M. Furius Camillus was nominated; he chose L. Aemilius as his Master of the Horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Against such formidable preparations on the part of their opponents, the proposers on their side prepared to defend the cause of the plebs with the weapons of courage and resolution.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They gave notice of a meeting of the Assembly and summoned the tribes to vote.</p><p>Full of anger and menace, the Dictator, surrounded by a compact body of patricians, took his seat, and the proceedings commenced as usual with a struggle between those who were bringing in the bills and those who were interposing their veto against them. The latter were in the stronger position legally but they were overborne by the popularity of the measures and the men who were proposing them.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The first tribes were already voting <q direct="unspecified">Aye,</q> when Camillus said, <q direct="unspecified">Since, Quirites, it is not the authority of your tribunes but their defiance of authority that you are ruled by now, and their right of veto, which was once secured by the secession of the plebs, is now being rendered nugatory by the same violent conduct by which you obtained; if, I, as Dictator, acting in your own interests quite as much as in that of the State, shall support the right of veto and protect, by my authority the safeguard which you are destroying.
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If therefore, C. Licinius and L. Sextius give way before the opposition of their colleagues, I will not intrude the powers of a patrician magistrate into the councils of the plebs;
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> if, however, in spite of that opposition they are bent on imposing their measures on the State, as though it had been subjugated in war, I will not allow the tribunitian power to work its own destruction.</q></p> <p>The tribunes of the plebs treated this pronouncement with contempt, and persisted in their course with unshaken resolution.
									<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thereupon Camillus, excessively angry, sent lictors to disperse the plebeians and threatened, if they went on, to bind the fighting men by their military oath and march them out of the City. The plebs were greatly alarmed, but their leaders were exasperated rather than intimidated by his opposition.</p> <p>But while the contest was still undecided he resigned office, either owing to some irregularity in his nomination, as certain writers maintain, or because the tribunes proposed a resolution, which the plebs adopted, to the effect that if Camillus took any action as Dictator a fine of 500,000 asses should be imposed upon him.
										<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> That his resignation was due to some defect in the auspices rather than to the effect of such an unprecedented proposal I am led to believe by the following considerations: the well-known character of the man himself; the fact that P. Manlius immediately succeeded him as Dictator &mdash;for what in fluence could he have exerted in a contest in which Camillus had been worsted?
										<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the further fact that Camillus was again Dictator, the following year, for surely he would have been ashamed to reassume an authority which had been successfully defied the year before.
										<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Besides, at the time when, according to the tradition, the resolution imposing a fine on him was passed, either he had as Dictator the power to negative a measure which
										<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> he saw was meant to circumscribe his authority, or else he was powerless to resist even those other measures on account of which this one was carried. But amidst all the conflicts in which tribunes and consuls have been engaged, the Dictator's powers have always been above controversy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Between Camillus' resignation of office and Manlius' entrance on his Dictatorship, the tribunes held a council of the plebs as though an interregnum had occurred. Here it was evident which of the proposed measures were preferred by the plebs and which their tribunes were most eager about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The measures dealing with usury and the allotment of State land were being adopted, that providing that one consul should always be a plebeian was rejected; both the former would probably have been carried into law if the tribunes had not said that they were putting them <foreign lang="fr">en bloc</foreign>.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>P. Manlius, on his nomination as Dictator, strengthened the cause of the plebs by appointing a plebeian, C. Licinius, who had been a consular tribune, as his Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I gather that the patricians were much annoyed; the Dictator generally defended his action on the ground of relationship; he pointed out also that the authority of a Master of the Horse was no greater than that of a consular tribune.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When notice was given for the election of tribunes of the plebs, Licinius and Sextius declared their unwillingness to be re-elected, but they put it in a way which made the plebeians all the more eager to secure the end which they secretly had in view.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For nine years, they said, they had been standing in battle array, as it were, against the patricians, at the greatest risk to themselves and with no advantage to the people. The measures they had brought forward and the whole power of the tribunes had, like themselves, become enfeebled by age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Their proposed legislation had been frustrated first by the veto of their colleagues, then by the withdrawal of their fighting men to the district of Velitrae, and last of all the Dictator had launched his thunders at them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At the present time there was no obstacle either from their colleagues or from war or from the Dictator, for he had given them an earnest of the future election of plebeian consuls by appointing a plebeian as Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was the plebs who stood in the way of their tribunes and their own interests. If they chose they could have a City and a Forum free from creditors, and fields rescued from their unlawful occupiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When were they ever going to show sufficient gratitude for these boons, if while accepting these beneficial measures they cut off from those who proposed them all hope of attaining the highest honours? It was not consistent with the self-respect of the Roman people for them to demand to be relieved of the burden of usury and placed on the land which is now wrongfully held by the magnates, and then to leave the tribunes, through whom they won these reforms, without honourable distinction in their old age or any hope of attaining it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They must first make up their minds as to what they really wanted and then declare their will by their votes at the election.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If they wanted the proposed measures carried as a whole, there was some reason for their re-electing the same tribunes, because they would carry their own measures through; if, however, they only wished that to be passed which each man happened to want for himself, there was no need for them to incur odium by prolonging their term of office; they would not have the tribuneship themselves, nor would the people obtain the proposed reforms.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This determined language from the tribunes filled the patricians with speechless indignation and amazement.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It is stated that Appius Claudius, a grandson of the old decemvir, moved by feelings of anger and hatred more than by any hope of turning them from their purpose, came forward and spoke to the following effect:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><q direct="unspecified">It would be nothing new or surprising to me, Quirites, to hear once more the reproach that has always been levelled against our family by revolutionary tribunes, namely, that from the very beginning we have never regarded anything in the State as more important than the honour and dignity of the patricians, and that we have always been inimical to the interests of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The former of these charges I do not deny. I acknowledge that from the day when we were admitted into the State and into the senate we have laboured most assiduously in order that the greatness of those houses amongst which it was your will that we should be numbered might be said in all truth to have been enhanced rather than impaired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In reply to the second charge, I would go so far as to assert, on my own behalf and on that of my ancestors, that neither as individuals nor in our capacity as magistrates have we ever done anything knowingly which was against the interests of the plebs, unless any one should suppose that what is done on behalf of the State as a whole is necessarily injurious to the plebs as though they were living in another city; nor can any act or word of ours be truthfully brought up as opposed to your real welfare, though some may have been opposed to your wishes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Even if I did not belong to the Claudian house and had no patrician blood in my veins, but more simply one of the Quirites, knowing only that I was sprung from free-born parents and was living in a free State &mdash;even
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> then, could I keep silence when I see that this L. Sextius, this C. Licinius, tribunes for life &mdash;good heavens! &mdash; have reached such a pitch of impudence during the nine years of their reign that they are refusing to allow you to vote as you please in the elections and in the enacting of laws?</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><q direct="unspecified">On one condition,</q> they say, <q direct="unspecified">you shall reappoint us tribunes for the tenth time.</q> What is this but saying, <q direct="unspecified">What others seek we so thoroughly despise that we will not accept it without a heavy premium</q>?
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But what premium have we to pay that we may always have you as tribunes of the plebs? <q direct="unspecified">That you adopt all our measures <foreign lang="fr">en bloc</foreign>, whether you agree with them or not, whether they are useful or the reverse.</q></p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> others.</q> <q direct="unspecified">No,</q> he says, <q direct="unspecified">you will not be allowed to do so. You would pass the measure about usury and the one about the distribution of land, for these concern you all; but you would not allow the City of Rome to witness the portentous sight of L. Sextius and C. Licinius as consuls, a prospect you regard with detestation and loathing. Either accept all, or I propose
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> none.</q> Just as if a man were to place poison together with food before some one famished with hunger and bid him either abstain from what would support his life or mix with it what would bring death. If this were a free State, would not hundreds of voices have exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">Be gone with your tribuneships and proposals.</q> What? If <emph>you</emph> do not bring in reforms which it is to the people's advantage to adopt, is there no one else who

If there were to-day a war with Etruria such as when Porsena encamped on the Janiculum, or such as that in recent times with the Gauls, when everything round us except the Capitol and the Citadel were in the enemy's hands, and, in the press of such a war, L.

Is this what you call an equal distribution of honours, when it is lawful for two plebeians to be made consuls, but not for two patricians; when one must necessarily be taken from the plebs, while it is open to reject every patrician? What is this comradeship, this equality of yours?

So exclusively do the auspices belong to us that not only do the people when electing patrician magistrates elect them only when the auspices are favourable, but even we, when, independently of the people, we are choosing an interrex, only do so after the auspices have been taken: we as private citizens have the auspices which your order does not possess even as

Are the senate no longer to authorise the Assembly of centuries, or the Assembly of curies? Are Sextius and Licinius to reign in this City of Rome as though they were a second Romulus, a second Tatius, because they give away other people's money and other people's

So great a charm is felt in preying upon other people's fortunes, that it has not occurred to them that by expelling the occupiers from their lands under the one law vast solitudes will be created, whilst by the action of the other all credit will be destroyed and with it all human society

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The speech of Appius only availed to effect the postponement of the voting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Sextius and Licinius were re-elected for the tenth time. They carried a law providing that of the ten keepers of the Sibylline Books, five should be chosen from the patricians and five from the plebeians. This was regarded as a further step towards opening the path to the consulship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The plebs, satisfied with their victory, made the concession to the patricians that for the present all mention of consuls should be dropped. Consular tribunes were accordingly elected. Their names were A. and M. Cornelius (each for the second time), M. Geganius, P. Manlius, L. Veturius, and P. Valerius (for the sixth time).</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>With the exception of the siege of Velitrae, in which the result was delayed rather than doubtful, Rome was quiet so far as foreign affairs went. Suddenly the City was startled by rumours of the hostile advance of the Gauls. M. Furius Camillus was nominated Dictator for the fifth time. He named as his Master of the Horse T. Quinctius Poenus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Claudius is our authority for the statement that a battle was fought at the Anio with the Gauls this year, and that it was then that the famous fight took place on the bridge in which T. Manlius killed a Gaul who had challenged him and then despoiled him of his golden collar in the sight of both armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I am more inclined, with the majority of authors, to believe that these occurrences took place ten years later.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>There was, however, a pitched battle fought this year by the Dictator, M. F. Camillus, against the Gauls in the Alban territory. Although, bearing in mind their former defeat, the Romans felt a great dread of the Gauls, their victory was neither doubtful nor difficult.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Many thousands of the barbarians were slain in the battle, many more in the capture of their camp. Many others, making chiefly in the direction of Apulia, escaped, some by distant flight, and others who had become widely scattered and in their panic had lost their way.</p> <p>By the joint consent of the senate and plebs a triumph was decreed to the Dictator.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>He had hardly disposed of that war before a more alarming commotion awaited him at home. After tremendous conflicts, the Dictator and the senate were worsted; consequently the proposals of the tribunes were carried, and in spite of the opposition of the nobility the elections were held for consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> L. Sextius was the first consul to be elected out of the plebs.</p> <p>Even that was not the end of the conflict.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The patricians refused to confirm the appointment, and matters were approaching a secession of the plebs and other threatening signs of appalling civic struggles. The Dictator, however, quieted the disturbances by arranging a compromise; the nobility made a concession in the matter of a plebeian consul, the plebs gave way to the nobility on the appointment of a praetor to administer justice in the City who was to be a patrician.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Thus after their long estrangement the two orders of the State were at length brought into harmony.</p> <p>The senate decided that this event deserved to be commemorated &mdash;and if ever the immortal gods merited men's gratitude, they merited it then &mdash;by the celebration of the Great Games, and a fourth day was added to the three hitherto devoted to them.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The plebeian aediles refused to superintend them, whereupon the younger patricians were unanimous in declaring that they would gladly allow themselves to be appointed aediles for the honour of the immortal gods.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They were universally thanked, and the senate made a decree that the Dictator should ask the people to elect two aediles from amongst the patricians, and that the senate should confirm all the elections of that year.</p></div1>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year will be noteworthy for the first consulship held by a plebeian, and also for two new magistracies, the praetorship, and the curule aedileship. These offices the patricians created in their own interest as an equivalent for their concession of one consulship to the plebs, who bestowed it on L. Sextius, the man who had secured it for them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The patricians secured the praetorship for Sp. Furius, the son of old Camillus, and the two aedileships for Gnaeus Quinctius Capitolinus and P. Cornelius Scipio, members of their own order. L. Aemilius Mamercus was elected from the patricians as colleague to L. Sextius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The main themes of discussion at the beginning of the year were the Gauls, about whom it was rumoured that after wandering by various routes through Apulia they had reunited their forces, and the Hernici, who were reported to have revolted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> All preparations were deferred with the sole purpose of preventing any action from being taken by the plebeian consul; everything was quiet and silent in the City, as though a suspension of all business had been proclaimed, with the one exception of the tribunes of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They did not silently submit to the procedure of the nobility in appropriating to themselves three patrician magistrates, sitting in curule chairs and clothed in the praetexta like consuls, as a set-off against one plebeian consul &mdash;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> the praetor even administering justice, as though he were a colleague of the consuls and elected under the same auspices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate felt somewhat ashamed of their resolution by which they had limited the curule aediles to their own order; it had been agreed that they should be elected in alternate years from the plebs; afterwards it was left open.</p><p>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Pestilence in Rome &mdash;Death of Camillus.</note> consuls for the following year were L. Genucius and Q.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Servilius. Matters were quiet as regarded domestic troubles or foreign wars, but, lest there should be too great a feeling of security, a pestilence broke aediles, and three tribunes of the plebs fell victims, and in the population generally there was a corresponding proportion of deaths. The most illustrious victim was M. F. Camillus, whose death, though occurring in ripe old age, was bitterly
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> lamented. He was, it may be truly said, an exceptional man in every change of fortune; before he went into exile foremost in peace and war, rendered still more illustrious when actually in exile by the regret which the State felt for his loss, and the eagerness with which after its capture it implored his assistance, and quite as much so by the success with which, after being restored to his country, he restored his country's fortunes together with his
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> own. For five-and-twenty years after this he lived fully up to his reputation, and was counted worthy to be named next to Romulus, as the second founder of the City.</p>

The new consuls were C. Sulpicius Peticus and C. Licinius
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Stolo. Nothing worth mentioning took place, except that in order to secure the peace of the gods a <foreign lang="la">lectisternium</foreign> was instituted, the third since the foundation of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> City.<note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="ed">See Livy's description of this in Vol. I. p. 305. That was the first institution of this peculiar solemnity in Rome; the second instance of its observance Livy has not mentioned, but he speaks of this as the third. It was essentially a banquet of the gods; richly covered couches were placed round tables which were loaded with offerings from the sacrifices which were going on in the temples and in private houses throughout the City. On these couches were laid either the emblems of the particular deity of draped wax effigies. Whether it was an importation from Greece or an old Italian rite seems doubtful.</note> But the violence of the epidemic was not alleviated by any aid from either men or gods, and it is asserted that as men's minds were completely overcome by superstitious terrors they introduced, amongst other attempts to placate the wrath of heaven, scenic representations, a novelty to a nation of warriors who had hitherto only had the games of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Circus. They began, however, in a small way, as nearly everything does, and small as they were, they were borrowed from abroad. The players were sent for from Etruria; there were no words, no mimetic action; they danced to the measures of the flute and practised graceful movements in Tuscan
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> fashion. Afterwards the young men began to imitate them, exercising their wit on each other in burlesque verses, and suiting their action to their
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> words. This became an established diversion, and was kept up by frequent practice. The Tuscan word for an actor is <foreign lang="la">istrio</foreign>, and so the native performers were called
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <foreign lang="la">histriones</foreign>. These did not, as in former times, throw out rough extempore effusions like the Fescennine verse, but they chanted satyrical verses quite metrically arranged and adapted to the notes of the flute, and these they accompanied with appropriate movements. Several years later Livius for the first time abandoned the loose satyrical verses and ventured to compose a play with a coherent
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> plot. Like all his contemporaries, he acted in his own plays, and it is said that when he had worn
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> out his voice by repeated recalls he begged leave to place a second player in front of the flutist to sing the monologue while he did the acting, with all the more energy because his voice no longer embarrassed
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> him. Then the practice commenced of the chanter following the movements of the actors, the dialogue alone being left to their
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> voices. When, by adopting this method in the presentation of pieces, the old farce and loose jesting was given up and the play became a work of art, the young people left the regular acting to the professional players and began to improvise comic verses. These were subsequently known as <foreign lang="la">exodia</foreign> (after-pieces), and were mostly worked up into the <q direct="unspecified">Atellane
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Plays.</q> <note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed">These were <q direct="unspecified">the old national drama immediately connected with the festive worship of the people in which it took its rise and which therefore retained a respectability which could be conceded to the performances of foreign <foreign lang="la">histriones</foreign>.

Hence it is a standing rule that those who take part in the <foreign lang="la">Atellanae</foreign> are not deprived of their civic standing, and serve in the army as being in no way connected with the
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> regular acting. Amongst the things which have arisen from small beginnings, the origin of the stage ought to be put foremost, seeing that what was at first healthy and innocent has grown into a mad extravagance that even wealthy kingdoms can hardly support.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>However, the first introduction of plays, though intended as a means of religious expiation, did not relieve the mind from religious terrors nor the body from the inroads of disease.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Owing to an inundation of the Tiber, the Circus was flooded in the middle of the Games, and this produced an unspeakable dread; it seemed as though the gods had turned their faces from men and despised all that was done to propitiate their wrath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> <note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed"><p>Continued Pestilence &mdash;Fresh Attempts at Proitiation.</p></note> C. Genucius and L. Aemilius Mamercus were the new consuls, each for the second time. The fruitless search for effective means of propitiation was affecting the minds of the people more than disease was affecting
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> their bodies. It is said to have been discovered that the older men remembered that a pestilence had once been assuaged by the Dictator driving in a nail. The senate believed this to be a religious obligation, and ordered a Dictator to be nominated for
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> that purpose. L. Manlius Imperiosus was nominated, and he appointed L. Pinarius as his Master of the Horse.</p> <p>There is an ancient instruction written in archaic letters which runs: <emph>Let him who is the praetor maximus fasten a nail on the Ides of September</emph>. This notice was fastened up on the right side of the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, next to the chapel
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> of Minerva. This nail is said to have marked the number of the year &mdash;written records being scarce in those days &mdash;and was for that reason placed under the protection of Minerva because she was the inventor
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> of numbers. Cincius, a careful student of monuments of this kind, asserts that at Volsinii also nails were fastened in the temple of Nortia, an Etruscan goddess, to indicate the number of
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> the year.</p> <p>It was in accordance with this direction that the consul Horatius dedicated the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the year following the expulsion of the kings<note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="ed">Livy obviously means to imply that the first nail was then driven in and the <q direct="unspecified">custom</q> observed annually by the consuls on Sept. 13. If this date happened to fall during an interregnum then it was necessary to nominate a Dictator to perform the office.</note>; from the consuls the ceremony of fastening the nails passed to the Dictators, because they possessed greater authority. As the custom had been subsequently dropped, it was felt to be of sufficient importance to require the appointment of a Dictator.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>L. Manlius was accordingly nominated, but, regarding his appointment as due to political rather than to religious reasons and eager to command in the war with the Hernici, he caused a very angry feeling among the men liable to serve by the inconsiderate way in which he conducted the enrolment. At last, in consequence of the unanimous resistance offered by the tribunes of the plebs, he gave way, either voluntarily or through compulsion, and laid down his Dictatorship.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Impeachment of Manlius</note>. &mdash;This did not, however, prevent his impeachment the following year, when Q. Servilius Ahala and L. Genucius were consuls, the prosecutor being M. Pomponius, one of the tribunes of the plebs. He had incurred universal hatred through the unfeeling severity with which he had carried out the enlistment; the citizens had not only been fined, but subjected to personal ill-treatment, some scourged and others imprisoned because they had not answered to their names.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But what men most loathed was his brutal temperament, and the epithet <q direct="unspecified">Imperiosus</q> (masterful) which had been fastened on him from his unblushing cruelty, an epithet utterly repugnant to a free State. The effects of his cruelty were felt quite as much by his nearest kindred, by his own blood as by strangers.</p> <p>Amongst other charges which the tribune brought against him was his treatment of his young son. It was alleged that although guilty of no offence he had banished him from the City, from his home and household gods, had forbidden him to appear in public in the Forum or to associate with those of his own age, and had consigned him to servile work, almost to the imprisonment of a workshop.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here the youth, of high birth, the son of a Dictator, was to learn by daily suffering how rightly his father was called <q direct="unspecified">Imperiosus.</q> And for what offence? Simply because he was lacking in eloquence, in readiness of speech! Ought not this natural defect to have been helped and remedied by the father, if there were a spark of humanity in him, instead of being punished and branded by persecution? Not even do brute beasts show less care and protection to their offspring if they happen to be sickly or deformed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But L. Manlius actually aggravated his son's misfortune by fresh misfortunes, and increased his natural dullness and quenched any faint glimmerings of ability which he might have shown by the clodhopper's life to which he was condemned and the boorish bringing up amongst cattle to which he had to submit.</p> <p>The youth himself was the last to be exasperated by these accusations brought against his father. On the contrary, he was so indignant at finding himself made the ground of the charges against his father and the deep resentment they created that he was determined to let gods and men see that he preferred standing by his father to helping his enemies.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He formed a project which, though natural to an ignorant rustic and no precedent for an ordinary citizen to follow, still afforded a laudable example of filial affection. Arming himself with a knife, he went off early in the morning, without any one's knowledge, to the City, and once inside the gates proceeded straight to the house of M. Pomponius. He informed the porter that it was necessary for him to see his master at once, and announced himself as T. Manlius, the son of Lucius. Pomponius imagined that he was either bringing some matter for a fresh charge, to revenge himself on his father, or was going to offer some advice as to the management of the prosecution.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> After mutual salutations, he informed Pomponius that he wished the business in hand to be transacted in the absence of witnesses. After all present had been ordered to withdraw, he grasped his knife and standing over the tribune's bed and pointing the weapon towards him, threatened to plunge it into him at once unless he took the oath which he was going to dictate to him, <q direct="unspecified">That he would never hold an Assembly of the plebs for the prosecution of his father.</q> The tribune was terrified, for he saw the steel glittering before his eyes, while he was alone and defenceless, in the presence of a youth of exceptional strength, and what was worse, prepared to use that strength with savage ferocity. He took the required oath and publicly announced that, yielding to violence, he had abandoned his original purpose.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The plebs would certainly have been glad of the opportunity of passing sentence on such an insolent and cruel offender, but they were not displeased at the son's daring deed in defence of his parent, which was all the more meritorious because it showed that his father's brutality had not in any way weakened his natural affection and sense of duty.</p> <p>Not only was the prosecution of the father dropped, but the incident proved the means of distinction for the son. That year, for the first time, the military tribunes were elected by the popular vote; previously they had been nominated by the commander-in-chief, as is the case now with those who are called Rufuli. This youth obtained the second out of six places, though he had done nothing at home or in the field to make him popular, having passed his youth in the country far from city life.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Marcus Curtius.</note> this year, owing either to an earthquake or the action of some other force, the middle of the Forum fell in to an immense depth, presenting the appearance of an enormous cavern.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> gulf, until at the bidding of the gods inquiry was made as to what that was in which the strength of Rome lay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> For this, the seers declared, must be sacrificed on that spot if men wished the Roman republic to be eternal. The story goes on that M. Curtius, a youth distinguished in war, indignantly asked those who were in doubt what
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> answer to give, whether anything that Rome possessed was more precious than the arms and valour of her sons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As those around stood silent, he looked up to the Capitol and to the temples of the immortal gods which looked down on the Forum, and stretching out his hands first towards heaven and then to the yawning chasm beneath, devoted himself to the gods below.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then mounting his horse, which had been caparisoned as magnificently as possible, he leaped in full armour into the cavern. Gifts and offerings of fruits of the earth were flung in after him by crowds of men and women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was from this incident that the designation <q direct="unspecified">The Curtian Gulf</q> originated, and not from that old-world soldier of Titius Tatius, Curtius Mettius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If any path would lead an inquirer to the truth, we should not shrink from the labour of investigation; as it is, on a matter where antiquity makes certainty impossible we must adhere to the legend which supplies the more famous derivation of the name.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Hernici.</note> this appalling portent had been duly expiated, the deliberations of the senate were concerned with the Hernici.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The mission of the Fetials who had been sent to demand satisfaction proved to be fruitless; the senate accordingiy decided to submit to the people at the earliest possible day the question of declaring war against the Hernici.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The people in a crowded Assembly voted for war. Its conduct fell by lot to L. Genucius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As he was the first plebeian consul to manage a war under his own auspices the State awaited the issue with keen interest, prepared to look
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> upon the policy of admitting plebeians to the highest offices of state as wise or unwise according to the way matters turned out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As chance would have it, Genucius, whilst making a vigorous attack upon the enemy, fell into an ambush, the legions were taken by surprise and routed, and the consul was surrounded and killed without the enemy being aware who their victim was.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the report of the occurrence reached Rome, the patricians were not so much distressed at the disaster which had befallen the commonwealth as they were exultant over the unfortunate generalship of the consul. Everywhere they were taunting the plebeians: <q direct="unspecified">Go on!
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Elect your consuls from the plebs, transfer the auspices to those for whom it is an impiety to possess them!
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The voice of the plebs may expel the patricians from their rightful honours, but has your law, which pollutes the auspices, any force against the immortal gods?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They have themselves vindicated their will as expressed through the auspices, for no sooner have these been profaned by one who took them against divine and human law than the army and its general have been wiped out as a lesson to you not to conduct the elections to the confusion of all the rights of the patrician houses.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Senate-house and the Forum alike were resounding with these protests.</p><p>Appius Claudius, who had led the opposition to the law, spoke with more weight than ever while he denounced the result of a
						<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> policy which he had severely censured, and the consul Servilius, with the unanimous approval of the patricians, nominated him Dictator. Orders were issued for an immediate enrolment and the suspension of all business.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After Genucius had fallen, C. Sulpicius had assumed the command, and before the arrival of the Dictator and the newlyraised legions, he distinguished himself by a smart action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The death of the consul had led the Hernici to think very lightly of the Roman arms, and they surrounded the Roman camp fully expecting to carry it by assault. The defenders, encouraged by their general and burning with rage and indignation at their recent defeat, made a sortie, and not only destroyed any hopes the Hernici had of forcing the entrenchment but created such disorder amongst them that they precipitately retreated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> By the arrival of the Dictator and the junction of the old and newly-raised legions, their strength was doubled. In the presence of the entire force, the Dictator commended Sulpicius and the men who had so gallantly defended the camp, and whilst he raised the courage of those who listened to the praise which they so well deserved, he at the same time made the rest all the keener to emulate them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The enemy showed no less energy in preparing for a renewal of the struggle. Aware of the increase in the strength of their enemy, and animated by the thought of their recent victory, they called every man in the Hernican nation who could bear arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Eight cohorts were formed of four hundred men each, who had been carefully selected. These, the picked flower of their manhood, were full of hope and courage, and they were further encouraged by a decree which had been passed to allow them double pay. They were exempt from all fatigue duty, in order that they might devote themselves more than the rest of the troops to the one duty reserved for them-that of fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In order to make their courage more conspicuous they occupied a special position in the fighting line.</p><p>The Roman camp was separated from the Hernican by a plain two miles broad. In the middle of this plain, almost equally distant from both camps, the battle took place.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For some time neither side gained any advantage, though the Roman cavalry made frequent attempts to break the enemy's line.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When they found that the effect produced was much feebler than the efforts they made, they obtained the Dictator's permission to abandon their horses and fight on foot. They raised a loud cheer and commenced a novel kind of fighting by charging as infantry.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Their onset would have been irresistible had not the special cohorts of the enemy opposed them with a strength and courage equal to their own.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the struggle was kept up by the foremost men of each nation. Whatever losses the common chances of battle inflicted on each side were many times greater than could have been expected from their numbers. The rest of the soldiers stood like a crowd of spectators, leaving the fighting to their chiefs as if it were their special privilege, and placing all their hopes of victory on the courage of others. Many fell on both sides, still more were wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At length the cavalry began to ask each other somewhat bitterly, <q direct="unspecified">What was left for them to do if after failing to repulse the enemy when mounted they could make no impression on them whilst fighting on foot. What third mode of fighting were they looking for?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Why had they dashed forward so eagerly in front of the standards to fight in a position which was not their proper one?</q> Urged on by these mutual reproaches, they raised their battle shout again and pressed forward. Slowly they compelled the enemy to give ground, then they drove them back more rapidly, and at last fairly routed them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is not easy to say what gave the advantage where the two sides were so evenly matched, unless it be that the Fortune which ever watches over each nation had the power to raise and to depress their courage.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Romans followed up the fleeing Hernici as far as their camp; but they abstained from attacking it, as it was late in the day. They offered sacrifices the next morning for a long time without obtaining any favourable omen, and this prevented the Dictator from giving the signal for attack before noon; the fight consequently went on into the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The next day they found the camp abandoned; the Hernici had fled and left some of their wounded behind. The people of Signium saw the main body of the fugitives streaming past their walls with their standards few and far between, and sallying out to attack them they scattered them in headlong flight over the fields.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The victory was anything but a bloodless one for the Romans; they lost a quarter of their whole force, and by no means the smallest loss fell on the cavalry, a considerable number of whom perished.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls for the following year were C. Sulpicius and C. Licinius Calvus. They resumed operations against the Hernici, and invaded their territory, but did not find the enemy in the open. They attacked and captured Ferentinum, a Hernican city; but as they were returning home the Tiburtines closed their gates against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There had previously been numerous complaints made on both sides, but this last provocation finally decided the Romans, in case the Fetials failed to get redress, to declare war against the Tiburtines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It is generally understood that T. Quinctius Pennus was the Dictator and Ser. Cornelius Maluginensis the Master of the horse. According to Licinius Macer, the Dictator was nominated by the consul Licinius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> His colleague, Sulpicius, was anxious to get the elections over before he departed for the war, in the hope of being himself re-elected, if he were on the spot, and Licinius determined to thwart his colleague's self-seeking ambition.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Licinius Macer's desire to appropriate the credit of this to his house (the Licinii) lessens the weight of his authority. As I find no mention of this in the older annalists, I am more inclined to believe that it was the prospect of a Gaulish war which was the immediate cause why a Dictator was nominated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At all events it was in this year that the Gauls formed their camp by the Salarian road, three miles from the City at the bridge across the Anio.</p> <p>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Titus Manlius' Exploit.</note> face of this sudden and alarming inroad the Dictator proclaimed a suspension of all business, and made every man who was liable to serve take the military oath.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He marched out of the City with an immense army and fixed his camp on this side the Anio. Each side had left the bridge between them intact, as its destruction might have been thought due to fears of an attack.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There were frequent skirmishes for the possession of the bridge; as these were indecisive, the question was left unsettled. A Gaul of extraordinary stature strode forward on to the unoccupied bridge, and shouting as loudly as he could, cried: <q direct="unspecified">Let the bravest man that Rome possesses come out and fight me, that we two may decide which people is the superior in war.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A long silence followed. The best and bravest of the Romans made no sign;they felt ashamed of appearing to decline the challenge, and yet they were reluctant to expose themselves to such terrible danger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Thereupon T. Manlius, the youth who had protected his father from the persecution of the tribune, left his post and went to the Dictator.<q direct="unspecified">Without
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> your orders, General,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">I will never leave my post to fight, no, not even if I saw that victory was certain ; but if you give me permission I want to show that monster as he stalks so proudly in front of their lines that I am a scion of that family which hurled the troop of Gauls from the Tarpeian rock.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the Dictator: <q direct="unspecified">Success to your courage, T. Manlius, and to your affection for your father and your fatherland . Go, and with the help of the gods show that the name of Rome is invincible.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Then his comrades fastened on his armour; he took an infantry shield and a Spanish sword<note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed">This was a short pointed double-edged weapon, and was used like a large dagger.</note> as better adapted for close fighting; thus armed and equipped they led him forward against the Gaul, who was exulting in his brute strength, and even &mdash;the ancients thought this worth recording &mdash;putting his tongue out in derision.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They retired to their posts and the two armed champions were left alone in the midst, more after the manner of a scene on the stage than under the conditions of serious war, and to those who judged by appearances, by no means equally matched.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The one was a creature of enormous bulk, resplendent in a many-coloured coat and wearing painted and gilded armour; the other a man of average height, and his arms, useful rather than ornamental, gave him quite an ordinary appearance. There was no singing of war-songs, <note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed">Compare the action of Taillefer before the battle ofSenlac.</note> no prancing about, no silly brandishing of
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> weapons. With a breast full of courage and silent wrath Manlius reserved all his ferocity for the actual moment of
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> conflict. When they had taken their stand between the two armies, while so many hearts around them were in suspense between hope and fear, the Gaul, like a great overhanging mass, held out his shield on his left arm to meet his adversary's blows and aimed a tremendous cut downwards with his
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> sword. The Roman evaded the blow, and pushing aside the bottom of the Gaul's shield with his own, he slipped under it close up to the Gaul, too near for him to get at him with his sword. Then turning the point of his blade upwards, he gave two rapid thrusts in succession and stabbed the Gaul in the belly and the groin, laying his enemy prostrate over a large extent of
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> ground. He left the body of his fallen foe undespoiled with the exception of his chain, which though smeared with blood he placed round his own
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> neck. Astonishment and fear kept the Gauls motionless; the Romans ran eagerly forward from their lines to meet their warrior, and amidst cheers and congratulations they conducted him to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Dictator. In the doggerel verses which they extemporised in his honour they called him Torquatus (<q direct="unspecified">adorned with a chain</q>), and this soubriquet became for his posterity a proud family
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> name. The Dictator gave him a golden crown, and before the whole army alluded to his victory in terms of the highest praise.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Strange to relate, that single combat had such a farreaching influence upon the whole war that the Gauls hastily abandoned their camp and moved off into the neighbourhood of Tibur. They formed an alliance offensive and defensive with that city, and the Tiburtines supplied them generously with provisions. After receiving this assistance they passed on into Campania.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Tibur</note>This was the reason why in the following year the consul, C. Poetilius Balbus, led an army, by order of the people, against the Tiburtines, though the conduct of the war against the Hernici had fallen by lot to his colleague, M. Fabius Ambustus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Though the Gauls had come back from Campania to their assistance, it was undoubtedly by the Tiburtine generals that the cruel depredations in the territories of Labici, Tusculum, and Alba were carried out. To act against the Tiburtines, the republic was content with a consul, but the sudden re-appearance of the Gauls required a Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Q. Servilius Ahala was nominated, and he selected T. Quinctius as Master of the Horse. On the authority of the senate, he made a vow to celebrate the Great Games, should the issue of the war prove favourable.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After giving orders for the consul's army to remain where it was, in order to confine the Tiburtines to their own war, the Dictator mode all the <q direct="unspecified">juniors</q> take the military oath, without a single refusal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The battle, in which the whole strength of the City was engaged, took place not far from the Colline Gate in the sight of the parents and wives and children of the Roman soldiers. Even when absent, the thought of those near and dear to one is a great incentive to courage, but now that they were within view they fired the men with a firm resolve to win their applause and secure their safety.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> There was great slaughter on both sides, but the Gauls were in the end repulsed, and fled in the direction of Tibur as though it were a Gaulish stronghold. The straggling fugitives were intercepted by the consul not far from Tibur; the townsmen sallied out to render them assistance, and they and the Gauls were driven within their gates.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> So the consul was equally successful with the Dictator.</p> <p>The other consul, Fabius, crushed the Hernici in successive defeats, at first in comparatively unimportant actions and then finally in one great battle when the enemy attacked him in full strength.</p><p>The Dictator passed splendid encomiums on the consuls, both in the senate and before the people, and even transferred to them the credit for his own success.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He then laid down his office. Poetilius celebrated a double triumph &mdash;over the Gauls and over the Tiburtines. It was considered a sufficient honour for Fabius to be allowed to enter the City in an ovation.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The Tiburtines laughed at Poetilius' triumph. <q direct="unspecified">When,</q> they said, <q direct="unspecified">had he ever met them in a pitched battle? A few of them had come outside their gates to watch the disordered flight of the Gauls, but when they found that they, too, were being attacked and cut down indiscriminately they retreated into their city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Did the Romans deem that sort of thing worthy of a triumph? They must not look upon it as too great and wonderful a thing to create disorder in an enemy's gates; they would themselves see greater confusion and panic before their own walls.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly, the following year, when M. Popilius Laenas and Cnaeus Manlius were the consuls, an army from Tibur marched in the early hours of the night when all was still against the City of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The citizens, suddenly aroused from sleep, were alarmed by the danger of a nocturnal attack and one quite unlooked for, and the alarm was heightened by their ignorance as to who the enemies were and whence they came.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> However, the word quickly passed <q direct="unspecified">To arms</q>; the gates were protected by pickets and the walls manned. When the early dawn revealed a comparatively small force before the walls and the enemy turned out to be none other than the Tiburtines, the consuls decided upon an immediate attack. They issued from two separate gates and attacked the enemy, as they were advancing to the walls, on both flanks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It soon became obvious that they had been trusting more to the chances of a surprise than to their own courage, so little resistance did they offer to the very first onset of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Their expedition turned out to be an advantage to the Romans, for the apprehensions aroused by a war so close to their gates stifled a nascent conflict between the patricians and the plebs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In the war which followed there was another hostile incursion, but one more formidable to the country districts than to the City; the Tarquinians were carrying on their depredations within the Roman frontiers mainly on the side towards Etruria. As redress was refused, the new consuls, C. Fabius and C. Plautius, by order of the people, declared war against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This campaign was allotted to Fabius, the one against the Hernici to Plautius.</p><p>Rumours<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Renewed fighting with the Gauls.</note> of hostilities on the part of the Gauls were becoming more frequent. Amidst these numerous alarms, however, there was one consolation &mdash; peace had been granted on their request to the Latins, and a strong contingent was sent by them in accordance with the old treaty which for many years they had not observed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Now that the cause of Rome was strengthened by this reinforcement, there was less excitement created by the news that the Gauls had recently reached Praeneste and from there had settled in the country round Pedum.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was decided that C. Sulpicius should be nominated Dictator; the consul, C. Plautius, was summoned home for the purpose. M. Valerius was appointed Master of the Horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They selected the finest troops out of the two armies which the consuls had commanded and led them against the Gauls.</p> <p>The war was somewhat more tedious than was agreeable to either side. At first it was only the Gauls who were anxious to fight, then the Romans showed even more alacrity than the Gauls in arming themselves for action.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Dictator by no means approved of this, since there was no necessity for him to run any risks. The enemy was daily becoming weaker by remaining inactive in a disadvantageous position, without any supplies previously collected, and with no proper entrenchments thrown up. Their whole strength both of mind and body depended upon rapid movements, and even a short delay told upon their vigour.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> For these reasons the Dictator prolonged the war and announced that he would inflict severe punishment on any one who fought against orders.</p> <p>The soldiers grew impatient at this state of things. When on picket or outpost duty at night, they talked in very disparaging terms about the Dictator, sometimes they abused the senators generally for not having given orders that the war should be conducted by consuls.
								<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <q direct="unspecified">An extraordinary commander,</q> they said, <q direct="unspecified">had been selected, one man out of a thousand, who thought that if he sat still and did nothing himself, victory would fly down from heaven into his lap.</q> Then they uttered these sentiments and still more angry ones openly in the daytime; they declared that they would either fight without waiting for orders or they would march back in a body to Rome.
								<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The centurions made common cause with the soldiers; the murmurs were not confined to scattered groups, a general discussion went on in the main thoroughfares of the camp and in the open space before the headquarters' tent. The crowd grew to the dimensions of an Assembly, and shouts were raised from all sides to go at once to the Dictator. Sextius Tullius was to be spokesman for the army, a position he was well worthy to fill.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Tullius was now first centurion for the seventh time, and there was not in the whole army amongst the infantry officers a more distinguished soldier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He led the procession to the tribunal, and Sulpicius was not more surprised at seeing the gathering than at seeing Tullius at the head of it.</p><p>He began: <q direct="unspecified">Do not be surprised, Dictator, at my being here.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The whole army is under the impression that it has been condemned by you for cowardice and to mark its disgrace has been deprived of its arms. It has asked me to plead its cause before you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Even if we could be charged with deserting our ranks and turning our backs to the enemy, or with the disgraceful loss of our standards, even then I should think it only fair for you to allow us to amend our fault by courage and to wipe out the memory of our disgraceful conduct by winning fresh glory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even the legions which were routed at the Alia marched out afterwards from Veii and recovered the City which they had lost through panic. For us, thanks to the goodness of the gods and the happy fortune which attends on you and on Rome, our fortunes and our honour remain unimpaired.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And yet I hardly dare mention the word <q direct="unspecified">honour</q> whilst the enemy ventures to mock us with every kind of insult, as if we were hiding ourselves like women behind our rampart, and &mdash;what grieves us much more &mdash;even you our commander have made up your mind that your army is without courage, without weapons, without hands to use them, and before you have put us to the proof have so despaired of us that you look upon yourself as the commander of cripples and weaklings.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What other reason can we believe there to be, why you, a veteran commander, a most gallant soldier, should be as they say sitting with your arms folded? However the case may be, it is more true to say that you appear to doubt our courage than that we doubt yours.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/><q direct="unspecified">But if this is not your doing, but a piece of State policy, if it is some concerted scheme of the patricians and not war with the Gauls that is keeping us in banishment from the City and from our household gods, then I ask you to regard what I am now going to say as addressed not by soldiers to their commander but to the patricians by the plebs, who say that as you have your projects so they will have theirs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Who could possibly be angry with us for regarding ourselves as your soldiers, not your slaves, sent to war not into banishment, ready, if any one gives the sign and leads us into battle, to fight as becomes men and Romans, equally ready, if there is no need for arms, to live a life of peace and quietness in Rome rather than in camp? This is what we would say to the patricians.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><q direct="unspecified">But you are our commander, and we your soldiers implore you to give us a chance of fighting. We are eager to win a victory, but to win it under your leadership; it is on you that we want to bestow the laurels of glory, it is with you that we desire to enter the City in triumphal procession, it is behind your chariot that we would go with joyous thanksgivings up to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>This speech of Tullius' was followed by earnest requests from the whole army that he would give the signal and order them to arm.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although the Dictator recognized that, however satisfactory the soldiers' action might be, a most undesirable precedent had been set, he nevertheless undertook to carry out their wishes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He interrogated Tullius privately as to what the whole thing meant and what warrant he had for his procedure. Tullius earnestly entreated the Dictator not to think that he had forgotten military discipline or the respect due to his commanding officer. <q direct="unspecified">But an excited multitude is generally swayed by their advisers, and he had consented to act as their leader to prevent any one else from coming forward whom they might have chosen because he shared their excitement.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He himself would do nothing against the wish of the commanderin-chief, but the commander also must be most careful to keep his men in hand. They were too excited now to be put off; they would themselves choose the place and time for fighting if the Dictator did not do so.</q></p> <p>During this conversation some cattle which happened to be grazing outside the rampart were being driven off by a Gaul, when two Roman soldiers took them from him.
							<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Gauls pelted them with stones, a shout was raised by the Roman outpost and men ran together from both sides. Affairs were rapidly approaching a pitched battle had not the centurions promptly stopped the fighting.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This incident confirmed the Dictator's belief in what Tullius had told him, and as matters no longer admitted of delay he issued orders to prepare for battle on the following day.</p> <p>The Dictator was going into action feeling more assured as to the courage than as to the strength of his troops. He began to turn over in his mind every possible device by which he could inspire fear into the enemy.
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At last he thought out an ingenious and original plan, one, too, which has since been adopted by many of our own generals as well as those of other countries and which is even practised to-day. He ordered the packsaddles to be taken off the mules and two pieces of coloured cloth placed on their backs.<note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">This would give them the appearance of cavalry saddles.</note>
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The muleteers were then furnished with arms, some taken from the prisoners and others belonging to the invalided soldiers, and after thus equipping about a thousand of them and
								<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> distributing a hundred of the cavalry amongst them he ordered them to ascend the mountains which overlooked the camp and conceal themselves in the woods, and remain there motionless till they received the signal from him.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As soon as it grew light the Dictator extended his lines along the lower slopes of the mountain in order that the enemy might have to form their front facing the mountain.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The arrangements for creating a groundless alarm were now completed, and that groundless alarm proved almost more serviceable than an actual increase of strength would have been.</p> <p>At first the leaders of the Gauls did not believe that the Romans would come down on to the plain, but when they saw them suddenly descending, they rushed on to meet them, eager for the encounter, and the battle commenced before the signal had been given by the commanders.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Gauls directed their fiercest attack upon the Roman right, and the Dictator's presence with that division alone prevented the attack from succeeding.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he saw the men wavering he called out sharply to Sextius and asked him if this was the way in which he had pledged his soldiers to fight. <q direct="unspecified">Where,</q> he cried, <q direct="unspecified">are the shouts of the men who clamoured for arms? Where are their threats of going into battle without their commander's orders?
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here is the commander, calling loudly to them to fight, and himself fighting in the forefront of the battle; who out of all those who were just now going to lead the way was following him? Braggarts in camp, cowards in battle!</q> They felt the truth of what they heard, and they were so stung by a sense of shame that they rushed on the enemy's weapons without any thought of danger.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They charged like madmen and threw the enemy's lines into confusion, and a cavalry attack which followed turned the confusion into rout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As soon as the Dictator saw their line broken in this part of the field he turned the attack on to their left, where he saw them closing up into a crowded mass, and at the same time gave the agreed signal to those on the mountain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When a fresh battle shout arose and these were seen crossing the mountain slope in the direction of the Gauls' camp, the enemy, afraid of being cut off, gave up the fight and ran in wild disorder to their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were met by Marcus Valerius, the Master of the Horse, who after putting their right wing to flight was riding up to their lines, and he turned their flight towards the mountain and woods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A great many were intercepted by the muleteers whom they took for cavalry, and a terrible slaughter took place amongst those whom panic had driven into the woods after the main battle was over.</p> <p>No one since Camillus celebrated a more justly deserved triumph over the Gauls than C. Sulpicius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A large quantity of gold taken out of the spoil was dedicated by him and stored away in a vault beneath the Capitol.</p> <p>The campaigns in which the consuls for the year were engaged ended in a very different way.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Whilst the Hernici were defeated and reduced to submission by his colleague, Fabius showed a sad want of caution and skill in his operations against the Tarquinians. The humiliation which Rome incurred through his defeat was embittered by the barbarity of the enemy, who sacrificed 307 prisoners of war.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That defeat was followed by a sudden predatory incursion of the Privernates and afterwards by one in which the Veliternians took part.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>In this year two additional tribes were formed &mdash;the Pomptine and the Publilian. The Games which Camillus had vowed when Dictator were celebrated.<note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed">There is probably some mistake here. Those mentioned on p. 311, Vol. I. as being vowed before the capture of Veii had been celebrated shortly before the Gaulish invasion (p. 326 ibid.). Livy probably wrote Servilius instead of Camillus, and the error may be due to a copyist. The vow which Servilius made is mentioned in chap. XI.</note> A measure dealing with improper canvassing was for the first time submitted to the people, after passing the senate, by C. Poetilius, tribune of the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It was intended to check the canvassing, mainly by rich plebeians, in the markets and promiscuous gatherings.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Another measure, by no means so welcome to the patricians, was brought forward the following year, the consuls being C. Marcius and Cnaeus Manlius. M. Duilius and L. Menenius, tribunes of the plebs, were the proposers of this measure, which fixed the rate of interest at 8 and 1/3 per cent.;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the plebs adopted it with much more eagerness than the Poetilian Law against canvassing.</p> <p>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Wars with Neighbouring Cities.</note> addition to the fresh wars decided upon the previous year, the Faliscans had been guilty of two acts of hostility; their men had fought in the ranks of the Tarquinians, and they had refused to give up those who had fled after their defeat to Tarquinii, when the Fetials demanded their surrender.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> That campaign fell to Cn. Manlius; Marcius conducted the operations against Privernum. This district had remained uninjured during the long years of peace, and when Marcius led his army thither, they loaded themselves with plunder.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Its value was enhanced by the munificence of the consul, for he appropriated none of it for the State, and so encouraged the efforts of the private soldier to increase his private means.<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed">The consul's action would do much to help them to pay off a large portion of the debt in which most of them were involved.</note></p><p>The Privernates had formed a strongly entrenched camp in front of their walls, and before attacking it Marcius summoned his troops to assembly, and said: <q direct="unspecified">If you promise me that you will do your duty bravely in battle and are quite as ready for fighting as for plunder, I give you now the camp and city of the enemy.</q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> With a mighty shout they demanded the signal for battle, and with heads erect and full of confidence they marched proudly into line. Sex. Tullius, who has been already mentioned, was in the front, and he called out, <q direct="unspecified">See, General, how your army is fulfilling its promise to you,</q> and with the word he dropped his javelin and drawing his sword charged the enemy.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The whole of the front line followed him and at the very first onset defeated the Privernates and pursued them as far as the town, which they prepared to storm. When the scaling ladders were actually placed against the walls the place surrendered. A triumph was celebrated over the Privernates.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Nothing worth recording was done by the other consul, except his unprecedented action in getting a law passed in camp by the tribes levying 5 per cent. on the value of every slave who was manumitted.<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified">One of the consuls, Cn. Manlius, was in the field with a consular army to carry on the war against the Tarquiniensians and Faliscans: his colleague, C. Marcius Rutilus was engaged with the Privernatians and enriching his army, it is said, with the plunder of the enemy's country, for many years untouched by the ravages of war. It is probable that the soldiers on this occasion made prisoners of many Privernatian families, and released them again on payment of a large ransom. But prisoners taken in war becoming, according to ancient law, the slaves of the captor, his release of a prisoner upon ransom was, in fact, the manumission of a slave. Accordingly Cn. Manlius called his soldiers together in the camp near Sutrium according to their tribes, and as they were assembled in regular comitia he proposed to them a law that five per cent. on the value of any emancipated slave should be paid by his master into the public treasury. It might be argued that the State ought not to lose all benefit from the plunder acquired by its soldiers; and that especially if a soldier set an enemy at liberty for the sake of his ransom some compensation should be made to his country whom his act might be supposed to injure. There was some plausibility in this, and the army of Manlius might have felt also some jealousy at the better fortune of their comrades, and might have known that their own general would not, like C. Marcius, give up to them the full benefit of such plunder as they might acquire from the Etruscans.</q> &mdash;<bibl>Arnold's History of Rome, II. 78-9.</bibl></note>As the money raised under this law would be a handsome addition to the exhausted treasury, the senate confirmed
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> it. The tribunes of the plebs, however, looking not so much to the law as to the precedent set, made it a capital offence for any one to convene the Assembly outside their usual place of meeting. If it were once legalised, there was nothing, however injurious to the people, which could not be carried through men who were bound by the oath of military
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> obedience.</p> <p>In this year C. Licinius Stolo was impeached by M. Popilius Laenas for having violated his own law; he and his son together occupied a thousand <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign> of land, and he had emancipated his son in order to evade the law. He was condemned to pay a fine of 10,000 <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new consuls were M. Fabius Ambustus and M. Popilius Laenas, each for the second time. They had two wars on hand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The one which Laenas waged against the Tiburtines presented little difficulty; after driving them into their city he ravaged their fields. The other consul, who was operating against the Faliscans and Tarquinians, met with a defeat in the first battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> What mainly contributed to it and produced a real terror amongst the Romans was the extraordinary spectacle presented by their priests who, brandishing lighted torches and with what looked like snakes entwined in their hair, came on like so many Furies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At this sight the Romans were like men distraught or thunderstruck and rushed in a panic-stricken mass into their entrenchments. The consul and his staff officers and the military tribunes laughed at them and scolded them for being terrified by conjuring tricks like a lot of boys.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Stung by a feeling of shame, they suddenly passed from a state of terror to one of reckless daring, and they rushed like blind men against what they had just fled from. When, after scattering the idle pageantry of the enemy, they got at the armed men behind, they routed the entire army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The same day they gained possession of the camp, and after securing an immense amount of booty returned home flushed with victory, jesting as soldiers do, and deriding the enemy's contrivance and their own panic.</p> <p>This led to a rising of the whole of Etruria, and under the leadership of the Tarquinians and Faliscans they marched to the salt-works.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In this emergency C. Marcius Rutilus was nominated Dictator &mdash;the first Dictator nominated from the plebs &mdash;and he appointed as Master of the Horse C. Plautius, also a plebeian. The patricians were indignant at even the dictatorship becoming common property, and they offered all the resistance in their power to any decree being passed or any preparations made to help the Dictator in prosecuting that war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This only made the people more ready to adopt every proposal which the Dictator made.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On leaving the City he marched along both banks of the Tiber, ferrying the troops across in whichever direction the enemy were reported to be; in this way he surprised many of the raiders scattered about the fields. Finally he surprised and captured their camp; 8ooo prisoners were taken, the rest were either killed or hunted out of the Roman territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> By an order of the people which was not confirmed by the senate a triumph was awarded him.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>As the senate would not have the elections conducted by a plebeian Dictator or a plebeian consul, they fell back on an interregnum. There was a succession of interreges &mdash;Q. Servilius Ahala, M. Fabius, Cn. Manlius, C. Fabius, C. Sulpicius, L. Aemilius, Q. Servilius, and M. Fabius Ambustus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> In the second of these interregna a contest arose because two patrician consuls were elected. When the tribunes interposed their veto and appealed to the Licinian Law, Fabius, the interrex, said that it was laid down in the Twelve Tables that whatever was the last order that the people made that should have the force of law, and the people had made an order by electing the two consuls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The tribunes' veto only availed to postpone the elections, and ultimately two patrician consuls were elected, namely C. Sulpicius Peticus (for the third time) and M. Valerius Publicola. They entered upon their office the day they were elected.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So in the 4ooth year from the foundation of the City and the 35th after its capture by the Gauls, the second consulship was wrested from the plebs, for the first time since the passing of the Licinian Law seven years previously.</p> <p>Empulum was taken this year from the Tiburtines without any serious fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It seems uncertain whether both consuls held joint command in this campaign, as some writers assert, or whether the fields of the Tarquinians were ravaged by Sulpicius at the same time that Valerius was leading his legions against the Tiburtines.</p> <p>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Contest over the Consulship.</note> consuls had a more serious conflict at home with the plebs and their tribunes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They considered it as a question not only of courage but of honour and loyalty to their order that as two patricians had received the consulship so they should hand it on to two patricians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They felt that they must either renounce all claims to it, if it became a plebeian magistracy, or they must keep it in its entirety as a possession which they had received in its entirety from their fathers.</p> <p>The plebs protested:<q direct="unspecified">What were they living for?
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Why were they enrolled as citizens if they could not with their united strength maintain the right to what had been won for them by the courage of those two men, L. Sextius and C. Licinius?
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It were better to put up with kings or decemvirs or any other form of absolutism, even though with
							<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> a worse name, than to see both consuls patricians, the other side not alternately governing and being governed but regarding itself as placed in perpetual authority, and looking upon the plebs as simply born to be their slaves.</q></p> <p>There was no lack of tribunes to lead the agitation, but in such a state of universal excitement everybody was his own leader.
								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After many fruitless journeys to the Campus Martius, where numerous election days had been wasted in disturbances, the plebs was at last worsted by the steady persistence of the consuls.
								<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> There was such a feeling of despair that the tribunes, followed by a gloomy and sullen plebs, exclaimed as they left the Campus that there was an end to all liberty, and that they must not only quit the Campus but must even abandon the City now that it was crushed and enslaved by the tyranny of the patricians.
								<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consuls, though deserted by the majority of the people, only a few voters remaining behind, proceeded none the less determinedly with the election. Both the consuls elected were patricians, M. Fabius Ambustus (for the third time) and T Quinctius. In some of the annalists I find M. Popilius given as consul instead of T. Quinctius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Etruscans</note>. Two wars were brought to a successful close this year. The Tiburtines were reduced to submission; the city of Sassula was taken from them and all their other towns would have shared the same fate had not the nation as a whole laid down their arms and made peace with the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A triumph was celebrated over them, otherwise the victory was followed by mild treatment of the vanquished. The Tarquinians were visited with the utmost severity. A large number were killed in battle; of the prisoners, all those of noble birth to the number of 358 were sent to Rome, the rest were put to the sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Those who had been sent to Rome met with no gentler treatment from the people, they were all scourged and beheaded in the middle of the Forum This punishment was an act of retribution for the Romans who had been immolated in the forum of Tarquinii.</p> <p>These successes in war induced the Samnites to ask for a league of friendship.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Their envoys received a favourable reply from the senate and a treaty of alliance was concluded with them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The plebs did not enjoy the same good fortune at home which they had met with in the field. In spite of the reduction in the rate of interest, which was now fixed at 8 and 1/3 per cent., the poor were unable to repay the capital, and were being made over to their creditors. Their personal distress left them little thought for public affairs and political struggles, elections, and patrician consuls; both consulships accordingly remained with the patricians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The consuls elected were C. Sulpicius Peticus (for the fourth time) and M. Valerius Publicola (for the second).</p> <p>Rumours were brought that the people of Caere, out of sympathy with their co-nationalists, had sided with the Tarquinians. Whilst the minds of the citizens were in consequence filled with apprehensions of a war with Etruria, the arrival of envoys from Latium diverted their thoughts to the Volscians. They reported that an army had been raised and equipped and was now threatening their frontiers and intended to enter and ravage the Roman territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The senate thought that neither of these movements ought to be ignored; orders were issued for troops to be enrolled for both wars; the consuls were to draw lots for their respective commands.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The arrival of despatches from the consul Sulpicius made the Etruscan war appear the more serious of the two. He was directing the operations against Tarquinii, and reported that the country round the Roman salt-works had been raided and a portion of the plunder sent to Caere, some of whose men had undoubtedly been amongst the depredators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul Valerius, who was acting against the Volscians and had his camp on the frontiers of Tusculum, was recalled and received orders from the senate to nominate a Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Titus, the son of Lucius Manlius, was nominated, and he named A. Cornelius Cossus as Master of the Horse. Finding the army which the consul had commanded sufficient for his purpose, he was authorised by the senate and the people to formally declare war upon the Caerites.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Submission of Caere.</note> would seem as though this formal declaration of war brought home to the Caerites the horrors of a war with Rome more clearly than the action of those who had provoked the Romans by their depredations. They realised how unequal their strength was to such a conflict; they bitterly regretted the raid, and cursed the Tarquinians who had instigated them to revolt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> No one made any preparation for war, but each did his utmost to urge the despatch of an embassy to Rome to beg pardon for their offence. When the deputation came before the senate they were referred by the senate to the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They besought the gods whose sacred things they had taken charge of and made due provision for in the Gaulish war <note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed">The incident is recorded in Vol. I. pp. 335-6.</note> that the Romans in their day of prosperity might feel the same pity for them that they had shown for Rome in her hour of distress. Then turning to the temple of Vesta they invoked the bond of hospitality which they formed in all purity and reverence with the Flamens and the
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Vestals. <q direct="unspecified">Could any one believe,</q> they asked, <q direct="unspecified">that men who had rendered such services would all of a sudden, without any reason, have become enemies, or if they had been guilty of any hostile act that they had committed it deliberately rather than in a fit of
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> madness? Was it possible that they could, by inflicting fresh injuries, obliterate their old acts of kindness, especially when they had been conferred on those who were so grateful for them; or that they would make an enemy of the Roman people now that it was prosperous and successful in all its wars after having sought its friendship at a time when it was in trouble and adversity? That should not be described as deliberate purpose which ought to be called violence and
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> constraint. After simply asking for a free passage, the Tarquinians traversed their territory in hostile array and compelled some of their country-fold to accompany them in that predatory expedition for which the city of Caere was now held
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> responsible. If it was decided that these men must be surrendered, they would surrender them, if they must be punished, punished they should be. Caere, once the sanctuary of Rome, the shelter of her sacred things, ought to be declared innocent of any thought of war, and acquitted of any charge of hostile intentions in return for her hospitality to the Vestals and her devotion to the
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> gods.</q></p> <p>Old memories rather than the actual circumstances of the case so wrought upon the people that they thought less of the present grievance than of the former kindness. Peace was accordingly granted to the people of Caere, and it was agreed to leave to the senate the question of a truce for 100
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> years.</p> <p>The Faliscans were implicated in the same charge and the war was diverted to them, but the enemy was nowhere to ho found in the open. Their territory was ravaged from end to end, but no attempt was made against their cities.</p> <p>After the return of the legions, the rest of the year was spent in repairing the walls and towers. The temple of Apollo was also dedicated.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Financial Reforms</note>. &mdash;At the close of the year the consular elections were put off owing to the quarrel between the two orders &mdash;the tribunes declared that they would not permit the elections to be held unless they were conducted in accordance with the Licinian Law, whilst the Dictator was determined to abolish the consulship altogether rather than make it the common property of plebeians and patricians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The elections were still postponed when the Dictator resigned office; so matters reverted to an interregnum. The interreges declined to hold the elections in consequence of the hostile attitude of the plebs, and the contest went on till the eleventh interregnum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Whilst the tribunes were sheltering themselves behind the Licinian Law and fighting the political battle, the plebs felt their most pressing grievance to be the steadily growing burden of debt; the personal question quite overshadowed the political controversy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Wearied out with the prolonged agitation the senate ordered L. Cornelius Scipio, the interrex, to restore harmony to the State by conducting the consular elections in accordance with the Licinian Law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> P. Valerius Publicola was elected and C. Marcius Rutilus was his plebeian colleague.</p><p>Now that there was a general desire for concord, the new consuls took up the financial question which was the one hin- drance to union.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The State assumed the responsibility for the liquidation of the debts, and five commissioners were appointed, who were charged with the management of the money and were hence called <foreign lang="la">mensarii</foreign> (=<q direct="unspecified">bankers</q>). The impartiality and diligence with which these commissioners discharged their functions make them worthy of an honourable place in every historical record. Their names were: C. Duilius, Publius Decius Mus, M. Papirius, Q. Publilius, and T. Aemilius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The task they undertook was a difficult one, and involved hardship generally to both sides; on one side, at any rate, it always pressed heavily; but they carried it out with great consideration for all parties, and whilst incurring a large outlay on the part of the State they did not involve it in loss.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Seated at tables in the Forum, they dealt with long-standing debts due to the slackness of the debtor more than to his want of means, either by advancing public money on proper security, or by making a fair valuation of his property.<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified">It appears that one cause of the prevailing distress was the scarcity of the circulating medium. A debtor, therefore, even though he possessed property in land, might yet be practically insolvent, inasmuch as he could not, except at an enormous loss, convert his land into money. Here therefore the five commissioners interposed; they furnished the debtor with ready money, when he had any property to offer as a security, or any friend who would be security for him: and they ordered that land and cattle should be received in payment at a certain valuation. In this manner much property which had hitherto been unavailable was brought into circulation, land and cattle became legal tender at a certain fixed rate of value; and thus a great amount of debt was liquidated, and, as Livy adds, to the satisfaction of the creditor as well as of the debtor.</q> &mdash;<bibl>Arnold, ibid. p. 73.</bibl></note> In this way an immense amount of debt was cleared off without any injustice or even complaints on either side.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Owing to a report that the twelve cities of Etruria had formed a hostile league, a good deal of alarm was felt, which subsequently proved to be groundless, and it was thought necessary that a Dictator should be nominated. This took place in camp, for it was there that the consuls received the senatorial decree. C. Julius was nominated and L. Aemilius was assigned to him as Master of the Horse.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Abroad,<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Renewed Conflicts over the Magistracies.</note> however, everything was tranquil. At home, owing to the Dictator's attempt to secure the election of patricians to both consulships, matters were brought to an interregnum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were two interreges, C. Sulpicius and M. Fabius, and they succeeded where the Dictator had failed, as the plebs, owing to the pecuniary relief recently granted them, were in a less aggressive mood..
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Both consuls elected were patricians &mdash;C. Sulpicius Peticus, who had been the first of the two interreges, and T Quinctius Pennus, some give as his third name Caeso, others Gaius.</p><p>They both proceeded to war; Quinctius against Falerii, Sulpicius against Tarquinii.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The enemy nowhere faced them in open battle; the war was carried on against fields rather than against men; burning and destroying went on everywhere.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This waste and decay, like that of a slow decline, wore down the resolution of the two peoples, and they asked for a truce first from the consuls then by their permission from the senate. They obtained one for forty years.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After the anxiety created by these two threatening wars was in this way allayed, there was a respite for a time from arms. The liquidation of the debts had in the case of many properties led to a change of ownership, and it was decided that a fresh assessment should be made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When, however, notice was given of the election of censors, C. Marcius Rutilus, who had been the first Dictator nominated from the plebs, announced that he was a candidate for the censorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> This upset the good feeling between the two orders. He took this step at what looked like an unfavourable moment because both consuls happened to be patricians, and they declared that they would allow no vote for him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But he resolutely held to his purpose, and the tribunes, anxious to recover the rights of the plebs which were lost in the consular elections, assisted him to the utmost of their power. There was no dignity which the greatness of his character was unequal to supporting, and the plebs were desirous of being called to share the censorship by the same man who had opened up the path to the dictatorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> There was no division of opinion shown in the elections, Marcius was unanimously elected censor, together with Manlius Gnaeus.</p> <p>This year also saw M. Fabius as Dictator, not from any apprehension of war but to prevent the Licinian Law from being observed in the consular elections.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Dictatorship, however, did not make the combined efforts of the senate more influential in the election of consuls than it had been in the election of censors.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>M.<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Defeat of the Gauls.</note> Popilius Laenas was the consul elected from the plebs, L. Cornelius Scipio the one from the patricians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fortune conferred the greater distinction upon the plebeian consul, for upon the receipt of information that an immense army of Gauls had encamped in the territory of Latium, the conduct of tbat war, owing to Scipio's serious illness at the time, was entrusted by special arrangement to Popilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He promptly raised an army, and ordered all who were liable for active service to meet under arms outside the Capene Gate at the temple of Mars; the quaestors were ordered to carry the standards from the treasury to the same place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> After bringing up four legions to full strength, he handed over the rest of the troops to P. Valerius Publicola, the praetor, and advised the senate to raise a second army to protect the republic against any emergency.</p> <p>When all preparations were completed and everything in readiness, he advanced towards the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> With the view of ascertaining their strength before testing it in a decisive action, he seized some rising ground as near to the camp of the Gauls as possible and began to construct the rampart.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the Gauls saw the Roman standards in the distance they formed their line, prepared, with their usual impulsiveness and instinctive love of fighting, to engage at once. Observing, however, that the Romans did not come down into the plain and were trusting to the protection of their position and their rampart, they imagined that they were smitten with fear, and at the same time would be more open to attack whilst they were occupied in the work of entrenchment. So raising a wild shout they advanced to the attack.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign>, who formed the working party, were not interrupted, for they were screened by the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="ed">for the explanation of these terms see Book VIII. chap. viii.</note> who were posted in front and who began the fighting.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Their steady courage was aided by the fact that they were on higher ground, for the <foreign lang="la">pila</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">hastae</foreign> were not thrown ineffectively as often happens on level ground, but being carried forward by their weight they reached their mark.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Gauls were borne down by the weight of the missiles which either pierced their bodies or stuck in their shields, making them extremely heavy to carry. They had almost reached the top of the hill in their charge when they halted, uncertain what to do.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The mere delay raised the courage of the Romans and depressed that of the enemy. Then the Roman line swept down upon them and forced them back; they fell over each other and caused a greater loss in this way than that inflicted by the enemy; so headlong was their flight that more were crushed to death than were slain by the sword.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But the victory was not yet decided. When the Romans reached the level ground another mass remained to be dealt with.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The number of the Gauls was great enough to prevent them from feeling the loss already sustained, and as though a new army had risen from the earth, fresh troops were brought up against their victorious enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Romans checked their onset and stood still, for not only had they, wearied as they were, to sustain a second fight, but the consul, while riding incautiously in the front, had his left shoulder almost run through by a heavy javelin and had retired.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The victory was all but forfeited by this delay, when the consul, after his wound was bound up, rode back to the front. <q direct="unspecified">Why are you standing still, soldiers?</q> he exclaimed. <q direct="unspecified">You have not to do with Latins or Sabines whom, after you have defeated, you can make into allies, it is against wild beasts that we have drawn the sword; we must either drain their blood or give them ours.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> You have repulsed them from your camp, you have driven them headlong down into the valley, you are standing over the prostrate bodies of your foes. Fill the valley with the same carnage with which you filled the mountain side.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Do not look for them to flee while you are standing here; the standards must go forward, you must advance against the enemy.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus encouraged they made a fresh charge, dislodged the front companies of the Gauls, and closing up their maniples into a wedge penetrated the enemy's centre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then the barbarians were broken up, and having no leadership or definite orders they turned the attack on to their own reserves. They were scattered over the plain, and their headlong flight carried them past their camp in the direction of the Alba hills. As the hill on which the old Alban stronghold stood appeared to be the highest in the range, they made for it</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The consul did not continue the pursuit beyond the camp as his wound was troublesome and he did not wish to risk an attack upon hills held by the enemy. All the spoil of the camp was given up to the soldiers, and he led back to Rome an army flushed with victory and enriched by the plunder of the Gauls, but owing to his wound his triumph was delayed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>As both consuls were on the sick list, the senate found it necessary to appoint a Dictator to conduct the elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> L. Furius Camillus was nominated, and P. Cornelius Scipio was associated with him as Master of the Horse. He restored to the patricians their old monopoly of the consulship, and for this service he was through their enthusiastic support elected consul, and he procured the election of Appius Claudius Crassus as his colleague.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Gaulish Marauders and Greek Pirates</note>. &mdash;Before the new consuls entered upon their office Popilius celebrated his triumph over the Gauls amidst the delighted applause of the plebs, and people asked each other with bated breath whether there was any one who regretted the election of a plebeian consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> At the same time they were very bitter against the Dictator for having seized the consulship as a bribe for his treating the Licinian Law with contempt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They considered that he had degraded the consulship more by his greedy ambition than by his acting against the public interest, since he had actually procured his own election as consul whilst he was Dictator.</p> <p>The year was marked by numerous disturbances. The Gauls came down from the hills of Alba because they could not stand the severity of the winter, and they spread themselves in plundering hordes over the plains and the maritime districts.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The sea was infested by fleets of Greek pirates who made descents on the coast round Antium and Laurentum and entered the mouth of the Tiber. On one occasion the searobbers and the land-robbers encountered one another in a hard-fought battle, and drew off, the Gauls to their camp, the Greeks to their ships, neither side knowing whether they were to consider themselves victors or vanquished.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>These various alarms were followed by a much more serious one. The Latins had received a demand from the Roman government to furnish troops, and after discussing the matter in their national council replied in these uncompromising terms: <q direct="unspecified">Desist from making demands on those whose help you need;

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> With two foreign wars on their hands and this revolt of their allies, the anxious senate saw that they would have to restrain by fear those who were not restrained by any considerations of honour. They ordered the consuls to exert their authority to the utmost in levying troops, since, as the body of their allies were deserting them, they would have to depend upon their fellow-citizens entirely.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Men were enlisted everywhere, not only from the City but also from the country districts. It is stated that ten legions were enrolled, each containing 4200 foot and 300 horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In these days the strength of Rome, for which the world hardly finds room, would even, if concentrated, find it difficult on any sudden alarm to raise a fresh army of that size; to such an extent have we progressed in those things to which alone we devote our efforts-wealth and luxury.</p><p>Amongst the other mournful events of this year was the death of the second consul, Ap. Claudius, which occurred while the preparations for war were going on.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The government passed into the hands of Camillus, as sole consul, and the senate did not think it well for a Dictator to be appointed, either because of the auspicious omen of his name in view of trouble with the Gauls, or because they would not place a man of his distinction under a Dictator.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Leaving two legions to protect the City, the consul divided the remaining eight between himself and L. Pinarius, the praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He kept the conduct of the war against the Gauls in his own hands instead of deciding upon the field of operations by the usual drawing of lots, inspired as he was by the memory of his father's brilliant successes. The praetor was to protect the coast-line and prevent the Greeks from effecting a landing, whilst he himself marched down into the Pomptine territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> His intention was to avoid any engagement in the flat country unless he was forced to fight, and to confine himself to checking their depredations; for as it was only by pillaging that they were able to maintain themselves, he thought that he could best crush them in this way. Accordingly he selected suitable ground for a stationary camp.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Marcus Valerius Corvus &mdash;Defeat of the Gauls.</note> the Romans were passing their time quietly at the outposts, a gigantic Gaul in splendid armour advanced towards them, and delivered a challenge through an interpreter to meet any Roman in single
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> combat. There was a young military tribune, named Marcus Valerius, who considered himself no less worthy of that honour than T. Manlius had been. After obtaining the consul's permission, he marched, completely armed, into the open ground between the two
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> armies. The human element in the fight was thrown into the shade by the direct interposition of the gods, for just as they were engaging a crow settled all of a sudden on the Roman's helmet with its head towards his
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> antagonist. The tribune gladly accepted this as a divinely-sent augury, and prayed that whether it were god or goddess who had sent the auspicious bird that deity would be gracious to him and help
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> him. Wonderful to relate, not only did the bird keep its place on the helmet, but every time they encountered it rose on its wings and attacked the Gaul's face and eyes with beak and talon, until, terrified at the sight of so dire a portent and bewildered in eyes and mind alike, he was slain by Valerius. Then, soaring away eastwards, the crow passed out of
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> sight. Hitherto the outposts on both sales had remained quiet, but when the tribune began to despoil his foeman's corpse, the Gauls no longer kept their posts, whilst the Romans ran still more swiftly to help the victor. A furious fight took place round the body as it lay, and not only the maniples at the nearest outposts but the legions pouring out from the camp joined in the
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> fray. The soldiers were exultant at their tribune's victory and at the manifest presence and help of the gods, and as Camillus ordered them into action he pointed to the tribune, conspicuous with his spoils, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Follow his example, soldiers, and lay the Gauls in heaps round their fallen
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> champion!</q> Gods and man alike took part in the battle, and it was fought out to a finish, unmistakably disastrous to the Gauls, so completely had each army anticipated a result corresponding to that of the single combat. Those Gauls who began the fight fought desperately, but the rest of the host who come to help them turned back before they came within range of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> missiles. They dispersed amongst the Volscians and over the Falernian district; from thence they made their way to Apulia and the western sea.</p> <p>The consul mustered his troops on parade, and after praising the conduct of the tribune presented him with ten oxen and a golden
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> chaplet. In consequence of instructions received from the senate he took over the maritime war and joined his forces with those of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> praetor. The Greeks were too lacking in courage to run the risk of a general engagement, and there was every prospect of the war proving a long
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> one. Camillus was in consequence authorised by the senate to nominate T. Manlius Torquatus as Dictator for the purpose of conducting the elections. After appointing A. Cornelius Cossus as Master of the Horse, the Dictator proceeded to hold the consular elections. Marcus Valerius <emph>Corvus</emph> (for that was henceforth his cognomen), a young man of twenty-three, was declared to be duly elected amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> people. His colleague was the plebeian, M. Popilius Laenas, now elected for the fourth time.</p> <p>Nothing worth recording took place between Camillus and the Greeks; they were no fighters on land and the Romans could not fight on the
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> sea. Ultimately, as they were prevented from landing anywhere and water and the other necessaries of life failed them, they abandoned
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Italy. To what Greek state or nationality that fleet belonged is a matter of uncertainty; I think it most likely that it belonged to the Tyrant of Sicily, for Greece itself was at that time exhausted by intestine wars and was watching with dread the growing power of Macedonia.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the armies were disbanded there was an interval of peace abroad and harmony between the two orders at home. To prevent things, however, from becoming too pleasant, a pestilence attacked the citizens, and the senate found themselves under the necessity of issuing an order to the decemvirs requiring them to consult the Sibylline Books.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On their advice a <foreign lang="la">lectisternium</foreign> was held.</p> <p>In this year colonists from Antium rebuilt Satricum, which had been destroyed by the Latins, and settled there. A treaty was concluded between Rome and Carthage; the latter city had sent envoys to ask for a friendly alliance.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As long as the succeeding consuls &mdash;T. Manlius Torquatus and C. Plautius-held office the same peaceful conditions prevailed. The rate of interest was reduced by one half and payment of the principal was to be made in four equal installments, the first at once, the remainder in three successive years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Though many plebeians were still in distress, the senate looked upon the maintenance of public credit as more important than the removal of individual hardships. What afforded the greatest relief was the suspension of military service and the war-tax.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Three years after Satricum had been rebuilt by the Volscians, whilst M. Vaierius Corvus was consul for the second time with Caius Poetilius, a report was sent on from Latium that emissaries from Antium were going round the Latin cantons with the view of stirring war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Valerius was instructed to attack the Volscians before the enemy became more numerous, and he proceeded with his army to Satricum.</p> <p>Defeat of the Volscians and Destruction of Satricum. &mdash;Here he was met by the Antiates and other Volscian troops who had been previously mobilised in case of any movement on the sale of Rome. The old standing hatred between the two nations made each side eager for battle; there was consequently no delay in trying conclusions.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Volscians, bolder to begin war than to sustain it, were completely defeated and fled precipitately to Satricum. The city was surrounded, and as it was on the point of being stormed &mdash;the scaling ladders were against the walls &mdash;they lost all hope and surrendered to the number of 4000 fighting men in addition to a multitude of noncombatants.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The town was sacked and burnt; the temple of Matuta the Mother was alone spared by the flames; all the plunder was given to the soldiers. In addition to the booty, there were the 4000 who had surrendered; these were marched in chains before the consul's chariot in his triumphal procession, then they were sold and a large sum was realised for the treasury.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some authors assert that these prisoners were slaves who had been captured in Satricum, and this is more likely to have been the case than that men who had surrendered should have been sold.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>M. Fabius Dorsuo and Ser. Sulpicius Camerinus were the next consuls. A sudden raid by the Auruncans led to a war with that people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fears were entertained that more than one city was concerned in this, that in fact it had been planned by the entire Latin League. To meet all Latium in arms L. Furius Camillus was nominated Dictator; he appointed Cnaeus Manlius Capitolinus Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As usual in great and sudden alarms a suspension of all business was proclaimed and the enlistment was made without any claims to exemption being allowed; when it was completed the legions were marched as rapidly as possible against the Auruncans. They showed the temper of marauders rather than of soldiers, and the war was finished in the very first battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But as they had begun the war without any provocation and had shown no reluctance to accept battle, the Dictator thought it his duty to secure the help of the gods, and during the actual fighting he vowed a temple to Juno Moneta. On his victorious return to Rome, he resigned his Dictatorship to discharge his vow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate ordered two commissioners to be appointed to carry out the construction of that temple in a style commensurate with the greatness of the Roman people, and a site was marked out in the Citadel where the house of M. Manlius Capitolinus had stood.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The consuls employed the Dictator's army in war with the Volscians and took from them by a <foreign lang="fr">coup-de-main</foreign> the city of Sora.</p><p>The temple of Moneta was dedicated in the following year, when C. Marcius Rutilus was consul for the third time and T. Manlius Torquatus for the second.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A portent followed close on the dedication similar to the old portent on the Alban Mount; a shower of stones fell and night seemed to stretch its curtain over the day. The citizens were filled with dread at this supernatural occurrence, and after the Sibylline Books had been consulted the senate decided upon the appointment of a Dictator to arrange the ceremonial observances for the appointed days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> P. Valerius Publicola was nominated and Q. Fabius Ambustus was appointed Master of the Horse. It was arranged that not only the Roman tribes but also the neighbouring populations should take part in the public intercessions, and the order of the days which each was to observe was definitely laid down.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>There were prosecutions this year of moneylenders by the aediles, and heavy sentences are stated to have been passed on them by the people. For some reason, which is not recorded, matters reverted to an interregnum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As, however, it ended in the election of two patrician consuls, this would appear to be the reason why it was resorted to. The new consuls were M. Valerius Corvus (for the third time) and A. Cornelius Cossus.</p>

To this we may add Dr. Arnold's remarks in his note 34 on p. 112, vol. II., <q direct="unspecified">Every step in the Samnite and Latin wars has been so disguised by the Roman annalists, that a probable narrative of these events can only be given by a free correction of their falsifications.</q></note> &mdash;The history will now be occupied with wars greater than any previously recorded; greater whether we consider the forces en gaged in them or the length of time they lasted, or the extent of country over which they were waged. For it was in this year (<date value="-343">343</date> B.C.) that hostilities commenced with the SAMNITES, a people strong in material resources and military
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> power. Our war with the Samnites, with its varying fortunes, was followed by the war with Pyrrhus, and that again by the war with Carthage. What a chapter of great events! How often had we to pass through the very extremity of danger in order that our dominion might be exalted to its present greatness, a greatness which is with difficulty
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> maintained!</p><p>The cause of the war between the Romans and the Samnites, who had been our friends and allies, came, however, from without; it did not arise between the two peoples
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> themselves. The Samnites, simply because they were the stronger, made an unprovoked attack upon the Sidicines; the weaker side were compelled to fly for succour to those who were more powerful and threw in their lot with the
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Campanians. The Campanians brought to the help of their allies the prestige of their name rather than actual strength; enervated by luxury they were worsted by a people inured to the use of arms, and after being defeated on Sidicine territory diverted the whole weight of the war against
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> themselves. The Samnites, dropping operations against the Sidicines, attacked the Campanians as being the mainstay and stronghold of their neighbours; they saw, too, that whilst victory would be just as easily won here, it would bring more glory and spoils. They seized the Tifata hills which overlook Capua and left a strong force to hold them, then they descended in close order into the plain which lies between the Tifata hills and
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Capua. Here a second battle took place, in which the Campanians were defeated and driven within their walls. They had lost the flower of their army, and as there was no hope of any assistance near, they found themselves compelled to ask for help from Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Appeal of the Campanians.</note> being admitted to an audience, their envoys addressed the senate to the following effect: <q direct="unspecified">Senators! the people of Capua have sent us as ambassadors to you to ask for a friendship which shall be perpetual, and for help for the present hour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Had we sought this friendship in the day of our prosperity it might have been cemented more readily, but at the same time by a weaker bond. For in that case, remembering that we had formed our friendship on equal terms, we should perhaps have been as close friends as now, but we should have been less prepared to accept your mandates, less at your mercy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Whereas now, won over by your compassion and defended in our extremity by your aid, we should be bound to cherish the kindness bestowed on us if we are not to appear ungrateful and undeserving of any help from either gods or man.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I certainly do not consider that the fact of the Samnites having already become your friends and allies should be a bar to our being admitted into your friendship; it only shows that they take precedence of us in the priority and degree of the honour which you have conferred upon them. There is nothing in your treaty with them to prevent you from making fresh treaties.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It has always been held amongst you to be a satisfactory reason for friendship, when he who made advances to you was anxious to be your friend.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although our present circumstances forbid us to speak proudly about ourselves, still we Campanians are second to no people, save yourselves, in the size of our city and the fertility of our soil, and we shall bring, I consider, no small accession to your prosperity by entering into your friendship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whenever the Aequi and Volscians, the perpetual enemies of this City, make any hostile movement we shall be on their rear, and what you lead the way in doing on behalf of our safety, that we shall always continue to do on behalf of your dominion and your glory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When these nations which lie between us are subjugated &mdash;and your courage and fortune are a guarantee that this will soon come about &mdash; you will have an unbroken dominion up to our frontier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Painful and humiliating is the confession which our fortunes compel us to make; but it has come to this, senators, we Campanians must be numbered either amongst your friends or your enemies. If you defend us we are yours, if you abandon us we shall belong to the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Make up your minds, then, whether you would prefer that Capua and the whole of Campania should form an addition to your strength or
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> should augment the power of the Samnites It is only right, Romans, that your sympathy and help should be extended to all, but especially should it be so to those who, when others appealed to them, tried to help them beyond their strength and so have brought themselves into these dire straits.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Although it was ostensibly on behalf of the Sidicines that we fought, we really fought for our own liberty, for we saw our neighbours falling victims to the nefarious brigandage of the Samnites, and we knew that when the Sidicines had been consumed the fire would sweep on to us.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Samnites are not coming to attack us because we have in any way wronged them, but because they have gladly seized upon a pretext for war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Why, if they only sought retribution and were not catching at an opportunity for satisfying their greed, ought it not to be enough for them that our legions have fallen on Sidicine territory and a second time in Campania itself?
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Where do we find resentment so bitter that the blood shed in two battles cannot satiate it? Then think of the destruction wrought in our fields, the men and cattle carried off, the burning and ruining of our farms, everything devastated with fire and sword &mdash;cannot all this appease their rage? No, they must satisfy their greed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> It is this that is hurrying them on to the storm of Capua; they are bent on either destroying that fairest of cities or making it their own. But you, Romans, should make it your own by kindness, rather than allow them to possess it as the reward of iniquity.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/><q direct="unspecified">I am not speaking in the presence of a nation that refuses to go to war when war is righteous, but even so, I believe if you make it clear that you will help us you will not find it necessary to go to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The contempt which the Samnites feel for their neighbours extends to us, it does not mount any higher; the shadow of your help therefore is enough to protect us, and we shall regard whatever we have, whatever we are, as wholly yours.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> For you the Campanian soil shall be tilled, for you the city of Capua shall be thronged; you we shall regard as our founders, our parents, yes, even as gods; there is not a single one amongst your colonies that will surpass us in devotion and loyalty towards you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Be gracious, senators, to our prayers and manifest your divine will and power on behalf of the Campanians, and bid them entertain a certain hope that Capua will be safe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> With what a vast crowd made up of every class, think you, did we start from the gates? How full of tears and prayers did we leave all behind. In what a state of expectancy are the senate and people of Capua, our wives and children, now living!
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> I am quite certain that the whole population is standing at the gates, watching the road which leads from here, in anxious suspense as to what reply you are ordering us to carry back to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> The one answer will bring them safety, victory, light, and liberty; the other &mdash;I dare not say what that might bring. Deliberate then upon our fate, as that of men who are either going to be your friends and allies, or to have no existence anywhere.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the envoys had withdrawn, the senate proceeded to discuss the question. Many of the members realised how the largest and richest city in Italy, with a very productive country near the sea, could become the granary of Rome, and supply every variety of provision.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Notwithstanding, however, loyalty to treaties outweighed even these great advantages, and the consul was authorised by the senate to give the following reply: <q direct="unspecified">The senate is of opinion, Campanians, that you are worthy of our aid, but justice demands that friendship with you shall be established on such a footing that no older friendship and alliance is thereby impaired. Therefore we refuse to employ on your behalf against the Samnites arms which would offend the gods sooner than they injured men. We shall, as is just and right, send an embassy to our allies and friends to ask that no hostile violence be offered you.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thereupon the leader of the embassy, acting according to the instructions they had brought with them, said: <q direct="unspecified">Even though you are not willing to make a just use of force against brute force and injustice in defence of what belongs to us, you will at all events defend what belongs to you. Wherefore we now place under your sway and jurisdiction, senators, and that of the Roman people, the people of Campania and the city of Capua, its fields, its sacred temples, all things human and divine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Henceforth we are prepared to suffer what we may have to suffer as men who have surrendered themselves into your hands.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At these words they all burst into tears and stretching out their hands towards the consul they prostrated themselves on the floor of the vestibule.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The senators were deeply moved by this instance of the vicissitudes of human fortune, where a people abounding in wealth, famous for their pride and luxuriousness, and from whom, shortly before, their neighbours had sought assistance, were now so broken in spirit that they put themselves and all that belonged to them under the power and authority of others.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It at once became a matter of honour that men who had formally surrendered themselves should not be left to their fate, and it was resolved <q direct="unspecified">that the Samnite nation would commit a wrongful act if they attacked a city and territory which had by surrender become the possession of Rome.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>They determined to lose no time in despatching envoys to the Samnites. Their instructions were to lay before them the request of the Campanians, the reply which the senate, mindful of their friendly relations with the Samnites, had given, and lastly the surrender which had been made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They were to request the Samnites, in virtue of the friendship and alliance which existed between them, to spare those who had made a surrender of themselves and to take no hostile action against that territory which had become the possession of the Roman people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> If these mild remonstrances proved ineffective, they were to solemnly warn the Samnites in the name of the senate and people of Rome to keep their hands off the city of Capua and the territory of Campania.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Samnites Defiant &mdash;War Declared.</note> envoys delivered their instructions in the national council of Samnium. The reply they received was couched in such defiant terms that not only did the Samnites declare their intention of pursuing the war against Capua, but their magistrates went outside the council chamber and, in tones loud
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> enough for the envoys to bear, ordered the prefects of cohorts to march at once into the Campanian territory and ravage it.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the result of this mission was reported in Rome, all other matters were at once laid aside and the <foreign lang="la">fetials</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="ed">see note 34 to Book IV. Vol. I.</note> were sent to demand redress. This was refused and the senate decreed that a formal declaration of war should be submitted for the approval of the people as soon as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The people ratified the action of the senate and ordered the two consuls to start, each with his army; Valerius for Campania, where he fixed his camp at Mount Glaurus, whilst Cornelius advanced into Samnium and encamped at Saticula.</p> <p><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Battle of Mount Glaurus</note>. &mdash;Valerius was the first to come into touch with the Samnite legions.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had marched into Campania because they thought that this would be the main theatre of war, and they were burning to wreak their rage on the Campanians who had been so ready first to help others against them and then to summon help for themselves.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As soon as they saw the Roman camp, they one and all clamoured for the signal for battle to be given by their leaders; they declared that the Romans would have the same luck in helping the Campanians that the Campanians had had in helping the Sidicines.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For a few days Valerius confined himself to skirmishes, with the object of testing the enemy's strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At length he put out the signal for battle and spoke a few words of encouragement to his men. He told them not to let themselves be daunted by a new war or a new enemy, for the further they carried their arms from the City the more unwarlike were the nations whom they approached.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were not to measure the courage of the Samnites by the defeats they had inflicted on the Sidicines and the Campanians; whenever two nations fought together, whatever the qualities they possessed, one side must necessarily be vanquished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was no doubt that as far as the Campanians were concerned they owed their defeats more to their want of hardihood and the weakening effects of excessive luxury than to the strength of their enemies. What could two successful wars an the part of the Samnites through all those centuries weigh against the many brilliant achievements at the Roman people,
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> who reckoned up almost more triumphs than years since the foundation of their City, who had subdued by the might at their arms all the surrounding nations &mdash;Sabines, Etruscans, Latins, Hernici, Aequi, Volscians, and Auruncans &mdash;who had slain the Gauls in so many battles and driven them at last to their ships?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His men must not only go into action in full reliance upon their own courage and warlike reputation, but they must also remember under whose auspices and generalship they were going to fight, whether under a man who is only
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> to be listened to provided he is a big talker, courageous only in words, ignorant of a soldier's work, or under one who himself knows how to handle weapons, who can show himself in the front, and do his duty in the <foreign lang="fr">melee</foreign> at battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <q direct="unspecified">I want you, soldiers,</q> he continued, <q direct="unspecified">to follow my deeds not my words, and to look to me not only for the word at command but also for example. It was not by party struggles nor by the intrigues so common amongst the nobles but by my own right hand that I won three consulships and attained the highest reputation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> There was a time when it might have been said to me, <q direct="unspecified">Yes, for you were a patrician descended from the liberators at our country, and your family held the consulship in the very year when this City first possessed consuls.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Now, however, the consulship is open to you, plebeians, as much as to us who are patricians; it is not the reward of high birth as it once was, but of personal merit. Look forward then, soldiers, to securing all the highest honours!
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> If with the sanction of the gods you men have given me this new name at Corvinus, I have not forgotten the old cognomen of our family; I have not forgotten that I am a Publicola.<note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="ed">See p. 78, Vol. I.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> I always study and always have studied the interests of the Roman plebs, both at home and in the field, whether as a private citizen or holding public office, whether as military tribune or as consul. I have been consistent to this aim in all my successive consulships.

				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nowhere was there ever a general who endeared himself more to his soldiers by cheerfully sharing every duty with the humblest
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> of his men In the military sports when the soldiers got up contests of speed and strength among themselves he was equally ready to win or to lose, and never thought any man unworthy to be his antagonist.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He showed practical kindness as circumstances required; in his language he was not less mindful of other men's liberty than of his own dignity, and what made him most popular was that he displayed the same qualities in discharging the duties of his office which he had shown as a candidate for it.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Following up their commander's words, the whole army marched out of camp with extraordinary alacrity.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In no battle that was ever fought did men engage with strength more equally matched, or more assured hopes of victory on both sides, or a stronger spirit of self-confidence unaccompanied, however, by any feeling of contempt for their opponents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The fighting temper of the Samnites was roused by their recent achievements and the double victory won a few days previously; the Romans on the other hand were inspired by their glorious record of four centuries of victory reaching back to the foundation of the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> But each side felt some anxiety at meeting a new and untried foe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The battle was an index to their feelings; for some time they fought so resolutely that neither line showed any signs of giving way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At length the consul, seeing that the Samnites could not be repulsed by steady fighting, determined to try the effect of a sudden shock and launched his cavalry at them. This made no impression, and as he watched them wheeling round in the narrow space between the opposing armies after their ineffective charge, having utterly failed to penetrate the enemy's line, he rode back to the front ranks of the legions, and after dismounting said: <q direct="unspecified">Soldiers, this task belongs to us infantry.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Come on! Wherever you see me making my way through the enemy's lines with my sword follow, and each of you do his best to cut down those in front.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> All that ground which is now glittering with uplifted spears you shall see cleared by a vast carnage.</q> During those words the cavalry, at the consul's order, retired an both flanks, leaving the centre clear for the legions. The consul led the charge, and slew the first man he engaged with.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Fired at the sight, every man, right and left, charged straight forward and began a fight to be remembered. The Samnites did not flinch, though they were receiving more wounds than they inflicted.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The battle had now gone on for a considerable time; there was a terrible slaughter round the Samnite standards but no signs of flight anywhere, so resolved were they that death alone should be their conqueror.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Romans began to find their strength failing through fatigue and not much daylight remained, so goaded on by rage and disappointment they flung themselves madly upon their foe.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then for the first time the Samnites were seen to be giving ground and preparing to flee; they were being taken prisoners and killed in all directions, and not many would have survived had not night put an end to what was becoming a victory rather than a battle.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>The Romans admitted that they had never fought with a more obstinate enemy, and when the Samnites were asked what it was that first turned them, with all their determination, to flight, they said that the eyes of the Romans looked like fire, and their faces and expression like those of madmen;
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> it was this more than anything else which filled them with terror. This terror showed itself not only in the result of the battle but also in their hurrying away in the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The next day the Romans took possession of their empty camp, and all the population of Capua came out there to congratulate them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">P. Decius Mus saves a Roman Army.</note> these rejoicings were very nearly being embittered by a great disaster in Samnium. The consul Cornelius had advanced from Saticula and led his army by a mountain pass which descended into a narrow valley.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> All the surrounding heights were occupied by the enemy, and he did not notice them high up above him till retreat was impossible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Samnites were waiting quietly till the whole of the column should descend into the lowest part of the valley, but meantime P. Decius, a military tribune, descried a peak jutting out on the pass which commanded the enemy's camp. This height would have been a difficult one for a heavy-armed force to climb but not for one in light marching order.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Decius came up to the consul, who was in a great state of alarm, and said to him: <q direct="unspecified">Do you see, A. Cornelius, that height above the enemy?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> If we promptly seize that position which the Samnites were blind enough to leave unoccupied, it will prove a stronghold in which all our hopes of safety will centre. Do not give me more than the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign> of one legion. When I have reached the summit with them you may march on out of this and save yourself and the army, for the enemy below, a mark for every missile we hurl, will not be able to move without being destroyed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Either the Fortune of Rome or our own courage will then clear the way for our escape.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The consul warmly thanked him, and after being furnished with the detachment he asked for, he marched through the pass unobserved and only came into view of the enemy when he was close to the spot for which he was making.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Then whilst every eye was fixed upon him in silent astonishment, he gave the consul time to withdraw his army into a more favourable position until he had halted his own men on the summit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Samnites marched aimlessly hither and thither; they could not follow the consul except by the same path where he had been exposed to their weapons and which was now equally dangerous to them, nor could they lead a force up the hill above them which Decius had seized.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>He and his men had snatched victory from their grasp, and therefore it was against him that their rage was mainly directed, whilst the nearness of the position and the paucity of its defenders were additional incentives to them to attack it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> First they were bent upon investing the peaks on all sides so as to cut Decius off from the consul, then they thought of retiring and leaving the way open for him so that they could attack when he had descended into the valley.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Whilst they were still in this state of indecision night overtook them.</p> <p>At first Decius hoped to be able to attack them from his higher ground while they were coming up the height; then he began to wonder why they did not show fight, or, at all events, if they were deterred by the nature of the ground why they did not enclose him with a circumvallation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He called the centurions round him. <q direct="unspecified">What ignorance, what cowardice this is!</q> he exclaimed. <q direct="unspecified">How on earth did those men win a victory over the Sidicines and Campanians? You see them there marching up and down, at one time forming up in close order, at another extending. We could by this time have been completely invested yet no one begins to entrench.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> We shall be like them if we stay here longer than we need. Come along with me and let us reconnoitre their positions while some light is still left and find out where the exit from here is open.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Disguised in a common soldier's cloak that the enemy might not mark the general going his rounds, and with his centurion similarly attired, he made a thorough examination of all these details.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After arranging the watches, he ordered the tessera<note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="ed">A wooden tablet on which the watchword was written &mdash;it was not as a rule given verbally &mdash;and frequently, also, the order of the day, as in the present instances.</note> to be given to the rest of the troops; when the bugle sounded for the second watch they were to muster round him
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> in silence. When they had assembled in accordance with instructions, he said: <q direct="unspecified">This silence, soldiers, must be maintained, and all applause as you listen to me checked. When I have laid my proposals fully before you, those of you who approve will cross over silently to the right. The opinion of the majority will be adopted. Now listen to
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> my plans. You were not carried here in flight, nor have you been abandoned through cowardice, and the enemy are investing you. You seized this position by your courage, by your courage you must get away from it. By coming here you have saved a splendid army for Rome, now you must save yourselves by cutting your
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> way out. Though few in number you have brought aid to many, and it is only fitting to your deserts that you yourselves should need the aid
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> of none. We have to do with an enemy who through his slackness yesterday failed to use the chance which Fortune gave him of wiping out an entire army; who did not perceive this most useful peak hanging over his head until it had been seized
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> by us. With all their thousands of men they did not prevent us, few as we are, from climbing it, and now that we are holding it, did they, though plenty of daylight remained, enclose us with lines of circumvallation? The enemy whom you eluded while his eyes were open, and he was on the watch, you certainly ought to evade when he is heavy
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> with sleep. In fact, it is absolutely necessary for you to do so, for our position is such that I have rather to point out the necessity in which you are placed than to suggest any plan
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> of action. For there can be no question as to your remaining here or departing, since Fortune has left you nothing but your arms and the courage which knows how to use them. If we show more fear of the sword than becomes men and Romans we shall have to die of hunger
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> and thirst. Our one chance of safety, then, lies in our breaking our way through and departing. We must do that either in the daytime or
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> at night. But this is a point which admits of little doubt; if we wait for daylight how can we hope that the enemy, who, as you see, has drawn a ring of men all round us, will not completely enclose us with entrenchments? On the other hand, if night be best for our sortie, as it most certainly is, then this hour of the night is most assuredly
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the fittest. You have mustered at the call for the second watch, an hour when men are buried in sleep. You will pass through them in silence, unnoticed by the sleepers, but should they become aware of your presence you will throw them into a panic by a
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> sudden shout. You have followed me so far, follow me still, while I follow Fortune who has guided us here Those of you who think this a safe plan step forward and pass over to the right.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>All Crossed over. They there followed Decius as he moved through the intervals between the pickets.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had already got as far as the centre of the Samnite lines when a soldier striding over the bodies of the sleeping sentinels made a noise by striking his shield against one of them. The sentinel awakened by the sound shook the one next him; they both jumped up and aroused others, not knowing whether friends or foes were amongst them, whether it was Decius' force breaking out or the consul capturing the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As they were no longer unobserved, Decius ordered his men to raise a shout, which paralysed the half-awakened sleepers with terror.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In their confusion they were unable to seize their arms promptly and could neither offer any resistance nor follow up their assailants.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> While the Samnites were in this state of confusion and panic, the Romans, cutting down all who opposed them, made their way in the direction of the consul's camp.</p> <p>A considerable portion of the night still remained and they were evidently now in safety. Decius addressed them: <q direct="unspecified">All honour to you, brave Romans!
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Your march up that height and your return will be extolled in every age But for the due recognition of such courage the light of day is needed; you have deserved something more than to carry your glory back to camp hidden in the silence of the night.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We will rest here and wait for the daylight.</q> They rested accordingly. As soon as it was light and the news was sent on to the consul in camp, there was great excitement and rejoicing, and where it was officially announced throughout the camp that the men who saved the army at the risk of their own lives had themselves returned safe and sound, they all poured out in crowds to meet them, showered congratulations upon them, gave thanks and praise to the gods, and extolled Decius to the skies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He marched through the camp in what amounted to a triumphal procession with his small force fully armed. Every eye was fixed upon him; the military tribune was treated with as much distinction as if he had been a consul.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When he reached the headquarters' tent, the consul ordered the Assembly to be sounded.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He was beginning to give Decius the praise he had so well earned, before the whole army, when Decius interrupted him and begged him to postpone those proceedings in view of the splendid opportunity which they now had in their hands.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He accordingly dismissed the parade and followed Decius' advice, which was to attack the enemy before they had recovered from their nocturnal panic and were still stationed round the height in separate detachments; some who had been sent in pursuit were believed to be still defiling through the pass.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The legions were ordered to arm for battle and were conducted by a more open route towards the enemy, as scouting parties had brought back fuller information about the locality. The attack was sudden and unexpected; the Samnites were everywhere in scattered bodies, most of them without arms, unable to secure their weapons or get into any compact formation or retire within their entrenchments. They were first driven in panic into their camp, there the camp itself was rushed and captured.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The shouting rolled round the height and the detachments who had been posted to watch it fled from a foe whom they had not yet seen. Those who had fled panic-struck into their camp &mdash;some 3o,ooo &mdash;were all slain.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this success the consul summoned an Assembly, and in the presence of his fellow-soldiers pronounced a eulogy on Decius not only for his former services but also for this crowning proof of his soldierly qualities. In addition to the other military rewards he presented him with a golden chaplet and a hundred oxen, and one white oxen of especial beauty, the horns of which had been gilded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The men who had been with him on the height were rewarded with a standing order for double rations and also with one ox and two tunics apiece. After the consul had made the presentation, the legionaries, amidst loud cheers, placed on Decius' head an <q direct="unspecified">obsidial</q> wreath of grass.<note anchored="yes" n="18" resp="ed">The <q direct="unspecified">wreath of the blockade.</q> &mdash;This was regarded as the highest of all military distinctions, and was always the gift of the whole army or particular body of troops who had been delivered, or rescued from a position in which they had been completely shut in by the enemy. The grass was taken, according to Festus, from the place which the force had occupied while it was invested.</note> Another similar wreath was bestowed upon him by his own
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> men. With these decorations upon him he sacrificed the beautiful ox to Mars and presented the hundred oxen which had been given him to the men who had accompanied him on his expedition. The legionaries also contributed a pound of meal and a pint of wine for each of them. During all these proceedings enthusiastic cheering went on through the whole camp.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Battle of Suessula &mdash;final Defeat of the Samnites.</note> the rout it had suffered at the hands of Valerius, the Samnite army was determined to put its fortunes to the proof in a final conflict, and a third battle was fought at Suessula. The whole fighting strength of the nation was
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> brought up. The alarming news was sent in haste to Capua; from there horsemen galloped to the Roman camp to beg for help
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> from Valerius. He at once ordered an advance, and leaving a strong force to protect the camp and the baggage, proceeded by forced marches to Suessula. He selected a site for his camp not far from the enemy, and very restricted in area, as with the exception of the horses there were no baggage, animals, or camp-followers to be
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> provided for. The Samnite army, assuming that there would be no delay in giving battle, formed their lines, and as no enemy advanced against them they marched on towards the Roman camp prepared to
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> assault it. When they saw the soldiers on the rampart and learnt from the report of the reconnoitring parties who had been sent in every direction that the camp was of small dimensions, they concluded that only a weak force of the enemy
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> held it. The whole army began to clamour for the fosse to be filled up and the rampart torn down that they might force their way into the camp. If the generals had not checked the impetuosity of their men, their recklessness would have terminated
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the war. As it was, however, their huge numbers were exhausting their supplies, and owing to their previous inaction at Suessula and the delay in bringing on an action they were not far from absolute scarcity. They determined, therefore, since, as they imagined, the enemy was afraid to venture outside his camp, to send foraging parties into
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> the fields. Meantime they expected that as the Romans made no movement and had brought only as much corn as they could carry with the rest of their equipment on their shoulders, they, too, would soon be in want
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> of everything.</p> <p>When the consul saw the enemy scattered through the fields and only a few left on outpost duty in front of the camp, he addressed a few words of encouragement to his men and led them out to storm the
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Samnite camp. They carried it at the first rush; more of the enemy were killed in their tents than at the gates or on the rampart. All the standards which were captured he ordered to be collected together. Leaving two legions to hold the camp, he gave strict orders that they were not to touch the booty till
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> he returned. He went forward with his men in open column and sent the cavalry to round up the scattered Samnites, like so much game, and drive them against
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> his army. There was an immense slaughter, for they were too much terrified to think under what standard to rally or whether to make for their camp or flee
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> further afield. Their fears drove them into such a hasty flight that as many as 40,000 shields &mdash; far more than the number of the slain &mdash;and military standards, including those captured in the storming of the camp, to the number of 170 were brought to
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> the consul. He then returned to the Samnite camp and all the booty there was given to the soldiers.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The success which attended these operations made the people of Falerii anxious to convert their forty years' truce into a permanent treaty of peace with Rome. It also led the Latins to abandon their designs against Rome and employ the force they had collected against the Paelignians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The fame of these victories was not confined to the limits of Italy; even the Carthaginians sent a deputation to congratulate the senate and to present a golden crown which was to be placed in the chapel of Jupiter on the Capitol. It weighed twenty-five pounds.

						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> &mdash;Soon after this an audience was granted to deputations from Capua and from Suessa, and at their request it was arranged that a force should be sent to winter in those two cities to act as a check upon the Samnites.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Even in those days a residence in Capua was by no means conducive to military discipline; having pleasures of every kind at their command, the troops became enervated and their patriotism was undermined. They began to hatch plans for seizing Capua by the same criminal means by which its present holders had taken it from its ancient possessors.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <q direct="unspecified">They richly deserved,</q> it was said, <q direct="unspecified">to have the precedent which they had set turned against themselves. Why should people like the Campanians who were incapable of defending either their possessions or themselves enjoy the most fertile territory in Italy, and a city well worthy of its territory, in preference to a victorious army who had driven off the Samnites from it by their sweat and blood?
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Was it just that these people who had surrendered themselves into their power should be enjoying that fertile and delightful country while they, wearied with warfare, were struggling with the arid and pestilential soil round the City, or suffering the ruinous consequences of an evergrowing interest which were awaiting them in Rome?</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>This agitation which was being conducted in secret, only a few being yet taken into the conspirators' confidence, was discovered by the new consul, Caius Marcius Rutilus, to whom Campania had been allotted as his province, his colleague, Q. Servilius, being left in the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Taught by years and experience &mdash;he had been four times consul as well as Dictator and censor &mdash;he thought his best course would be, after he was in possession of the facts as ascertained through the tribunes, to frustrate any chance of the soldiers carrying out their design by encouraging them in the hope of executing it whenever they pleased. The troops had been distributed amongst the cities of Campania, and the contemplated plan had been propagated from Capua throughout the entire force.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The consul caused a rumour, therefore, to be spread that they were to occupy the same winter quarters the following year. As there appeared to be no necessity for their carrying out their design immediately, the agitation quieted down for the present.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After settling the army in their summer quarters, whilst all was quiet among the Samnites the consul began to purify it by getting rid of the mutinous spirits.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Some were dismissed as having served their time; others were pronounced to be incapacitated through age or infirmity ; others were sent home on furlough, at first separately, then selected cohorts were sent together, on the ground that they had passed the winter far from their homes and belongings. A large number were transferred to different places, ostensibly for the needs of the service. All these the other consuls and the praetor detained in Rome on various imaginary pretexts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> At first, unaware of the trick that was being played upon them, they were delighted to revisit their homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They soon, however, found out that even those who were first sent away were not rejoining the colours and that hardly any were disbanded but those who had been in Campania, and amongst these mainly the leading agitators. At first they were surprised, and then they felt a well-grounded apprehension that their plans had leaked out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> <q direct="unspecified">Now,</q> they said, <q direct="unspecified">we shall have to suffer courtmartial, informers will give evidence against us, we shall one after another be executed in secret; the reckless and ruthless tyranny of the consuls and senators will be let loose on us.</q></p><p>The soldiers,
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> seeing how those who were the backbone of the conspiracy had been cleverly got rid of by the consuls, did not venture to do more than whisper these things to one another.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>One cohort, which was stationed not far from Antium, took up a position at Lantulae in a narrow pass between the mountains and the sea to intercept those whom the consul was sending home on the various pretexts mentioned above.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They soon grew to a very numerous body, and nothing was wanting to give it the form of a regular army except a general. They moved on into the Alban district, plundering as they went, and entrenched themselves in a camp under the hill of Alba Longa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After completing their entrenchments they spent the rest of the day in arguing about the choice of a leader, as they had not sufficient confidence in any one amongst themselves. But who could be invited from Rome?
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Which of the patricians or plebeians would expose himself to such peril, or to whom could the cause of an army maddened by injustice be safely committed? The next day found them still engaged in the discussion, when some of those who had been dispersed in the marauding expedition brought back the
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> information that Titus Quinctius was cultivating a farm in the neighbourhood and had lost all interest in his City and the honourable distinctions he had won.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This man belonged to a patrician house, and after achieving great reputation as a soldier, had his military career cut short by a wound which made him lame in one of his feet, and he betook himself to a rural life, far from the Forum and its party struggles.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> On hearing his name mentioned they recalled the man to mind, and hoping that all might turn out well they ordered an invitation to be sent to him. They hardly expected that he would come voluntarily, and prepared to intimidate him into compliance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The messengers accordingly entered his farmhouse in the dead of night and woke him up from a sound sleep, and after telling him that there was no alternative, it must either be authority and rank or, if he resisted, death, they carried him off to the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> On his arrival he was saluted as their commander, and all dismayed as he was by the strangeness and suddenness of the affair, the insignia of his office were brought to him and he was peremptorily told to lead them to the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Acting on their own impulse rather than their leader's advice they plucked up their standards and marched in hostile array as far as the eighth milestone on what is now the Appian Way.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> They would have gone on at once to the City had they not received word that an army was on its march, and that M. Valerius Corvus had been nominated Dictator, with L. Aemilius Mamercus as his Master of the Horse, to act against them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Marcus Valerius restores Peace and Concord.</note> soon as they came into view and recognised the arms and standards, the thought of their country instantly calmed the passions of them all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They had not yet been hardened to the sight of civic bloodshed, they knew of no wars but those against foreign foes, and secession from their own countrymen began to be looked upon as the last degree of madness. First the leaders then the men on both sides sought an opening for negotiations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Quinctius, who had had enough of fighting for his country and was the last man to fight against it, and Corvus, who was devoted to all his countrymen, especially to the soldiers and above all to his own army, came forward to a colloquy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When the latter was recognised, his opponents showed as much respect for him as his own men by the silence with which they prepared to listen to him.</p> <p>He addressed them as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Soldiers! When I left the City I offered up prayers to the immortal gods who watch over our State, your State and mine, that they would of their goodness grant me, not a victory over you, but the glory of bringing about a reconciliation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There have been and there will be abundant opportunities for winning glory in war, and this occasion we must seek for peace.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> That which I implored of the immortal gods, when I offered up my prayers, you have it in your power now to grant me if you will please to remember that you are encamped not in Samnium, not amongst the Volscians, but on Roman soil. Those hills which you see are the hills of your City; I, your consul, am the man under whose auspices and leadership you twice defeated the legions of the Samnites a year ago and twice captured their camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I am Marcus Valerius Corvus, soldiers, a patrician it is true, but my nobility has shown itself in benefits to you, not in wrongs; I have never been the author of any law bearing harshly on you or of any oppressive enactment of the senate; in all my commands I have been stricter with myself than with you.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If noble birth, if personal merit, if high office, if distinguished service could make any man proud, I venture to say that such is my descent, such the proof I have given of myself, such the age at which I obtained the consulship, being only twenty-three, that I had it in my power to show myself harsh and overbearing not only to the plebs but even to the patricians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> What have you heard that I have said or done as consul more than I should had I been one of your tribunes? In that spirit I administered two successive consulships, in that spirit will this dread Dictatorship be administered; I shall not be more gentle towards these soldiers of mine and of my country than to you who would be &mdash;I loathe the word &mdash;

							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Wait till your wives and mothers come out from the City with dishevelled hair to meet you as they once came to meet Coriolanus! Then the Volscian legions refrained from attacking us because they had a Roman for their general; will not you, an army of Romans, desist from an impious war? Titus Quinctius!
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> by whatever means you were placed in your present position, whether willingly or unwillingly, if there is to be a conflict, retire, I beg you to the rearmost line; it will be more honourable for you to flee from a fellow-citizen than to fight against your country.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But if there is to be peace you will take your place with honour amongst the foremost and play the part of a beneficent mediator in this conference. Demand what is just and you shall receive it, though we should acquiesce even in what is unjust rather than embrue impious hands in one another's blood.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>T. Quinctius, bathed in tears, turned to his men and said: <q direct="unspecified">If, soldiers, I am of any use at all you will find that I am a better leader in peace than in war. The words you have heard are not those of a Volscian or a Samnite but of a Roman.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> They were spoken by your consul, your commander, soldiers, whose auspices you have found by experience to be favourable for you; do not desire to learn by experience what they may be when directed against you.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The senate had at its disposal other generals more ready to fight against you; it has selected the one man who has showed most consideration for his soldiers, in whom you have placed most confidence as your commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Even those who have victory in their power wish for peace, what ought we to wish for?
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> Why do we not lay aside all resentment and ambitious hopes &mdash;those treacherous advisers &mdash; and trust ourselves and all our interests to his tried fidelity?</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was a universal shout of approval, and T. Quinctius advancing to the front asserted that his men would submit to the authority of the Dictator. He implored Valerius to take up the cause of his unhappy fellow-citizens, and when he had taken it up to maintain it with the same integrity that he had always shown in his public administration.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For himself he demanded no conditions, he would not place his hope in anything but his innocence, but for the soldiers there must be the same guarantee that was given in the days of their fathers to the plebs and afterwards to the legions, namely, that no man should be punished for having taken part in the secession.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Dictator expressed his approval of what had been said, and after telling them all to hope for the best he galloped back to the City, and after obtaining the consent of the senate, brought a measure before the people who were assembled in the Petilian Grove granting immunity to all who had taken part in the secession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He then begged the Quirites to grant him one request, which was that no one should ever either in jest or earnest bring that matter up against any one. A military <foreign lang="la">Lex Sacrata</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="19" resp="ed">See note 15 on p. 358, Vol. I.</note> was also passed, enacting that no soldier's name should be struck off the muster-roll without his consent.<note anchored="yes" n="20" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified">They deprecated the power of striking their names off the list of soldiers, partly because it degraded them to an inferior rank, that of the <foreign lang="la">capite censi</foreign>, who were considered unfit to bear arms, and partly because whilst they were on military service they were protected from being personally attached for debts; and partly, also, because service in Campania bore an agreeable aspect and might furnish a poor man with the means of relieving himself from his embarrassments.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> &mdash;Arnold, I. p. 123.</note> An additional provision was subsequently embodied in it, forbidding any one who had once been military tribune from being made to serve afterwards as a
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> centurion. This was in consequence of a demand made by the mutineers with respect to P. Salonius, who had been every year either military tribune or centurion of the first class. They were incensed against him because he had always opposed their mutinous projects and had fled from Lautulae to avoid being mixed up with
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> them. As this proposal was aimed solely at Salonius the senate refused to allow it. Then Salonius himself appealed to the senators not to consider his dignity of more importance than the harmony of the State, and at his request they ultimately passed
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> it. Another demand just as impudent was that the pay of the cavalry should be reduced at that time they were receiving three times the infantry pay &mdash;because they had acted against the mutineers.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In addition to these measures I find the following recorded by various authorities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> L. Genucius, a tribune of the plebs, brought before them a measure declaring usury illegal, whilst other resolutions were adopted forbidding any one to accept re-election to the same office in less than ten years or fill two offices in the same year, and also that both consuls might legally be elected from the plebs If all these concessions were really made it is quite clear that the revolt possessed considerable strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In other annalists it is stated that Valerius was not nominated Dictator, but the matter was entirely arranged by the consuls; also that it was not before they came to Rome but in Rome itself that the body of conspirators broke out into armed revolt;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> also that it was not to T. Quinctius' farm but to the house of C. Manlius that the nocturnal visit was paid, and that it was Manlius who was seized by the conspirators and made their leader, after which they marched out to a distance of four miles and entrenched themselves;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> also that it was not their leaders who made the first suggestions of concord, but what happened was that as the two
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> armies advanced towards each other prepared for action the soldiers exchanged mutual greetings, and as they drew nearer grasped each other's hands and embraced one another, and the consuls, seeing how averse the soldiers were from fighting, yielded to circumstances and made proposals to the senate for reconciliation and concord.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Thus the ancient authorities agree in nothing but the simple fact that there was a mutiny and that it was suppressed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The report of this disturbance and the seriousness of the war which had been commenced with the Samnites made many nationalities averse from an alliance with Rome. The Latins had long been faithless to their treaty, and in addition to that the Privernates made a sudden incursion and devastated the neighbouring Roman colonies of Norba and Setia.</p></div1>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Privernates and Volscians &mdash;Peace with the Samnites.</note> When messengers from Setia and Norba arrived in Rome with complaints of a defeat they had suffered at the hands of the revolted Privernates, the consulship was held by C.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Plautius (for the second time) and L. Aemilius Mamercus. News was also brought that an army of Volscians led by the people of Antium
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> had concentrated at Satricum. Both wars fell to Plautius. He marched first to Privernum and at once engaged the enemy who were defeated without much trouble. The town was captured and then given back to the Privernates after a strong garrison had been
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> placed in it; two-thirds of their territory were confiscated. Then the victorious army was led against the Antiates at Satricum. There a battle was fought with terrible bloodshed on both sides, and whilst the result was still uncertain night separated the combatants. The Romans were in no way discouraged by the indecisiveness of
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the conflict, and prepared for battle the next day. The Volscians, after reckoning up their losses in the battles, were by no means eager to run any further risk; looking upon themselves as defeated, they made a hurried departure to Antium in the night, leaving
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> their wounded and a part of their baggage behind. An immense quantity of arms was found both amongst the dead on the field and in the camp. These the consul said he was offering to Lua Mater. He then ravaged the enemy's territories down to the sea-board.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the other consul entered the Sabellian territory, he found that the Samnites had no camp, no legions confronting him. Whilst he was laying waste their fields with fire and sword, envoys came to him to ask for peace and he referred them to the senate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After permission had been given them to state their case, they laid aside their truculent manner and requested that peace might be granted them and
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> also the right of making war against the Sidicines. They considered that they were the more justified in making this request because they had formed friendly relations with Rome when their affairs were prosperous, not as in the case of the Campanians when they were in adversity, and they were taking up arms against the Sidicines, who had always been their enemies and never
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> friends of Rome, who had not, like the Samnites, sought its friendship in a time of peace, nor like the Campanians, asked for its help in a time of war, and who were not under the protection and suzerainty of Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The praetor, T Aemilius, put these demands to the senate, and they decided that the former treaty should be renewed with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The reply given then by the praetor was to the effect that it was no fault of the Roman people that the friendship with them had not remained unbroken, and there was no objection to its being re-established since they themselves were weary of a war brought on them by their own fault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As to the Sidicines there was nothing to prevent the Samnites from being free to make either peace or war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After the treaty was made the Roman army was at once withdrawn. The men had received a year's pay and three months' rations, for which the consul had stipulated, that he might allow time for an armistice until the envoys returned.</p><p>The Samnites advanced against the Sidicines
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> with the same troops that they had employed in the war with Rome, and they were very hopeful of effecting an early capture of the city. Then at last the Sidicines took steps to make a surrender of themselves to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate rejected it as being made too late and forced from them by extreme necessity. They then made it to the Latins who were already in arms on their own account.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Even the Campanians did not refuse to take part in the hostile movement, so much keener was their sense of the injuries inflicted by the Samnites than of the kindness shown them by Rome.</p><p>One immense army, composed of these many nationalities and under Latin leadership, invaded the Samnite country and inflicted more disasters by ravages than by actual fighting.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Although the Latins proved superior in the various encounters, they were not loath to retire from the enemy's territory lest they might have to fight too often. This allowed the Samnites time to send envoys to Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When they were admitted to an audience they complained to the senate that they were suffering more now that they were in treaty with them than they had before, when they were enemies;
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> they very humbly requested them to be satisfied with having snatched from them the victory they had won over the Campanians and the Sidicines, and not permit them, in addition, to be conquered by these most cowardly people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If the Latins and Campanians were really under the suzerainty of Rome they should exert their authority to keep them off the Samnite land, if they renounced that suzerainty they should coerce them by force.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They received an ambiguous reply, for the senate shrank from acknowledging that the Latins no longer recognised their authority, and on the other hand they were afraid, if they reprimanded them, that they might alienate them altogether.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The circumstances of the Campanians were quite different; they were bound not by treaty but by the terms of surrender, and they must keep quiet whether they would or no. There was nothing in their treaty with the Latins which prevented them from making war with whom they pleased.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Revolt of the Latins and Campanians.</note> this reply the Samnites were dismissed, quite uncertain as to what the Romans were going to do. But its effect was to completely estrange the Campanians, who now feared the worst, and it made the Latins more determined than ever, since the Romans refused any further concessions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Under the pretext of making preparations for a Samnite war, they held frequent meetings of their national council, and in all the consultations of their leaders they hatched plans in secret for war with Rome. The Campanians also took part in this movement against their preservers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But in spite of the careful secrecy with which everything was being conducted &mdash;for they wanted the Samnites to be dislodged from their rear before the Romans made any movement &mdash;some who had friends and relatives in Rome sent hints about the league which was being formed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consuls were ordered to resign before the expire of their year of office in order that the new consuls might be elected at an earlier date in view of such a formidable war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were religious difficulties in the way of the elections being held by those whose tenure of office had been curtailed, and so an interregnum commenced. There were two interreges, M. Valerius and M. Fabius. The latter elected T. Manlius Torquatus (for the third time) and P. Decius Mus as consuls.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>It was in this year (<date value="-341">341</date> B.C.), it appears, that Alexander, King of Epirus, landed in Italy, and there is no doubt that had he been fairly successful at first that war would have extended to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This, too, was about the time of the achievements of Alexander the Great, the son of this man's sister, who, after proving himself invincible in another region of the globe, was cut off, whilst a young man, by disease.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Although there could be no doubt as to the revolt of their allies &mdash;the Latin league &mdash;still, as though they were concerned for the Samnites and not for themselves, the Romans invited the ten chiefs of the league to Rome to give them instructions as to what they wanted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Latium at that time had two praetors, L. Annius of Setia and L. Numisius of Cerceii, both belonging to the Roman colonists. Through these men not only had Signia and Velitrae, themselves Roman colonies, but the Volsci also been instigated to take up arms. It was decided that they should be particularly invited by name.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> No one had the slightest doubt as to the reason for this invitation. A meeting of their council was accordingly held prior to their departure; they informed those present that they had been asked by the senate to go to Rome, and they requested them to decide as to what reply they should give with reference to the matters which they had reason to suppose would be discussed.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After various opinions had been expressed, Annius spoke as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Although it was I who put the question to you as to what answer should be given, I still think that it is of more importance to the interests of the State to decide what must be done rather than what must be said. When our plans are developed it will be easy enough to fit words to facts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If even now we are capable of submitting to servitude under the shadowy pretext of a treaty on equal terms, what is to prevent us from deserting the Sidicines and receiving our orders not only from the Romans but even from the Samnites, and giving as our reply that we are ready to lay down our arms at the beck and call of the Romans?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But if your hearts are at last touched by any yearning for independence; if a treaty, an alliance, an equality of rights really exists; if we are at liberty to boast of the fact that the Romans are of the same stock as ourselves, though once we were ashamed of it; if our army, which when united with theirs doubles their strength, and which the consuls will not dispense with when conducting wars which concern them alone &mdash;if,
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I say, that army is really an army of their allies, then why are we not on an equal footing in all respects?
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Why is not one consul elected from the Latins? Those who possess half the strength, do they possess half the government?
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This is not in itself too much honour for us, seeing that we acknowledge Rome to be the head of Latium, but we have made it appear so by our prolonged forbearance.</q></p> <p><q direct="unspecified">But if ever you longed for an opportunity of taking your place in the government and of making use of your liberty, now is the time;
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> this is the opportunity which has been given you by your own courage and the goodness of the gods.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> You tried their patience by refusing to supply troops. Who doubts that they were intensely irritated when we broke through a custom more than two centuries old? Still they put up with the annoyance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> We waged war with the Paelignians on our own account; they who before did not allow us the right to defend our own frontiers did not intervene. They heard that the Sidicines were received into our protection, that the Campanians had revolted from them to us, that we were preparing an army to act against the Samnites with whom they had a treaty, they never moved out of their City.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> What was this extraordinary self-restraint due to but to a consciousness of our strength and of theirs? I have it on good authority that when the Samnites were laying their complaints about us they received a reply from the Roman senate, from which it was quite evident that they themselves do not now claim that Latium is under the authority of Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Make your rights effective by insisting on what they are tacitly conceding to you. If any one is afraid of saying this, I declare my readiness to say it not only in the ears of the Roman people and their senate but in the audience of Jupiter himself who dwells in the Capitol, and to tell them that if they wish us to remain in alliance with them they must accept one consul from us and half their senate.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>His speech was followed by a universal shout of approval, and he was empowered to do and to say whatever he deemed to be in furtherance of the interests of the State of Latium and of his own honour.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On their arrival in Rome, the senate assembled in the Capitol and granted them an audience. T. Manlius, the consul, acting on the instructions of the senate, recommended them not to make war upon the Samnites, with whom the Romans had a treaty, on which Annius, as though he were a conqueror who had captured the Capitol by arms instead of an ambassador protected by the law of nations, said:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/><q direct="unspecified">It is about time, Titus Manlius and senators, that you gave up treating us as though you were our suzerains, when you see the State of Latium raised by the bounty of the gods to a most flourishing position, both in population and in military power, the Samnites defeated, the Sidicines and Campanians in alliance with us, even the Volscians now making common cause with us, whilst your own colonies actually prefer the government of Latium to that of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But since you cannot bring your minds to abandon your impudent claims to sovereignty, we will go so far, in recognising that we are kindred nations, as to offer peace upon the conditions of equal rights for both, since it has pleased the gods to grant equal strength to both; though we are quite able to assert the independence of Latium by force of arms. One consul must be elected from Rome, the other from Latium; the senate must contain an equal number of members from both nations; there must be one nation, one republic. And in order that there may be one seat of government and one name for all, since one side or the other must make some concession, let us, if this City really takes precedence, be all called Romans.</q></p><p>It so happened that the Romans had in their consul T. Manlius, a man who was quite as proud and passionate as Annius. He was so enraged as to declare that if the senate were visited by such madness as to accept these conditions from a man from Setia, he would come with his sword drawn into the Senatehouse and kill every Latin he found there.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then turning to the image of Jupiter, he exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">Hear, O Jupiter, these abominable words! Hear them, O Justice and Right! Thou, Jupiter, as though thou hadst been conquered and made captive, art to see in thy temple foreign consuls and a foreign senate! Were these the terms of the treaty, Latins, which Tullus, the King of Rome, made with your fathers of Alba, or which L. Tarquin made with you afterwards? Have you forgotten the battle at Lake Regillus? Are you so utterly oblivious of your defeats in the old days and of our kindness towards you?</q></p> <p>This outburst was followed by the indignant protest of the senate, and it is recorded that whilst on all hands appeals were being made to the gods, whom the consuls were continually invoking as the guardians of treaties, the voice of Annius was heard pouring contempt upon the divine majesty of the Jupiter of Rome.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> At all events when, in a storm of passion he was flinging himself out of the vestibule of the temple, he slipped down the steps and struck his head so heavily against the bottom step that he became unconscious.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The authorities are not agreed as to whether he was actually killed, and I leave the question undecided, as also the statement that during the appeals to the gods to avenge the breach of treaties, a storm burst from the sky with a terrific roar; for they may either be true or simply invented as an appropriate representation of the wrath of the gods.</p> <p>Torquatus was sent by the senate to conduct the envoys away, and when he saw Annius lying on the ground he exclaimed, loud enough to be heard by the senators and populace alike: <q direct="unspecified">It is well. The gods have commenced a just and righteous war! There is a divine power at work; thou, O Great Jupiter, art here . Not in vain have we consecrated this to be thine abode, O Father of gods and men . Why do you hesitate, Quirites, and you, senators, to take up arms when the gods are your leaders?
								<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I will lay the legions of the Latins low, just as you see their envoy lying here.</q></p> <p>The consul's words were received by the people with loud applause and raised them to such a pitch of excitement that when the envoys took their departure they owed their safety more to the care of the magistrates who, on the consul's order, accompanied them to protect them from the attacks of the angry people than to any respect felt for the law of nations.</p> <p>War having been decided upon by senate as much as people, the consuls enrolled two armies and proceeded through the territories of the Marsi and Paeligni, where they were joined by an army of Samnites. They fixed their camp at Capua, where the Latins and their allies had assembled. It is said that whilst they were there each consul had the same vision in the quiet of the night. A Form greater and more awful than any human form appeared to them and announced that the commander of the one army and the army itself on the other side were destined as a sacrifice to the Dii Manes and to Mother Earth.
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In whichever army the commander should have devoted the legions of his enemies and himself as well to those deities, that army, that people would have the victory. When the consuls compared these visions of the night together, they decided that victims should be slain to avert the wrath of the gods, and further, that if, on inspection, they should portend the same as the vision had announced, one of the two consuls should fulfill his destiny. When the answers of the soothsayers, after they had inspected the victims, proved to correspond with their own secret belief in the vision, they called up the superior officers and told them to explain publicly to the soldiers what the gods had decreed, in order that the voluntary death of a consul might not create a panic in the army.
									<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They arranged with each other that when either division began to give way, the consul in command of it should devote himself <q direct="unspecified">on behalf of the Roman people and the Quirites.</q> The council of war also decided that if ever any war had been conducted with the strict enforcement of orders, on this occasion certainly, military discipline should be brought back to the ancient standard.
									<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Their anxiety was increased by the fact that it was against the Latins that they had to fight, a people resembling them in language, manners, arms, and especially in their military organisation. They had been colleagues and comrades, as soldiers, centurions, and tribunes, often stationed together in the same posts and side by side in the same maniples. That this might not prove a source of error and confusion, orders were given that no one was to leave his post to fight with the enemy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amongst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Titus Manlius.</note> the troop commanders, who had been sent out everywhere to reconnoitre, there happened to be T. Manlius, the consul's son. He had ridden out with his men by the enemy's camp and was hardly a stone's-throw from their nearest post, where the
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Tusculan cavalry were stationed, when Geminus Maecius, who was in command, a man of high reputation amongst his own people, recognised the Roman cavalry and the consul's son at their head, for they were all &mdash;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> especially the men of distinction &mdash;known to each other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Accosting Manlius he said: <q direct="unspecified">Are you going to conduct the war against the Latins and their allies with that single troop of yours? What will the consuls, what will their two armies be doing in the meantime?</q><q direct="unspecified">They
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> will be here in good time,</q> Manlius replied, <q direct="unspecified">and so will Jupiter, the Great and Powerful, the witness of your breach of faith. If we fought at Lake Regillus till you had quite enough, certainly we
							<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> shall succeed here also in preventing you from finding too much pleasure in meeting us in battle.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In reply, Geminus rode forward a short distance and said: <q direct="unspecified">Are you willing, before the day comes when you are to set your armies in motion for so great an effort, to have a meeting with me that the result of our single combat may show how much a Latin horseman is superior to a Roman?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Either urged on by anger or feeling ashamed to decline the contest, or dragged on by the irresistible power of destiny, the high-spirited youth forgot the consul's edict and the obedience due to a father and rushed headlong into a contest in which victory or defeat were alike fatal. The rest of the cavalry retired to remain spectators of the fray; the two combatants selected a clear space over which they charged each other at full gallop with levelled spears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Manlius' lance passed above his adversary's helmet, Maecius' across the neck of the other's horse. They wheeled their horses round, and Manlius standing in his stirrups was the first to get in a second stroke ; he thrust his lance between the horse's ears.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Feeling the wound, the horse reared, shook its head violently, and threw its rider off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Whilst he was trying to rise after his heavy fall by supporting himself with his lance and shield, Manlius drove his lance right through his body and pinned him to the earth. After despoiling the body he returned to his men, and amidst their exulting shouts entered the camp
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> and went straight to his father at the headquarters' tent, not in the least realising the nature of his deed or its possible consequences, whether praise or punishment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <q direct="unspecified">That all may say, my father,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">that I am a true scion of your blood, I bring to you these equestrian spoils taken from a dead enemy who challenged me to single combat.</q> On hearing this the consul turned away from his son and ordered the trumpet to sound the Assembly.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The soldiers mustered in large numbers and the consul began: <q direct="unspecified">Since you, T. Manlius, have shown no regard for either
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> the authority of a consul or the obedience due to a father, and in defiance of our edict have left your post to fight against
					<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> the enemy, and have done your best to destroy the military discipline through which the Roman State has stood till now unshaken, and have forced upon me the necessity of forgetting either my duty to the republic or my duty to myself and my children, it is better that we should
					<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> suffer the consequences of our offence ourselves than that the State should expiate our crime by inflicting great injury upon itself. We shall be a melancholy example, but one that will be profitable to the young men of the future.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> My natural love of my children and that proof of courage which from a false sense of honour you
					<milestone unit="section" n="19??"/> have given, move me to take your part, but since either the consuls' authority must be vindicated by your death or forever abrogated by letting you go unpunished, I would believe that even you yourself, if there is a drop of my blood in your veins, will not shrink from restoring by your punishment the military discipline which has been weakened by your misconduct.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Go, lictor, bind him to the stake.</q> All were paralysed by such a ruthless order; they felt as if the axe was directed against each of them; fear rather than discipline kept them motionless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> For some moments they stood transfixed in silence, then suddenly, when they saw the blood pouring from his severed neck, their voices rose in unrestrained and angry complaint; they spared neither laments nor curses.
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> The body of the youth covered with his spoils was cremated on a pyre erected outside the rampart, with all the funeral honours that the soldiers' devotion could pay. <q direct="unspecified">Manlian orders</q> were not only regarded with horror for the time, but were looked upon as setting a frightful precedent for the future.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The terrible severity of the punishment, however, made the soldiers more obedient to their general, and not only did it lead to greater attention being paid to the pickets and sentry duties and the ordering of the outposts, but when they went
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> into battle for the final contest, this severity proved to be of the greatest service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The battle was exactly like one fought in a civil war; there was nothing in the Latin army different from the Roman except their courage.</p> <p>At<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Changes in the Roman Military System.</note> first the Romans used the large round shield called the <foreign lang="la">clipeus</foreign>, afterwards, when the soldiers received pay, the smaller oblong shield called the <foreign lang="la">scutum</foreign> was adopted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The phalanx formation, similar to the Macedonian of the earlier days, was abandoned in favour of the distribution into companies (<foreign lang="la">manipuli</foreign>); the rear portion being broken up into smaller divisions.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The foremost line consisted of the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign>, formed into fifteen companies, drawn up at a short distance from each other.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> These were called the lightarmed companies, as whilst one-third carried a long spear (<foreign lang="la">hasta</foreign> and short iron javelins, the remainder carried shields. This front line consisted of youths in the first bloom of manhood just old enough for service.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Behind them were stationed an equal number of companies, called <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign>, made up of men in the full vigour of life, all carrying shields and furnished with superior weapons. This body of thirty companies were called the <foreign lang="la">antepilani</foreign>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Behind them were the standards under which were stationed fifteen companies, which were divided into three sections called <foreign lang="la">vexillae</foreign>, the first section in each was called the <foreign lang="la">pilus</foreign>, and they consisted of 180 men to every standard (<foreign lang="la">vexillum</foreign>). The first <foreign lang="la">vexillum</foreign> was followed by the <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign>, veterans of proved courage; the second by the <foreign lang="la">rorarii</foreign>, or <q direct="unspecified">skirmishers,</q> younger men and less distinguished; the third by the <foreign lang="la">accensi</foreign>, who were least to be depended upon, and were therefore placed in the rearmost line.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>When the battle formation of the army was completed, the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> were the first to engage. If they failed to repulse the enemy, they slowly retired through the intervals between the companies of the <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign> who then took up the fight, the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> following in their rear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign>, meantime, were resting on one knee under their standards, their shields over their shoulders and their spears planted on the ground with the points upwards, giving them the appearance of a bristling palisade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> If the <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign> were also unsuccessful, they slowly retired to the triarii, which has given rise to the proverbial saying, when people are in great difficulty <q direct="unspecified">matters have come down to the <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign>.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the <foreign lang="la">triarii</foreign> had admitted the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign> through the intervals separating their companies, they rose from their kneeling posture
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> and instantly closing their companies up they blocked all passage through them and in one compact mass fell on the enemy as the last hope of the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The enemy who had followed up the others as though they had defeated them, saw with dread a now and larger army rising apparently out of the earth.</p><p>There were generally four legions enrolled, consisting each of 5000 men, and 300 cavalry were assigned to each legion.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> A force of equal size used to be supplied by the Latins, now, however, they were hostile to Rome.</p> <p>The two armies were drawn up in the same formation, and they knew that if the maniples kept their order they would have to
							<milestone unit="section" n="16??"/> fight, not only vexilla with vexilla, hastati with hastati, principes with principes, but even centurion with Centurion.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>There were amongst the triarii two centurions, one in each army &mdash;the Roman, possessing but little bodily strength but an energetic and experienced soldier, the Latin, a man of enormous strength and a splendid fighter &mdash;very well known to each other because they had always served in the same Company.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The Roman, distrusting his own strength, had obtained the consuls' permission before leaving Rome to choose his own sub-centurion to protect him from the man who was destined to be his enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> This youth, finding himself face to face with the Latin centurion, gained a victory over him.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Defeat of the Latins-Self-devotion of Decius.</note> battle took place near the base of Mount Vesuvius, where the road led to Veseris. Before leading out their armies to battle the consuls offered sacrifice. The<foreign lang="la">haruspex</foreign>, whose duty it was to inspect the different organs in the victims, pointed out to Decius a prophetic intimation of his death, in all other respects the signs were favourable. Manlius' sacrifice was entirely satisfactory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <q direct="unspecified">It is well,</q> said Decius,<q direct="unspecified">if my colleague has obtained favourable signs.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They moved forward to battle in the formation I have already described, Manlius in command of the right division, Decius of the left.</p> <p>At first both armies fought with equal strength and equal determination. After a time the Roman hastati on the left, unable to withstand the insistency of the Latins, retired behind the principes.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> During the temporary confusion created by this movement, Decius exclaimed in a loud voice to M. Valerius: <q direct="unspecified">Valerius, we need the help of the gods! Let the Pontifex Maximus dictate to me the words in which I am to devote myself for the legions.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Pontifex bade him veil his head in his toga praetexta, and rest his hand, covered with the toga, against his chin, then standing upon a spear to say these words:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><q direct="unspecified">Janus, Jupiter, Father Mars, Quirinus, Bellona, Lares, ye Novensiles and Indigetes, deities to whom belongs the power over us and over our foes, and ye, too, Divine Manes, I pray to you, I do you reverence,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> I crave your grace and favour that you will bless the Roman People, the Quirites, with power and victory, and visit the enemies of the Roman People, the Quirites, with fear and dread and death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In like manner as I have uttered this prayer so do I now on behalf of the commonwealth of the Quirites, on behalf of the army, the legions, the auxiliaries of the Roman People, the Quirites, devote the legions and auxiliaries of the enemy, together with myself to the Divine Manes and to Earth.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After this prayer he ordered the lictors to go to T. Manlius and at once announce to his colleague that he had devoted himself on behalf of the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then girded himself with the Gabinian cincture, and in full armour leaped upon his horse and dashed into the middle of the enemy. To those who watched him in both armies, he appeared something awful and superhuman, as though sent from heaven to expiate and appease all the anger of the gods and to avert destruction from his people and bring it on their enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> All the dread and terror which he carried with him threw the front ranks of the Latins into confusion which soon spread throughout the entire army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This was most evident, for wherever his horse carried him they were paralysed as though struck by some death-dealing star; but when he fell, overwhelmed with darts, the Latin cohorts, in a state of perfect consternation, fled from the spot and left a large space clear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Romans, on the other hand, freed from all religious fears, pressed forward as though the signal was then first given and commenced a great battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Even the rorarii rushed forward between the companies of antepilani and added strength to the hastati and principes, whilst the triarii, kneeling on their right knee, waited for the consul's signal to rise.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Manlius heard the fate of his colleague, he honoured his glorious death with tears no less than with the due meed of praise. Meantime the battle proceeded, and in some quarters the weight of numbers was giving the advantage to the Latins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> For some time Manlius was in doubt whether the moment had not come for calling up the triarii, but judging it better for them to be kept fresh till the final crisis of the battle, he gave orders for the accensi at the extreme rear to advance to the front.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they came up, the Latins, taking them for the opposing triarii, instantly called up their own. In the desperate struggle they had tired themselves out and broken or blunted their spears, but as they were still driving the enemy back by main force, they imagined that the battle was decided and that they had reached their last line.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then it was that the consul said to his triarii: <q direct="unspecified">Rise up now, fresh and vigorous against a wearied foe; think of your country and your parents and wives and children; think of your consul lying there dead that ye might win the victory!</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They rose up fresh and resplendent in their armour, as though a new army had suddenly sprung up, and after letting the antepilani retire through them they raised their battle-shout.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The front ranks of the Latins were thrown into disorder, the Romans thrust their spears into their faces, and in this way killed the main support of their army. They went on without being touched through the remaining companies as though through a crowd of unarmed men, and they marked their advance with such a slaughter that they left hardly a fourth part of the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Samnites, too, who were drawn up close to the lowest spurs of the mountain, were threatening the Latins on their flank, and so adding to their demoralisation.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The chief credit for that successful battle was given by all, Romans and allies alike, to the two consuls &mdash;one of whom had diverted on to himself alone all the dangers that threatened from the gods supernal and the gods infernal, whilst the other had shown such consummate generalship in the battle itself that the Roman and Latin historians who have left an account of it, are quite agreed that whichever side had had T. Manlius as their commander must have won the victory.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>After their flight the Latins took refuge in Menturnae. Their camp was captured after the battle, and many were killed there, mostly Campanians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The body of Decius was not found that day, as night overtook those who were searching for it, the next day it was discovered, buried beneath a heap of javelins and with an immense number of the enemy lying round it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> His obsequies were conducted by his colleague in a manner befitting that glorious death.</p> <p>I ought to add here that a consul or Dictator or praetor, when he devotes the legions of the enemy, need not necessarily devote himself but may select any one he chooses out of a legion that has been regularly enrolled.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If the man who has been so devoted is killed, all is considered to have been duly performed. If he is not killed, an image of the man, seven feet high at least, must be buried in the earth, and a victim slain as an expiatory sacrifice; on the spot, where such an image has been buried, no Roman magistrate must ever set his foot.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> If, as in the case of Decius, the commander devotes himself but survives the battle, he can no longer discharge any religious function, either on his own account or on behalf of the State. He has the right to devote his arms, either by offering a sacrifice or otherwise, to Vulcan or to any other deity.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The spear on which the consul stands, when repeating the formula of devotion, must not pass into the enemy's hands; should this happen a <foreign lang="la">suovetaurilia</foreign> <note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed">for a description of the sacrifice known as the <foreign lang="la">suovetaurilia</foreign>, see note 3, Book III.</note>must be offered as a propitiation to Mars.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Although the memory of every traditional custom relating to either human or divine things has been lost through our abandonment of the old religion of our fathers in favour of foreign novelties, I thought it not alien from my subject to record these regulations in the very words in which they have been handed down.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In some authors I find it stated that it was only after the battle was
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> over that the Samnites who had been waiting to see the result came to support the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Assistance was also coming to the Latins from Lanuvium whilst time was being wasted in deliberation, but whilst they were starting and a part of their column was already on the march, news came of the defeat of the Latins. They faced about and re-entered their city and it is stated that Milionius, their praetor, remarked that for that very short march they would have to pay a heavy price to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Those of the Latins who survived the battle retreated by many different routes, and gradually assembled in the city of Vescia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Here the leaders met to discuss the situation, and Numisius assured them that both armies had really experienced the same fortune and an equal amount of bloodshed; the Romans enjoyed no more than the name of victory, in every other respect they were as good as defeated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The headquarters of both consuls were polluted with blood; the one had murdered his son, the other had devoted himself to death; their whole army was massacred, their hastati and principes killed; the companies both in front of and behind the standards had suffered enormous losses; the triarii in the end saved the situation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Latin troops, it was true, were equally cut up, but Latium and the Volsci could supply reinforcements more quickly than Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If, therefore, they approved, he would at once call out the fighting men from the Latin and Volscian peoples and march back with an army to Capua, and would take the Romans unawares; a battle was the last thing they were expecting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He despatched misleading letters throughout Latium and the Volscian country, those who had not been engaged in the battle being the more ready to believe what he said, and a hastilylevied body of militia, drawn from all quarters, was got together.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> This army was met by the consul at Trifanum, a place between Sinuessa and Menturnae. Without waiting even to choose the sites for their camps, the two armies piled their baggage, fought and finished the war, for the Latins were so utterly worsted
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> that when the consul with his victorious army was preparing to ravage their territory, they made a complete surrender and the Campanians followed their example.</p> <p>Latium and Capua were deprived of their territory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Latin territory, including that of Privernum, together with the Falernian, which had belonged to the Campanians as far as the Volturnus, was distributed amongst the Roman plebs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They received two <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign> a head in the Latin territory, their allotment being made up by three-quarters of a <foreign lang="la">jugerum</foreign> in the Privernate district; in the Falernian district they received three entire <foreign lang="la">jugera</foreign>, the additional quarter being allowed owing to the distance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Laurentes, amongst the Latins and the aristocracy of the Campanians, were not thus penalised because they had not revolted. An order was made for the treaty with the Laurentes to be renewed, and it has since been renewed annually on the tenth day after the Latin Festival.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Roman franchise was conferred on the aristocracy of Campania, and a brazen tablet recording the fact was fastened up in Rome in the temple of Castor, and the people of Campania were ordered to pay them each &mdash;they numbered <date value="1600">1600</date> in all &mdash;the sum of 450 <foreign lang="la">denarii</foreign> annually.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The war having been thus brought to a close, and rewards and punishments having been meted out to each according to their deserts, T. Manlius returned to Rome. There seems good reason for believing that only the older men went out to meet him on his arrival, the younger part of the population showed their aversion and detestation for him not only then but all through his life.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Antiates made incursions into the territories of Ostia, Ardea, and Solonia. Manlius' health prevented him from prosecuting this war, so he nominated L. Papirius Crassus as Dictator, and he named L. Papirius Cursor as his Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> No important action was taken by the Dictator against the Antiates, though he had a permanent camp in their country for some months.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This year had been signalised by victories over many powerful nations, and still more by the noble death of one consul, and the stern, never-to-be-forgotten exercise of authority on the part of the other. It was followed by the consulship of Titus Aemilius Mamercinus and Q. Publilius Philo.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They did not meet with similar materials out of which to build a reputation, nor did they study the interests of their country so much as their own or those of the political factions in the republic The Latins resumed hostilities to recover the domain they had lost, but were routed in the Fenectane plains and driven out of their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There Publilius, who had achieved this success, received into surrender the Latin cities who had lost their men there, whilst Aemilius led his army to Pedum. This place was defended by a combined force from Tibur, Praeneste, and Velitrae, and help was also sent from Lanuvium and Antium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the various battles the Romans had the advantage, but at the city itself, and at the camp of the allied forces which adjoined the city, their work had to be done all over again.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consul suddenly abandoned the war before it was brought to a close, because he heard that a
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> triumph had been decreed to his colleague, and he actually returned to Rome to demand a triumph before he had won a victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The senate were disgusted at this selfish conduct, and made him understand that he would have no triumph till Pedum had either been taken or surrendered. This produced a complete estrangement between Aemilius and the senate, and he thenceforth administered his consulship in the spirit and temper of a seditious tribune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As long as he was consul he perpetually traduced the senate to the people, without any opposition from his colleague, who himself also belonged to the plebs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Material for his charges was afforded by the dishonest allocation of the Latin and Falernian domain amongst the plebs, and after the senate, desirous of restricting the consul's authority, had issued an order for the nomination of a Dictator to act against the Latins, Aemilius, whose turn
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> it then was to have the <foreign lang="la">fasces</foreign>, nominated his own colleague, who named Junius Brutus as his Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He made his Dictatorship popular by delivering incriminatory harangues against the senate and also by carrying three measures <note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="ed">These measures practically annihilated the Assembly of Curies as a political power. The first appears to have been a more stringent reenactment of the Valerian and Horatian Law (see Vol. I. p. 201). The second <q direct="unspecified">abolished the right of the patrician senate to reject a decree of the community as unconstitutional...in so far that it had to bring forward its constitutional objections, if it had any such, when the list of candidates was exhibited or the project of law brought in; which practically amounted to a regular announcement of its consent beforehand</q> <bibl>(Mommsen, I. 297).</bibl> The third deprived the patricians of the chance of misusing the uncontrolled powers of the censorship as in the case of Mamercus <bibl>(Vol. I. pp. 247-8).</bibl></note> which were directed against the nobility and were most advantageous to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> plebs. One was that the decisions of the plebs should be binding on all the Quirites; the second, that measures which were brought before the Assembly of centuries should be sanctioned by the patricians before being finally put to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> vote; the third, that since it had come about that both censors could legally be appointed from the plebs, one should in any case be always chosen from that
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> order. The patricians considered that the consul and the Dictator had done more to injure the State by their domestic policy than to strengthen its power by their successes in the field.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls for the next year were L. Furius Camillus and C. Maenius. In order to bring more discredit upon Aemilius for his neglect of his military duties the previous year, the senate insisted that no expenditure of arms and men must be spared in order to reduce and destroy Pedum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The new consuls were peremptorily ordered to lay aside everything else and march at once. The state of affairs in Latium was such that they would neither maintain peace nor undertake war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For war their resources were utterly inadequate, and they were smarting too keenly under the loss of their territory to think of peace. They decided, therefore, on a middle course, namely, to confine themselves to their towns, and if they were informed of any town being attacked, to send assistance to it from
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> the whole of Latium . The people of Tibur and Praeneste, who were the nearest, reached Pedum, but the troops from Aricium, Lanuvium, and Veliternae, in conjunction with the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> Volscians of Antium, were suddenly attacked and routed by Maenius at the river Astura. Camillus engaged the Tiburtines who were much the strongest force, and, though with greater difficulty, achieved a similar success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> During the battle the townsmen made a sudden sortie, but Camillus, directing a part of his army
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> against them, not only drove them back within their walls, but stormed and captured the town, after routing the troops sent to their assistance, all in one day. After this successful attack on one city, they decided to make a greater and bolder effort, and to lead their victorious army on to the complete subjugation of Latium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They did not rest until, by capturing or accepting the surrender of one city after another, they had effected their purpose. Garrisons were placed in the captured towns, after which they returned to Rome to enjoy a triumph which was by universal consent accorded to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> An additional honour was paid to the two consuls in the erection of their equestrian statues in the Forum, a rare incident in that age</p> <p>Before the consular elections for the following year were held, Camillus brought before the senate the question of the future settlement of Latium.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <q direct="unspecified">Senators,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">our military operations in Latium have by the gracious favour of the gods and the bravery of our troops been brought to a successful close.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The hostile armies were cut down at Pedum and the Astura, all the Latin towns and the Volscian Antium have either been stormed or have surrendered and are now held by your garrisons.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> We are growing weary of their constant renewal of hostilities, it is for you to consult as to the best means of binding them to a perpetual peace.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The immortal gods have made you so completely masters of the situation that they have put it into your bands to decide whether there shall be henceforth a Latium or not.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> So far, then, as the Latins are concerned, you can secure for yourselves a lasting peace by either cruelty or kindness. Do you wish to adopt ruthless measures against a people that have surrendered and been defeated?
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> It is open to you to wipe out the whole Latin nation and create desolation and solitude in that country which has furnished you with a splendid army of allies which you have employed in many great wars. Or do you wish to follow the example of your ancestors and make Rome greater by conferring her citizenship on those whom she has defeated?
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The materials for her expansion to a glorious height are here at hand. That is assuredly the most firmly-based empire, whose subjects take a delight in rendering it their obedience.
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> But whatever decision you come to, you must make haste about it You are keeping so many peoples in suspense, with their minds distracted between hope and fear, that you are bound to relieve yourselves as soon as possible from your anxiety about them, and by exercising either punishment or kindness to pre-occupy minds which a state of strained expectancy has deprived of the power of thought.
							<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Our task has been to put you in a position to take the whole question into consultation, your task is to decree what is best for yourselves and for the republic.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The leaders of the senate applauded the way in which the consul had introduced the motion, but as the circumstances differed in different cases they thought that each case ought to be decided upon its merits, and with the view of facilitating discussion they requested the consul to put the name of each place separately.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Lanuvium received the full citizenship and the restitution of her sacred things, with the proviso that the temple and grove of Juno Sospita should belong in common to the Roman people and the citizens living at Lanuvium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Aricium, Nomentum, and Pedum obtained the same political rights as Lanuvium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Tusculum retained the citizenship which it had had before, and the responsibility for the part it took in the war was removed from the State as a whole and fastened on a few individuals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Veliternians, who had been Roman citizens from old times, were in consequence of their numerous revolts severely dealt with; their walls were thrown down, their senate deported and ordered to live on the other side of the Tiber<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed">As rebels, their lives were forfeited, but the sentence was commuted into one of perpetual banishment amongst an alien nationality.</note>;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> if any of them were caught on this side of the river, he was to be fined 1000 <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>, and the man who caught him was not to release him from confinement till the money was paid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Colonists were sent on to the land they had possessed, and their numbers made Velitrae look as populous as formerly.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Antium also was assigned to a fresh body of colonists, but the Antiates were permitted to enrol themselves as colonists if they chose; their warships were taken away, and they were forbidden to possess any more; they were admitted to citizenship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Tibur and Praeneste had their domains confiscated, not owing to the part which they, in common with the rest of Latium, had taken in the war, but because, jealous of the Roman power, they had joined arms with the barbarous nation of the Gauls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The rest of the Latin cities were deprived of the rights of intermarriage, free trade, and common councils with each other. Capua, as a reward for the refusal of its aristocracy to join the Latins, were allowed to enjoy the private rights of Roman citizens, as were also Fundi and Formiae, because they had always allowed a free passage through their territory. It was decided that Cumae and Suessula should enjoy the same rights as Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Some of the ships of Antium were taken
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> into the Roman docks, others were burnt and their beaks (<foreign lang="la">rostra</foreign>) were fastened on the front of a raised gallery which was constructed at the end of the Forum, and which from this circumstance was called the Rostra.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Hostilities on the Samnite Frontiers</note>. &mdash;C. Sulpicius Longus and P. Aelius Paetus were the new consuls. The blessings of peace were now enjoyed everywhere, a peace maintained not more by the power of Rome than by the influence she had acquired through her considerate treatment of her vanquished enemies, when a war broke out between the Sidicines and the Auruncans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After their surrender had been accepted by the consul Manlius, the Auruncans had kept quiet, which gave them a stronger claim to the help of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate decided that assistance should be afforded them, but before

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The senate were angry with the consuls, through whose delay their allies had been betrayed, and ordered a Dictator to be nominated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> C. Claudius Regillensis was nominated accordingly, and he named as his Master of the Horse C. Claudius Portator. There was some difficulty about the religious sanction of the Dictator's appointment, and as the augurs pronounced that there was an

The culprit, covered by a pall and lying in the hearse, was brought through the Forum, the Vicus Longus, and the Alta Semita to the Porta Collina amidst the mourning and dejected crowd of her friends and relatives. let us quote the thrilling account of an execution given by Plutarch: <q direct="unspecified">The Vestal convicted of incest is buried alive in the neighbourhood of the Porta Collina under the Agger of Servius Tullius. Here is a crypt, small in size, with an opening in the vault through which the ladder is lowered; it is furnished with a bed, and oil lamp, and a few scanty provisions, such as bread, water, milk, and oil. These provisions (in fact a refinement of cruelty) are prepared because it would appear a sacrilege to condemn to starvation women formerly consecrated to the gods. The unfortunate culprit is brought here in a covered hearse, to which she is tied with leather straps, so that it is impossible that her sighs and lamentations should be heard by the attendant mourners. The crowd opens silently for the passage of the hearse; not a word is pronounced, not a murmur is heard. Tears stream from the eyes of every spectator. It is impossible to imagine a more horrible sight; the whole city is shaken with terror and sorrow. The hearse being brought to the edge of the opening, the executor cuts the bands and the high priest mutters an inaudible prayer, and lifts up his hands towards the gods, before bidding the culprit good-bye. He follows and assists her to the top of the ladder, and turns back at the fatal instant of her disappearance. As soon as she reaches the bottom, the ladder is removed, the opening is sealed, and a large mass of earth is heaped upon the stone that seals it until the top of the embankment is reached and every trace of the execution made to disappear.</q></q></note></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In this year also Q. Publilius Philo was elected as the first plebeian praetor against the opposition of the consul Sulpicius; the senate, after failing to keep the highest posts in their own hands, showed less interest in retaining the praetorship.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls for the following year were L. Papirius Crassus and Caeso Duillius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was war with the Ausonians; the fact that it was against a new enemy rather than a formidable one made it noticeable.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This people inhabited the city of Cales, and had joined arms with their neighbours, the Sidicines. The combined army of the two cities was routed in a quite insignificant engagement; the proximity of their cities made them all the sooner seek a safety in flight which they did not find in fighting. The senate were none the less anxious about the war, in view of the fact that the Sidicines had so frequently either taken the aggressive themselves or assisted others to do so, or had been the cause of hostilities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They did their utmost, therefore, to secure the election of M. Valerius Corvus, the greatest commander of his day, as consul for the fourth time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> M. Atilius Regulus was assigned to him as his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> To avoid any chance of mistake, the consuls requested that this war might be assigned to Corvus without deciding it by lot.</p><p>After taking over the victorious army from the previous consuls, he marched to Cales, where the war had originated. The enemy were dispirited through the remembrance of the former conflict, and he routed them at the very first attack.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then advanced to an assault upon their walls . Such was the eagerness of the soldiers that they were anxious to bring up the scaling ladders and mount the walls forthwith, but Corvus perceived the difficulty of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> task and preferred to gain his object by submitting his men to the labours of a regular siege rather than by exposing them to unnecessary risks. So he con- structed an <foreign lang="la">agger</foreign> and brought up the <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign> and the turrets close to the walls, but a fortunate circumstance rendered them unnecessary.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> M. Fabius, a Roman prisoner, succeeded in eluding his guards on a festival, and after breaking his chains fastened a rope from a battlement of the wall and let himself down amongst the Roman works.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He induced the commander to attack the enemy while they were sleeping off the effects of their wine and feasting, and the Ausonians were captured, together with their city, with no more trouble than they had previously been routed in the open field. The booty seized was enormous, and after a garrison was placed in Cales the legions were marched back to Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The senate passed a resolution allowing the consul to celebrate a triumph, and in order that Atilius might have a chance of distinguishing himself, both the consuls were ordered to march against the Sidicines.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Before starting they nominated, on the resolution of the senate, L. Aemilius Mamercinus as Dictator, for the purpose of conduct- ing the elections; he named Q. Publilius Philo as his Master of the Horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The consuls elected were T. Veturius and Spurius Postumius. Although there was still war with the Sidicines, they brought forward a proposal to send a colony to Cales in order to anticipate the wishes of the plebs by a voluntary act of kindness.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The senate passed a resolution that 2500 names should be enrolled, and the three commissioners appointed to settle the colonists and allocate the holdings were Caeso Duillius, T. Quinctius, and M. Fabius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new consuls, after taking over the army from their predecessors, entered the enemy's territory and carried their depredations up to the walls of their city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Sidicines had got together an immense army, and were evidently prepared to fight desperately for their last hope; there was also a report that Samnium was being roused into hostilities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A Dictator was accordingly nominated by the consuls on the resolution of the senate &mdash;P. Cornelius Rufinus; the Master of the Horse was M. Antonius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Subsequently a religious difficulty arose through an informality in their nomination, and they resigned their posts. In consequence of a pestilence which followed, it seemed as though all the auspices were tainted by that informality, and matters reverted to an interregnum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were five interreges and under the last one, M. Valerius Corvus, the consuls elected were C. Cornelius (for the second time) and Cn. Domitius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Matters were now quiet, but a rumour of a Gaulish war created as much alarm as an actual invasion, and it was decided that a Dictator should be appointed. M. Papirius Crassus was nominated, his Master of the Horse being P. Valerius Publicola.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst they were raising a stronger levy than was usual in wars near at hand, the reconnoitring parties that had been sent out reported that all was quiet amongst the Gauls.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>For the last two years there had been suspicions of a move ment in Samnium in favour of a change of policy, and as a measure of precaution the Roman army was not withdrawn from the Sidicine territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The landing of Alexander of Epirus near Paestum led the Samnites to make common cause with the Lucanians, but their united forces were defeated by turn in a pitched battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then established friendly relations with Rome, but it is very doubtful how far he would have maintained them had his other enterprises been equally successful.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>In this year a census was taken, the censors being Q. Publilius Philo and Sp. Postumius. The new citizens were assessed and formed into two additional tribes, the Maecian and the Scaptian.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> L. Papirius, the praetor, secured the passage of a law by which the rights of citizenship without the franchise were conferred on the inhabitants of Acerrae.</p> <p>These were the military and civil transactions for the year.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Roman Matrons Guilty of Poisoning.</note> M Claudius Marcellus and T Valerius were the new consuls. I find in the annals Flaccus and Potitus variously given as the consul's cognomen, but the question is of small importance.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>This year gained an evil notoriety, either through the unhealthy weather or through human guilt. I would gladly believe &mdash;and the authorities are not unanimous on the point &mdash; that it is a false story which states that those whose deaths made the year notorious for pestilence were really carried off by poison.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I shall, however, relate the matter as it has been handed down to avoid any appearance of impugning the credit of our authorities.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The foremost men in the State were being attacked by the same malady, and in almost every case with the same fatal results. A maid-servant went to Q. Fabius Maximus, one of the curule aediles, and promised to reveal the cause of the public mischief if the government would guarantee her against any danger in which her discovery might involve her.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Fabius at once brought the matter to the notice of the consuls and they referred it to the senate, who authorised the promise of immunity to be given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> She then disclosed the fact that the State was suffering through the crimes of certain women; those poisons were concocted by Roman matrons, and if they would follow her at once she promised that they should catch the poisoners in the act.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They followed their informant and actually found some women compounding poisonous drugs and some poisons already made up.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> These latter were brought into the Forum, and as many as twenty matrons, at whose houses they had been seized, were brought up by the magistrates' officers. Two of them, Cornelia and Sergia, both members of patrician houses, contended that the drugs were medicinal preparations. The maid-servant, when confronted with them, told them to drink some that they might prove she had given false evidence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They were allowed time to consult as to what they would do, and the bystanders were ordered to retire that they might take counsel with the other matrons. They all consented to drink the drugs, and after doing so fell victims to their own criminal designs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Their attendants were instantly arrested, and denounced a large number of matrons as being guilty of the same offence, out of whom a hundred and seventy were found guilty. Up to that time there had never been a charge of poison investigated in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The whole incident was regarded as a portent, and thought to be an act of madness rather than deliberate wickedness. In consequence of the universal alarm created, it was decided to follow the precedent recorded in the annals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> During the secessions of the plebs in the old days a nail had been driven in by the Dictator, and by this act of expiation men's minds, disordered by civil strife, had been restored to sanity. A resolution was passed accordingly, that a Dictator should be appointed to drive in the nail.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Cnaeus Quinctilius was appointed and named L. Valerius as his Master of the Horse. After the nail was driven in they resigned office.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>L.<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Revolt and Recovery of Privernum and Fundi.</note> Papirius Crassus and L. Plautius Venox were thereupon elected consuls, the former for the second time. At the beginning of the year deputations came from Fabrateria and Luca, places belonging to the Volscians, with a request
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> to be received into the protection al Rome, whose overlordship they would faithfully and loyally acknowledge if they would undertake to defend them from the Samnites The senate acceded to their request, and sent to warn the Samnites against violating the territory of these two cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Samnites took the warning, not because they were anxious for peace, but because they were not yet ready for war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This year a war commenced with Privernum and its ally, Fundi; their commander was a Fundan, Vitrubius Baccus, a man of great distinction not only in his own city but even in Rome, where he had a house on the Palatine, which was afterwards destroyed and the site sold, the place being thenceforth known as the Bacci Prata.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whilst he was spreading devastation far and wide through the districts of Setia, Norba, and Cora, L. Papirius advanced against him and took up a position not far from his camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Vitrubius had neither the prudence to remain within his lines in presence of an enemy stronger than himself nor the courage to fight at a distance from his camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He gave battle whilst his men were hardly clear of their camp, and thinking more of retreating back to it than of the battle or the enemy, was with very little effort put to a decisive defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Owing to the proximity of the camp retreat was easy, and he had not much difficulty in protecting his men from serious loss; hardly any were killed in the actual battle, and only a few in the rear of the crowded fugitives as they were rushing into their camp As soon as it grew dark they abandoned it for Privernum, trusting to stone walls for protection rather than to the rampart round their camp.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The other consul, Plautius, alter ravaging the fields in all directions and carrying off the plunder, led his army into the territory of Fundi. As he was crossing their frontier the senate of Fundi met him and explained that they had not come to intercede for Vitrubius and those who had belonged to his party, but for the people of Fundi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They pointed out that Vitrubius himself had cleared them from all responsibility by seeking shelter in Privernum and not in Fundi, though it was his city. At Privernum, therefore, the enemies of Rome were to be looked for and punished, for they had been faithless both to Fundi and Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The men of Fundi wished for peace; their sympathies were wholly Roman, and they retained a grateful sense of the boon they received when the rights of citizenship were conferred upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They besought the consul to abstain from making war upon an unoffending people; their lands, their city, their own persons and the persons of their wives and children were and would continue to be at the disposal of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The consul commended them for their loyalty and sent despatches to Rome to inform the senate that the Fundans were firm in their allegiance, after which he marched to Privernum. Claudius gives a different account.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> According to him the consul first proceeded against the ringleaders of the revolt, of whom three hundred and fifty were sent in chains to Rome. He adds that the senate refused to receive the surrender because they considered that the Fundans were anxious to escape with the punishment of poor and obscure individuals.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst Privernum was invested by two consular armies, one of the consuls was recalled home to conduct the elections. It was in this year that the <foreign lang="la">carceres</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">The <foreign lang="la">carceres</foreign> were chambers provided with doors in which the chariots with their teams stood till the signal was given, when the doors were flung open and they started on the course. From a mosaic figured in Lanciani they would appear to have been under the imperial gallery, or, as we should perhaps say now, the imperial box.</note> were erected in the Circus Maximus</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The trouble of the war with Privernum was not yet over when a most alarming report of a sudden movement amongst the Gauls reached the senate. Such reports were not often treated lightly. The new consuls, L. Aemilius Mamercinus and C. Plautius, were immediately ordered to arrange their respective commands on the very day they assumed office, namely July 1. The Gaulish war fell to Mamercinus, and he allowed none of those who were called up for service to claim exemption.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It is even asserted that the mob of mechanics and artizans, a class utterly unfit for warfare, were called out. An immense army was concentrated at Veii to check the advance of the Gauls. It was thought better not to march any further in case the enemy took some other route to the City. After a thorough reconnaissance had been made, it was ascertained after a few days that all was quiet as far as the Gauls were concerned, and the whole force was thereupon marched to Privernum.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>From this point there is a twofold story. Some state that the city was stormed and Vitrubius taken alive; other authorities aver that before the final assault the townsmen came out with a caduceus <note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed">This was primarily the wand or staff carried by Hermes, the herald-god, and the term was applied to the staff &mdash;corresponding to our flag of truce &mdash;carried by peace-envoys when approaching the victorious enemy with a view to surrender.</note> and surrendered to the consul, whilst Vitrubius was given up by
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> his own men. The senate, when consulted as to the fate of Vitrubius and the Privernates, instructed the consul to demolish the walls of Privernum and station a strong garrison there, and then to celebrate his triumph. Vitrubius was to be kept in prison until the consul returned and then to be scourged and beheaded; his house on the Palatine was to be razed and his goods devoted to Semo Sancus. The money realised by their sale was melted down into brazen orbs which were deposited in the chapel of Sancus opposite the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> temple of Quirinus. With regard to the senate of Privernum, it was decreed that every senator who had remained in that city after its revolt from Rome should be deported beyond the Tiber on the same conditions as those of Velitrae. After his triumph, when Vitrubius and his accomplices had been put to death, the consul thought that as the senate was satisfied with the punishment of the guilty, he might safely refer to the matter of the Privernates. He addressed the House in the following terms:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/><q direct="unspecified">Since the authors of the revolt, senators, have been visited by the immortal gods and by you with the punishment they deserved, what is your pleasure with regard to the innocent population? Although it is my duty to ask for opinions rather than to give them, I should like to say that in view of the fact that the Privernates are neighbours of the Samnites, with whom peaceful relations are now upon a most uncertain footing, I am anxious that as few grounds of complaint as possible should exist between
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> us and them.</q></p> <p>The question was not an easy one to settle, for the senators were governed largely by their temperaments and some advised a harsh, others a gentler course. The general divergence of opinion was widened by one of the Privernate envoys who was thinking more of the state of things in which he had been born than of his present plight. One of the senators who was advocating sterner measures asked him what punishment he thought
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> his countrymen deserved. He replied: <q direct="unspecified">The punishment which those deserve who assert their liberty.</q> The consul saw that this spirited reply only exasperated those who were already adverse to the cause of the Privernates, and he tried to get a softer answer by a
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> more considerate question. <q direct="unspecified">Well,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">if we spare you now, what sort of a peace may we hope to have with you for the time to come?</q> <q direct="unspecified">A real and lasting one,</q> was the reply, <q direct="unspecified">if its terms be good, but if they are bad, one that will soon be broken.</q> On hearing this, some of the senators exclaimed that he was using open threats, and that it was by such language that even those states which had been pacified were incited
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> to renew hostilities. The better part of the senate, however, put a more favourable construction on his reply, and declared that it was an utterance worthy of a man and a man who loved liberty. Was it, they asked, to be supposed that any people or, for that matter, any individual would remain longer than he could help under conditions which
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> made him discontented? Peace would only be faithfully kept where those who accepted it did so voluntarily; they could not hope that it would be faithfully kept where they sought to reduce men to servitude. The senate was brought to adopt this view mainly by the consul himself who kept repeating to the consulars &mdash;the men who had to state their opinions first &mdash;in a tone loud enough for many to hear, <q direct="unspecified">Men whose first and last thought is their liberty deserve to become Romans.</q> Thus they gained their cause in the senate, and the proposal to confer full citizenship on the Privernates was submitted to the people.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The new consuls were P. Plautius Proculus and P. Cornelius Scapula. The year was not remarkable for anything at home or abroad beyond the fact that a colony was sent to Fregellae which was in the territory of Sidicum and had afterwards belonged to the Volscians.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>There was also a distribution of meat made to the people by M. Flavius on the occasion of his mother's funeral.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There were many who looked upon this as the payment of a bribe to the people under the pretext of honouring his mother's memory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He had been prosecuted by the aediles on the charge of seducing a married woman, and had been acquitted, and this was considered in the light of a dole given in return for the favour shown him at the trial.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It proved also to be the means of his gaining office, for at the next election he was made a tribune of the plebs in his absence and over the heads of competitors who had personally canvassed.</p> <p>Palaeopolis<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Palaeopolis.</note> was a city not far from the present site of Neapolis The two cities formed one community.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The original inhabitants came from Cumae; Cumae traced its origin to Chalcis in Euboea. The fleet in which they had sailed from home gave them the mastery of the coastal district which they now occupy, and after landing in the islands of Aenaria and Pithecusae they ventured to transfer their settlements to the mainland.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>This community, relying on their own strength and on the lax observance of treaty obligations which the Samnites were showing towards the Romans, or possibly trusting to the effect of the pestilence which they had heard was now attacking the City, committed many acts of aggression against the Romans who were living in Campania and the Falernian country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In consequence of this, the consuls, L. Cornelius Lentulus and Q. Publilius Philo, sent the <foreign lang="la">fetials</foreign> to Palaeopolis to demand redress. On hearing that the Greeks, a people valiant in words rather than in deeds, had sent a defiant reply, the people, with the sanction of the senate, ordered war to be made on Palaeopolis.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consuls arranged their respective commands; the Greeks were left for Publilius to deal with; Cornelius, with a second army, was to check any movement on the part of the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As, however, he received intelligence that they intended to advance into Campania in anticipation of a rising there, he thought it best to form a standing camp there.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Both<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War Declared Against Samnium.</note> consuls sent word to the senate that there were very slender hopes of the Samnites remaining at peace. Publilius informed them that 2000 troops from Nola and 4000 Samnites had been admitted into Palaeopolis, more under pressure from Nola than
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> from any great desire for their presence on the part of the Greeks; Cornelius sent the additional information that orders for a general levy had been issued
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> throughout Samnium, and attempts were being openly made to induce the neighbouring communities of Privernum, Fundi, and Formiae to rise.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Under these circumstances it was decided to send ambassadors to the Samnites before actually commencing war. The Samnites sent an insolent reply.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They accused the Romans of wanton aggression, and absolutely denied the charges made against themselves; they declared that the assistance which the Greeks had received was not furnished by their government, nor had they tampered with Fundi and Formiae, for they had no reason to distrust their own strength if it came to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Moreover, it was impossible to disguise the deep irritation which the Samnite nation felt at the conduct of the Roman people in restoring Fregellae
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> after they had taken it from the Volscians and destroyed it, and placing a colony on Samnite territory which the colonists called Fregellae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If this insult and injury were not removed by those responsible for it, they would themselves exert all their strength to get rid of it</p> <p>The Roman ambassadors invited them to submit the questions at issue to arbitration before their common friends, but the Samnites replied: <q direct="unspecified">Why should we beat about the bush?
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> No diplomacy, no arbitration can adjust our quarrel; arms and the fortune of war can alone decide the issue. We must meet in Campania.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To which the Roman replied: <q direct="unspecified">Roman soldiers will march not whither the enemy summons them, but whither their commander leads them.</q></p> <p>Publilius meantime had taken up a suitable position between Palaeopolis and Neapolis in order to prevent them from rendering each other the mutual assistance they had hitherto given. The time for the elections was close at hand, and it would have been most inexpedient for the public interest to recall Publilius, as he was ready to attack the place and in daily expectation of effecting its capture.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> An arrangement was accordingly made with the tribunes of the plebs to propose to the people that at the expiration
							<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> of his term of office Publilius should continue to act as proconsul till the war with the Greeks was brought to a close.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The same step was taken with regard to Cornelius, who had already entered Samnium, and written instructions were sent to him to nominate a Dictator to hold the elections. He nominated M. Claudius Marcellus, and Sp. Postumius was named by him Master of the Horse.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The elections, however, were not held by that Dictator, doubts having been raised as to whether the proper formalities had been observed in his nomination. The augurs, when consulted, declared that they had not been duly observed. The tribunes characterised their action as dishonest and iniquitous.
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <q direct="unspecified">How,</q> they asked, <q direct="unspecified">could they know that there was any irregularity? The consul rose at midnight to nominate the Dictator; he had made no communication to any one either officially or privately about the matter;
								<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> there was no one living who could say that he had seen or heard anything which would vitiate the auspices; the augurs sitting quietly in Rome could not possibly divine what difficulty the consul may have met with in the camp. Who was there who could not see that the irregularity which the augurs had discovered lay in the fact that the Dictator was a plebeian?</q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> These and other objections were raised by the tribunes. Matters, however, reverted to an interregnum, and owing to the repeated adjournment of the elections on one pretext after another, there were no fewer than fourteen interegna. At last L. Aemilius, the fourteenth interrex, declared C. Poetilius and L. Papirius Mugilanus duly elected. In other lists I find Cursor.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When he was invited by the Tarentines into Italy, he received a warning to beware of the water of Acheron and the city of Pandosia; for it was there that the limits of his destiny were fixed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This made him cross over into Italy all the sooner, that he might be as far as possible from the city of Pandosia in Epirus and the river Acheron, which flows from Molossis into the Infernal Marshes and finally empties itself into the Thesprotian Gulf.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> But, as often happens, in trying to avoid his fate he rushed upon it. He won many victories over the nationalities of Southern Italy, inflicting numerous defeats upon the legions of Bruttium and Lucania, capturing the city of Heraclea, a colony of settlers from Tarentum, taking Potentia from the Lucanians, Sipontum from the Apulians, Consentia and Terina from the Bruttii and other cities belonging to the Messapians and Lucanians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He sent three hundred noble families to Epirus to be detained there as hostages.</p> <p>The circumstances under which he met his death were these. He had taken up a permanent position on three hills not far from the city of Pandosia which is close to the frontiers of the Lucanians and Bruttii.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> From this point he made incursions into every part of the enemy's territory, and on these expeditions he had as a bodyguard some two hundred Lucanian refugees, in whose fidelity he placed confidence, but who, like most of their countrymen, were given to changing their minds as their fortunes changed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Continuous rains had inundated the whole country and prevented the three divisions of the army from mutually supporting each other, the level ground between the hills being impassable. While they were in this condition two out of the three divisions were suddenly attacked in the king's absence and overwhelmed.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After annihilating them the enemy invested the third hill, where the king was present in person. The Lucanian refugees managed to communicate with their countrymen, and promised, if a safe return were guaranteed to them, to place the king in their hands alive or dead.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Alexander, with a picked body of troops, cut his way, with splendid courage, through the enemy, and meeting the Lucanian general slew him after a hand to hand fight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then getting together those of his men who were scattered in flight, he rode towards the ruins of a bridge which had been carried away by the floods and came to a river.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Whilst his men were fording it with very uncertain footing, a soldier, almost spent by his exertions and his fears, cursed the river for its unlucky name, and said, <q direct="unspecified">Rightly art thou called Acheros !</q> When these words fell on his ear the king at once recalled to mind the oracular warning, and stopped, doubtful whether to cross or not.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Sotimus, one of his personal attendants, asked him why he hesitated at such a critical moment and drew his attention to the suspicious movements of the Lucanian refugees who were evidently meditating treachery.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The king looked back and saw them coming on in a compact body; he at once drew his sword and spurred his horse through the middle of the river. He had already reached the shallow water on the other side when one of the refugees some distance away transfixed him with a javelin.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He fell from his horse, and his lifeless body with the weapon sticking in it was carried down by the current to that part of the bank where the enemy were stationed. There it was horribly mutilated.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> After cutting it through the middle they sent one half to Consentia and kept the other to make sport of . Whilst they were pelting it at a distance with darts and stones a solitary woman ventured among the rabble who were showing such incredible brutality and implored them to desist. She told them amid her tears that her husband and children were held prisoners by the enemy and she hoped to ransom them with the king's body however much it might have been disfigured.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> This put an end to the outrages. What was left of the limbs was cremated at Consentia by the reverential care of this one woman, and the bones were sent back to Metapontum;
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> from there they were carried to Cleopatra, the king's wife, and Olympias, his sister, the latter of whom was the mother, the former the sister of Alexander the Great.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>I thought it well to give this brief account of the tragic end of Alexander of Epirus, for although Fortune kept him from hostilities with Rome, the wars he waged in Italy entitle him to a place in this history.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the same deities were propitiated in this as in the former one.</p> <p>The new consuls, acting on the orders of the people, sent heralds to deliver a formal declaration of war to the Samnites, and made all their preparations on a much
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> greater scale for this war than for the one against the Greeks. New and unexpected succours were forthcoming, for the Lucanians and Apulians, with whom Rome had up to that time established no relations, came forward with offers to make an
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> alliance and promised armed assistance; a friendly alliance was formed with them. Meantime the operations in Samnium were attended with success, the towns of Allifae, Callifae, and Rufrium passed into the hands of the Romans, and ever since the consuls had entered the country the rest of the territory was ravaged far and wide.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Whilst this war was commencing thus favourably, the other war against the Greeks was approaching its close. Not only were the two towns Palaeopolis and Neapolis cut off from all communication with each other by the enemy's lines, but the townsfolk within the walls were practically prisoners to their own defenders, and were suffering
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> more from them than from anything which the outside enemy could do; their wives and children were exposed to such extreme indignities as are only inflicted when cities are stormed and sacked. A report
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> reached them that succours were coming from Tarentum and from the Samnites. They considered that they had more Samnites than they wanted already within their walls, but the force from Tarentum composed of Greeks, they were prepared to welcome, being Greeks themselves, and through their means they hoped
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> to resist the Samnites and the Nolans no less than the Romans.</p> <p>At last, surrender to the Romans seemed the less of the two evils. Charilaus and Nymphius, the leading men in the
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> city, arranged with one another the respective parts they were to play. One was to desert to the Roman Commander, the other to remain in the city and prepare it for the successful execution
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> of their plot. Charilaus was the one who went to Publilius Philo. After expressing the hope that all might turn out for the good and happiness of Palaeopolis and Rome, he went on to say that he had decided to deliver up the fortifications. Whether in doing this he should be found to have preserved
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> his country or betrayed it depended upon the Roman sense of honour. For himself he made no terms and asked for no conditions, but for his countrymen
						<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> he begged rather than stipulated that if his design succeeded the people of Rome should take into consideration the eagerness with which they sought to renew the old friendly relations, and the risk attending their action rather
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> than their folly and recklessness in breaking the old ties of duty. The Roman commander gave his approval to the proposed scheme and furnished him with 3000 men to seize that part of the city which was in the occupation of the Samnites. L. Quinctius, a military tribune, was in command of this force.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nymphius at the same time approached the Samnite praetor and persuaded him, now that the whole of the Roman fighting force was either round Palaeopolis or engaged in Samnium, to allow him to sail round with the fleet to the Roman seaboard and ravage not only the coastal districts but even the country close to the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But to ensure secrecy he pointed out that it would be necessary to start by night, and that the ships should be at once launched. To expedite matters the whole of the Samnite troops, with the exception of those who were mounting guard in the city, were sent down to the shore.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Here they were so crowded as to impede one another's movements and the confusion was heightened by the darkness and the contradictory orders which Nymphius was giving in order to gain time. Meantime Charilaus had been admitted by his confederates into the city. When the Romans had completely occupied the highest parts of the city, he ordered them to raise a shout, on which the Greeks, acting on the instructions of their leaders kept quiet.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Nolans escaped at the other end of the city and took the road to Nola. The Samnites, shut out as they were from the city, had less difficulty in getting away but when once out of danger they found themselves in a much more sorry flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They had no arms, there was nothing they possessed which was not left behind with the enemy; they returned home stripped and destitute, an object of derision not only to foreigners but even to their own countrymen.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>I am quite aware that there is another view of this transaction, according to which it was the Samnites who surrendered, but in the above account I have followed the authorities whom I consider most worthy of credit Neapolis became subsequently the chief seat of the Greek population, and the fact of a treaty being made with that city renders it all the more probable that the re-establishment of friendly relations was due to them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>As it was generally believed that the enemy had been forced by the siege to come to terms, a triumph was decreed to Publilius. Two circumstances happened in connection with his consulship which had never happened before &mdash;a prolongation of command and a triumph after he had laid down his command.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Revolt of the Lucanians.</note> was followed almost immediately by a war with the Greeks on the eastern coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Tarentines had encouraged the people of Palaeopolis through their long resistance with vain hopes of succour, and when they heard that the Romans had got possession of the place they severely blamed the Palaeopolitans for leaving them in the lurch, as though they were quite guiltless of having behaved in a similar manner themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were furious with the Romans, especially after they found that the Lucanians and Apulians had established friendly relations with them &mdash;for it was in this year that the alliance had been formed &mdash;and they realised that they would be the next to be involved.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They saw that it must soon become a question of either fighting Rome or submitting to her, and that their whole future in fact depended upon the result of the Samnite war. That nation stood out alone, and even their strength was inadequate for the struggle, now that the Lucanians had abandoned them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They believed, however, that these could still be brought back and induced to desert the Roman alliance, if sufficient skill were shown in sowing the seeds of discord between them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>These arguments found general acceptance among a people who were fickle and restless, and some young Lucanians, distinguished for their unscrupulousness rather than for their sense of honour, were bribed to make themselves tools of the war party.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After scourging one another with rods they presented themselves with their backs exposed, in the popular Assembly, and loudly complained that after they had ventured inside the Roman camp, they had been scourged by the consul's orders and were within an ace of losing their heads.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The affair had an ugly look, and the visible evidence removed any suspicion of fraud. The Assembly became greatly excited, and amidst loud shouts insisted upon the magistrates convening the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> When it assembled the senators were surrounded by a crowd of spectators who clamoured for war with Rome, whilst others went off into the country to rouse the peasantry to arms. Even the coolest heads were carried away by the tumult of popular feeling; a decree was passed that a fresh alliance should be made with the Samnites, and negotiations were opened with them accordingly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Samnites did not feel much confidence in this sudden and apparently groundless change of policy, and the Lucanians were obliged to give hostages and allow the Samnites to garrison their fortified places. Blinded by the imposition that had been practised on them and by their furious resentment at it, they made no difficulty about accepting these terms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Shortly afterwards, when the authors of the false charges had removed to Tarentum, they began to see how they had been hoodwinked, but it was then too late, events were no longer in their power, and nothing remained but unavailing repentance.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This year (<date value="-326">326</date> B.C.&gt; was marked by the dawn, as it were, of a new era of liberty for the plebs; creditors were no longer allowed to attach the persons of their debtors. This change in the law was brought about by a signal instance of lust and cruelty upon the part of a moneylender.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> L. Papirius was the man in question. C. Publilius had pledged his person to him for a debt which his father had contracted. The youth and beauty of the debtor which ought to have called forth feelings of compassion only acted as incentives to lust and insult.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Finding that his infamous proposals only filled the youth with horror and loathing, the man reminded him that he was absolutely in his power and sought to terrify him by threats. As these failed to crush the boy's noble instincts, he ordered him to be stripped and beaten.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Mangled and bleeding the boy rushed into the street and loudly complained of the usurer's lust and brutality.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A vast crowd gathered, and on learning what had happened became furious at the outrage offered to one of such tender years, reminding them as it did of the conditions under which they and their children were living.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They ran into the Forum and from there in a compact body to the Senate-house.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In face of this sudden outbreak the consuls felt it necessary to convene a meeting of the senate at once, and as the members entered the House the crowd exhibited the lacerated back of the youth and flung themselves at the feet of the senators as they passed in one by one. The strongest bond and support of credit was there and then overthrown through the mad excesses of one individual.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The consuls were instructed by the senate to lay before the people a proposal <q direct="unspecified">that no man be kept in irons or in the stocks, except such as have been guilty of some crime, and then only till they have worked out their sentence; and, further, that the goods and not the person of the debtor shall be the security for the debt.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> So the <foreign lang="la">nexi</foreign> <note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed">The <foreign lang="la">nexi</foreign> were those who had given personal security, and if they failed to redeem themselves by payment on the given day, they were brought before the praetor to be adjudged(<foreign lang="la">addictus</foreign>) to the creditor, who then took them as his bondsmen. By these laws, therefore, the <foreign lang="la">nexum</foreign> as a form of security was declared illegal.</note> were released, and it was forbidden for any to become <foreign lang="la">nexi</foreign> in the future.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with the Vestinians.</note> Samnite war, the sudden dejection of the Lucanians, and the fact that the Tarentines had been the instigators were quite sufficient in themselves to cause the senators anxiety.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Fresh trouble, however, arose this year through the action of the Vestinians, who made common cause with the Samnites The matter had been a good deal discussed, though it had not yet occupied the attention of the government. In the following year, however, the new consuls, L. Furius Camillus and Junius Brutus Scaeva, made it the very first question to bring before the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Though the subject was no new one, yet it was felt to be so serious that the senators shrank from either taking it up or refusing to deal with it They were afraid that if they left that nation unpunished, the neighboring states might be encouraged to make a similar display of wanton arrogance, while to punish them by force of arms might lead others to fear similar treatment and arouse feelings of resentment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In fact, the whole of these nations &mdash;the Marsi, the Paeligni, and the Marrucini &mdash;were quite as warlike as the Samnites, and in case the Vestinians were attacked would have to be reckoned with as enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The victory, however, rested with that party in the senate who seemed at the time to possess more daring than prudence, but the result showed that Fortune favours the bold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The people, with the sanction of the senate, resolved on war with the Vestinians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The conduct of that war fell by lot to Brutus, the war in Samnium to Camillus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Armies were marched into both countries, and by carefully watching the frontiers the enemy were prevented from effecting a junction. The consul who had the heavier task, L. Furius, was overtaken by a serious illness and was obliged to resign his command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He was ordered to nominate a Dictator to carry on the campaign, and he nominated L. Papirius Cursor, the foremost soldier of his day, Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus being appointed Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The two distinguished themselves by their conduct in the field, but they made themselves still more famous by the conflict which broke out between them, and which almost led to fatal consequences.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The other consul, Brutus, carried on an active campaign amongst the Vestinians without meeting with a single reverse. He ravaged the fields and burnt the farm buildings and crops of enemy, and at last drove him reluctantly into action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A pitched battle was fought, and he inflicted such a defeat on the Vestinians, though with heavy loss on his own side also, that they fled to their camp, but not feeling sufficiently protected by fosse and rampart they dispersed in scattered parties to their towns, trusting to their strong positions and stone walls for their defence. Brutus now commenced an attack upon their towns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The first to be taken was Cutina, which he carried by escalade, after a hot assault by his men, who were eager to avenge the heavy losses they had sustained in the previous battle. This was followed by the capture of Cingilia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He gave the spoil of both cities to his troops as a reward for their having surmounted the walls and gates of the enemy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Samnite War-Conflict between the Dictator and his Master of the Horse.</note> The advance into Samnium was made under doubtful auspices. This circumstance did not portend the result of the campaign, for that was quite favourable,
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> but it did foreshadow the insane passion which the commanders displayed.</p> <p>Papirius was warned by the <foreign lang="la">pullarius</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed">See note 16 to Book X.</note> that it would be necessary to take the auspices afresh. On his departure for Rome for this purpose, he strictly charged the Master of the Horse
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> to keep within his lines and not to engage the enemy. After he had gone Q. Fabius learnt from his scouts that the enemy were showing as much
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> carelessness as if there were not a single Roman in Samnium. Whether it was that his youthful temper resented everything being dependent on the Dictator, or whether he was tempted by the chance offered him of a brilliant success, at any rate, after making the necessary preparations and dispositions he advanced as far as Inbrinium &mdash; for so
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> is the district called &mdash;and fought a battle with the Samnites. Such was the fortune of the fight that had the Dictator himself been present he could have done nothing to make the success more complete. The general did
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> not disappoint his men, nor did the men disappoint their general. The cavalry made repeated charges but failed to break through the massed force opposed to them, and acting on the advice of L. Cominius, a military tribune, they removed the bits from their horses and spurred them on so furiously that nothing could withstand them. Riding down men and armour they spread carnage far and wide.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The infantry followed them and completed the disorder of the enemy. It is said that they lost 20,000 men that day. Some authorities whom I have consulted state that there were two battles fought in the Dictator's absence, and each was a brilliant success. In the oldest writers, however, only one battle is mentioned, and some annalists omit the incident altogether.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In consequence of the vast number slain, a large amount of spoil in the shape of armour and weapons was picked up on the battle-field, and the Master of the Horse had this collected into a huge heap and burnt. His
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> object may have been to discharge a vow to some deity. But if we are to trust the authority of Fabius, he did this to prevent the Dictator from reaping the fruits of his glory, or carrying the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> spoils in his triumph and afterwards placing his name upon them.<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed">The name of the victorious general was generally inscribed on such spoils of the enemy as were offered to a deity, generally either Romulus or Jupiter, and hung up in his temple. We have an instance of an inscription on the spoils in Vol. I. p. 244.</note> The fact also of his sending the despatches announcing his victory to the senate and not to the Dictator would seem to show that he was by no means anxious to allow him any share in the credit of it. At all events the Dictator took it in that night, and whilst everybody else was jubilant at the victory which
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> had been won, he wore an expression of gloom and wrath. He abruptly dismissed the senate and hurried from the Senate-house, repeatedly exclaiming that the authority and dignity of the Dictator would be as completely overthrown by the Master of the Horse as the Samnite legions had been if this contempt of his orders were to remain unpunished. In this angry and
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> menacing mood, he started with all possible speed for the camp. He was unable, however, to reach it before news arrived of his approach, for messengers had started from
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> the City in advance of him, bringing word that the Dictator was coming bent on vengeance, and almost every other word he uttered was in praise of T Manlius.<note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="ed">Papirius was evidently hoping to take T. Manlius for his model and re-enact the scene described in chap. vii.</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Fabius immediately summoned his troops to assembly, and appealed to them to show the same courage with which they had defended the republic from a brave and determined foe in protecting from the unrestrained ferocity of the Dictator the man under whose auspices and generalship they had been victorious.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He was coming, maddened by jealousy, exasperated at another man's merits and good fortune, furious because the republic had triumphed in his absence. If it were in his power to change the fortune of the day, he would rather that victory rested with the Samnites than with the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He kept talking about the contempt of orders as though the reason why he forbade all fighting were not precisely the same as that which makes him vexed now that we have fought.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <emph>Then</emph>, prompted by jealousy, he wanted to suppress the merits of others and deprive of their arms men who were most eager to use them, so as to prevent their being employed in his absence; now he is exasperated and furious because the soldiers were not crippled or defenceless though L. Papirius was not with them, and because Q. Fabius considered himself Master of the Horse and not the lacquey of the Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What would he have done if, as often happens amid the chances of war, the battle had gone against us, seeing that now, after the enemy has been thoroughly defeated and a victory won for the republic which even under his unrivalled generalship could not have been more complete, he is actually menacing the Master of the Horse with punishment! He would, were it in his power, treat all with equal severity, not only the Master of Horse but the military tribunes, the centurions, the men of the rank and file.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Jealousy, like lightning, strikes the summits, and because he cannot reach all he has selected one man as his victim whom he regards as the chief conspirator &mdash;your general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If he should succeed in crushing him and quenching the splendour of his success, he will treat this army as a victor treats the vanquished, and with the same ruthlessness which he has been allowed to practise on the Master of the Horse. In defending his cause they will be defending the liberty of all.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If the Dictator sees that the army is as united in guarding its victory as it was in fighting for it, and that one man's safety is the common concern of all, he will bring himself to a calmer frame of mind. His closing words were: <q direct="unspecified">I entrust my fortunes and my life to your fidelity and courage.</q></p> <p>His words were greeted with universal shouts of approval.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They told him not to be dismayed or depressed, no man should harm him while the legions of Rome were alive.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not long after this the Dictator appeared, and at once ordered the trumpet to sound the Assembly. When silence was restored an usher summoned Q. Fabius, the Master of the Horse. He advanced and stood immediately below the Dictator's tribunal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Dictator began: <q direct="unspecified">Quintus Fabius, inasmuch as the Dictator possesses supreme authority, to which the consuls who exercise the old kingly power, and the praetors who are elected under the same auspices as the
						<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> consuls alike submit, I ask you whether or not you think it right and fitting that the Master of the Horse should bow to that authority?
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Further, I ask you whether as I was aware that I had left the City under doubtful auspices I ought to have jeopardised the safety of the republic in the face of this religious difficulty, or whether I ought to have taken the auspices afresh and so avoided any action till the pleasure of the gods was known? I should also like to know whether, if a religious impediment prevents the Dictator from acting, the Master of the Horse is at liberty to consider himself free and unhampered by such impediment?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> But why am I putting these questions? Surely, if I had gone away without leaving any orders, you ought to have used your judgment in interpreting my wishes and acted accordingly. Answer me this, rather: Did I forbid you to take any action in my absence? Did I forbid you to engage the enemy?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In contempt of my orders, whilst the auspices were still indecisive and the sanctions of religion withheld, you dared
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> to give battle, in defiance of all the military custom and discipline of our ancestors, in defiance of the will of the gods. Answer the questions put to you, but beware of uttering a single word about anything else.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Lictor, stand by him!</q></p> <p>Fabius found it far from easy to reply to each question in detail, and protested against the same man being both accuser and judge in a matter of life and death.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He exclaimed that it would be easier to deprive him of his life than of the glory he had won, and went on to exculpate himself and bring charges against the Dictator.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Papirius in a fresh outburst of rage ordered the Master of the Horse to be stripped and the rods and axes to be got ready. Fabius appealed to the soldiers for help, and as the lictors began to tear off his clothes, he retreated behind the triarii who were now raising a tumult.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their shouts were taken up through the whole concourse, threats and entreaties were heard everywhere.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Those nearest the tribunal, who could be recognised as being within view of the Dictator implored him to spare the Master of the Horse and not with him to condemn the whole army; those furthest off and the men who had closed round Fabius reviled the Dictator as unfeeling and merciless. Matters were rapidly approaching a mutiny.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Even those on the tribunal did not remain quiet; the staff officers who were standing round the Dictator's chair begged him to adjourn the proceedings to the following day to allow his anger to cool and give time for quiet consideration.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They urged that the youthful spirit of Fabius had been sufficiently chastened and his victory sufficiently sullied;
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> they begged him not to push his punishment to extremities or to brand with ignominy not only a youth of exceptional merit but also his distinguished father and the whole Fabian house. When they found their arguments and entreaties alike unavailing, they asked him to look at the angry multitude in front.
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> To add fire to men whose tempers were already inflamed and to provide the materials for a mutiny was, they said, unworthy of a man of his age and experience.
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> If a mutiny did occur, no one would throw the blame of it upon Q. Fabius, who was only deprecating punishment; the sole responsibility would lie on the Dictator for having in his blind passion provoked the multitude to a deplorable struggle with him.
							<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> And as a final argument they declared that to prevent him from supposing that they were actuated by any personal feeling in favour of Fabius, they were prepared to state on oath that they considered the infliction of punishment on Fabius under present circumstances to be detrimental to the interests of the State.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These remonstrances only irritated the Dictator against them instead of making him more peaceably disposed towards Fabius, and he ordered them to leave the tribunal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In vain the ushers demanded silence, neither the Dictator's voice nor those of his officers could be heard owing to the noise and uproar; at last night put an end to the conflict as though it had been a battle.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Master of the Horse was ordered to appear on the following day. As, however, everybody assured him that Papirius was so upset and embittered by the resistance he had met with that he would be more furious than ever, Fabius left the camp secretly and reached Rome in the night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the advice of his father, M. Fabius, who had been thrice consul as well as Dictator, a meeting of the senate was at once summoned.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whilst his son was describing to the senators the violence and injustice of the Dictator, suddenly the noise of the lictors clearing the way in front of the Senate-house was heard and the Dictator himself appeared, having followed him up with some light cavalry as soon as he heard that he had quitted the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Then the contention began again, and Papirius ordered Fabius to be arrested. Though not only the leaders of the senate but the whole House sought to deprecate his wrath, he remained unmoved and persisted in his purpose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then M. Fabius, the father, said: <q direct="unspecified">Since neither the authority of the senate nor the years which I, whom you are preparing to bereave of a son, have reached, nor the noble birth and personal merits of the Master of the Horse whom you yourself appointed, and entreaties such as have often mitigated the fierceness of human foes and pacified the anger of offended deities &mdash;since none of these move you &mdash;I claim the intervention of the tribunes of the plebs and appeal to the people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As you are seeking to escape from the judgment which the army has passed upon you and which the senate is passing now, I summon you before the one judge who has at all events more power and authority than your Dictatorship.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I shall see whether you will submit to an appeal to which a Roman king &mdash;Tullus Hotilius &mdash;submitted.</q> <note anchored="yes" n="14" resp="ed">Alluding to the case of Horatius, Book I. p. 31.</note></p> <p>He at once left the Senate-house for the
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Assembly. Thither the Dictator also proceeded with a small party, whilst the Master of the Horse was accompanied by all the leaders of the senate in a body. They had both taken their places on the rostra when Papirius ordered Fabius to be removed to the space
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> below. His father followed him and turned to Papirius with the remark, <q direct="unspecified">You do well to order us to be removed to a position from which we can speak as private
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> citizens.</q></p> <p>For some time regular debate was out of the question, nothing was heard but mutual
									<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> altercations. At last the loud and indignant tones of the elder Fabius rose above the hubbub as he expatiated on the tyranny and brutality of Papirius. He himself, he said, had been Dictator, and not a single person, not a single plebeian, whether centurion or private soldier, had ever suffered any wrong from
									<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> him. But Papirius would wrest victory and triumph from a Roman commander just as he would from hostile generals. What a difference there was between the moderation shown by the men of old and this new fashion of ruthless
									<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> severity! The Dictator, Quinctius Cincinnatus, rescued the consul, L. Minucius, from a blockade, and the only punishment he inflicted was to leave him as second in command of the
									<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> army. <note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="ed">See Vol. I. pp. 169, 172.</note> L. Furius, after expressing his contempt for the age and authority of M. F. Camillus, incurred a most disgraceful defeat, <note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="ed">See Book Vi. p. 28.</note> but Camillus not only checked his anger for the moment and refrained from putting in his despatches to the people, or rather to the senate, anything reflecting on his colleague, but on his return to Rome, after the senate had allowed him to choose from the consular tribunes one to be associated with him in his command, he actually
									<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> chose L. Furius. Why, even the people themselves, who hold in their hands the sovereign power, have never allowed their feelings to carry them beyond the imposition of a fine even where armies have been lost through the foolhardiness or ignorance
									<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> of their generals. Never up to this day has a commander-inchief been tried for his life because he was defeated. But now generals who have won victories and earned the most splendid triumphs are threatened with the rods and axes, a treatment which the laws of war forbid even
									<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> to the vanquished. What, he asked, would his son have suffered if he had met with defeat, been routed and stripped of his camp? Could that man's rage and violence go beyond
									<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> scourging and killing? It was owing to Q. Fabius that the State was offering up joyous and grateful thanksgivings for victory; it was on his account that the sacred fanes stood open and prayers and libations were being offered at the altars, and the smoke of
									<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> sacrifice was ascending. How fitting it was that this very man should be stripped and torn with rods before the eyes of the Roman people, in sight of the Capitol and the Citadel, in sight of the gods whom he invoked in two battles nor
									<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> invoked in vain! What would be the feelings of the army who had won their victories under his auspices and generalship? What grief would there be in the Roman camp, what exultation among the enemy!</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>The old man wept bitterly as he uttered these protests and expostulations, ever and anon throwing his arms round his son and appealing for help to gods and men.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He had on his side the support of the august and venerable senate, the sympathy of the people, the protection of the tribunes, and the remembrance of the absent army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the other side were pleaded the unquestioned sovereign power of the Roman people and all the traditions of military discipline, the Dictator's edict which had ever been regarded as possessing divine sanction, and the example of Manlius who had sacrificed his affection for his son to the interests of the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Brutus too, urged the Dictator, the founder of Roman freedom, had done this before in the case of his two children. Now fathers were indulgent, and aged men, easy-going in matters that do not touch themselves, were spoiling the young men, teaching them to despise authority and treating military discipline as of little importance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He declared his intention of adhering to his purpose, he would not abate a single jot of the punishment due to the man who had fought in defiance of his injunctions, while the auspices were doubtful and the religious sanction withheld.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Whether the supreme authority of the Dictator was to remain unimpaired did not depend on him; he, L. Papirius, would do nothing to weaken its power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He sincerely hoped that the tribunes would not use their authority, itself inviolable, to violate by their interference the sovereignty of the Roman government, and that the people to whom the appeal had been made would not extinguish in his case especially Dictator and Dictatorship alike.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> <q direct="unspecified">If it did, it will not be L. Papirius but the tribunes, the corrupt judgment of the people that posterity will accuse and accuse in vain.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the bond of military discipline has once been broken no soldier will obey his centurion, no centurion his military tribune, no military tribune his general, no Master of the Horse the Dictator.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> No one will have any reverence or respect for either men or gods, no observance will be shown to the orders of commanders or the auspices under which they acted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Without obtaining leave of absence soldiers will roam at will through friendly or hostile country; in total disregard of their military oath they will abandon their standards when and where they chose, they will refuse to assemble when ordered, they will fight regardless of day or night, whether the ground were favourable or unfavourable, whether their commander has given orders or not, keeping no formation, no order.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Military service, instead of being the solemn and sacred thing it is, will resemble wild and disorderly brigandage. Expose yourselves, tribunes, to all future ages as the authors of these evils! Make yourselves personally responsible for the criminal recklessness of Q. Fabius!</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The tribunes were dismayed and felt more anxiety now about their own position than about the man who had sought their protection. They were relieved from their heavy responsibility by the action of the people; the whole Assembly appealed to the Dictator and besought him with earnest entreaties that he would for their sakes forego inflicting punishment on the Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the tribunes saw the turn matters had taken they added their entreaties also, and implored the Dictator to make allowance for human frailty and to pardon Q. Fabius for an error natural to youth, for he had already suffered punishment enough.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And now the youth himself, and even his father, abandoning all further contention, fell on their knees and sought to turn aside the Dictator's anger.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At last, when silence was restored, the Dictator spoke. <q direct="unspecified">This, Quirites,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">is as it should be. Military discipline has conquered, the supreme authority of government has prevailed; it was a question whether either would survive this day's proceedings.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Q. Fabius is not acquitted of guilt in having fought against his commander's orders, but though condemned as guilty he is restored as a free gift to the people of Rome, to the authority of the tribunes, who protected him not by exercising their legal powers but by their intercession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Live, Q. Fabius; happier now in the unanimous desire of your fellow-citizens to defend you than in the hour of exultation after your victory! Live, though you dared to do what even your father, had he been in the place of Papirius, could not have pardoned!
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As for me, you shall be restored to favour whenever you please. But to the Roman people to whom you owe your life you can make no better return than to show that you have this day learnt the lesson of submission to lawful commands in peace and in war.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After announcing that he would no longer detain the Master of the Horse he left the rostra. The joyful senate, the still more joyful people, flocked round the Dictator and the Master of the Horse, and congratulated them on the result and then escorted them to their homes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was felt that military authority had been strengthened no less by the peril in which Q. Fabius had been placed than by the terrible punishment of young Manlius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>It so happened that on each occasion on which the Dictator was absent from the army, the Samnites showed increased activity. M. Valerius, however, the second in command, who was in charge of the camp, had the example of Q. Fabius before his eyes and dreaded the stern Dictator's anger more than an attack from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A foraging party were ambushed and cut to pieces, and it was commonly believed that they could have been relieved from the camp had not the commanding officer been deterred by the peremptory orders he had received.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This incident still further embittered the feelings of the soldiers who were already incensed against the Dictator owing to his implacable attitude towards Fabius and then to his having pardoned him at the request of the people alter having refused to do so on their intercession.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Defeat of the Samnites.</note> placing L. Papirius Crassus in command al the City and prohibiting Q. Fabius from any action in his capacity as Master of the Horse, the Dictator returned to the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> His arrival was not viewed with much pleasure by his own men, nor did it create any alarm amongst the enemy. For the very next day, either unaware al his presence or regarding it of small importance whether he were present or absent, they marched towards the camp in order of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> And yet so much depended upon that one man, L. Papirius, such care did he show in choosing his ground and posting his reserves, so far did he strengthen his force in every way that military skill could suggest, that if the general's tactics' had been backed up by the goodwill of the troops it was considered absolutely certain that the Samnite war would that day have been brought to a close.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As it was, the soldiers showed no energy; they deliberately threw the victory away that their commander's reputation might be damaged. The Samnites lost a larger proportion of killed, the Romans had more wounded.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The quick eye of the general saw what prevented his success, and he realised that he must curb his temper and soften his sternness by greater affability.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He went round the camp accompanied by his staff and visited the wounded, putting his head inside their tents and asking them how they were getting on, and commending them individually by name to the care of his staff officers, the military tribunes, and prefects.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In adopting this course, which naturally tended to make him popular, he showed so much tact that the feelings of the men were much sooner won over to their commander now that their bodies were being properly looked after. Nothing conduced more to their recovery than the gratitude they felt for his attention.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> When the health of the army was completely restored he gave battle to the enemy, both he and his men feeling quite confident of victory, and he so completely defeated and routed the Samnites that this was the last occasion on which they ventured on a regular engagement with the Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After this the victorious army advanced in every direction where there was any prospect of plunder, but wherever they marched they found no armed force; they were nowhere openly attacked or surprised from ambush.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They showed all the greater alertness because the Dictator had issued an order that the whole of the spoil was to be given to the soldiers; the chance of private gain stimulated their warlike spirit quite as much as the consciousness that they were avenging the wrongs of their country.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Cowed by these defeats, the Samnites made overtures for peace and gave the Dictator an undertaking to supply each of the soldiers with a set of garments and a year's pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> On his referring them to the senate they replied that they would follow him to Rome and trust their cause solely to his honour and rectitude. The army was thereupon withdrawn from Samnium.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Dictator made a triumphal entry into the City, and as he wished to lay down his office, he received instructions from the senate before doing so to conduct the consular elections.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The new consuls were C. Sulpicius Longus (for the second time) and Q. Aemilius Cerretanus. The Samnites did not succeed in obtaining a permanent peace, as they could not agree on the conditions; they took back with them a truce for one year.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But even this was soon broken, for when they heard that Papirius had resigned they were eager to renew hostilities.</p> <p>The new consuls &mdash;some authorities give Aulus instead of Aemilius for the second consul &mdash;had on their hands a fresh enemy, the Apulians, in addition to the revolt of the Samnites Armies were despatched against both;
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the Samnites were allotted to Sulpicius, the Apulians to Aemilius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Some writers assert that it was not against the Apulians that the campaign was undertaken, but for the protection of their allies against the wanton aggressions of the Samnites The circumstances of that people, however, who were hardly able to defend themselves, make it more probable that they had not attacked the Apulians but that both nations were united in hostilities against Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Nothing noteworthy took place; the districts of both Samnium and Apulia were laid waste, but neither in the one nor the other was the enemy met with.</p> <p>At Rome the citizens were one night suddenly aroused from sleep by an alarm so serious that the Capitol, the Citadel, the walls, and gates were filled with troops.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The whole population was called to arms, but when it grew light neither the author nor the cause of the excitement was discovered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Appeal of Tusculum.</note> this year M. Flavius, a tribune of the plebs, brought before the people a proposal to take measures against the Tusculans, <q direct="unspecified">by whose counsel and assistance the peoples of Velitrae and Privernum had made war against the people of Rome.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The people of Tusculum came to Rome with their wives and children in mourning garb, like men awaiting trial, and went from tribe to tribe prostrating themselves before the tribesmen. The compassion which their attitude called out went further to procure their pardon than their attempts to exculpate themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> All the tribes, with the exception of the Pollian tribe, vetoed the proposal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> That tribe voted for a proposal that all the adult males should be scourged and beheaded, and their wives and children sold into slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Even as late as the last generation the Tusculans retained the memory of that cruel sentence, and their resentment against its authors showed itself in the fact that the Papirian tribe (in which the Tusculans were afterwards incorporated) hardly ever voted for any candidate belonging to the Pollian tribe.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Samnites again Defeated.</note> . Fabius and L. Fulvius were the consuls for the following year. The war in Samnium was threatening to take a more serious turn, as it was stated that mercenary troops had been hired from the neighbouring states. The apprehensions created led to the nomination of A. Cornelius Arvina as Dictator, with M. Fabius Ambustus as Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> These commanders carried out the enrolment with unusual strictness, and led an exceptionally fine army into Samnium. But although they were on hostile territory, they exercised as little caution in choosing the site for their camp as though the enemy had been at a great distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Suddenly the Samnite legions advanced with such boldness that they encamped with their rampart close to the Roman outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The approach of night prevented them from making an immediate attack; they disclosed their intention as soon as it grew light the next morning.</p> <p>The Dictator saw that a battle was nearer than he expected, and he determined to abandon a position which would hamper the courage of his men Leaving a number of watch-fires alight to deceive the enemy, he silently
						<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> withdrew his troops, but owing to the proximity of the camps his movement was not unobserved. The Samnite cavalry immediately followed on his heels but refrained from actual attack till it grew lighter, nor did the infantry emerge from their camp before daybreak.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As soon as they could see, the cavalry began to harass the Roman rear, and by pressing upon them where difficult ground had to be crossed, considerably delayed their advance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Meantime the infantry had come up, and now the entire force of the Samnites was pressing on the rear of the column.</p> <p>As the Dictator saw that no further advance was possible without heavy loss, he ordered the ground he was holding to be measured out for a camp. But as the enemy's cavalry was gradually enveloping them, it was impossible to procure wood for the stockade or to commence their entrenchment.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Finding that to go forward and to remain where he was were equally out of the question, the Dictator ordered the baggage to be removed from the column and collected and the line of battle formed.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The enemy formed also into line, equally matched in courage and in strength. Their confidence was increased by their attributing the retirement of the Romans to fear and not, as was actually the case, to the disadvantageous position of their camp.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This made the fight for some considerable time an even one, though the Samnites had long been unaccustomed to stand the battle-shout of the Romans. We read that actually from nine o'clock till two in the afternoon the contest was maintained so equally on both sides that the shout which was raised at the first onset was never repeated, the standards neither advanced nor retreated, in no direction was there any giving way. They fought, each man keeping his ground, pressing forward with their shields, neither looking back nor pausing for breath.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their noise and tumult never grew weaker, the fighting went on perfectly steadily, and it looked as if it would only be terminated by the complete exhaustion of the combatants or the approach of night.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>By this time the men were beginning to lose their strength and the sword its vigour, whilst the generals were baffled. A troop of Samnite cavalry, who had ridden some distance round the Roman rear, discovered that their baggage was lying at a distance from the combatants without any guard or protection of any kind. On learning this the whole of the cavalry rode up to it eager to secure the plunder.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A messenger in hot haste reported this to the Dictator, who remarked: <q direct="unspecified">All right, let them encumber themselves with spoil.</q> Then the soldiers one after another began to exclaim that their belongings were being plundered and carried off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The Dictator sent for the Master of the Horse. <q direct="unspecified">Do you see,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">M. Fabius, that the enemy's cavalry have left the fight? They are hampering and impeding themselves with our baggage.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Attack them whilst they are scattered, as plundering parties always are; you will find very few of them in the saddle, very few with swords in their hands. Cut them down whilst they are loading their horses with spoil, with no weapons to defend themselves, and make it a bloody spoil for them!
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> I will look after the infantry battle, the glory of the cavalry victory shall be yours.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The cavalry force, riding in perfect order, charged the enemy whilst scattered and hampered by their plunder and filled the whole place with carnage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Incapable of either resistance or flight they were cut down amongst the packages which they had thrown away and over which their startled horses were stumbling.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After almost annihilating the enemy's cavalry, M. Fabius led his cavalry by a short circuit round the main battle and attacked the Samnite infantry from behind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The fresh shouting which arose in that direction threw them into a panic, and when the Dictator saw the men in front looking round, the standards getting into confusion, and the whole line wavering, he called upon his men and encouraged them to fresh efforts; he appealed to the military tribunes and first cen- turions by name to join him in renewing the fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They again raised the battle-shout and pressed forward, and wherever they advanced they saw more and more demoralisation amongst the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The cavalry were now within view of those in front, and Cornelius, turning round to his maniples, indicated as well as he could by voice and hand that he recognised the standards and bucklers of his own cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> No sooner did they see and hear them than, forgetting the toil and travail they had endured for almost a whole day, forgetting their wounds, and as eager as though they had just emerged fresh from their camp after receiving the signal for battle, they flung themselves on the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Samnites could no longer bear up against the terrible onset of the cavalry behind them and the fierce charge of the infantry in front. A large number were killed between the two, many were scattered in flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The infantry accounted for those who were hemmed in and stood their ground, the cavalry created slaughter among the fugitives; amongst those killed was their commander-in-chief.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>This battle completely broke down the resistance; so much so that in all their councils peace was advocated. It could not, they said, be a matter of surprise that they met with no success in an unblest war, undertaken in defiance of treaty obligations, where the gods were more justly incensed against them than men. That war would have to be expiated and atoned for at a great cost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The only question was whether they should pay the penalty by sacrificing the few who were guilty or shedding the innocent blood of all. Some even went so far as to name the instigators of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> One name, especially, was generally denounced, that of Brutulus Papius. He was an aristocrat and possessed great influence, and there was not a shadow of doubt that it was he who had brought about the breach of the recent truce.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The praetors found themselves compelled to submit a decree which the council passed, ordering Brutulus Papius to be surrendered and all the prisoners and booty taken from the Romans to be sent with him to Rome, and further that the redress which the fetials had demanded in accordance with treaty-rights should be made as law and justice demanded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Brutulus escaped the ignominy and punishment which awaited him by a voluntary death, but the decree was carried out; the fetials were sent to Rome with the dead body, and all his property was surrendered with him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> None of this, however, was accepted by the Romans beyond the prisoners and whatever articles amongst the spoil were identified by the owners; so far as anything else was concerned, the surrender was fruitless.</p><p>The senate decreed a triumph for the Dictator.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Some authorities state that this war was managed by the consuls and it was they who celebrated the triumph over the Samnites, and further that Fabius invaded Apulia and brought away great quantities of spoil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There is no discrepancy as to A. Cornelius having been Dictator that year, the only doubt is whether he was appointed to conduct the war, or whether, owing to the serious illness of L. Plautius, the praetor, he was appointed to give the signal for starting the chariot races, and after discharging this not very noteworthy function resigned office.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It is difficult to decide which account or which authority to prefer.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I believe that the true history has been falsified by funeral orations and lying inscriptions on the family busts, since each family appropriates to itself an imaginary record of noble deeds and official distinctions. It is at all events owing to this cause that so much confusion has been introduced into the records of private careers and public events.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> T. Veturius Calvinus and Spurius Postumius were the consuls. The Samnites had for their captain-general that year C. Pontius, the son of Herennius, the ablest statesman they possessed, whilst the son
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> was their foremost soldier and commander.</p><p>When the envoys who had been sent with the terms of surrender returned from their fruitless mission, Pontius made the following speech in the Samnite council: <q direct="unspecified">Do not suppose that this mission has been barren of results.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> We have gained this much by it, whatever measure of divine wrath we may have incurred by our violation of treaty obligations has now been atoned for. I am perfectly certain that all those deities whose will it was that we should he reduced to the necessity of making the restitution which was demanded under the terms of the treaty, have viewed with displeasure the haughty contempt with which the Romans have treated our concessions.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> What more could we have done to placate the wrath of heaven or soften the resentment of men than we have done?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The property of the enemy, which we considered ours by the rights of war, we have restored; the author of the war, whom we could not surrender alive, we gave up after he had paid his debt to nature, and lest any taint of guilt should remain with us we carried his possessions to Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> What more, Romans, do I owe to you or to the treaty or to the gods who were invoked as witnesses to the treaty? What arbitrator am I to bring forward to decide how far your wrath, how far my punishment is to go?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> I am willing to accept any, whether it he a nation or a private individuaI. But if human law leaves no rights which the weak share with the stronger, I can still fly to the gods, the avengers of intolerable tyranny, and I will pray them to turn their wrath against those for whom it is not enough to have
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> their own restored to them and to he loaded also with what belongs to others, whose cruel rage is not satiated by the death of the guilty and the surrender of their lifeless remains together with their property, who cannot he appeased unless we give them our very blood to suck and our bowels to tear.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A war is just and right, Samnites, when it is forced upon us; arms are blessed by heaven when there is no hope except in arms.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Since then it is of supreme importance in human affairs what things men do under divine favour and what they do against the divine will, he well assured that, if in your former wars you were fighting against the gods even more than against men, in this war which is impending you will have the gods themselves to lead you.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After uttering this prediction, which proved to he as true as it was reassuring, he took the field and, keeping his movements as secret as possible, fixed his camp in the neighbourhood of Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> From there he sent ten soldiers disguised as shepherds to Calatia, where he understood that the Roman consuls were encamped, with instructions to pasture some cattle in different directions near the Roman outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they fell in with any foraging parties they were all to tell the same story, and say that the Samnite legions were in Apulia investing Luceria with their whole force and that its capture was imminent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This rumour had purposely been spread before and had already reached the ears of the Romans; the captured shepherds confirmed their belief in it, especially as their statements all tallied.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was no doubt but that the Romans would assist the Lucerians for the sake of protecting their allies and preventing the whole of Apulia from being intimidated by the Samnites into open revolt. The only matter for consideration was what route they would take.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There were two roads leading to Luceria; one along the Adriatic Coast through open country, the longer one of the two but so much the safer; the other and shorter one through the Caudine Forks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This is the character of the spot; there are two passes, deep, narrow, with wooded hills on each side, and a continuous chain of mountains extends from one to the other. Between them lies a watered grassy plain through the middle of which the road goes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Before you reach the plain you have to pass through the first defile and either return by the same path by which you entered or, if you go on, you must make your way out by a still narrower and more difficult pass at the other end.</p> <p>The Roman column descended into this plain from the first defile with its overhanging cliffs, and marched straight through to the other pass.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They found it blocked by a huge barricade of felled trees with great masses of rock piled against them. No sooner did they become aware of the enemy's stratagem than his outposts showed themselves on the heights above the pass.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> A hasty retreat was made, and they proceeded to retrace their steps by the way they had come when they discovered that this pass also had its own barricade and armed men on the heights above. Then without any order being given they called a halt. Their senses were dazed and stupefied and a strange numbness seized their limbs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Each gazed at his neighbour, thinking him more in possession of his senses and judgment than himself. For a long time they stood silent and motionless, then they saw the consuls' tents being set up and some of the men getting their entrenching tools ready.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Though they knew that in their desperate and hopeless plight it would he ridiculous for them to fortify the ground on which
						<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> they stood still, not to make matters worse by any fault of their own they set to work without waiting for orders and entrenched their camp with its rampart close to the water.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> While they were thus engaged the enemy showered taunts and insults upon them, and they themselves in bitter mockery jeered at their own fruitless labour.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The consuls were too much depressed and unnerved even to summon a council of war, for there was no place for either counsel or help, but the staff-officers and tribunes gathered round them, and the men with their faces turned towards their tents sought from their leaders a succour which the gods themselves could hardly render them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Night surprised them while they were lamenting over their situation rather than consulting how to meet it The different temperaments of the men came out; some exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">Let us break through the barricades, scale the mountain slopes, force our way through the forest, try every way where we can carry arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Only let us get at the enemy whom we have beaten for now nearly thirty years; all places will he smooth and easy to a Roman fighting against the perfidious Samnite.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Others answered: <q direct="unspecified">Where are we to go? How are we to get there? Are we preparing to move the mountains from their seat? How will you get at the enemy as long as these peaks hang over us? Armed and unarmed, brave and cowardly we are all alike trapped and conquered. The enemy will not even offer us the chance of an honourable death by the sword, he will finish the war without moving from his seat.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Indifferent to food, unable to sleep, they talked in this way throughout he night.</p><p>Even the Samnites were unable to make up their minds what to do under such fortunate circumstances. It was unanimously agreed to write to Herennius, the captain-general's father, and ask his advice.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was now advanced in years and had given up all public business, civil as well as military, but though his physical powers were failing his intellect was as sound and clear as ever.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He had already heard that the Roman armies were hemmed in between the two passes at the Caudine Forks, and when his son's courier asked for his advice he gave it as his opinion that the whole force ought to he at once allowed to depart uninjured.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This advice was rejected and the courier was sent back to consult him again.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He now advised that they should every one he put to death. On receiving these replies, contradicting each other like the ambiguous utterances of an oracle, his son's first impression was that his father's mental powers had become impaired through his physical weakness. However, he yielded to the unanimous wish and invited his father to the council of war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The old man, we are told, at once complied and was conveyed in a wagon to the camp. After taking his seat in the council, it became clear from what he said that he had not changed his mind, but he explained his reasons for the advice he gave.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He believed that by taking the course he first proposed, which he considered the best, he was establishing a durable peace and friendship with a most powerful people in treating them with such exceptional kindness; by adopting the second he was postponing war for many generations, for it would take that time for Rome to recover her strength painfully and slowly after the loss of two armies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There was no third course. When his son and the other chiefs went on to ask him what would happen if a middle course were taken, and they were dismissed unhurt but under such conditions as by the rights of war are imposed on the vanquished, he replied:
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <q direct="unspecified">That is just the policy which neither procures friends nor rids us of enemies. Once let men whom you have exasperated by ignominious treatment live and you will find out your mistake.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Romans are a nation who know not how to remain quiet under defeat. Whatever disgrace this present extremity burns into their souls will rankle there for ever, and will allow them no rest till they have made you pay for it many times over.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Neither of these plans was approved and Herennius was carried home from the camp.</p><p>In the Roman camp, after many fruitless attempts had been made to break out and
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> they found themselves at last in a state of utter destitution, necessity compelled them to send envoys to the Samnites to ask in the first instance for fair terms of peace, and failing that to challenge them to battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Pontius replied that all war was at an end, and since even now that they were vanquished and captured they were incapable of acknowledging their true position, he should deprive them of their arms and send them under the yoke, allowing them to retain one garment each.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other conditions would he fair to both victors and vanquished. If they evacuated Samnium and withdrew their colonists from his country, the Roman and
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> the Samnite would henceforth live under their own laws as sovereign states united by a just and honourable treaty. On these conditions he was ready to conclude a treaty with the consuls, if they rejected any of them he forbade any further overtures to he made to him.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the result was announced, such a universal cry of distress arose, such gloom and melancholy prevailed, that they evidently could not have taken it more heavily if it had been announced to them all that they must die on the spot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then followed a long silence. The consuls were unable to breathe a word either in favour of a capitulation so humiliating or against one so necessary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At last L. Lentulus, of all the staff-officers the most distinguished, both by his personal qualities and the offices he had held, spoke: <q direct="unspecified">I have often,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">heard my father, consuls, say that he was the only one in the Capitol who refused to ransom the City from the Gauls with gold, for the force in the Capitol was not invested and shut in with fosse and rampart, as the Gauls were to indolent to undertake that sort of work; it was therefore quite possible for them to make a sortie involving, perhaps, heavy loss, but not certain destruction.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> If we had the same chance of fighting, whether on favourable or unfavourable ground, which they had of charging down upon the foe from the capitol, in the same way as the besieged have often made sorties against their besiegers, I should not fall behind my father's spirit and courage in the advice which I should give.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> To die for one's country is, I admit, a glorious thing, and as concerns myself I am ready to devote myself for the people and legions of Rome or to plunge into the midst of the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But it is here that I beheld my country, it is on this spot that all the legions which Rome possesses are gathered, and unless they wish to rush to death for their own sakes, to save their honour, what else have they that they can save by their death.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> <q direct="unspecified">The dwellings of the City,</q> somebody may reply, <q direct="unspecified">and its walls, and that crowd of human beings who form its population.</q> Nay, on the contrary, all these things are not saved, they are handed over to the enemy if this army is annihilated.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> For who will protect them? A defenceless multitude of non-combatants, I suppose; as successfully as it defended them from the approach of the Gauls.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Or will they implore the help of an army from Veii with Camillus at its head? Here and here alone are all our hopes, all our strength. If we save these we save our country, if we give these up to death we desert and betray our country.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> <q direct="unspecified">Yes,</q> you say, <q direct="unspecified">but surrender is base and ignominious.</q> It is; but true affection for our country demands that we should preserve it, if need be, by our disgrace as much as by our death.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> However great then the indignity, we must submit to it and yield to the compulsion of necessity, a compulsion which the gods themselves cannot evade! Go, consuls, give up your arms as a ransom for that State which your ancestors ransomed with gold!</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls left to confer with Pontius. When the victor began to insist upon a treaty, they told him that a treaty could not possibly be made without the orders of the people nor without the fetials and the usual ceremonial.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> So that the convention of Claudium did not, as is commonly believed and as even Claudius asserts, take the form of a regular treaty. It was concluded through a <foreign lang="la">sponsio</foreign>, i.e. by the officers giving their word of honour to observe the conditions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> For what need would there have been in the case of a treaty for any pledge from the officers or for any hostages, since in concluding a treaty the imprecation <note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="ed">The full form is given in Vol. I. p. 28.</note> is always used: <q direct="unspecified">By whosoever default it may come about that the said conditions are not observed, may Jupiter so smite that people as this swine is new struck by the
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> fetials.</q></p> <p>The consuls, the staff - officers, the quaestors, and the military tribunes all gave their word on oath, and all their names are extant to-day, whereas if a regular treaty had been concluded no names but those of the two fetials would have
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> survived.</p> <p>Owing to the inevitable delay in arranging a treaty, 6oo equites were demanded as hostages to answer with their lives if the terms of the capitulation were not
								<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> observed. <note anchored="yes" n="2" resp="ed">The officers gave their pledged word to do their utmost to induce the senate and people to conclude a treaty with the Samnites. Their failure involved the fate of hostages.</note> Then a definite time was fixed for surrendering the hostages and sending the army, deprived of its arms, under the yoke.</p><p>The return of the consuls with the terms of surrender henewed the grief and distress in the camp. So bitter was the feeling that the men had difficulty in keeping their hands off those <q direct="unspecified">through whose rashness,</q> they said, <q direct="unspecified">they had been brought into that place and through whose cowardice
									<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> they would have to leave it in a more shameful plight than they
									<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> had come. They had had no guides who knew the neighbourhood, no scouts had been thrown out, they had fallen blindly like wild animals into a trap.</q> There they were, looking at each other, gazing sadly at the armour and weapons which were soon to be given up, their right hands which were to be defenceless, their bodies which were to be at the mercy of
									<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> their enemies. They pictured to themselves the hostile yoke, the taunts and insulting looks of the victors, their marching disarmed between the armed ranks, and then afterwards the miserable progress of an army in disgrace through the cities of their allies, their return to their country and their parents, whither their ancestors had so often returned in
									<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> triumphal procession. They alone, they said, had been defeated without receiving a single wound, or using a single weapon, or fighting a single battle; they had not been allowed to draw the sword or come to grips with the enemy; courage and strength had been given them in vain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>While they were uttering these indignant protests, the hour of their humiliation arrived which was to make everything more bitter for them by actual experience than they had anticipated
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> or imagined. First of all they were ordered to lay down their arms and go outside the rampart with only one garment each. The first to be dealt with were those surrendered as hostages who were taken away for
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> safe keeping. Next, the lictors were ordered to retire from the consuls, who were then stripped of
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> their <foreign lang="la">paludamenta</foreign>. This aroused such deep commiseration amongst those who a short time ago had been cursing them and saying that they ought to be surrendered and scourged, that every man, forgetting his own plight, turned away his eyes from such an outrage upon the majesty of state as from a spectacle too horrible to behold.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls were the first to be sent, little more than half-clothed, under the yoke, then each in the order of his rank was exposed to the same disgrace, and finally, the legionaries one after another.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Around them stood the enemy fully armed, reviling and jeering at them; swords were pointed at most of them, and when they offended their victors by showing their indignation and resentment too plainly some were wounded and even killed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Return of the Roman Army</note>. &mdash;Thus were they marched under the yoke. But what was still harder to bear was that after they had emerged from the pass under the eyes of the foe, though, like men dragged up from the jaws of hell, they seemed to behold the light for the first time, the very light itself, serving only to reveal such a hideous sight as they marched along, was more gloomy than any shape of death.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They could have reached Capua before nightfall, but not knowing how their allies would receive them, and kept back by a feeling of shame, they all flung themselves, destitute of everything, on the sides of the road near Capua.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As soon as news of this reached the place, a proper feeling of compassion for their allies got the better of the inborn disdain of the Campanian;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> they immediately sent to the consuls their own insignia of office, the fasces and the lictors, and the soldiers they generously supplied with arms, horses, clothes, and provisions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> As they entered Capua the senate and people came out in a body to meet them, showed them all due hospitality, and paid them all the consideration to which as individuals and as members of an allied state they were entitled.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> But all the courtesies and kindly looks and cheerful greetings of their allies were powerless to evoke a single word or even to make them lift up their eyes and look in the face the friends who were trying to comfort them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To such an extent did feelings of shame make their gloom and
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> despondency all the heavier, and constrain them to shun the converse and society of men.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The next day some young nobles were commissioned to escort them to the frontier. On their return they were summoned to the Senate-house, and in answer to inquiries on the part of the older senators they reported that they seemed to be much more gloomy and depressed than the day before;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> the column moved along so silently that they might have been dumb; the Roman mettle was cowed; they had lost their spirit with their arms; they saluted no man, nor did they return any man's salutation; not a single man had the power to open his mouth for fear of what was coming; their necks were bowed as if they were still beneath the yoke.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The Samnites had won not only a glorious victory but a lasting one; they had not only captured Rome as the Gauls had done before them, but, what was a still more warlike exploit, they had captured the Roman courage and hardihood.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While this report was being made and listened to with the greatest attention, and the name and greatness of Rome were being mourned over
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> as though lost for ever, in the council of her faithful allies, Ofillius Calavius, the son of Ovus, addressed the senators. He was a man of high birth and with a distinguished career and now venerable for his age.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He is reported to have said: <q direct="unspecified">The truth is far otherwise. That stubborn silence, those eyes fixed on the ground, those ears deaf to all consolation, that shame - faced shrinking from the light, are all indications of a terrible resentment fermenting in their hearts which will break out in vengeance.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Either I know nothing of the Roman character or that silence will soon call forth amongst the Samnites cries of distress and groans of anguish.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The memory of the capitulation of Caudium will be much more bitter to the Samnites than to the Romans. Whenever and wherever they meet each side will be animated by its own courage and the Samnites will not find the Caudine Forks everywhere.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Rome<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Reception in Rome.</note> was now aware of its disaster. The first information they received was that the army was blockaded, then came the more gloomy news of the ignominious capitulation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Immediately on receiving the first intelligence of the blockade they began to levy troops, but when they heard that the army had surrendered in such a disgraceful way, the preparations for relieving them were abandoned, and without waiting for any formal order the whole City presented the aspect of public mourning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The booths round the Forum were shut up; all public business in the Forum ceased spontaneously before the proclamation closing it was made; the senators laid aside their purple striped tunics and gold rings; the gloom amongst the citizens was almost greater than that in the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Their indignation was not confined to the generals or the officers who had made the convention, even the innocent soldiers were the objects of resentment, they said they would not admit them into the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But this angry temper was dispelled by the arrival of the troops; their wretched appearance awoke commiseration amongst the most resentful.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They did not enter the City like men returning in safety after being given up for lost, but in the guise and with the expression of prisoners. They came late in the evening and crept to their homes, where they kept themselves so close that for some days not one of them would show himself in public or in the Forum.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The Consuls shut themselves up in privacy and refused to discharge any official functions with the exception of one which was wrung from them by a decree of the senate,
					<milestone unit="section" n="13??"/> namely, the nomination of a Dictator to conduct the elections. They nominated Q. Fabius Ambustus, with P. Aelius Paetus as Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Their appointment was found to be irregular, and they were replaced by M. Aemilius Papus as Dictator and L. Valerius Flaccus as Master of the Horse. Even they, however, were not allowed to conduct the elections; the people were dissatisfied with all the magistrates of that year, and so matters reverted to an interregnum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Q. Fabius Maximus and M. Valerius Corvus were successively interreges, and the latter held the consular elections. Q. Publilius Philo and L. Papirius Cursor &mdash;the latter for the second time &mdash;were returned. The choice was universally approved, for all knew there were no more brilliant generals at that day.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Discussion in the Senate.</note> entered upon the active duties of their office on the very day of their election, for so had the senate decreed, and after disposing of the business connected with their accession to office, they proceeded at once to introduce the subject of the capitulation of Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Publilius, who was the presiding consul, called upon Spurius Postumius to speak. He rose in his place with just the same expression that he had worn when passing under the yoke, and began:</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/><q direct="unspecified">Consuls, I am quite aware that I have been called upon to speak first, not because I am foremost in honour, but because I am foremost in disgrace and hold the position not of a senator but of a man on his trial who has to meet the charge not only of an unsuccessful war but also of an ignominious peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Since, however, you have not introduced the question of our guilt or punishment, I shall not enter upon a defence which in the presence of men not unacquainted with the mutability of human fortunes would not be a very difficult one to undertake. I will state in a few words what I think about the question before us, and you will he able to judge from what I say whether it was myself or your legions that I spared when I pledged myself to the convention, however shameful or however necessary it was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This convention, however, was not made by the order of the Roman people, and therefore the Roman people are not bound by it, nor is anything due to the Samnites under its terms beyond our own persons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Let us be surrendered by the fetials, stripped and bound; let us release the people from their religious obligations if we have involved them in any, so that without infringing any law human or divine we may resume a war which will be justified by the law of nations and sanctioned by the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I advise, that in the meantime the consuls enrol and equip an army and lead it forth to war, but that they do not cross the hostile frontier until all our obligations under the terms of surrender have been discharged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> And you, immortal gods, I pray and beseech, that as it was not your will that the consuls Sp. Postumius and T. Veturius
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> should wage a successful war against the Samnites, you may at least deem it enough to have witnessed us sent under the yoke and compelled to submit to a shameful convention, enough to witness us surrendered, naked and in chains, to the enemy, taking upon our heads the whole weight of his anger and vengeance!
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> May it be in accordance with your will that the legions of Rome under fresh consuls should wage war against the Samnites in the same way in which all wars were waged before we were consuls!</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>When he finished speaking, such admiration and pity were felt for him that they could hardly think that it was the same Sp. Postumius who had concluded such a disgraceful peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They viewed with the utmost sadness the prospect of such a man suffering at the hands of the enemy such terrible punishment as he was sure to meet with, enraged as they would be at the rupture of the peace.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The whole House expressed in terms of the highest praise their approval of his proposal. They were beginning to vote on the question when two of the tribunes of the plebs, L. Livius and Q. Maelius, entered a protest which they afterwards withdrew.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They argued that the people as a whole would not be discharged from their religious obligation by this surrender unless the Samnites were placed in the same position of advantage which they held at Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Further, they said they did not deserve any punishment for having saved the Roman army by undertaking to procure peace,<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed">Livy evidently assumes that these two tribunes of the plebs were with the army, a most unusual arrangement, as they were supposed to be watching over the interests of the plebs within the walls of Rome. But the whole strength of Rome, i. e., the great majority of the plebeians, were at Caudium, so the presence of all the tribunes in the City might not have been necessary.</note> and they urged as a final reason that as they, the tribunes, were sacrosanct and their persons inviolable they could not be surrendered to the enemy or exposed to any violence.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To this Postumius replied: <q direct="unspecified">In the meanwhile, surrender us, whom no inviolability protects and whose surrender will violate no man's conscience.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Afterwards you will surrender those <q direct="unspecified">sacrosanct</q> gentlemen also as soon as their year of office expires, but if you take my advice you will see that before they are surrendered they are scourged in the Forum by way of paying interest for a punishment that will have been delayed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Why, who is so ignorant of fetial law as not to see that these men are saying this, not because it represents the fact but to prevent their being surrendered?
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> I do not deny, senators, that where the pledged words of men are held to possess a binding force only second to the sanctions of religion, then such undertakings as we have given are as sacred as formal treaties. But I do say that without the express order of the people nothing can be ratified which can bind the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Suppose the Samnites, in the same spirit of insolent pride in which they extorted this capitulation from us, had compelled us to recite the formula for the surrender of cities,<note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="ed">For this formula, see Vol. I. p. 45.</note> would you say, tribunes, that the Roman people was surrendered and that this City with its shrines and temples, its territory, and its waters had become the property of the Samnites? I say no more about surrender, because what we are considering is the pledge we gave in the capitulation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Well now, suppose we had given a pledge that the Roman people would abandon this City, would burn it, would no longer have its own magistrates and senates and laws, but would live under the rule of kings. <q direct="unspecified">Heaven forbid!</q> you say.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Yes, but the binding force of a capitulation is not lightened by the humiliating nature of its terms. If the people can be bound by any article, it can by all. The point which some consider important, namely whether it is a consul or a Dictator or a praetor who has given the undertaking is of no weight whatever.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Samnites themselves made this clear, for it was not enough for them that the consuls pledged themselves, they compelled the staff-officers, the quaestors, and the military tribunes to do the same.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/><q direct="unspecified">Now no one need say to me, <q direct="unspecified">Why did you pledge yourself in that way, seeing that a consul has no right to do so and you were not in a position to promise them a peace of which you could not guarantee the ratification, or to act on behalf of the people when they had given you no mandate to do so?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Nothing that happened at Caudium, senators, was dictated by human prudence; the gods deprived both the enemy's commanders and your own of their senses. We did not exercise sufficient caution in our various movements, they in their folly threw away a victory when they had won through our folly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They hardly felt safe on the very ground which gave them their victory, such a hurry were they in to agree to any conditions if only they could deprive of their arms men who were home to arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If they had been in their senses, would they have had any difficulty in sending envoys to Rome whilst they were fetching an old man from his home to advise them? Was it impossible for them to enter into negotiations with the senate and with the people about securing peace and making a treaty?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It is a three days' journey for lightly-equipped horsemen, and in the meantime there would have been an armistice until the envoys returned bringing either peace or the certainty of their victory. Then and then only would there have been a binding agreement, because we should have made it by order of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But you would not have made such an order, nor should we have given such a pledge. It was not the will of heaven that there should be any other result than this, namely, that the Samnites should be vainly deluded by a dream too delightful for their minds
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> to grasp, that the same Fortune which had imprisoned our army should also release it, that an illusory victory should be rendered futile by a still more illusory peace, and that stipulations should be brought in, binding on none but those who actually made them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> For what share have you, senators, what share has the people in this business? Who can call you to account, who can say that you have deceived him? The enemy? You have given no pledge to the enemy. Any fellow-citizen? You have not empowered my fellow-citizen to give a pledge on your behalf.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> You are not in my way involved with us, for you have given us no mandate; you are not answerable to the Samnites, for you have had no dealings with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> It is we who are answerable, pledged as debtors and quite able to discharge the debt in respect of what is our own, which we are prepared to pay, that is, our own persons and lives. On these let them wreak their vengeance, for these let them sharpen their swords and their rage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> As for the tribunes,. you ought to consider whether it is possible for them to be surrendered at once, or whether it ought to be deferred, but as for us, T.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They immediately resigned their office and were handed over to the fetials to be conducted with the rest to Caudium.</p> <p>After the senate had passed their resolution, it seemed as though the light of day was once more shining on the State.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The name of Postumius was in all men's mouths, he was extolled to the skies, his conduct was put on a level with the selfsacrifice of P. Decius and other splendid deeds of heroism.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was through his counsel and assistance, men said, that the State had found its way out of a dishonourable and guilty peace; he was exposing himself to the rage of the enemy and all the tortures they could inflict as an expiatory victim for the Roman people.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> All eyes were turned to arms and war; <q direct="unspecified">shall we ever be allowed,</q> they exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">to meet the Samnites in arms?</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Amidst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Pontius Rejects the Sham Surrender.</note> this blaze of angry excitement and thirst for vengeance, a levy was made and nearly all re-enlisted as volunteers. Nine legions were formed out of the former troops, and the army marched to Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The fetials went on in advance, and on arriving at the city gate they ordered the garment to be stripped off from those who had made the capitulation and their arms to be tied behind their backs.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As the apparitor, out of respect for Postumius' rank, was binding his cords loosely, <q direct="unspecified">Why do you not,</q> he asked, <q direct="unspecified">draw the cord tight that the surrender may be made in due form?</q> When they had entered the council chamber and reached the tribunal where Pontius was seated, the fetial addressed him thus:
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> <q direct="unspecified">Forasmuch as these men have, without being ordered thereto by the Roman people, the Quirites, given their promise and oath that a treaty shall be concluded and have thereby been guilty of high crime and misdemeanour, I do herewith make surrender to you of these men, to the end that the Roman people may he absolved from the guilt of a heinous and detestable act.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As the fetial said this Postumius struck him as hard as he could with his knee, and in a loud voice declared that he was a Samnite citizen, that he had violated the law of nations in maltreating the fetial who, as herald, was inviolable, and that after this the Romans would be all the more justified in prosecuting the war.<note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified">It is hard to say whether this trickery, at once so base and so foolish, should be ascribed to mere hypocrisy or to fanaticism; for the fanatic is as prone to falsehood as to cruelty, and justifies to himself the one no less than the other by holding that the end sanctifies the means. Yet it is a fanaticism less wicked indeed, but even more extraordinary, when a man like Livy can describe such a scene, and can represent, as he has done, the conduct of Pontius in such strong contrast with that of the Romans, without appearing to feel any admiration of the one or any shame for theother.</q> (<bibl>Arnold, History of Rome, II. p. 225</bibl>.) Most English readers will sympathise with Dr. Arnold here; few probably will read without a sense of pain Dr. Mommsen's defence of the part the Romans played in this transaction (pp. 364-5, Vol. I.). The proposition he lays down that <q direct="unspecified">a great nation does not surrender what it possesses except under the pressure of extreme necessity: all treaties making concessions are acknowledgments of such a necessity, not moral obligations</q> is undoubtedly true from the Roman standpoint, but surely is subversive of any ehtical basis on which international amity can rest to-day.</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Pontius replied:<q direct="unspecified">I shall not accept this surrender of yours nor will the Samnites regard it as valid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Why do you not, Spurius Postumius, if you believe in the existence of gods, either cancel the whole agreement or abide by what you have pledged yourself to. The Samnite people have a right to all those whom it held in its power, or in their stead it has a right to make peace with Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But why do I appeal to you? You are keeping your word as far as you can and rendering yourself as prisoner to your conqueror. I appeal to the Roman people. If they are dissatisfied with the convention of the Caudine Forks, let them place their legions once more between the passes which imprisoned them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Let there be no fraudulent dealing on either side, let the whole transaction be annuled, let them resume the arms which they delivered up at the capitulation, let them return to that camp of theirs, let them have everything that they had on the eve of their surrender. When that is done, then let them take a bold line and vote for war, then let the convention and the peace agreed to be repudiated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Let us carry on the war with the same fortune and on the same ground which we held before any mention was made of peace; the Roman people will not then have any occasion to blame their consuls for pledges they had no right to give, nor shall we have any reason to charge the Roman people with any breach of faith.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/><q direct="unspecified">Will you never be at a loss for reasons why, after defeat, you should not abide by your agreements? You gave hostages to Porsena, afterwards you stole them away.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> You ransomed your city from the Gauls with gold, whilst they were in the act of receiving the gold they were cut down. You made peace with us on condition of our restoring your captured legions, you are now making that peace null and void.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> You always cloak your dishonest dealing under some specious pretext of right and justice. Does the Roman people not approve of its legion being saved at the cost of a humiliating peace? Then let it keep its peace to itself, only let it restore to the victor its captured legions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Such action would be in accord with the dictates of honour, with the faith of treaties, with the solemn proceedings of the fetials. But that you should secure what you stipulated for, the safety of thousands of your countrymen, whilst I am not to secure the peace which I stipulated for when I released them &mdash;is this what you Aulus Cornelius and you fetials call acting according to the law of nations?</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/><q direct="unspecified">As to those men whom you make believe to surrender I neither accept them nor do I regard them as surrendered, nor do I hinder them from returning to their countrymen, who are bound by a convention, the violation of which brings down the wrath of all the gods whose majesty is being trifled with.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> True, Spurius Postumius has just struck the herald fetial with his knee, then wage war! Of course the gods will believe that Postumius is a Samnite citizen not a Roman, and that it is by a Samnite citizen that a Roman herald has been maltreated, and that for that reason you are justified in making war upon us.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> It is sad to think that you feel no shame in exposing this mockery of religion to the light of day, and that old men of consular rank should invent excuses for breaking their word which even children would think beneath them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Go, lictor, remove the bonds from the Romans, let none of them be hindered from departing where they please.</q></p> <p>Thus set free they returned to the Roman camp, their personal obligations and possibly those of the State having been discharged.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Renewal of the War.</note> Samnites clearly saw that instead of the peace which they had so arrogantly dictated, a most bitter war had commenced. They not only had a foreboding of all that was coming but they almost saw it with their eyes; now when it was too late they began to view with approval the two alternatives which the elder Pontius had suggested.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They saw that they had fallen between the two, and by adopting a middle course had exchanged the secure possession of victory for an insecure and doubtful peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They realised that they had lost the chance of doing either a kindness or an injury, and would have to fight with those whom they might have got rid of for ever as enemies or secured for ever as friends. And though no battle had yet given either side the advantage, men's feelings had so changed that Postumius enjoyed a
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> greater reputation amongst the Romans for his surrender than Pontius possessed amongst the Samnites for his bloodless victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman regarded the possibility of war as involving the certainty of victory, whilst the Samnites looked upon the renewal of hostilities by the Roman as equivalent to their own defeat.</p> <p>In the meantime, Satricum revolted to the Samnites. The latter made a sudden descent on Fregellae and succeeded in occupying it in the night, assisted, there is no doubt by the Satricans.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Mutual fear kept both the Samnites and the Fregellans quiet till daylight, with the return of light the battle began. For some time the Fregellans held their ground, for they were fighting for their hearths and homes and the noncombatant population assisted them from the roofs of the houses.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At length the assailants gained the advantage by adopting a ruse. A proclamation was made that all who laid down their arms should depart unhurt, and the defenders did not interfere with the crier who made it Now that there were hopes of safety they fought with less energy and in all directions arms were thrown away.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Some, however, showed more determination and made their way fully armed through the opposite gate. Their courage proved a better protection than the timid credulity of the others, for these were hemmed in by the Samnites with a ring of fire, and in spite of their cries for mercy were burnt to death..</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>After arranging their respective commands, the consuls took the field. Papirius marched into Apulia as far as Luceria, where the equites who had been given as hostages at Caudium were interned; Publilius remained in Samnium to oppose the legions who had been at Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> His presence made the Samnites uncertain how to act; they could not march to Luceria for fear of exposing themselves to a rear attack, nor did they feel satisfied to remain where they were, as Luceria might in the meantime he lost.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They decided that the best course would be to try their fortune and hazard a battle with Publilius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly they drew up their forces for action.</p><p>Before engaging them Publilius thought he ought to address a few words to his men, and ordered the Assembly to be sounded. There was such an eager rush, however, to the general's tent, and such loud shouts were raised in all directions as the men clamoured to be led to battle, that none of the general's address was heard; the memory of their recent disgrace was quite enough of itself to stimulate every man to fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They strode rapidly into battle, urging the standard-bearers to move faster, and, to avoid any delay in having to hurl their javelins, they flung them away as if at a given signal and rushed upon the enemy with naked steel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was no time for the commander's skill to be shown in manoeuvring his men or posting his reserves, it was all carried through by the enraged soldiers, who charged like madmen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The enemy were not only routed, they did not even venture to stay their flight at their camp, but went in scattered parties in the direction of Apulia. Eventually they rallied and reached Luceria in a body.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The same rage and fury which had carried the Romans through the midst of the enemy hurried them on to the Samnite camp, and more carnage took place there than on the battle-field. Most of the plunder was destroyed in their excitement.</p> <p>The other army under Papirius had marched along the coast and reached Arpi.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The whole of the country through which he passed was peaceably disposed, an attitude which was due more to the injuries inflicted by the Samnites than to any services which the Romans had rendered.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> For the Samnites used to live at that day in open hamlets among the mountains, and they were in the habit of making marauding incursions into the low country and the coastal districts. Living the free open-air life of mountaineers, themselves they despised the less hardy cultivators of the plains who, as often happens, had developed a character in harmony with their surroundings.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> If this tract of country had been on good terms with the Samnites, the Roman army would either have failed to reach Arpi or they would have been unable to obtain provisions on their route, and so would have been cut off from supplies of every kind.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Even as it was, when they had advanced to Luceria both besieged and besiegers were suffering from scarcity of provisions. The Romans drew all their supplies from Arpi but in very small quantities, for, as the infantry were all employed in outpost and patrol duty and in the construction of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> siege-works, the cavalry brought the corn from Arpi in their haversacks, and sometimes when they encountered the enemy they were compelled to throw these away so as to be free to fight. The besieged, on the other hand, were obtaining their provisions and reinforcements from Samnium.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> But the arrival of the other consul, Publilius, with his victorious army led to their being more closely invested. He left the conduct of the siege to his colleague that he might be free to intercept the enemy's convoys on all sides.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When the Samnites, who were encamped before Luceria, found that there was no hope of the besieged enduring their privations any longer, they were compelled to concentrate their whole strength and offer battle to Papirius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst both sides were making their preparations for battle, a deputation from Tarentum appeared on the scene with a peremptory demand that both the Samnites and the Romans should desist from hostilities. They threatened that whichever side stood in the way of a cessation of arms, they would assist the other side against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After hearing the demands which the deputation advanced and apparently attaching importance to what they had said, Papirius replied that he would communicate with his colleague. He then sent for him and employed the interval in hastening the preparations for battle. After talking over the matter, about which there could be no two opinions, he displayed the signal for battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Whilst the consuls were engaged in the various duties, religious and otherwise, which are customary before a battle, the Tarentines waited for them, expecting an answer, and Papirius informed them that the pullarius had reported that the auspices were favourable and the sacrifice most satisfactory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> <q direct="unspecified">You see,</q> he added, <q direct="unspecified">that we are going into action with the sanction of the gods.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He then ordered the standards to be taken up, and as he marched his men on to the field he expressed his contempt for a people of such egregious vanity, that whilst quite incapable of managing their own affairs, owing to domestic strife and discord, they thought themselves justified in prescribing to others how far they must go in making peace or war.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Samnites, on the other hand, had given up all thoughts of fighting, either because they were really anxious for peace or because it was their interest to appear so, in order to secure the goodwill of the Tarentines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When they suddenly caught sight of the Romans drawn up for battle, they shouted that they should act according to the instructions of the Tarentines; they would neither go down into the field nor carry their arms outside their rampart, they would rather let advantage be taken of them and bear whatever chance might bring them than be
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> thought to have flouted the peaceful advice of Tarentum The consuls said that they welcomed the omen, and prayed that the enemy might remain in that mood so as not even to defend their rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Advancing in two divisions up to the entrenchments, they attacked them simultaneously on all sides. Some began to fill up the fosse, others tore down the abattis on the rampart and hurled the timber into the fosse. It was not their native courage only, but indignation and rage as well which goaded them On smarting as they were from their recent disgrace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As they forced their way into the camp, they reminded one another that there were no Forks of Caudium there, none of those insuperable defiles where deceit had won an insolent victory over incaution, but Roman valour which neither rampart nor fosse could check. They slew alike those who fought and those who fled, armed and unarmed, slaves and freemen, young and old, men and beasts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Not a single living thing would have survived had not the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> consuls given the signal to retire, and by stern commands and threats driven the soldiers who were thirsting for blood out of the enemy's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> As the men were highly incensed at this interruption to a vengeance which was so delightful, it was necessary to explain to them on the spot why they were prevented from carrying it further.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The consuls assured them that they neither had yielded nor would yield to any man in showing their hatred of the enemy, and as they had been their leaders in the fighting so they would have been foremost in encouraging their insatiable rage and vengeance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> But they had to consider the 6oo equites who were being detained as hostages in Luceria, and to take care that the enemy, despairing of any quarter for themselves, did not wreak their blind rage on their captives, and destroy them before they perished themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The soldiers quite approved and were glad that their indiscriminate fury had been checked; they admitted that they must submit to anything rather than endanger the safety of so many youths belonging to the noblest families in Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The soldiers were dismissed to quarters, and a council of war was held to decide whether they should press on the siege of Luceria with their whole force or whether Publilius with his army should visit the Apulians and ascertain their intentions, about which there was considerable doubt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The latter was decided upon, and the consul succeeded in reducing a considerable number of their towns in one campaign, whilst others were admitted into alliance.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Papirius, who had remained behind to prosecute the siege of Luceria, soon found his expectations realised, for as all the roads by which supplies could be brought in were blocked, the Samnite garrison in Luceria was so reduced by famine that they sent to the Roman consul an offer to restore the hostages, for whose recovery the war had been undertaken, if he would raise the siege.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He replied that they ought to have consulted Pontius, at whose instigation they had sent the Romans under the yoke, as to what terms he thought ought to he imposed on the vanquished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As, however, they preferred that equal terms should be fixed by the enemy rather than proposed by themselves, he told the negotiators to take back word to Luceria that all the arms, baggage, and beasts of burden together with the non-combatant population were to be left behind; the soldiers he should send under the yoke and leave them one garment apiece.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In doing this, he said, he was subjecting them to no novel disgrace but simply retaliating upon them one which they had themselves inflicted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were compelled to accept these terms and 7000 men were sent under the yoke. An enormous amount of booty was found in Luceria, all the arms and standards which had been taken at Caudium, and what created the greatest joy of all &mdash;they recovered the equites, the hostages whom the Samnites had placed there for security.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Hardly any victory that Rome ever won was more noteworthy for the sudden change that it wrought in the circumstances of the republic, especially if, as I find stated in some annals, Pontius, the son of Herennius, the Samnite captain-general, was sent under the yoke with the rest, to expiate the disgrace he had inflicted on the consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> I am not, however, so much surprised that uncertainty should exist with regard to this point as I am that any doubt should be felt as to who really captured Luceria;
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> whether, that is to say, it was Lucius Cornelius, acting as Dictator, with L. Papirius Cursor as Master of the Horse, who achieved those successes at Caudium and afterwards at Luceria, and as the one man who avenged the stain on Roman honour celebrated what I am inclined to think was, with the exception of that of F. Camillus, the most justly earned triumph that any down to that day had enjoyed, or whether the glory of that distinction should be attributed to the consuls and especially to Papirius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> There is a further mistake here owing to doubts as to whether at the next consular elections Papirius Cursor was re-elected for the third time in consequence of his success at Luceria, together with Q. Aulius Corretanus for the second time, or whether the name should really be L. Papirius Mugilanus.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Reduction of Satricum.</note> authorities are agreed that the remainder of the war was conducted by the consuls. Aulius finished the campaign against the Frentanians in one battle. Their routed army fled to their city, and after giving hostages the consul received their surrender.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The other consul was equally fortunate in his campaign against the Satricans. Though admitted to Roman citizenship they had revolted to the Samnites after the Caudine disaster and allowed them to garrison their city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But when the Roman army was close to their walls they sent an urgent request, couched in very humble terms, for peace. The consul replied that unless they handed over the Samnite garrison or put them to death they were not to go to him again. The severity of this reply created more terror amongst them than the actual presence of the Roman army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They repeatedly asked him by what means he thought that such a small and weak body as they were could attempt to use force against a strong and well-armed garrison. He told them to seek counsel from those through whose advice they had admitted the garrison in the first instance. After having with some difficulty obtained his permission to consult their senate, they returned to the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were two parties in the senate: the leaders of the one were the authors of the revolt from Rome, the other consisted of loyal citizens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both, however, were equally anxious that every effort should be made to induce the consul to grant peace.</p> <p>As the Samnite garrison were not in the least prepared to stand a siege, they intended to evacuate the city the following night.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The party who had introduced them thought it would be quite sufficient to let the consul know at what hour and by what gate they would leave; the others who had been all along opposed to their coming actually opened the gate to the consul that very night and admitted his troops into the city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Samnites were unexpectedly attacked by a force concealed in the woods through which they were marching whilst the shouts of the Roman were resounding in all parts of the city; by this double act of treachery the Samnites were slain and Satricum captured within the space of one short hour and the consul became complete master of the situation.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He ordered a strict inquiry to be made as to who were responsible for the revolt, and those who were found to be guilty were scourged and beheaded.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Satricans were deprived of their arms and a strong garrison was placed in the city.</p> <p>The writers who tell us that it was under Papirius that Luceria was recovered and the Samnites sent under the yoke,
							<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> go on to inform us that after the capture of Satricum he returned to Rome to celebrate his triumph.
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> And indeed he was, undoubtedly, a man deserving of all praise for his soldierly qualities, distinguished as he was not only by intellectual force but also by his physical prowess.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He was especially noted for his swiftness of foot, which gave him his cognomen<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified">Cursor"="the runner.</q></note>; he is stated to have beaten all those of his own age in racing. Owing either to his great strength or the amount of exercise he took he had an enormous appetite.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Under no commander did either horse or foot find service harder, for he himself never knew what it was to be tired. On one occasion the cavalry ventured to ask him to excuse them some of their fatigue duty in consideration of their having fought a successful action.
							<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He replied: <q direct="unspecified">That you may not say I never excuse you anything, I excuse you from rubbing your horses' backs when you dismount.</q>
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He was as much of a martinet to the allies of Rome as he was to his own countrymen.
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The commander of the Praenestine detachment had shown a lack of courage in bringing his men up from the rear into the fighting line . Papirius, walking in front of his tent, ordered him to be called up, and on his appearance told the lictor to get the axe ready. The Praenestine, on hearing this, stood paralysed with fear.
							<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> <q direct="unspecified">Come, lictor,</q> said Papirius, <q direct="unspecified">cut out this root; it is in the way of people as they walk.</q> After almost frightening him to death with this threat, he dismissed him with a fine.
							<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> No age has been more prolific in great and noble characters than the one in which he lived, and even in that age there was no one whose single arm did more to sustain the commonwealth. Had Alexander the Great, after subjugating Asia, turned his attention to Europe, there are many who maintain that he would have met his match in Papirius.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nothing<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Comparison of the Strength of Rome with that of Macedonia under Alexander the Great.</note> can he thought to be further from my aim since I commenced this task than to digress more than is necessary from the order of the narrative or by embellishing my work with a variety of topics to afford pleasant resting-places, as it were, for my readers and mental relaxation for myself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The mention, however, of so great a king and commander induces me to lay before my readers some reflections which I have often made when I have proposed to myself the question, <q direct="unspecified">What would have been the results for Rome if she had been engaged in war with Alexander?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The things which tell most in war are the numbers and courage of the troops, the ability of the commanders, and Fortune, who has such a potent influence over human affairs, especially those of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Any one who considers these factors either separately or in combination will easily see that as the Roman empire proved invincible against other kings and nations, so it would have proved invincible against Alexander.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Let us, first of all, compare the commanders on each side. I do not dispute that Alexander was an exceptional general, but his reputation is enhanced by the fact that he died while still young and before he had time to experience any change of fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Not to mention other kings and illustrious captains, who afford striking examples of the mutability of human affairs, I will only instance Cyrus, whom the Greeks celebrate as one of the greatest of men. What was it that exposed him to reverses and misfortunes but the length of his life, as recently in the case of Pompey the Great?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let me enumerate the Roman generals &mdash;not all out of all ages but only those with whom as consuls and Dictators Alexander would have had to fight &mdash;
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> M. Valerius Corvus, C. Marcius Rutilus, C. Sulpicius, T. Manlius Torquatus, Q. Publilius Philo, L. Papirius Cursor, Q. Fabius Maximus, the two Decii, L. Volumnius, and Manlius Curius. Following these come those men of colossal mould who would have confronted him if he had first turned his arms against Carthage and then crossed over into Italy later in life.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Every one of these men was Alexander's equal in courage and ability, and the
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> art of war, which from the beginning of the City had been an unbroken tradition, had now grown into a science based on definite and permanent rules. It was thus that the kings conducted their wars, and alter them the Junii and the Valerii, who expelled the kings, and in later succession the Fabii, the Quinctii, and the Cornelii.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> It was these rules that Camillus followed, and the men who would have had to fight with Alexander had seen Camillus as an old man when they were little more than boys.</p> <p>Alexander no doubt did all that a soldier ought to do in battle, and that is not his least title to fame.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But if Manlius Torquatus had been opposed to him in the field, would he have been inferior to him in this respect, or Valerius Corvus, both of them distinguished as soldiers before they assumed command?
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Would the Decii, who, after devoting themselves, rushed upon the enemy, or Papirius Cursor with his vast physical courage and strength?
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Would the clever generalship of one young man have succeeded in baffling the whole senate, not to mention individuals, that senate of which he, who declared that it was composed of kings, alone formed a true idea?
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Was there any danger of his showing more skill than any of those whom I have mentioned in choosing the site for his camp, or organising his commissariat, or guarding against surprises, or choosing the right moment for giving battle, or disposing his men in line of battle and posting his reserves to the best advantage?
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> He would have said that it was not with Darius that he had to do, dragging after him a train of women and eunuchs, wrapped up in purple and gold, encumbered with all the trappings of state, He found him an easy prey rather than a formidable enemy and defeated him without loss, without being called to do anything more daring than to show a just contempt for the idle show of power.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The aspect of Italy would have struck him as very different from the India which he traversed in drunken revelry with an intoxicated army; he would have seen in the passes of Apulia and the mountains of Lucania the traces of the recent disaster which befell his house when his uncle Alexander, King of Epirus, perished.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I am speaking of Alexander as he was before he was submerged in the flood of success, for no man was less capable of bearing prosperity than he was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If we look at him as transformed by his new fortunes and presenting the new character, so to
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> speak, which he had assumed after his victories, it is evident he would have come into Italy more like Darius than Alexander, and would have brought with him an army which had forgotten its native Macedonia and was rapidly becoming Persian in character.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It is a disagreeable task in the case of so great a man to have to record his ostentatious love of dress; the prostrations which he demanded from all who approached his presence, and which the Macedonians must have felt to be humiliating, even had they been vanquished, how much more when they were victors;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the terribly cruel punishments he in- flicted; the murder of his friends at the banquet-table; the vanity which made him invent a divine pedigree for himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> What, pray, would have happened if his love of wine had become stronger and his passionate nature more violent and fiery as he grew older? I am only stating facts about which there is no dispute. Are we to regard none of these things as serious draw- backs to his merits as a commander?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Or was there any danger of that happening which the most frivolous of the Greeks, who actually extol the Parthians at the expense of the Romans, are so constantly harping upon, namely, that the Roman people must have bowed before the greatness of Alexander's name &mdash; though I do not think they had even beard of him &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> that not one out of all the Roman chiefs would have uttered his true sentiments about him, though men dared to attack him in Athens, the very city which had been shattered by Macedonian arms and almost well in sight of the smoking ruins of `Thebes, and the speeches of his assailants are still extant to prove this?</p><p>However lofty our ideas of this man's greatness, still it is the greatness of one individual, attained in a successful career of little more than ten years.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Those who extol it on the ground that though Rome has never lost a war she has lost many battle, whilst Alexander has never fought a battle unsuccess- fully, are not aware that they are comparing the actions of one individual, and he a youth, with the achievements of a people who have had 8oo years of war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Where more generations are reckoned on one side than years on the other, can we be sur- prised that in such a long space of time there
						<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> have been more changes of fortune than in a period of thirteen years? Why do you not compare the fortunes of one man with another, of one commander with another?
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> How many Roman generals could I name who have never been unfortunate in a single battle! You may run through page after page of the lists of magistrates, both consuls and Dictators, and not find one with whose valour and fortunes the Roman people have ever for a single day had cause to be dissatisfied.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And these men are more worthy of admiration than Alexander or any other king.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Some retained the Dictatorship for only ten or twenty days; none held a con- sulship for more than a year; the levying of troops was often obstructed by the tribunes of the plebs; they were late, in consequence, in taking the field, and were often recalled before the time to conduct the elections;
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> frequently, when they were commencing some important operation, their year of office expired; their colleagues frustrated or ruined their plans, some through recklessness, some through jealousy; they often had to succeed to the mistakes or failures of others and take over an army of raw recruits or one in a bad state of discipline.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Kings are free from all hindrances; they are lords of time and circumstance, and draw all things into the sweep of their own designs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Thus, the invincible Alexander would have crossed swords with invincible captains, and would have given the same pledges to Fortune which they gave.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Nay, he would have run greater risks than they, for the Macedonians had only one Alexander, who was not only liable to all sorts of accidents but deliberately exposed himself to them, whilst there were
					<milestone unit="section" n="19??"/> many Romans equal to Alexander in glory and in the grandeur of their deeds, and yet each of them might fulfil his destiny by his life or by his death without imperilling the existence of the State.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It remains for us to compare the one army with the other as regards either the numbers or the quality of the troops or the strength of the allied forces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Now the census for that period gives 250,000 persons. In all the revolts of the Latin league ten legions were raised, consisting almost entirely of city troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Often during those years four or five armies were engaged simultaneously in Etruria, in Umbria (where they had to meet the Gauls as well), in Samnium, and in Lucania.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then as regards the attitude of the various Italian tribes &mdash;the whole of Latium with the Sabines, Volscians, and Aequi, the whole of Campania, parts of Umbria and Etruria, the Picentines, the Marsi, and Paeligni, the Vestinians and Apulians, to which we should add the entire coast of the western sea, with its Greek population, stretching from Thurii to Neapolis and Cumae, and from there as far as Antium and Ostia &mdash;all these nationalities he would have found to be either strong allies of Rome or reduced to impotence by Roman arms.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He would have crossed the sea with his Macedonian veterans, amounting to not more than 30,000 men and 4000 cavalry, mostly Thracian. This formed all his real strength. If he had brought over in addition Persian and Indians and other Orientals, he would have found them a hindrance rather than a help.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> We must remember also that the Romans had a reserve to draw upon at home, but Alexander, warring on a foreign soil, would have found his army diminished by the wastage of war, as happened afterwards to Hannibal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> His men were armed with round shields and long spears, the Romans had the large shield called the scutum, a better protection for the body, and the javelin, a much more effective weapon than the spear whether for hurling or thrusting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In both armies the soldiers fought in line rank by rank, but the Macedonian phalanx lacked mobility and formed a single unit; the Roman army was more elastic, made up of numerous divisions, which could easily act separately or in combination as required.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then with regard to fatigue duty, what soldier is better able to stand hard work than the Roman?</p> <p>If Alexander had been worsted in one battle the war would have been over; what army could have broken the strength of Rome, when Caudium and Cannae failed to do so?
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Even if things had gone well with him at first, he would often have been tempted to wish that Persians and Indians and effeminate Asiatics were his foes, and would have confessed that
						<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> his former wars had been waged against women, as Alexander of Epirus is reported to have said when after receiving his moral wound was comparing his own fortune with that of this very youth in his Asiatic campaigns.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> When I remember that in the first Punic war we fought at sea for twenty-four years, I think that Alexander would hardly have lived long enough to see one war through.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It is quite possible, too, that as Rome and Carthage were at that time leagued together by an old-standing treaty, the same apprehensions might have led those two powerful states to take up arms against the common foe, and Alexander would have been crushed by their combined forces.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Rome has had experience of a Macedonian war, not indeed when Alexander was commanding nor when the resources of Macedon were still unimpaired, but the contests against Antiochus, Philip, and Perses were fought not only without loss but even without risk.</p> <p>I trust that I shall not give offence when I say that, leaving out of sight the civil wars, we have never found an enemy's cavalry or infantry too much
							<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> for us, when we have fought in the open field, on ground equally favourable for both sides, still less when the ground has given us an advantage.
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The infantry soldier, with his heavy armour and weapons, may reasonable fear the arrows of Parthian cavalry, or passes invested by the enemy, or country where supplies cannot be brought up,
							<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> but he has repulsed a thousand armies more formidable than those of Alexander and his Macedonians, and will repulse them in the future if only the domestic peace and concord which we now enjoy remains undisturbed for all the years to come.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>M. Foslius Flaccina and L. Plautius Venox were the next consuls. In this year several communities amongst the Samnites made overtures for a fresh treaty. These deputations, when admitted to an audience, prostrated themselves on the ground, and their humble attitude influenced the senate in their favour.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Their prayers, however, were by no means so efficacious with the Assembly, to which they had been referred by the senate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their request for a treaty was refused, but after they had spent several days in appealing to individual citizens, they succeeded in obtaining a two years' truce.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In Apulia, too, the people of Teanum and Canusium, tired of the constant ravages which they had suffered, gave hostages and surrendered to the consul, L. Plautius.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>It was in this year also that prefects were first appointed for Capua and a code of laws given to that city by the praetor, L. Furius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Both these boons were granted in response to a request from the Campanians themselves as a remedy for the deplorable state of things brought about by civic discord.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Two new tribes were formed, the Ufentine and the Falernian. As the power of Apulia was declining, the people of Teate<note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">this form of the nameLivy probably found in the annalist whom he was consulting at the time. It is, however, in all probability the Teanum mentioned above which is found inscribed on coins as Teate.</note> came to the new consuls, C. Junius Bubulcus and Q. Aemilius Barbula, to negotiate for a treaty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They gave a formal undertaking that throughout Apulia peace would be maintained towards Rome, and the confident assurances they gave led to a treaty being granted, not, however, as between two independent states; they were to acknowledge the suzerainty of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> After the subjugation of Apulia &mdash;for Forentum, also a place of considerable strength, had been captured by Junius &mdash;an advance was made into Lucania, and the consul, Aemilius, surprised and captured the city of Nerulum.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The order introduced into Capua by the adoption of Roman institutions had become generally known amongst the states in alliance with Rome, and the Antiates asked for the same privilege, as they were without a fixed code of laws or any regular magistrates of their own. The patrons of the colony<note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed">Probably Romans of high standing, who were chosen by individual cities or by cantons to act as their agents-general in the City. Or possibly the term denotes the three comissioners (triumviri) who had supervised the settlement of the colony.</note> were commissioned by the senate to draw out a system of jurisprudence. Not only the arms of Rome but her laws were spreading far and wide.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the termination of their year of office the consuls did not hand the legions over to their successors, Sp. Nautius and M. Popilius, but to the Dictator, L. Aemilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In conjunction with M. Fulvius, the Master of the Horse, he commenced an attack on Saticula, and the Samnites at once seized this opportunity to renew hostilities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Romans were threatened by a double danger; the Samnites, after getting a large army together, had entrenched themselves not far from the Roman camp in order to relieve their blockaded allies, whilst the Saticulans suddenly flung their gates open and made a tumultuous attack on the Roman outposts.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The two bodies of combatants, each relying more on the help of the other than on its own strength, united in a regular attack on the Roman camp. Though both sides of the camp were attacked, the Dictator kept his men free from panic, owing to his having selected a position which could not easily be turned, and also because his men presented two fronts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He directed his efforts mainly against those who had made the sortie, and drove them back, without much trouble, behind their walls. Then he turned his whole strength against the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Here the fighting was more sustained and the victory was longer in coming, but when it did come it was decisive. The Samnites were driven in disorder to their camp, and after extinguishing all the camp fires they departed silently in the night, having abandoned all hope of saving Saticula. By way of retaliation they invested Plistica, a city in alliance with Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year having expired, the war was thenceforward carried on by the Dictator, Q. Fabius, whilst the new consuls, like their predecessors, remained in Rome. Fabius marched with reinforcements to Saticula to take over the army from Aemilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Samnites did not remain before Plistica; they had called up fresh troops from home, and trusting to their numbers they fixed their camp on the same ground as in the previous year and endeavoured to distract the Romans from their siege operations by a series of harassing attacks.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This made the Dictator all the more determined to press the siege, as he Considered that the reduction of the place would largely affect the character of the war; he treated the Samnites with comparative indifference, and merely strengthened the pickets on that side of the camp to meet any attack that might be made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This emboldened the Samnites; they rode up to the rampart day after day and allowed the Romans no rest. At last they almost got within the gates of the camp, when Q. Aulius, the Master of the Horse, without consulting the Dictator, charged them furiously from the camp with the whole of his cavalry and drove them off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Though this was only a desultory conflict, Fortune influenced it so largely that she inflicted a signal loss on both sides and brought about the deaths of both Commanders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> First, the Samnite general, indignant at being repulsed and put to flight from the ground over which he had ridden with such confidence, induced his cavalry by entreaties and encouragement to renew the combat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Whilst he was conspicuous amongst them as he urged on the fighting, the Master of the Horse levelled his lance and spurred his horse against him with such force that with one thrust he hurled him from his saddle dead.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> His men were not, as often happens, dismayed at their leader's fall. All who were round him flung their missiles on Aulius, who had incautiously ridden on amongst them, but they allowed the dead general's brother to have the special glory of avenging his death.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In a frenzy of grief and rage he dragged the Master of the Morse out of his saddle and slew him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The Samnites, amongst whom he had fallen, would have secured the body had not the Romans suddenly leaped from their horses, on which the Samnites were obliged to do the same. A fierce infantry fight raged round the bodies of the two generals in which the Roman was decidedly superior; the body of Aulius was rescued, and amidst mingled demonstrations of grief and joy the victors carried it into camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After losing their leader and seeing the unfavourable result of the trial of strength in the cavalry action, the Samnites considered it useless to make any further efforts on behalf of Saticula and resumed the siege of Plistica. A few days later Saticula surrendered to the Romans and Plistica was carried by assault by the Samnites</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Fighting round Sora.</note> seat of war was now changed; the legions were marched from Samnium and Apulia to Sora.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> This place had revolted to the Samnites alter putting the Roman colonists to death. The Roman army marched thither with all speed to avenge the death of their countrymen and to re-establish the colony.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> No sooner had they arrived before the place than the reconnoitring parties who had been watching the different routes brought in reports one after another that the Samnites were following and were now at no great distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The consul marched to meet the enemy, and an indecisive action was fought at Lantulae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The battle was put a stop to, not by the losses or flight of either side but by night, which overtook the combatants while still uncertain whether they were victors or vanquished.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> I find in some authorities that this battle was unfavourable to the Romans, and that Q. Aulius, the Master of the Horse, fell there. C. Fabius was appointed Master of the Horse in his place and came with a fresh army from Rome. He sent orderlies in advance to consult the Dictator as to where he should take up his position and also as to the time and mode of attacking the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> After becoming thoroughly acquainted with the Dictator's plans, he halted his army in a place where he was well concealed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The Dictator kept his men for some days confined to their camp, as though he were enduring a siege rather than conducting one. At last he suddenly displayed the signal for battle. Thinking that brave men were more likely to have their courage stimulated when all their hopes depended upon themselves, he kept the arrival of the Master
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> of the Horse and the fresh army concealed from his soldiers, and as though all their prospects of safety depended upon their cutting their way out, he said to his men:
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> <q direct="unspecified">We have been caught in a position where we are shut in, and we have no way out unless we can open one by our victorious swords. Our standing camp is sufficiently protected by its entrenchments, but it is untenable owing to want of provisions; all the places from which supplies could be obtained have revolted, and even if the people were willing to help us the country is impassable for convoys.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I shall not cheat your courage by leaving a camp here into which you can retire, as you did on the last occasion, without winning the victory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Entrenchments are to be protected by arms, not arms by entrenchments. Let those who think it worth their while to prolong the war hold their camp as a place of retreat; we must have regard to nothing but victory.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Advance the standards against the enemy, and when the column is clear of the camp those who have been told off for the purpose will set it on fire.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What you lose, soldiers, will he made up to you in the plunder of all the surrounding cities which have revolted.</q> The Dictator's words, pointing to the dire necessity to which they were reduced, produced intense excitement, and rendered desperate by the sight of the burning camp- the Dictator had only ordered some spots nearest to them to be set on fire &mdash;they charged like madmen, and at the first onset threw the enemy into confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At the same moment the Master of the Horse seeing the burning camp in the distance &mdash;the agreed signal &mdash;attacked the enemy in the rear. Thus hemmed in, the Samnites fled in all directions, each as best he could.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> A vast number, who had crowded together in their panic and were so close to one another that they could not use their weapons, were killed between the two armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The enemy's camp was captured and plundered, and the soldiers, loaded with spoil, were marched back to their own camp. Even their victory did not give them so much pleasure as the discovery that with the exception of a small part spoilt by fire their camp was unexpectedly safe.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They then returned to Sora, and the new consuls, M. Poetilius and C. Sulpicius, took over the army from the Dictator Fabius, after a large proportion of the veterans had been sent home and new cohorts brought up as reinforcements.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Owing, however, to the difficulties presented by the position of the city, no definite plan of attack was yet formed; a long time would be needed to reduce it by famine, and to attempt to storm it would involve considerable 
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/>risk.</p><p>In the midst of this uncertainty a Soran deserter left the town secretly and made his way to the Roman sentinels, whom he requested to conduct him at once to the consuls.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On being brought before them he undertook to betray the place into their hands. When questioned as to the means by which he would carry out his undertaking, he laid his proposals before them and they appeared quite feasible.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He advised them to remove their camp, which was almost adjoining the walls, to a distance of six miles from the town, this would lead to less vigilance on the part of those who were on outpost duty during the day and sentry duty at night. The following night, after some cohorts had been ordered to conceal themselves in some wooded spots close under the town, he conducted a picked body of ten men by a steep and almost inaccessible path into the citadel.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Here a quantity of missile weapons had been collected, far more than would be required for the men who had been brought there, and m addition there were large stones, some lying about as is usual in craggy places, others piled in heaps by the townsmen to use for the defence of the place.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> When he had posted the Romans here and had pointed out to them a steep and narrow path leading up from the town, he said to them: <q direct="unspecified">From this ascent even three armed men could keep back a multitude however large.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> You are ten in number, and what is more you are Romans, and the bravest of them. You have the advantage of position and you will be helped by the night, which by its obscurity makes everything look more terrible. I will now spread panic everywhere; you devote yourselves to holding the citadel.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Then he ran down and created as great a tumult as he possibly could, shouting: <q direct="unspecified">To arms, citizens! Help, help! The citadel has been seized by the enemy, hasten to its defence!</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He kept up the alarm as he knocked at the doors of the principal men, he shouted it in the ears of all whom he met, of all who rushed out terror-struck into the streets. The panic which one man had started was carried by numbers through the city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The magistrates hurriedly sent men up to the citadel to find out what had happened, and when they heard that it was held by an armed force, whose numbers were grossly exaggerated, they gave up all hopes of recovering it.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> All quarters of the city were filled with fugitives; the gates were burst open by people who were only half awake and mostly without arms, and through one of these the Roman cohorts, roused by the shouting, rushed in and slew the frightened crowds who were thronging the streets.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Sora was already captured when in the early dawn the consul appeared and accepted the surrender of those whom Fortune had spared from the nocturnal massacre.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Amongst these two hundred and twenty-five were sent in chains to Rome as they were universally admitted to have been the instigators of the murder of the colonists and the revolt which followed. The rest of the population were left uninjured and a garrison was stationed in the town.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> All those taken to Rome were scourged and beheaded to the great satisfaction of the plebs, who felt it to be a matter of supreme importance that those who had been sent out in such large numbers as colonists should be safe wherever they were.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Suppression of Movements in Ausonia, Campania, and Apulia.</note> leaving Sora the consuls extended the war to the cities and fields of Ausonia, for the whole country had become restless owing to the presence of the Samnites after the battle of Lautulae.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Plots were being hatched everywhere throughout Campania, even Capua was not free from disaffection, and it was found upon investigation that the movement had actually reached some of the principal men in Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> It was, however, as in the case of Sora, through the betrayal of her cities that Ausonia fell under the power of Rome.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>There were three cities &mdash;Ausona, Menturnae, and Vescia &mdash; which some twelve young men belonging to the principal families there had mutually agreed to betray to the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They came to the consuls and informed them that their people had long been looking forward to the arrival of the Samnites, and after they had heard of the battle of Lautulae, they looked upon the Romans as vanquished and many of the younger men had volunteered to serve with the Samnites After the Samnites,
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> however, had been driven out of their country they were wavering between peace and war, afraid to close their gates to the Romans lest they should provoke a war and yet determined to close them if a Roman army approached their city. In this state of indecision they would fall an easy prey.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Acting on their advice, the Romans moved their camp into the neighbourhood of these cities, and at the same time soldiers were despatched, some fully armed, to occupy concealed positions near the walls, others in ordinary dress, with swords hidden under their togas, were to enter the cities through the open gates at the approach of daylight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As soon as the latter began to attack the guards the signal was given for the others to rush from their ambush. Thus the gates were secured, and the three towns were captured at the same time and by the same stratagem.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As the generals were not there to direct the attack, there was no check upon the carnage which ensued, and the nation of the Ausonians was exterminated, just as if they had been engaged in an internecine war, though there was no certain proof of their having revolted.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During this year the Roman garrison at Luceria was treacherously betrayed, and the Samnites became masters of the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The traitors did not go long unpunished. A Roman army was not far away, and the city, which lay in a plain, was taken at the first assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Lucerines and Samnites were put to death, no quarter being given, and such deep indignation was felt at Rome that when the question of sending fresh colonists to Luceria was under discussion in the senate many voted for the complete destruction of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not only the bitter feeling towards a people who had been twice subdued but also the distance from Rome made them shrink from banishing their countrymen so far from home.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> However, the proposal to despatch colonists was adopted; 2500 were sent.</p> <p>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Prosecutions for Treason.</note> disloyalty was thus manifesting itself everywhere, Capua also became the centre of intrigues amongst some of her principal men.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When the matter came up in the senate, there was a general feeling that it ought to he dealt with at once.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> A decree was passed authorising the immediate opening of a court of inquiry, and C. Maenius was nominated Dictator to conduct the proceedings. M. Foslius was appointed Master of the Horse. The greatest alarm was created by this step, and the Calavii, Ovius, Novius, who had been the ringleaders, did not wait to be denounced to the Dictator, but placed themselves beyond the reach of prosecution by what was undoubtedly a self-inflicted death.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As there was no longer any matter for investigation at Capua, the inquiry was directed to those who were suspected in Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The decree was interpreted as authorising an inquiry, not in regard to Capua especially, but generally in respect of all who had formed cabals and conspiracies against the republic, including the secret leagues entered into by candidates for office. The inquiry began to embrace a wider scope both with respect to the nature of the alleged offences and the persons affected, and the Dictator insisted that
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the authority vested in him as criminal judge was unlimited.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Men of high family were indicted, and no one was allowed to appeal to the tribunes to arrest proceedings. When matters had gone thus far, the nobility &mdash; not only those against whom information was being laid, but the order as a whole &mdash;protested
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> that the charge did not lie on the patricians, to whom the path to honours always lay open, unless it was obstructed by intrigue, but on the <foreign lang="la">novi homines</foreign>.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They even asserted that the Dictator and the Master of the Horse were more fit to be put upon their trial than to act as inquisitors in cases where this charge was brought, and they would find that out as soon as they had vacated their office.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Under these circumstances, Maenius, more anxious to clear his reputation than to retain his office, came forward in the Assembly and addressed it in the following terms: <q direct="unspecified">You are all cognisant, Quirites, of what my life has been in the past, and this very office which has been conferred upon me is a testimony to my innocence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There are men amongst the nobility &mdash;as to their motives it is better that you should form your own opinion than that I, holding the office I do, should say anything without proof &mdash;who tried their utmost to stifle this inquiry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> When they found themselves powerless to do this they sought to shelter themselves, patricians though they were, behind the stronghold of their opponents, the tribunician veto, so as to escape from trial.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> At last, driven from that position, and thinking my course safer than that of trying to prove their innocence, they have directed their assaults against us, and private citizens have not been ashamed to demand the impeachment of the Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Now, that gods and men alike may know that in trying to avoid giving an account of themselves these men are attempting the impossible, and that I am prepared to answer any charge and meet my accusers face to face, I at once resign my Dictatorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> And if the senate should assign the task to you, consuls, I beg that you will begin with M. Foslius and myself, so that it may be conclusively shown that we are protected from such charges, not by our official position, but by our innocence.</q></p> <p>He then at once laid down his office, followed by the Master of the Horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> They were the first to be tried before the consuls, for so the senate ordered, and as the evidence given by the nobles against them completely broke down, they were triumphantly acquitted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Even Publilius Philo, a man who had repeatedly filled the highest offices as a reward for his services at home and in the field, but who was disliked by the nobility, was put on his trial and acquitted.
						<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> As usual, however, it was only whilst this inquisition was a novelty that it had strength enough to attack illustrious names; it soon began to stoop to humbler victims, until it was at length stifled by the very cabals and factions which it had been instituted to suppress.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Defeat of the Samnites in Campania.</note> rumour of these proceedings, and, still more, the expectation of a Campanian revolt, which had already been secretly organised, recalled the Samnites from their designs in Apulia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They marched to Caudium, which from its proximity to Capua would make it easy for them, if the opportunity offered, to wrest that city from the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls marched to Caudium with a strong force. For some time both armies remained in their positions on either side of the pass, as they could only reach each other by a most difficult route.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At length the Samnites descended by a short detour through open country into the flat district of Campania, and there for the first time they came within sight of each other's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There were frequent skirmishes, in which the cavalry played a greater part than the infantry, and the Romans had no cause to be dissatisfied with these trials of strength, nor with the delay which was prolonging the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Samnite generals, on the other hand, saw that these daily encounters involved daily losses, and that the prolongation of the war was sapping their strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They decided, therefore, to bring on an action. They posted their cavalry on the two flanks of their army with instructions to keep their attention on their camp, in case it were attacked, rather than on the battle, which would be safe in the hands of the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> On the other side, the consul Sulpicius directed the right wing, Poetilius the left. The Roman right was drawn up in more open order than usual, as the Samnites opposed to them were standing in thinly extended ranks in order either to surround the enemy or to prevent themselves from being surrounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The left, which was in a much closer formation, was further strengthened by a rapid manoeuvre of Poetilius, who suddenly brought up into the fighting line the cohorts which were usually kept in reserve, in case the battle was prolonged. He then charged the enemy with his full strength.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As the Samnite infantry were shaken by the weight of the attack their cavalry came to their support, and riding obliquely between the two armies were met by the Roman cavalry who charged them at a hard gallop and threw infantry and cavalry alike into confusion, until they had forced back the whole line in this part of the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Sulpicius was taking his part with Poetilius in encouraging the men in this division, for on hearing the battleshout raised he had ridden across from his own division, which was not yet engaged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Seeing that the victory was no longer doubtful here he rode back to his post with his <date value="1200">1200</date> cavalry, but he found a very different condition of things there, the Romans had been driven from their ground and the victorious enemy were pressing them hard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The presence of the consul produced a sudden and complete change, the courage of the men revived at the sight of their general, and the cavalry whom he had brought up rendered an assistance out of all proportion to their numbers, whilst the sound, followed soon by the sight of the success on the other wing, re-animated the combatants to redouble their exertions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> From this moment the Romans were victorious along the whole line, and the Samnites abandoning all further resistance, were all killed or taken prisoners, with the exception of those who succeeded in escaping to Maleventum, now called Beneventum Their loss in prisoners and slain is stated by the chroniclers to have amounted to 30,000.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Further Operations against the Samnites.</note> this great victory the consuls advanced to Bovianum, which they proceeded to invest.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They remained there in winter quarters until C. Poetilius, who had been named Dictator with M. Foslius as Master of the Horse, took over the army from the new consuls, L. Papirius Cursor, consul for the fifth time, and C. Junius Bubulcus, for the second time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On learning that the citadel of Fregellae had been captured by the Samnites, he raised the siege of Bovianum and marched to Fregellae. The place was retaken without fighting, for the Samnites evacuated it in the night, and after leaving a strong garrison there, the Dictator returned to Campania with the main object of recovering Nola.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> At his approach the whole of the Samnite population and the native peasantry retired within the wails.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> After examining the position of the city, he gave orders for all the buildings outside the wall &mdash;and there was a considerable population in the suburbs &mdash;to be destroyed in order to render the approach easier. Not long afterwards, Nola was taken, either by the Dictator or by the consul, C. Junius, for both accounts are given.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Those who give the credit of the capture to the consul state that Atina and Calatia were also taken by him, and they explain the appointment of Poetilius by saying that he was nominated Dictator for the purpose of driving in the nail on the outbreak of an epidemic.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Colonies were sent out this year to Suessa and Pontia; Suessa had belonged to the Auruncans, and the island of Pontia had been inhabited by the Volscians, as it lay off their coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The senate also authorised the settlement of a colony at Interamna on the Casinus, but it fell to the succeeding consuls, M. Valerius and P. Decius, to appoint the commissioners and send out the colonists to the number of 4000.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Censorship of Appius Claudius.</note> Samnite war was now drawing to a close, but before the senate could dismiss it entirely from their thoughts there was a rumour of war on the side of Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With the one exception of the Gauls, no nation was more dreaded at that time, owing to their proximity to Rome and their vast population.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>One of the consuls remained in Samnium to finish the war, the other, P. Decius, was detained in Rome by serious illness, and on instructions from the senate, nominated C. Junius Bubulcus Dictator.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In view of the seriousness of the emergency the Dictator compelled all who were liable for service to take the military oath, and used his utmost endeavours to have arms and whatever else was required in readiness. Notwithstanding the great preparations he was making, he had no intention of assuming the aggressive, and had quite made up his mind to wait until the Etruscans made the first move The Etruscans were equally energetic in their preparations, and equally reluctant to commence hostilities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Neither side went outside their own frontiers.</p> <p>This year (<date value="-312">312</date> B.C.&gt; was signalised by the censorship of Appius Claudius. His claim to distinction with posterity rests mainly upon his public works, the road<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed">The Via Appia. This famous road, one of the greatest engineering works in the Old World, extended from Rome to Capua, a distance of about 120 miles, and was carried through deep cuttings, over the hills, and on vast substructures of stones through the valleys. It was subsequently extended to Brundisium.</note> and the aqueduct<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed">the Appian Aqueduct was the first of fourteen which were successively constructed to supply the Romans with pure water. It was nearly eight miles in length and ran almost the whole way underground.</note> which bear his name.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He carried out these undertakings single-handed, for, owing to the odium he incurred by the way he
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> revised the senatorial lists and filled up the vacancies, his colleague, thoroughly ashamed of his conduct, resigned. In the obstinate temper which had always marked his house, Appius continued to hold office alone.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed">If a censor died or resigned before the legal expiry of this office his colleague as a rule resigned also rather than bear the responsibility of such vast powers alone.</note> It was owing to his action that the Potitii, whose family had always possessed
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the right of ministering at the Ava Maxima of Hercules, transferred that duty to some temple servants, whom they had instructed in the various
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> observances. There is a strange tradition connected with this, and one well calculated to create religious scruples in the minds of any who would disturb the established order of ceremonial usages. It is said that though when the change was made there were twelve branches of the family of the Potitii<note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed">They are first introduced to us on p. 10, Vol. I.</note> comprising thirty adults, not one member, old or young, was alive twelve months
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> later. Nor was the extinction of the Potitian name the only consequence; Appius himself some years afterwards was struck with blindness by the unforgetting wrath of the gods.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="30"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls for the following year were C. Junius Bubulcus (for the third time) and Q. Aemilius Barbula (for the second time).</p> <p>At the beginning of their year of office they laid a complaint before the Assembly touching the unscrupulous way in which vacancies in the senate had been filled up, men having been passed over who were far superior to some who had been selected, whereby the whole senatorial order had been sullied and disgraced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They declared that the selection had been made solely with a view to popularity and out of sheer caprice, and that no regard whatever had been paid to the good or bad characters of those chosen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They then gave out that they should ignore them altogether, and at once proceeded to call over the names of the senators as they appeared on the roll before Appius Claudius and C. Plautius were made censors.</p> <p>Two official posts were for the first time this year placed at the disposal of the people, both of a military character. One was the office of military tribune ; sixteen were henceforth appointed by the people for the four legions; these had hitherto been selected by the Dictators and consuls, very few places being left to the popular vote. L. Atilius and C. Marcius, tribunes of the plebs, were responsible for that measure.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The other was the post of naval commissioner; the people were to appoint two to superintend the equipment and refitting of the fleet. This provision was due to M. Decius, a tribune of the plebs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>An incident of a somewhat trifling character occurred this year which I should have passed over did it not appear to be connected with religious customs. The guild of flute-players<note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="ed">The guild of flute-players was from very early times a large and wealthy one, as they attended most of the sacrificial functions and games, and as a rule supplied the music at funerals. They were not only well paid but treated with great respect, a feeling which Livy does not appear to share. Their annual festival, alluded to here, when they perambulated the City was on June 13. The censors' prohibition may have been called for by their excessive hilarity on this occasion, an explanation which Livy's account renders probable.</note> had been forbidden by the censors to hold their annual banquet in the temple of Jupiter, a privilege they had enjoyed from ancient times Hugely disgusted, they went off in a body to Tibur, and not one was left in the City to perform at the sacrificial rites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The senate were alarmed at the prospect of the various religious ceremonies being thus shorn of their due ritual, and they sent envoys to Tibur, who were to make it their business to see that the Romans got these men back again.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Tiburtines promised to do their best, and invited the musicians into the Senate-house, where they were strongly urged to return to Rome. As they could not be persuaded to do so the Tiburtines adopted a ruse quite appropriate to the character of the men they were dealing with.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> It was a feast day and they were invited to various houses, ostensibly to supply music at the banquets. Like the rest of their class, they were fond of wine, and they were plied with it till they drank themselves into a state of torpor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In this condition they were thrown into wagons and carried off to Rome. They were left in the wagons all night in the Forum, and did not recover their senses till daylight surprised them still suffering from the effect of their debauch.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The people crowded round them and succeeded in inducing them to stay, and they were granted the privilege of going about the City for three days every year in their long dresses and masks with singing and mirth; a custom which is still observed. Those members of the guild who played on solemn occasions in the temple of Jupiter had the right restored to them of holding their banquets there.</p> <p>These incidents occurred while the public attention was fixed on two most serious wars.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Further Successes in Samnium.</note> consuls drew lots for their respective commands; the Samnites fell to Junius, the new theatre of war in Etruria to Aemilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Roman garrison of Cluvia in Samnium, alter being unsuccessfully attacked, were starved into surrender, and were then massacred after being cruelly mangled by the scourge.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Enraged at this brutality, Junius felt that the first thing to be done was to attack Cluvia, and on the very day he arrived before the place he took it by storm and put all the adult males to death. Thence his conquering army marched to Bovianum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was the chief city of the Pentrian Samnites, and by far the wealthiest and best supplied with arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> There was not the same cause for resentment here as at Cluvia, the soldiers were mainly animated by the prospect of plunder, and on the capture of the place the enemy were treated with less severity; but there was almost more booty collected there than from all the rest of Samnium, and the whole of it was generously given up to the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Now that nothing could withstand the overwhelming might of Roman arms, neither armies nor camps nor cities, the one idea in the minds of all the Samnite leaders was to choose some position from which Roman troops when scattered on their foraging expeditions might be caught and surrounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some peasants who pretended to be deserters and some who had, either deliberately or by accident, been made prisoners, came to the consuls with a story in which they all agreed, and which really was true, namely, that an immense quantity of cattle had been driven into a pathless forest. The consuls were induced by this story to send the legions, with nothing but their kits to encumber them, in the direction the cattle had taken, to secure them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> A very strong body of the enemy were concealed on either side of the road, and when they saw that the Romans had entered the forest they suddenly raised a shout and made a tumultuous attack upon them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The suddenness of the affair at first created some confusion, while the men were piling their kits in the centre of the column and getting at their weapons, but as soon as they had each freed themselves from their burdens and put themselves in fighting trim, they began to assemble round the standards. From their old discipline and long experience they knew their places in the ranks, and the line was formed without any orders being needed, each man acting on his own initiative.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The consul rode up to the part where the fighting was hottest and, leaping off his horse, called Jupiter, Mars, and other gods to witness that he had not gone into that place in quest of
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> any glory for himself, but solely to provide booty for his soldiers, nor could any other fault be found with him except that he had been too anxious to enrich his men at the expense of the enemy. From that disgrace nothing would clear him but the courage of his men.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Only they must one and all make a determined attack. The enemy had been already worsted in the field, stripped of his camp, deprived of his cities, and was now trying the last chance by lurking secretly in ambush and trusting to his ground, not to his arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> What ground was too difficult for Roman courage? He reminded them of the citadels of Fregellae and of Sora and of the successes they had everywhere met with when the nature of the ground was all against them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Fired by his words, his men, oblivious of all difficulties, went straight at the hostile line above them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Some exertion was needed while the column were climbing up the face of the hill, but when once the leading standards had secured a footing on the summit and the army found that it was on favourable ground, it was the enemy's turn to be dismayed; they flung away their arms, and in wild flight made for the lurking-places in which they had shortly before concealed themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> But the place which they had selected as presenting most difficulty to the enemy now became a trap for themselves, and impeded them in every way. Very few were able to escape. As many as 20,000 men were killed, and the victorious Romans dispersed in different directions to secure the cattle of which the enemy had made them a present.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Etruria.</note> these occurrences in Samnium the whole of the cities of Etruria with the exception of Arretium had taken up arms and commenced what proved to be a serious war by an attack on Sutrium. This city was in alliance with Rome, and served as a barrier on the side of Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Aemilius marched thither to raise the siege, and selected a site before the city where he entrenched himself. His camp was plentifully supplied with provisions from Sutrium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The Etruscans spent the day after his arrival in discussing whether they should bring on an immediate engagement or protract the war. Their generals decided upon the more energetic course as the safer one, and the next day at sunrise the signal for battle was displayed and the troops marched into the field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> As soon as this was reported to the consul he ordered the tessera to he given out, instructing the men to take their breakfast, and after they were strengthened by food to arm themselves for battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> When he saw that they were in complete readiness, he ordered the standards to go forward, and after the army had emerged from the camp he formed his battle-line not far from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> For some time both sides stood in expectation, each waiting for the other to raise the battle-shout and begin the fighting. The sun passed the meridian before a single missile was discharged on either side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At length the Etruscans, not caring to leave the field without securing some success, raised the battle-shout; the trumpets sounded and the standards advanced.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Romans showed no less eagerness to engage. They closed with each other in deadly earnest. The Etruscans had the advantage in numbers, the Romans in courage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The contest was equally maintained and cost many lives, including the bravest on both sides, nor did either army show any signs of giving way until the second Roman line came up fresh into the place of the first, who were wearied and exhausted. The Etruscans had no reserves to support their first line, and all fell in front of their standards or around them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> No battle would have witnessed fewer fugitives or involved greater carnage had not the Tuscans, who had made up their minds to die, found protection in the approach of night, so that the victors were the first to desist from fighting.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> After sunset the signal was given to retire, and both armies returned in the night to their respective camps.</p> <p>Nothing further worth mention took place that year at Sutrium. The enemy had lost the whole of their first line in a single battle and had only their reserves left, who were hardly sufficient to protect their camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Amongst the Romans there were so many wounded that those who left the field disabled were more numerous than those who had fallen in the battle.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Appius Claudius prolongs his Censorship in defiance of the Law.</note> consuls for the following year were Q. Fabius and C. Marcius Rutilus. Fabius took over the command at Sutrium, and brought reinforcements from Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A fresh army was also raised in Etruria and sent to support the besiegers.</p><p>Very many years had elapsed since there had been any contests between the patrician magistrates and the tribunes of the plebs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Now, however, a dispute arose through that family which seemed marked out by destiny to be the cause of quarrels with the plebs and its tribunes. Appius Claudius had now been censor eighteen months, the period fixed by the Aemilian Law for the duration of that office.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In spite of the fact that his colleague, C. Plautius, had resigned, he could under no circumstances whatever be induced to vacate his office. P. Sempronius was the tribune of the plebs who commenced an action for limiting his censorship to the legal period.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> In taking this step he was acting in the interests of justice quite as much as in the interests of the people, and he carried the sympathies of the aristocracy no less than he had the support of the masses.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He recited the several provisions of the Aemilian Law and extolled its author, Mamercus Aemilius, the Dictator, for having shortened the censorship. Formerly, he reminded his hearers, it was held for five years, a time long enough to make it tyrannical and despotic, Aemilius limited it to eighteen months.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then turning to Appius he asked him: <q direct="unspecified">Pray tell me, Appius, what would you have done had you been censor at the time that C. Furius and M. Geganius were censors?</q> Appius Claudius replied that the tribune's question had not much bearing on his case.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He argued that though the law might be binding in the case of those censors during whose period of office it was passed, because it
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> was after they had been appointed that the people ordered the measure to become law, and the last order of the people was law for the time being, nevertheless, neither he nor any of the censors subsequently appointed could be bound by it because all succeeding censors had been appointed by the order of the people and the last order of the people was the law for the time being. <note anchored="yes" n="14" resp="ed">Appius' argument is this: The Aemilian Law only restricted the censorship of Furius and Geganius, because whilst their election was tantamount to one <q direct="unspecified">order of the people</q> the Aemilian Law was a second <q direct="unspecified">order of the people</q> superseding the first. But in all subsequent elections there was only one <q direct="unspecified">order of the people,</q> viz. the election itself, and therefore the original law which fixed the duration of the office at five years resumed its validity.</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This quibble on the part of Appius convinced no one. Sempronius then addressed the Assembly in the following language: <q direct="unspecified">Quirites, here you have the progeny of that Appius who, after being appointed decemvir for one year, appointed himself for a second year, and then, without going through any form of appointment either at his own hands or at any one
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> else's, retained the fasces and the supreme authority for a third year, and persisted in retaining them until the power which he gained by foul means, exercised by foul means, and retained by foul means, proved his ruin.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This is the family, Quirites, by whose violence and lawlessness you were driven out of your City and compelled to occupy the Sacred Mount;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the family against which you won the protection of your tribunes; the family on whose account you took up your position, in two armies, on the Aventine.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It is this family which has always opposed the laws against usury and the agrarian laws; which interfered with the right of intermarriage between patricians and plebeians; which blocked the path of the plebs to curule offices.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This name is much more deadly to your liberties than the name of the Tarquins. Is it really the case, Appius Claudius, that though it is a hundred years since Mamercus Aemilius was Dictator, and there have been all those censors since, men of the highest rank and strength of character, not one of them ever read the Twelve Tables, not one of them knew that the last order of the people is the law for the time being?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Of course they all knew it, and because they knew it they preferred to obey the Aemilian Law rather than that older one by which the censors were originally appointed, simply because the former was
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> the last passed by order of the people and also because when two laws contradict each other the later one repeals the earlier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Do you maintain, Appius, that the people are not bound by the Aemilian Law, or do you claim, if they are bound by it, that you alone are exempt from its provisions? That law availed to bind those arbitrary censors C. Furius and M. Geganius, who gave us a proof of the mischief which that office could work in the republic when, in revenge for the limitation of their power, they placed among
					<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> the <foreign lang="la">aerarii</foreign> the foremost soldier and statesman of his time, Mamercus Aemilius. It bound all the succeeding censors for a hundred years, it binds your colleague C. Plautius, who was appointed under the same auspices, with the same powers as yourself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Did not the people appoint him <q direct="unspecified">with all the customary powers and privileges</q> that a censor can possess? Or are you the solitary exception in whom all these powers and privileges reside?
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Whom then can you appoint as <q direct="unspecified">king for sacrifices</q>? He will cling to the name of <q direct="unspecified">king</q> and say that he was ap- pointed with all the powers that the Kings of Rome possessed. Who do you suppose would be contented with a six months' dictatorship or a five days' interregnum?
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Whom would you venture to nominate as Dictator for the purpose of driving in the nail or presiding at the Games? How stupid and spiritless, Quirites, you must consider those men to have been who after their magnificent achievements resigned their dictatorship in twenty days, or vacated their office owing to some flaw in their appointment!
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But why should I recall instances of old time? It is not ten years since C. Maenius as Dictator was conducting a criminal process with a rigour which some powerful people con- sidered dangerous to themselves, and in consequence his enemies charged him with being tainted with the very crime he was investigating.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He at once resigned his dictatorship in order to meet, as a private citizen, the charges brought against him. I am far from wishing to see such moderation in you, Appius . Do not show yourself a degenerate scion of your house; do not fall short of your ancestors in their craving for power, their love of tyranny; do not vacate your office a day or an hour sooner than you are obliged, only see that you do not exceed the fixed term.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Perhaps you will he satisfied with an additional day or an additional month?
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> <q direct="unspecified">No,</q> he says, <q direct="unspecified">I shall hold my censorship for three years and a half beyond the period fixed by the Aemilian Law and I shall hold it alone.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> This sounds very much like an absolute monarch. Or will you co-opt a colleague, a pro- ceeding forbidden by divine laws even where one has been lost by death?</q></p> <p><q direct="unspecified">There is a sacred function going back to the very earliest times, the only one actually initiated by the deity in whose honour it is performed, which has always been discharged by men of the highest rank and most blameless character.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> You, conscientious censor that you are, have transferred this ministry to servants, and a House older than this City, hallowed by the hospitality they showed to immortal gods, has become extinct in one short year owing to you and your censorship.
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> But this is not enough for you, you will not rest till you have involved the whole commonwealth in a sacrilege the consequences of which I dare not contemplate.
						<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> The capture of this City occurred in that lustrum in which the censor, L. Papirius Cursor, after the death of his colleague, C. Julius, co-opted as his colleague M. Cornelius Maluginensis sooner than abdicate his office. And yet how much more moderation did he show even then than you Appius; he did not continue to hold his censorship alone nor beyond the legal term.
						<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> L. Papirius did not, however, find any one to follow his example, all succeeding censors resigned office on the death of their colleague. But nothing restrains you, neither the expiry of your term of office nor the resignation of your colleague nor the Law nor any feeling of self-respect.
						<milestone unit="section" n="23"/> You consider it a merit to show arrogance, effrontery, contempt of gods and men. When I consider the majesty and reverence which surround the office that you have held, Appius Claudius, I am most reluctant to subject you to personal restraint or even to address you in severe terms.
						<milestone unit="section" n="24"/> But your obstinacy and arrogance have compelled me to speak as I have done, and now I warn you that if you do not comply with the Aemilian Law I shall order you to be taken to prison.
						<milestone unit="section" n="25"/> Our ancestors made it a rule that if at the election of censors two candidates did not get the requisite majority of votes one should not be returned alone, but the election should be adjourned. Under this rule, as you cannot be appointed sole censor, I will not allow you to remain in office alone.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>He then ordered the censor to be arrested and taken to prison. Appius formally appealed to the protection of the tribunes, and though Sempronius was supported by six of his colleagues, the other three vetoed any further proceedings. Appius continued to hold his office alone amidst universal indignation and disgust.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">War with Etruria.</note> these proceedings in Rome the siege of Sutrium was being kept up by the Etruscans. The consul Fabius was marching to assist the allies of Rome and to attempt the enemy's lines wherever it seemed practicable. His route lay along the lowest slopes of the mountain range, when he came upon the hostile forces drawn up in battle formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The wide plain which stretched below revealed their enormous numbers, and in order to compensate for his own inferiority in that respect by the advantage of position, he deflected his column a little way on to the rising ground, which was rough and covered with stones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then formed his front against the enemy. The Etruscans, thinking of nothing but their numbers, on which they solely relied, came on with such eager impetuosity that they flung away their javelins in order to come more quickly to a hand-to-hand fight, and rushed upon their foe with drawn swords.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The Romans, on the other hand, showered down upon them first their javelins and then the stones with which the ground plentifully supplied them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Shields and helmets alike were struck, and those who were not wounded were confounded and bewildered; it was almost impossible for them to get to close quarters, and they had no missiles with which to keep up the fight from a distance.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Whilst they were standing as a mark for the missiles, without any sufficient protection, some even retreating, the whole line wavering and unsteady, the Roman hastati and principes raised their battleshout again and charged down upon them with drawn swords.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Etruscans did not wait for the charge but faced about and in disorderly flight made for their camp. The Roman cavalry, however, galloping in a slanting direction across the plain, headed off the fugitives, who gave up all idea of reaching their camp and turned off to the mountains.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For the most part without arms, and with a large proportion of wounded, the fugitives entered the Ciminian forest. Many thousands of Etruscans were killed, thirty-eight standards were taken, and in the capture of the camp the Romans secured an immense amount of booty. Then the question was discussed whether to pursue the enemy or no.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Ciminian forest was, in those days, more frightful and impassable than the German forests were recently found to be; not a single trader had, up to that time, ventured through it. Of those present in the council of war, hardly any one but the general himself was bold enough to undertake to enter it; they had not yet forgotten the horrors of Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> According to one tradition, it appears that M. Fabius, the consul's brother &mdash;others say Caeso, others again L. Claudius, the consul's halfbrother &mdash;declared that he would go and reconnoitre, and shortly return with accurate information.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He had been brought up in Caere, and was thoroughly conversant with the Etruscan language and literature. There is authority for asserting that at that time Roman boys were, as a rule, instructed in Etruscan literature as they now are in Greek, but I think the probability is that there was something remarkable about the man who displayed such boldness in disguising himself and mingling with the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He is said to have been accompanied by only one servant, and during their journey they only made brief inquiries as to the nature of the country and the names of its leading men, lest they should make some startling blunder in conversing with the natives and so be found out.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They went disguised as shepherds, with their rustic weapons, each carrying two bills and two heavy javelins.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But neither their familiarity with the language nor the fashion of their dress nor their implements afforded them so much protection as the impossibility of believing that any stranger would enter the Cimiman forest. It is stated that they penetrated as far as Camerinum in Umbria, and on their arrival there the Roman ventured to say who they were.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He was introduced into the senate, and, acting in the consul's name, he established a treaty of friendship with them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After having been most kindly and hospitably received, he was requested to inform the Romans that thirty days' provision would be ready for them if they came into that district, and the Camertine soldiery would he prepared to act under their orders.</p> <p>When the consul received this report, he sent the baggage on in advance at the first watch.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The legions were ordered to march behind the baggage, while he himself remained behind with the cavalry. The following day at dawn he rode up with his cavalry to the
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> enemy's outposts stationed on the edge of the forest, and after he had engaged their attention for a considerable time, he returned to the camp and, in the evening, leaving by the rear gate, he started after the column. By dawn on the following day he was holding the nearest heights of the Ciminian range, and after surveying the rich fields of Etruria he sent out parties to forage.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> A very large quantity of plunder had already been secured when some cohorts of Etruscan peasantry, hastily got together by the authorities of the neighbourhood, sought to check the foragers;
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> they were, however, so badly organised that, instead of rescuing the prey, they almost fell a prey themselves.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After putting them to flight with heavy loss, the Romans ravaged the country far and wide, and returned to their camp loaded with plunder of every kind.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>It happened to be during this raid that a deputation, consisting of five members of the senate with two tribunes of the plebs, came to warn Fabius, in the name of the senate, not to traverse the Ciminian forest. They were very glad to find that they had come too late to prevent the expedition, and returned to Rome to report victory.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This expedition did not bring the war to a close, it only extended it. The whole country lying below the Ciminian range had felt the effect of his devastations, and they roused the indignation of the cantons of Etruria and of the adjoining districts of Umbria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A larger army than had ever assembled before was marched to Sutrium. Not only did they advance their camp beyond the edge of the forest, but they showed such eagerness that they marched down in battle order on to the plain as soon as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> After advancing some distance they halted, leaving a space between them and the Roman camp for the enemy to form his lines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they became aware that their enemy declined battle, they marched up to the rampart of the camp and, on seeing that the outposts retired within the camp, they loudly insisted upon their generals ordering the day's rations to be brought down to them from their camp, as they intended to remain under arms and attack the hostile camp, if not by night, at all events at dawn. The Romans were quite as excited at the prospect of battle, but they were kept quiet by their commander's authority.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when the general ordered the troops to take food, and instructed them to remain under arms and in readiness at what- ever hour he gave the signal, whether by day or by night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> In a brief address to his men he drew a contrast between the military qualities of the Samnites and those of the Etruscans, speaking highly of the former and disparaging the latter, saying that there was no comparison between them as regarded either their courage or their numbers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They would learn in time that he had another weapon in reserve, meanwhile he must keep silence. By these dark hints he made his men believe that the enemy were being betrayed, and this helped to restore the courage which had quailed at the sight of such an immense multitude. This impression was confirmed by the absence of any intention on the part of the enemy to entrench the ground they were occupying.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After the troops had had dinner, they rested until about the fourth watch. Then they rose quietly and armed themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> A quantity of mattock-headed axes were distributed to the camp-followers, with which they were to dig away the rampart and fill up the fosse with it The troops were formed up within their entrenchments, and picked cohorts were posted at the exits of the camp. Then a little before dawn &mdash;in summer nights the time for deepest sleep &mdash;the signal was given, the men crossed the levelled rampart in line and fell upon the enemy, who were lying about in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Some were killed before they could stir, others only half awake as they lay, most of them whilst wildly endeavouring to seize their arms. Only a few had time to arm themselves, and these, with no standards under which to rally, no officers to lead them, were routed and fled, the Romans following in hot pursuit. Some sought their camp, others the forest. The latter proved the safer refuge, for the camp, situated in the plain below, was taken the same day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The gold and silver were ordered to be brought to the consul; the rest of the spoil became the property of the soldiers. The killed and prisoners amounted to 6o,ooo.</p> <p>Some authors assert that this great battle was fought beyond the Cimiman forest, at Perusia, and that fears were felt in the City lest the army, cut off from all help by that terrible forest, should he overwhelmed by a united force of Tuscans and Umbrians.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> But wherever it was fought, the Romans had the best of it As a result of this victory, Perusia, Cortona, and Arretium, which were at that time the three leading cantons of Etruria, sent to Rome for a treaty of peace. A thirty years' truce was granted them.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Operations against the Samnites.</note> these occurrences in Etruria the other consul, C. Marcius Rutilus, took Allifae from the Samnites. Many other fortified posts and hamlets were either destroyed or passed uninjured into the power of the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> While this was going on, P. Cornelius, whom the senate had made maritime prefect, took the Roman fleet to Campania and brought up at Pompeii. Here the crews landed and proceeded to ravage the territory of Nuceria. After devastating the district near the coast, from which they could have easily reached their ships, they went further inland, attracted as usual by the desire for plunder, and here they roused the inhabitants against them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As long as they were scattered through the fields they met nobody, though they might have been cut off to a man, but when they returned, thinking themselves perfectly safe, they were overtaken by the peasants and stripped of all their plunder. Some were killed; the survivors were driven helter-skelter to their ships.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>However great the alarm created in Rome by Q. Fabius' expedition through the Ciminian forest, there was quite as much pleasure felt by the Samnites when they heard of it. They said that the Roman army was hemmed in; it was the Caudine disaster over again;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the old recklessness had again led a nation always greedy for further conquests into an impassable forest; they were beset by the difficulties of the ground quite as much as by hostile arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Their delight was, however, tinged with envy when they reflected that fortune had diverted the glory of finishing the war with Rome from the Samnites to the Etruscans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> So they concentrated their whole strength to crush C. Marcius or, if he did not give them a chance of fighting, to march through the country of the Marsi and Sabines into Etruria. The consul advanced against them, and a desperate battle was fought with no decisive result.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Which side lost most heavily was doubtful, but a rumour was spread that the Romans had been worsted, as they had lost some belonging to the equestrian order and some military tribunes, besides a staff officer, and &mdash;what was a signal disaster &mdash;the consul himself was wounded. Reports of the battle, exaggerated as usual, reached Rome and created the liveliest alarm among the senators.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was decided that a Dictator should be nominated, and no one had the slightest doubt that Papirius Cursor would be nominated, the one man who was regarded as the supreme general of his day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But they did not believe that a messenger could get through to the army in Samnium, as the whole country was hostile nor were they by any means sure that Marcius was still alive.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The other consul, Fabius, was on bad terms with Papirius. To prevent this private feud from causing public danger, the senate resolved to send a deputation to Fabius, consisting of men of consular rank, who were to support
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> their authority as public envoys by using their personal influence to induce him to lay aside all feeling of enmity for the sake of his country.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>When they had handed to Fabius the resolution of the senate, and had employed such arguments as their instructions demanded, the consul, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground, withdrew from the deputation, without making any reply and leaving them in utter uncertainty as to what he would do.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Subsequently, he nominated L. Papirius dictator according to the traditional usage at midnight. When the deputation thanked him for having shown such rare self-command, he remained absolutely silent, and without vouchsafing any reply or making any allusion to what he had done, he abruptly dismissed them, showing by his conduct what a painful effort it had cost him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Papirius named C. Junius Bubulcus, Master of the Horse. Whilst he was submitting to the Assembly of Curies the resolution conferring the Dictatorial power, an unfavourable omen compelled him to adjourn the proceedings. It fell to the Faucian cury to vote first, and this cury had voted first in the years in which two memorable disasters occurred, the capture of the City and the capitulation of Caudium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Licinius Macer adds a third disaster through which this cury became ill-omened, the massacre at the Cremera.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following day, after fresh auspices had been taken, the Dictator was invested with his official powers. He took command of the legions which were raised during the scare connected with the expedition through the Ciminian forest, and led them to Longula.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Here he took over the consul's troops, and with the united force went into the field. The enemy showed no disposition to shirk battle, but while the two armies stood facing each other fully prepared for action, yet neither anxious to begin, they were overtaken by night.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their standing camps were within a short distance of each other, and for some days they remained
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> quiet, not, however, through any distrust of their own strength or any feeling of contempt for the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Meantime the Romans were meeting with success in Etruria, for in an engagement with the Umbrians the enemy were unable to keep up the fight with the spirit with which they began it, and, without any great loss, were completely routed. An engagement also took place at Lake Vadimonis, where the Etruscans had concentrated an army raised under a <foreign lang="la">lex sacrata</foreign>,<note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="ed">For the Lex Sacrata, see note 15 to Book IV. We see here that it was common to most of the old Italian nationalities. An army so raised was regarded as a devoted body pledged under the most fearful oaths to absolute obedience to their general and also to fight to the death. The most notable instance of this method of raising troops occurs in the following book.</note> in which each man chose his comrade.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As their army was more numerous than any they had previously raised, so they exhibited a higher courage than they had ever shown before. So savage was the feeling on both sides that, without discharging a single missile, they began the fight at once with swords.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The fury displayed in the combat, which long hung in the balance, was such that it seemed as though it was not the Etruscans who had been so often defeated that we were fighting with, but some new, unknown people. There was not the slightest sign of yielding anywhere; as the men in the first line fell, those in the second took their places, to defend the standards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> At length the last reserves had to be brought up, and to such an extremity of toil and danger had matters come that the Roman cavalry dismounted, and, leaving their horses in charge, made their way over piles of armour and heaps of slain to the front ranks of the infantry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> They appeared like a fresh army amongst the exhausted combatants, and at once threw the Etruscan standards into confusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The rest of the men, worn out as they were, nevertheless followed up the cavalry attack, and at last broke through the enemy's ranks. Their determined resistance was now overcome, and when once their maniples began to give way, they soon took to actual flight.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>That day broke for the first time the power of the Etruscans after their long-continued and abundant prosperity. The main strength of their army was left on the field, and their camp was taken and plundered.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Equally hard fighting and an equally brilliant success characterised the campaign which immediately followed against the Samnites. In addition to their usual preparations for war, they had new glittering armour made in which their troops were quite resplendent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There were two divisions; one had their shields plated with gold, the other with silver. The shield was made straight and broad at the top to cover the chest and shoulders, then became narrower towards the bottom to allow of it being more easily moved about.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> To protect the front of the body they wore coats of chain armour; the left leg was covered with a greave, and their helmets were plumed to give them the appearance of being taller than they really were.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The tunics of the men with gold plated shields were in variegated colours, those with the silver shields had tunics of white linen. The latter were assigned to the right wing, the former were posted on the left.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Romans knew that all this splendid armour had been provided, and they had been taught by their generals that a soldier ought to inspire dread not by being decked out in gold and silver but by trusting to his courage and his sword.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They looked upon those things as a spoil for the enemy rather than a defence for the wearer, resplendent enough before a battle but soon stained and fouled by wounds and bloodshed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They knew that the one ornament of the soldier was courage, and all that finery would belong to whichever side won the victory; an enemy however rich was the prize of the victor, however poor the victor might be.</p><p>With this teaching fresh in their minds, Cursor led his men into battle.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He took his place on the right wing, and gave the command of the left to the Master of the Horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> As soon as the two lines came into collision, a contest began between the Dictator and the Master of the Horse, quite as keen as the struggle against the enemy, as to whose division should be the first to win the victory. Junius happened to be the first to dislodge the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Bringing up his left wing against the enemy's right, where the "devoted" soldiers were posted, conspicuous in their white tunics and glittering armour, he declared that he would sacrifice them to Orcus, and, pushing the attack, he shook their ranks and made them visibly give way.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> On seeing this, the Dictator exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">Shall the victory begin on the left wing? Is the right wing, the Dictator's own division, going to follow where another had led the way in battle, and not win for itself the greatest share of the victory?</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> This roused the men; the cavalry behaved with quite as much gallantry as the infantry, and the staff-officers displayed no less energy than the generals.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> M. Valerius on the right wing, and P. Decius on the left, both men of consular rank, rode up to the cavalry who were covering the flanks and urged them to snatch some of the glory for themselves. They charged the enemy on both flanks, and the double attack increased the consternation of the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> To complete their discomfiture, the Roman legions again raised their battleshout and charged home. Now the Samnites took to flight, and soon the plain was filled with shining armour and heaps of bodies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> At first the terrified Samnites found shelter in their camp, but they were not able even to hold that; it was captured, plundered, and burnt before nightfall.</p> <p>The senate decreed a triumph for the Dictator.
							<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> By far the greatest sight in the procession was the captured armour, and so magnificent were the pieces considered that the gilded shields were distributed amongst the owners of the silversmiths' shops to adorn the Forum.
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> This is said to be the origin of the custom of the aediles decorating the Forum when the symbols of three Capitoline deities are conducted in procession through the City on the occasion of the Great Games. Whilst the Romans made use of this armour to honour the gods, the Campanians, out of contempt and hatred towards the Samnites, made the gladiators who performed at their banquets wear it, and they then called them <q direct="unspecified">Samnites.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>The consul Fabius fought a battle this year with the remnants of the Etruscans at Perusia, for this city had broken the truce.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> He gained an easy and decisive victory, and after the battle he approached the walls and would have taken the place had not envoys been sent on to surrender it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> After he had stationed a garrison in Perusia, deputations came to him from different cities in Etruria to ask for a restoration of amicable relations; these he sent on to the senate at Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> Then he entered the city in triumphal procession, after achieving a more solid success than the Dictator, especially as the defeat of the Samnites was put down largely to the credit of the staff-officers, P. Decius and M. Valerius. These men were chosen by an almost unanimous vote at the next elections &mdash;one as consul, the other as praetor.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Owing to his splendid services in the subjugation of Etruria, the consulship of Fabius was extended to another year, Decius being his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Valerius was elected praetor for the fourth time.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The consuls arranged their respective commands; Etruria fell to Decius, and Samnium to Fabius. Fabius marched to Nuceria, where the people of Alfaterna met him with a request for peace, but as they had refused it when offered to them before, he declined to grant it now.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> It was not till he actually began to attack the place that they were forced into unconditional surrender. He fought an action with the Samnites and won an easy victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The memory of that battle would not have survived if it had not been that the Marsi engaged for the first time on that occasion in hostilities with Rome. The Peligni, who had followed the example of the Marsi, met with the same fate.</p> <p>The other consul, Decius, was also successful.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He inspired such alarm in Tarquinii that its people provided his army with corn and asked for a forty years' truce.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He captured several fortified posts belonging to Volsinii, some of which he destroyed that they might not serve as retreats for the enemy, and by extending his operations in all directions he made his name so dreaded that the whole Etruscan league begged him to grant a treaty. There was not the slightest chance of their obtaining one, but a truce was granted them for one year.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> They had to provide a year's pay for the troops and two tunics for every soldier. That was the price of the truce.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>While matters were thus quieted in Etruria fresh trouble was caused by the sudden defection of the Umbrians, a people hitherto untouched by the ravages of war beyond what their land had suffered from the passage of the Romans. They called out all their fighting men and compelled a large section of the Etruscan population to resume hostilities. The army which they mustered was so large that they began to talk in very braggart tones about themselves and in very contemptuous terms about the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They even expressed their intention of leaving Decius in their rear and marching straight to attack Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their intentions were disclosed to Decius; he at once hastened by forced marches to a city outside the frontiers of Etruria and took up a position in the territory of Pupinia, to watch the enemy's movements.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>This hostile movement on the part of the Umbrians was regarded very seriously in Rome, even their menacing language made people, after their experience of the Gaulish invasion, tremble for the safety of their City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Instructions were accordingly sent to Fabius, ordering him, if he could for the time being suspend operations in Samnium, to march with all speed into Umbria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The consul at once acted upon his instructions and proceeded by forced marches to Mevania, where the forces of the Umbrians were stationed. They were under the impression that he was far away in Samnium, with another war on his hands, and his sudden arrival produced such consternation amongst them,
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> that some advised a retreat into their fortified cities, while others were in favour of abandoning the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> There was one canton &mdash;the natives call it Materina &mdash;which not only kept the rest under arms but even induced them to come to an immediate engagement. They attacked Fabius while he was fortifying his camp. When he saw them making a rush towards his entrenchments he called his men off from their work and marshalled them in the best order that the ground and the time at his disposal allowed. He reminded them of the glory they had won in Etruria and in Samnium, and bade them finish off this wretched aftergrowth of the Etruscan war and exact a fitting retribution for the impious language in which the enemy had threatened to attack Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> His words were received with such eagerness by his men that their enthusiastic shouts interrupted their commander's address, and without waiting for the word of command or the notes of the trumpets and bugles they raced forward against the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> They did not attack them as though they were armed men; marvellous to relate, they began by snatching the standards from those who bore them, then the standardbearers were themselves dragged off to the consul, the soldiers were pulled across from the one army to the other, the action
					<milestone unit="section" n="19??"/> was everywhere fought with shields rather than with swords, men were knocked down by the bosses of shields and blows under the arm-pits. More were captured tan killed, and only one cry was heard throughout the ranks: <q direct="unspecified">Lay down your arms!</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> So, on the field of battle, the prime authors of the war surrendered. During the next few days the rest of the Umbrian communities submitted. The Ocriculans entered into a mutual undertaking with Rome and were admitted to her friendship.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After bringing to a victorious close the war which had been allotted to his colleague, Fabius returned to his own sphere of action.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> As he had conducted operations with such success the senate followed the precedent set by the people in the previous year and extended his command for a third year in spite of the strenuous opposition of Appius Claudius who was now consul, the other consul being L. Volumnius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I find in some annalists that Appius was a candidate for the consulship while he was still censor, and that L. Furius, a tribune of the plebs, stopped the election until he had resigned his censorship.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> A new enemy, the Sallentines, had appeared, and the conduct of this war was assigned to his colleague; Appius himself remained in Rome with the view of strengthening his influence by his domestic administration, as the attainment of military glory was in other hands.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Volumnius had no cause to regret this arrangement, he fought many successful actions and took some of the enemy's cities by storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He was lavish in distributing the spoil, and this generosity was rendered still more pleasing by his frank and cordial manner; by qualities such as these he made his men keen to face any perils or labours.</p> <p>Q. Fabius, as proconsul, fought a pitched battle with the Samnites near the city of Allifae. There was very little uncertainty as to the result; the enemy were routed and driven to their camp, and they would not have held that had more daylight been left.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Before night, however, their camp was completely invested, so that none could escape. On the morrow while it was still twilight they made proposals for surrender, and their surrender was accepted on condition that the Samnites should be dismissed with one garment apiece after they had all passed under the yoke.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> No provision had been made for their allies, and as many as 7000 of them were sold into slavery.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Those who declared themselves Hernicans were separated and placed under guard; subsequently Fabius sent them all to the senate in Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> After inquiries had been made as to whether they had fought for the Samnites against Rome as conscripts or as volunteers, they were committed to the custody of the Latin cities. The new consuls, P. Cornelius Arvina and Q. Marcius Tremulus, were ordered to bring the whole question of the prisoners before the senate.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Hernicans resented this, and a national council was held at Anagnia in what they call the Maritime Circus; the whole nation thereupon, with the exception of Aletrium, Ferentinae, and Verulae, declared war against Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Subjugation of the Hernicans and Aequi &mdash;Peace with the Samnites.</note> Now that Fabius had evacuated the country the Samnites became restless. Calatia and Sora and the Roman garrisons there were taken by storm, and the soldiers who had been taken prisoners were cruelly massacred. P. Cornelius was despatched thither with an army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Anagnians and Hernicans had been assigned to Marcius. At first the enemy occupied such a well-chosen position
					<milestone unit="section" n="3??"/> between the camps of the two consul that no messenger, however active, could get through, and for some days both consuls were kept in ignorance of everything
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> and in anxious suspense as to each other's movements. Tidings of this alarming state of things reached Rome, and every man liable to service was called out; two complete armies were raised against sudden emergencies. But the progress of the war did not justify this extreme alarm, nor was it
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> worthy of the old reputation which the Hernicans enjoyed. They attempted nothing worth mentioning, within a few days they were stripped of three camps in succession, and begged for a thirty days'
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> armistice to allow of their sending envoys to Rome. To obtain this they consented to supply the troops with six months' pay and one tunic per man. The envoys were referred by the senate to Marcius, to whom they had given full powers to treat,
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> and he received the formal surrender of the Hernicans.</p> <p>The other consul in Samnium, though superior in strength, was more hampered in his movements. The enemy had blocked all the roads and secured the passes so that no supplies could be brought in, and though the consul drew up his line and offered battle each day
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> he failed to allure the enemy into an engagement. It was quite clear that the Samnites would not risk an immediate conflict, and
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> that the Romans could not stand a prolonged campaign. The arrival of Marcius, who after subjugating the Hernicans had hurried to the assistance of his colleague, made it
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> impossible for the enemy to delay matters any longer. They had not felt themselves strong enough to meet even one army in the open field, and they knew that their position would be perfectly
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> hopeless if the two consular armies formed a junction; they decided, therefore, to attack Marcius while he was on the march before he had time to deploy his men . The soldiers' kits were hurriedly thrown together in the centre, and the fighting
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> line was formed as well as the time allowed. The noise of the battle-shout rolling across and then the sight of the cloud of dust in the distance
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> created great excitement in the standing camp of Cornelius. He at once ordered the men to arm for battle, and led them hurriedly out of the camp into line. It would, he exclaimed, be a scandalous disgrace if they allowed the other army to win a victory which both ought to share, and failed to maintain their claim to the
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> glory of a war which was especially their own. He then made a flank attack, and breaking through
						<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> the enemy's centre pushed on to their camp, which was denuded of defenders, and burnt it As soon as Marcius' troops caught sight of the flames, and the enemy looking behind them saw them too, the Samnites took to flight in all directions, but no place
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> afforded them a safe refuge, death awaited them everywhere.</p> <p>After 30,000 of the enemy had
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> been killed the consuls gave the signal to retire. They were recalling and collecting the troops together amidst mutual congratulations when suddenly fresh cohorts of the enemy were seen in the distance, consisting of recruits who had been sent up as reinforcements. This renewed the carnage, for, without any orders from the consuls or any signal given, the victorious Romans attacked them, exclaiming as they charged that the Samnite
							<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> recruits would have to pay dearly for their training. The consuls did not check the ardour of their men, for they knew well that raw soldiers would not even attempt to fight
							<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> when the veterans around them were in disorderly flight. Nor were they mistaken; all the Samnite forces,
							<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> veterans and recruits alike, fled to the nearest mountains. The Romans went up after them, no place afforded safety to the beaten foe, they were routed from the heights they had occupied, and at last with one voice they all begged for peace. They were ordered to supply corn for three months, a year's pay, and a tunic for each soldier, and envoys were
							<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> despatched to the senate to obtain terms of peace.</p> <p>Cornelius was left in Samnium; Marcius entered the City in triumphal procession alter his subjugation of the Hernicans. An equestrian statue was decreed to him which was erected in

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>P. Cornelius Scipio was nominated Dictator this year, with P. Decius Mus as Master of the Horse, for the purpose
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> of holding the elections, as neither of the consuls could leave the seat of war. The consuls elected were L. Postumius and Tiberius Minucius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Piso places these consuls immediately after Q. Fabius and P. Decius, omitting the two years in which I have inserted the consulships of Claudius and Volumnius and of Cornelius and Marcius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Whether this was due to a slip of memory in drawing up the lists or whether he purposely omitted them, believing them to be wrongly inserted, is uncertain.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Samnites made forays this year into the district of Stellae in Campania. Both consuls accordingly were despatched to Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Postumius marched to Tifernum, Minucius made Bovianum his objective. Postumius was the first to come into touch with the enemy and a battle was fought at Tifernum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Some authorities state that the Samnites were thoroughly beaten and 24,000 prisoners taken. According to others the battle was an indecisive one, and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> Postumius, in order to create an impression that he was afraid of the enemy, withdrew by night into the mountains, whither the enemy followed him and took up an entrenched position two miles away from him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> To keep up the appearance of having sought a safe and commodious place for a standing camp &mdash;and such it really was &mdash;the consul strongly entrenched himself and furnished his camp with all necessary stores.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Then, leaving a strong detachment to hold it, he started at the third watch and led his legions in light marching order by the shortest possible route to his colleague, who was also encamped in front of another Samnite army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Acting on Postumius' advice Minucius engaged the enemy, and after the battle had gone on for the greater part of the day without either side gaining the advantage, Postumius brought up his fresh legions and made an unsuspected attack upon the enemy's wearied lines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Exhausted by fighting and by wounds they were incapable of flight and were practically annihilated. Twenty-one standards were captured.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Both armies marched to the camp which Postumius had formed, and there they routed and dispersed the enemy, who were demoralised by the news of the previous battle. Twenty-six standards were captured, the captain-general of the Samnites, Statius Gellius, and a large number of men were made prisoners, and both camps were taken.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The next day they commenced an attack on Bovianum which was soon taken, and the consuls after their brilliant successes celebrated a joint triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Some authorities assert that the consul Minucius was carried back to the camp severely wounded and died there, and that M. Fulvius was made consul in his place, and after taking over the command of Minucius' army effected the capture of Bovianum.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>During the year Sora, Arpinum, and Cesennia were recovered from the Samnites The great statue of Hercules was also set up and dedicated in the Capitol.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>P. Sulpicius Saverrio and P. Sempronius Sophus were the next consuls. During their consulship the Samnites, anxious for either a termination or at least a suspension of hostilities, sent envoys to Rome to sue for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> In spite of their submissive attitude they did not meet with a very favourable reception. The reply they received was to the effect that if the Samnites had not often made proposals for peace while they were actually preparing for war negotiations might possibly have been entered into, but now as their words had proved worthless the question must be decided by their deeds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were informed that the consul P. Sempronius would shortly be in Samnium with his army, and he would he able to judge accurately whether they were more disposed to peace or to war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When he had obtained all the information that he wanted he would lay it before the senate; on his return from Samnium the envoys might follow him to Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Wherever Sempronius marched they found the Samnites peaceably disposed and ready to supply them with provisions and stores. The old treaty was therefore restored.</p> <p>From that quarter the Roman arms were turned against their old enemies the Aequi. For many years this nation had remained quiet, disguising their real sentiments under a peaceable attitude.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As long as the Hernicans remained unsubdued the Aequi had frequently co-operated with them in sending help to the Samnites, but after their final subjugation almost the whole of the Aequian nation threw off the mask and openly went over to the enemy. After Rome had renewed the treaty with the Samnites the fetials went on to the Aequi to demand satisfaction.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They were told that their demand was simply regarded as an attempt on the part of the Romans to intimidate them by threats of war into becoming Roman citizens.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> How desirable a thing this citizenship was might be seen in the case of the Hernicans who, when allowed to choose, preferred living under their own laws to becoming citizens of Rome. To men who were not allowed which they would prefer, but were made Roman citizens by compulsion, it would be a punishment.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>As these opinions were pretty generally expressed in their different councils, the Romans ordered war to be declared against the Aequi.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Both the consuls took the field and selected a position four miles distant from the enemy's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As the Aequi had for many years had no experience of a national war, their army was like a body of irregulars with no properly appointed generals and no discipline or obedience. They were in utter confusion; some were of opinion that they ought to give battle, others thought they ought to confine themselves to defending their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The majority were influenced by the prospect of their fields being devastated and their cities, with their scanty garrisons, being destroyed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> In this diversity of opinions one was given utterance to which put out of sight all care for the common weal and directed each man's regards to his own private interests.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They were advised to abandon their camp at the first watch, carry off all their belongings, and disperse to their respective cities to protect their property behind their walls. This advice met with the warmest approval from all.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Whilst the enemy were thus straggling homewards, the Romans as soon as it was light marched out and formed up in order of battle, and as there was no one to oppose, they went on at a quick march to the enemy's camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Here they found no pickets before the gates or on the rampart, none of the noise which is customary in a camp, and fearing from the unusual silence that a surprise was being prepared they came to a halt. At length they climbed over the rampart and found everything deserted.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> Then they began to follow up the enemy's footsteps, but as these went in all directions alike, they found themselves going further and further astray. Subsequently they discovered through their scouts what the design of the enemy was, and their cities were successively attacked. Within a fortnight they had stormed and captured thirty-one walled towns. Most of these were sacked and burnt, and the nation of the Aequi was almost exterminated.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>A triumph was celebrated over them, and warned by their example the Marrucini, the Marsi, the Paeligni, and the Feretrani sent spokesmen to Rome to sue for peace and friendship. These tribes obtained a treaty with Rome.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Aedileship of Cnaeus Flavius.</note> was during this year that Cn. Flavius, the son of a freedman, born in a humble station of life, but a clever plausible man, became curule aedile.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> I find in some annalists the statement that at the time of the election of aediles he was acting as apparitor to the aediles, and when he found that the first vote was given in his favour, and was disallowed on the ground that he was a clerk, he laid aside his writing tablet and took an oath that he would not follow that profession.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Licinius Macer, however, attempts to show that he had given up the clerk's business for some time as he had been a tribune of the plebs, and had also twice held office as a triumvir, the first time as a <foreign lang="la">triumvir nocturnus</foreign>,<note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="ed"><q direct="unspecified">At a very remote age the direction of the police was entrusted to three magistrates called triumviri nocturni, because their principal duty was to watch over the safety of the City at night.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> colony. However this may be, there is no question that he maintained a defiant attitude towards the nobles, who regarded his lowly origin with
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> contempt. He made public the legal forms and processes which had been hidden away in the closets of the pontiffs; he exhibited a calendar written on whitened boards in the Forum, on which were marked the days on which legal proceedings were allowed; to the intense disgust of the nobility he dedicated the temple of Concord on the
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Vulcanal. At this function the Pontifex Maximus, Cornelius Barbatus, was compelled by the unanimous voice of the people to recite the usual form of devotion in spite of his insistence that in accordance with ancestral usage none but a consul or a commander-in-chief could dedicate a
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> temple. It was in consequence of this that the senate authorised a measure to be submitted to the people providing that no one should presume to dedicate a
					<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> temple or an altar without being ordered to do so by the senate or by a majority of the tribunes of the plebs.</p> <p>I will relate an incident, trivial enough in itself, but affording a striking proof of the way in which the liberties of the plebs were asserted against the insolent presumption of the
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> nobility. Flavius went to visit his colleague, who was ill. Several young nobles who were sitting in the room had agreed not to rise when he entered, on which he ordered his curule chair to be brought, and from that seat of dignity calmly surveyed his enemies, who were filled with unutterable
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> disgust.</p> <p>The elevation of Flavius to the aedileship was, however, the work of a party in the Forum who had gained their power during the censorship of Appius
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Claudius. For Appius had been the first to pollute the senate by electing into it the sons of freedmen, and when no one recognised the validity of these elections and he failed to secure in the Senate-house the influence which he had sought to gain in the City, he corrupted both the Assembly of Tribes and the Assembly of Centuries by distributing the dregs of the populace amongst all the
							<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> tribes. Such deep indignation was aroused by the election of Flavius that most of the nobles laid aside their gold rings and military decorations as a sign of
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> mourning.</p> <p>From that time the citizens were divided into two parties; the uncorrupted part of the people, who favoured and supported men of integrity and patriotism, were aiming at one thing, the "mob of the Forum" were aiming at something
								<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> else. This state of things lasted until Q. Fabius and P. Decius were made censors. Q. Fabius, for the sake of concord, and at the same time to prevent the elections from being controlled by the lowest of the populace, threw the whole of the citizens of the lowest class &mdash;the <q direct="unspecified">mob of the Forum</q> &mdash;into four tribes and called them <q direct="unspecified">the City
									<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Tribes.</q> Out of gratitude for his action, it is said, he received an epithet which he had not gained by all his victories, but which was now conferred upon him for the wisdom he had shown in thus adjusting the orders in the State &mdash; the cognomen <q direct="unspecified">Maximus.</q></p> <p>It is stated that he also instituted the annual parade of the cavalry on July 5.</p></div1>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The latter was in the country of the Aequi; 6000 colonists were settled there. Sora had been a Volscian town, but the Samnites had occupied it; 4000 men were sent there.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The right of citizenship was conferred this year upon the Arpinates and the Trebulans. The Frusinates were mulcted in a third of their territory, for it had been ascertained that they were the instigators of the Hernican revolt. The senate decreed that the consuls should hold an inquiry, and the ringleaders were scourged and beheaded.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>However, in order that the Romans might not pass a whole year without any military operations, a small expeditionary force was sent into Umbria. A certain cave was reported to be the rendezvous of a body of freebooters, and from this hiding-place they made armed excursions into the surrounding country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Roman troops entered this cave, and many of them were wounded, mostly by stones, owing to the darkness of the place. At length they discovered another entrance, for there was a passage right through the cave, and both mouths of the cavern were filled up with wood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was set on fire, and, stifled by the smoke, the bandits, in trying to escape, rushed into the flames and 2000 perished.</p> <p>M. Livius Denter and M. Aurelius were the new consuls, and during their year of office hostilities were resumed by the Aequi.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They resented the planting within their borders of a colony which was to be a stronghold of Roman power, and they made a desperate effort to capture it, but were beaten off by the colonists.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In their weakened condition it seemed almost incredible that the Aequi could have begun war, relying solely upon themselves, and the fear of an indefinitely extended war necessitated the appointment of a Dictator. C. Junius Bubulcus was nominated, and he took the field, with M. Titinius as Master of the Horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the very first battle he crushed the Aequi, and a week later he returned in triumph to the City. Whilst Dictator he dedicated the temple of Salus which he had vowed as consul and the con- struction of which he had contracted for when censor.</p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The consul, Aemilius, was sent to meet this enemy, and in one battle he routed him and drove him to his ships.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Thuriae was restored to its former inhabitants, and peace was established in the Sallentine territory. In some annalists I find it stated that the Dictator, Junius Bubulcus, was sent into that country, and that Cleonymus left Italy to avoid a conflict with the Romans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He sailed round the promontory of Brundisium, and was carried up the Adriatic, where he had on his left the harbourless shores of Italy and on his right the countries occupied by the Illyrians, the Liburnians, and the Histrians, savage tribes chiefly notorious for their acts of piracy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He dreaded the possibility of falling in with these, and consequently directed his course inland until he reached the coasts of the Veneti. Here he landed a small party to explore the neighbourhood. The information they brought back was to the effect that there was a narrow beach, and on crossing it they found lagoons which were affected by the tide; beyond these level cultivated country was visible, and in the further distance hills could be seen.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> At no great distance was the mouth of a river deep enough to allow of ships being brought up and safely anchored &mdash;this was the Meduacus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> On hearing this he ordered the fleet to make for that river and sail up-stream. As the river channel did not admit the passage of his largest ships, the bulk of his troops went up in the lighter vessels and came to a populous district belonging to the maritime villages of the Patavii, who inhabit that coast.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After leaving a few to guard the ships they landed, seized the villages, burnt the houses, and carried off the men and cattle as booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Their eagerness for plunder led them too far from their ships. The people of Patavium were obliged to be always under arms owing to their neighbours, the Gauls, and when they heard what was going on, they divided their forces into two armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> One of these was to proceed to the district where the invaders were reported to be carrying on their depredations; the other was to go by a different route, to avoid meeting any of the plunderers, to where the ships were anchored, about fourteen miles from the town. The latter attacked the ships, and after killing those who resisted them, they compelled the terrified sailors to take their vessels over to the opposite bank.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The other army had been equally successful against the plunderers, who in their flight to their ships were intercepted by the Veneti, and, hemmed in between the two armies, were cut to pieces.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some of the prisoners informed their captors that King Cleonymus, with his fleet, was only three miles distant. The prisoners were sent to the nearest village for safe-keeping, and some of the defenders got into their river boats, which were flatbottomed to allow of their passing over the shallows in the lagoons, whilst others manned the vessels they had captured and sailed down the river.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When they reached the Greek fleet they surrounded the large ships, which were afraid to stir and dreaded unknown waters more than the enemy, and pursued them to the mouth of the river. Some which in the confused fighting had run aground were captured and burnt.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>After this victory they returned. Failing to effect a successful landing in any part of the Adriatic, Cleonymus sailed away with barely a fifth part of his fleet undamaged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> There are many still living who have seen the beaks of the ships and the spoils of the Lacedaemonians hung up in the old temple of Juno in Patavium, and the anniversary of that battle is celebrated by a sham fight of ships on the river which flows through the town.</p>

								<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Such a precipitate flight is contradictory to all that we know of Fabius; for it was his reputation as a soldier that more than anything else justified his epithet of Maximus, and he never forgot the severity of Papirius towards him, and could never have been tempted to fight without the Dictator's orders.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The news of this defeat created a quite unnecessary alarm in Rome. Measures were adopted as though an army had been annihilated;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> all legal business was suspended, guards were stationed at the gates, watches were set in the different wards of the City, armour and weapons were stored in readiness on the walls, and every man within the military age was embodied.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the Dictator returned to the camp he found that, owing to the careful arrangements which the Master of the Horse had made, everything was quieter than he had expected.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The camp had been moved back into a safer position; the cohorts who had lost their standards were punished by being stationed outside the rampart without any tents;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the whole army was eager for battle that they might all the sooner wipe out the stain of their defeat.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Under these circumstances the Dictator at once advanced his camp into the neighbourhood of Rusella. The enemy followed him, and although they felt the utmost confidence in a trial of strength in the open field, they decided to practise stratagem on their enemy, as they had found it so successful before.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At no great distance from the Roman camp were some half-demolished houses belonging to a village which had been burnt when the land was harried.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Some soldiers were concealed in these and cattle were driven past the place in full view of the Roman outposts, who were under the command of a staff-officer, Cnaeus Fulvius. As not a single man left his post to take the bait, one of the drovers, coming up close to the Roman lines, called out to the others who were driving the cattle somewhat slowly away from the ruined cottages to ask them why they were so slow, as they could drive them safely through the middle of the Roman camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Some Caerites who were with Fulvius interpreted the words, and all the maniples were extremely indignant at the insult, but they did not dare to move without orders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He then instructed those who were familiar with the language to notice whether the speech of the herdsmen was more akin to that of rustics or to that of towndwellers. On being told that the accent and personal appearance were too refined for cattle-drovers, he said, <q direct="unspecified">Go and tell them to unmask the ambush they have tried in vain to conceal; the Romans know all, and can now no more be trapped by cunning than they can be vanquished by arms.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When these words were carried to those who were lying concealed, they suddenly rose from their lurking-place and advanced in order of battle on to the open plain, which afforded a view in all directions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The advancing line appeared to Fulvius to be too large a body for his men to withstand, and he sent a hasty message to the Dictator to ask for help; in the meantime he met the attack single-handed.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the message reached the Dictator, he ordered the standards to go forward and the troops to follow.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> But everything was done almost more rapidly than the orders were given. The standards were instantly snatched up, and the troops were with difficulty prevented from charging the enemy at a run. They were burning to avenge their recent defeat, and the shouts, becoming continually louder in the battle that was already going on, made them still more excited.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They kept urging each other on, and telling the standard-bearers to march more quickly, but the more haste the Dictator saw them making the more determined was he to check the column and insist upon their marching deliberately.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Etruscans had been present in their full strength when the battle began. Message after message was sent to the Dictator telling him that all the legions of the Etruscans were taking part in the fight and that his men could no longer hold out against them, whilst he himself from his higher ground saw for himself in what a critical position the outposts were.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> As however, he felt quite confident that their commander could still sustain the attack, and as he was himself near enough to save him from all danger of defeat, he decided to wait until the enemy became utterly fatigued, and then to attack him with fresh troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Although his own men were advancing so slowly there was now only a moderate distance over which to charge, at all events for cavalry, between the two lines. The standards of the legions were in front, to prevent the enemy from suspecting any sudden or secret manoeuvre, but the Dictator had left intervals in the ranks of infantry through which the cavalry could pass.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The legions raised the battle-shout, and at the same moment the cavalry charged down upon the enemy, who were unprepared for such a hurricane, and a sudden panic set in.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As the outposts, who had been all but cut off, were now relieved at the last moment, they were all allowed a respite from further exertions. The fresh troops took up the fighting, and the result did not long remain in doubt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The routed enemy sought their camp, and as they retreated before the Romans who were attacking it, they became crowded together in the furthest part.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> In trying to escape, they became blocked in the narrow gates, and a good many climbed on to the mound and stockade in the hope of defending themselves on higher ground, or possibly of crossing ramparts and fosse and so escaping.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In one part the mound had been built up too loosely, and, owing to the weight of those standing on it, crumbled down into the fosse, and many, both soldiers and non-combatants, exclaiming that the gods had cleared the passage for their flight, made their escape that way.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>In this battle the power of the Etruscans was broken up for the second time. After undertaking to provide a year's pay for the army and a two months' supply of corn, they obtained permission from the Dictator to send envoys to Rome to sue for peace.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> A regular treaty of peace was refused, but they were granted a two years' truce. The Dictator returned in triumphal procession to the City.</p> <p>Some of my authorities aver that Etruria was pacified without any important battle being fought simply through the settlement of the troubles in Arretium and the restoration of the Cilnii to popular favour.</p> <p>No sooner had M. Valerius laid down the Dictatorship than he was elected consul.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Some have thought that he was elected without having been a candidate and, therefore, in his absence, and that the election was conducted by an interrex. There is no question, however, that he held the consulship with Apuleius Pansa.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Ogulnian Law.</note> their year of office foreign affairs were fairly peaceful; the ill-success the Etruscans had met with in war and the terms of the truce kept the Etruscans quiet;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> the Samnites, after their many years of defeat and disaster, were so far quite satisfied with their recent treaty with Rome. In the City itself the large number of colonists sent out made the plebs less restless and lightened their financial burdens.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But to prevent anything like universal tranquillity a conflict between the most prominent plebeians and the patricians was started by two of the tribunes of the plebs, Quintus and Cnaeus Olgunius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> These men had sought everywhere for an opportunity of traducing the patricians before the plebs, and after all other attempts had failed they adopted a policy which was calculated to inflame the minds, not of the dregs of the populace, but of the actual leaders of the plebs, men who
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> had been consuls and enjoyed triumphs, and to whose official distinctions nothing was lacking but the priesthood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This was not yet open to both orders.</p> <p>The Ogulnii accordingly gave notice of a measure providing that as there were at that time four augurs and four pontiffs, and it had been decided that the number of
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> priests should be augmented, the four additional pontiffs and five augurs should all be co-opted from the plebs How the college of augurs could have been reduced to four, except by the death of two of their number, I am unable to discover.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> For it was a settled rule amongst the augurs that their number was bound to consist of threes, so that the three ancient tribes of the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres might each have their own augur, or if more were needed, the same number should be added for each. This was the principle on which they proceeded when by adding five to four the number was made up to nine, so that three were assigned to each tribe.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But the co-optation of the additional priests from the plebs created almost as much indignation amongst the patricians as when they saw the consulship made open.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They pretended that the matter concerned the gods more than it concerned them; as for their own sacred functions they would see for themselves that these were not polluted; they only hoped and prayed that no disaster might befall the republic.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Their opposition, however, was not so keen, because they had become habituated to defeat in these political contests, and they saw that their opponents in striving for the highest honours were not, as formerly, aiming at what they had little hopes of winning; everything for which they had striven, though with doubtful hopes of success, they had hitherto gained &mdash;numberless consulships, censorships, triumphs.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Appius Claudius and P. Decius are said to have been the leaders in this controversy, the former as the opponent, the latter as the supporter of the proposed measure.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The arguments they advanced were practically the same as those employed for and against the Licinian Laws when the demand was made for the consulship to be thrown open to the plebeians. After going over much of the old ground, Decius made a final appeal on behalf of the proposals.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He began by recalling the scene which many of those present had witnessed, when the elder Decius, his father, vested in the Gabine cincture<note anchored="yes" n="3" resp="ed">See note II to Book V.</note> and standing upon a spear, solemnly devoted himself on behalf of the legions and people of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He proceeded, <q direct="unspecified">The offering which the consul Decius made on that occasion was in the eyes of the immortal gods as pure and holy as that of his colleague, T. Manlius, would have been if he had devoted himself. Could not that Decius also have been fitly chosen to exercise priestly functions on behalf of the Roman people?
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> And for me, are you afraid that the gods will not listen to my prayers as they do to those of Appius Claudius? Does he perform his private devotions with a purer mind or worship the gods in a more religious spirit than I do?
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Who has ever had occasion to regret the vows which have been made on behalf of the commonwealth by so many plebeian consuls, so many plebeian Dictators, when they were going to take command of their armies, or when they were actually engaged in battle?
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Count up the commanders in all the years since war was for the first time waged under the leadership and auspices of plebeians, you will find as many triumphs as commanders. The plebeians, too, have their nobility and have no cause to be dissatisfied with them.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> You may be quite certain that, if a war were suddenly to break out now, the senate and people of Rome would not put more confidence in a general because he was a patrician than in one who happened to be a plebeian.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Now, if this is the case, who in heaven or earth could regard it as an indignity that the men whom you have honoured with curule chairs, with the <foreign lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>, the <foreign lang="la">tunica palmata</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="la">toga picta</foreign>, <note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="ed">for the <foreign lang="la">toga praetexta</foreign>, see note 2 to Book I. The <foreign lang="la">tunica palmata</foreign> was an under-garment embroidered with figures of victory and palm branches. Over this was thrown the <foreign lang="la">toga picta</foreign>, a purple toga embroidered with gold. These were the vestments of the Capitoline Jupiter, and were lent from the Capitol to be worn by the victorious general while he celebrated his triumph. The triumphal crown &mdash;stones set in gold &mdash;was held over him by an official as he rode in the chariot drawn by four white horses which formed the centre of the procession. The laurel wreath he wore upon his brows.</note>with the triumphal crown and the laurel wreath, the men upon whose houses you have conferred special distinction by affixing to them the spoils taken from the enemy &mdash;that these men, I say, should have in addition to their other marks of rank the insignia of the pontiffs and
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> the augurs? A triumphing general drives through the City in a gilded chariot, apparelled in the splendid vestments of Jupiter Optimus Maximus After this he goes up to the Capitol; is he not to be seen there with <foreign lang="la">capis</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">lituus</foreign><note anchored="yes" n="5" resp="ed">The <foreign lang="la">capis</foreign> was a dish used in sacrificing, here denoting the priest. The <foreign lang="la">lituus</foreign> (see Vol. I. p. 22) similarly denoted the augur.</note>? Is it to be regarded as an indignity, if he with veiled head slay a victim, or from his place on the citadel take
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> an augury? And if in the inscription on his bust the words <q direct="unspecified">consulship,</q> <q direct="unspecified">censorship,</q> <q direct="unspecified">triumph</q> are read without arousing any indignation, in what mood will the reader regard the words which you are going to add, <q direct="unspecified">augurship</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> and <q direct="unspecified">pontificate</q>? I do indeed hope, please heaven, that, thanks to the good will of the Roman people, we now possess sufficient dignity to be capable of conferring as much honour on the priesthood as we shall receive. For the sake of the gods as much as for ourselves let us insist that as we worship them now as private individuals so we may worship them for the future as officials of the State.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><q direct="unspecified">But why have I so far been assuming that the question of the patricians and the priesthood is still an open one, and that we are not yet in possession of the highest of all offices?
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> We see plebeians amongst the ten keepers of the Sacred Books, acting as interpreters of the Sibyl's runes and the Fates of this people; we see them, too, presiding over the sacrifices and other rites connected with Apollo.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> No injustice was inflicted on the patricians when an addition was made to the number of the keepers of the Sacred Books on the demand of the plebeians.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> None has been inflicted now, when a strong and capable tribune has created five more posts for augurs and four more for priests, which are to be filled by plebeians, not, Appius, with the design of ousting you patricians from your places, but in order that the plebs may assist you in the conduct of divine matters as they do to the utmost of their power in the administration of human affairs.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/><q direct="unspecified">Do not blush, Appius, to have as your colleague in the priesthood a man whom you might have had as colleague in the censorship or in the consulship, who might be Dictator with you as his Master of Horse, just as much as you might be Dictator with him for your Master of the Horse.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> A <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> immigrant, Attius Clausus, or if you prefer it, Appius Claudius, the founder of your noble house, was admitted by those old patricians into their number;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> do not think it beneath you to admit us into the number of the priests.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> We bring with us many distinctions, all those, in fact, which have made you so proud. L. Sextius was the first plebeian to be elected consul, C. Licinius Stolo was the first plebeian Master of the Horse, C. Marcius Rutilus the first plebeian who was both Dictator and censor, Q. Publilius Philo was the first praetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> We have always heard the same objection raised &mdash;that the auspices were solely in your hands, that you alone enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of noble birth, that you alone can legitimately hold sovereign command and take the auspices either in peace or war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Have you never heard the remark that it was not men sent down from heaven who were originally created patricians, but those who could cite a father,<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="ed">i.e. to prove one's legitimacy as freeborn. The phrase seems to be an attempt to explain the etymology of <foreign lang="la">patri-cuius</foreign> &mdash;<foreign lang="la">pater</foreign>=<q direct="unspecified">father,</q> <foreign lang="la">cieo</foreign>=<q direct="unspecified">cite,</q> or <q direct="unspecified">mention by name.</q></note> which is nothing more than saying that they were
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> freeborn. I can now cite a consul as my father, and my son will be able to cite him as his grandfather. It simply comes to this, Quirites, that we can get nothing without a struggle. It is only a quarrel that the patricians are seeking, they do not care in the least about the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> result. I for my part support this measure, which I believe will be for your good and happiness and a blessing to the State, and I hold that you ought to pass it.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Assembly was on the point of ordering the voting to proceed, and it was evident that the measure would be adopted, when, on the intervention of some of the tribunes, all further business was adjourned for the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On the morrow, the dissentient tribunes having given way, the law was passed amid great enthusiasm. The co-opted pontiffs were P. Decius Mus, the supporter of the measure, P. Sempronius Sophus, C. Marcius Rutilus, and M. Livius Denter. The five augurs who were also taken from the plebs were C. Genucius, P. Aelius Paetus, M. Minucius Faesus, C. Marcius, and T. Publilius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> So the number of the pontiffs was raised to eight and that of the augurs to nine.</p> <p>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Valerian Law.</note> this year the consul, M. Valerius, carried a proposal to strengthen the provisions of the law touching the right of appeal.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> This was the third time since the expulsion of the kings that this law was re-enacted, and always by the same family. I think that the reason for renewing it so often was solely the fact that the excessive power exercised by a few men was dangerous to the liberties of the plebs.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Porcian law, however, seems to have been passed solely for the protection of the citizens in life and limb, for it imposed the severest penalties on any one who killed or scourged a Roman citizen.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Valerian law, it is true, forbade any one who had exercised his right of appeal to be scourged or beheaded, but if any one transgressed its provisions it added no penalty, but simply declared such transgression to be a <q direct="unspecified">wicked act.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Such was the self-respect and sense of shame amongst the men of those days, that I believe that declaration to have been a sufficiently strong barrier against violations of the law.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Nowadays there is hardly a slave who would not use stronger language against his master.</p> <p>Valerius<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Wars with the Aequi and Umbrians.</note> also conducted a war against the Aequi, who had recommenced hostilities, but who retained nothing of their earlier character except their restless temper.</p> <p>The other consul, Apuleius, invested the town of Nequinum in Umbria.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was situated where Narnia now stands, on high ground which on one side was steep and precipitous, and it was impossible to take it either by assault or by regular siege works.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It was left to the new consuls, M. Fulvius Paetus and T. Manlius Torquatus, to carry the siege to a successful issue.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>According to Licinius Macer and Tubero, all the centuries intended to elect Q. Fabius consul for this year, but he urged them to postpone his consulship until some more important war broke out, for he considered that he would be more useful to the State as a City magistrate. So without dissembling his real wishes or ostensibly seeking the post, he was elected curule aedile along with L. Papirius Cursor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> I cannot, however, be certain on this point, for the earlier annalist, Piso, states that the curule aediles for this year were Cn. Domitius, Cn. F. Calvinus, Sp. Carvilius, and Q. F. Maximus I think that the cognomen of the last-mentioned aedile &mdash;Maximus
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> &mdash;was the cause of the error, and that a story in which the lists of both elections were combined was constructed to fit in with the mistake.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The lustrum was closed this year by the censors, P. Sempronius Sophus and P. Sulpicius Saverrio, and two new tribes were added, the Aniensis and the Teretina.</p> <p>These were the principal events of the year in <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meantime the siege of Nequinum was dragging slowly on and time was being wasted. At length two of the townsmen, whose houses abutted on the city wall, made a tunnel, and came by that secret passage to the Roman outposts.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They were conducted to the consul, and undertook to admit a detachment of soldiers within the fortifications and the city walls. It did not seem right to reject their proposal, nor yet to accept it offhand.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> One of them was instructed to conduct two spies through the underground passage; the other was detained as a hostage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The report of the spies was satisfactory, and 300 soldiers, led by the deserter, entered the city by night and seized the nearest gate. This was broken open, and the consul with his army took possession of the place without any fighting. Thus Nequinum passed into the power of Rome.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A colony was sent there as an outpost against the Umbrians, and the place was called Narnia from the river Nar. The army marched back to Rome with a large amount of spoil.</p> <p>This<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Renewal of Hostilities by the Etruscans and Samnites.</note> year the Etruscans determined to break the truce, and began to make preparations for war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> But the invasion of their country by an enormous army of Gauls &mdash;the last thing they were expecting &mdash;turned them for a time from their purpose.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Trusting to the power of money, which with them was very considerable, they endeavoured to convert the Gauls from enemies into allies in order that they might combine their forces in an attack on Rome. The barbarians did not object to an alliance, the only question was as to the amount of pay.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> After this had been agreed upon and all the other preparations for war had been completed, the Etruscans called upon the Gauls to follow them. They refused to do so, and asserted that they had not taken the money to make war on Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Whatever they had received had been accepted as compensation for not devastating the land of Etruria or subjecting its inhabitants to armed violence.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> However, they expressed their willingness to serve if the Etruscans really wished them to do so, but only on one condition, namely that they should be admitted to a share of their territory and be able to settle at last in a permanent home.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Many councils were held in the various cantons to discuss this proposal, but it was found impossible to accept the terms, not so much because they would not consent to any loss of territory as because they dreaded the prospect of having as their neighbours men belonging to such a savage race.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Gauls were accordingly dismissed, and carried back with them an enormous sum of money gained without labour and without risk.</p> <p>The rumour of a Gaulish invasion in addition to the Etruscan war created alarm in Rome, and there was less hesitation in concluding a treaty with the Picentes.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The campaign in Etruria fell to the consul T. Manlius. He had scarcely entered the hostile territory when, as he was wheeling his horse round in some cavalry exercises, he was flung off and almost killed on the spot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Three days later the consul ended his life. The Etruscans derived encouragement from this incident, for they took it as an omen, and declared that the gods were fighting for them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When the sad news reached Rome, not only was the loss of the man severely felt, but also the inopportuneness of the time when it occurred.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The senate were prepared to order the nomination of a Dictator, but refrained from doing so as the election of a successor to the consul went quite in accordance with the wishes of the leading patricians. Every vote was given in favour of M. Valerius, the man whom the senate had decided upon as Dictator.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The legions were at once ordered to Etruria. Their presence acted as such a check upon the Etruscans that no one ventured outside their lines; their fears shut them up as closely as though they were blockaded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Valerius devastated their fields and burnt their houses, till not only single farms but numerous villages were reduced to smoking ashes, but he failed to bring the enemy to action.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>While this war was progressing more slowly than had been anticipated, apprehensions were felt as to another war which, from the numerous defeats sustained formerly on both sides, was not unreasonably regarded with dread. The Picentes had sent information that the Samnites were arming for war, and that they had approached the Picentes to induce them to join them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The latter were thanked for their loyalty, and the public attention was diverted to a large extent from Etruria to Samnium.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The dearness of provisions caused widespread distress amongst the citizens. Those writers who make Fabius Maximus a curule aedile for that year assert that there would have been actual famine if he had not shown the same wise care in the control of the market and the accumulation of supplies which he had so often before displayed in war.</p> <p>An interregnum occurred this year &mdash;tradition assigns no reason for it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The interreges were Ap. Claudius and P. Sulpicius. The latter held the consular elections, at which L. Cornelius Scipio and Cn. Fulvius were returned.</p> <p>At the beginning of their year a deputation came from the Lucanians to lay a formal complaint against the Samnites.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They informed the senate that that people had tried to allure them into forming an offensive and defensive alliance with them, and, finding their efforts futile, they invaded their territory and were laying it waste, and so, by making war upon them, trying to drive them into a war with Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The Lucanians, they said, had made too many mistakes already; they had now quite made up their minds that it would be better to bear and suffer everything than to attempt anything against Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> They implored the senate to take them under its protection and to defend them from the wanton aggressions of the Samnites. They were fully aware that it Rome declared war against Samnium their loyalty to her would be a matter of life and death, but, notwithstanding that, they were prepared to give hostages as a guarantee of good faith.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Commencement of the Third Samnite War.</note> discussion in the senate was brief. The members unanimously decided that a treaty of close alliance should be made with the Lucanians and satisfaction demanded from the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When the envoys were readmitted, they received a favourable reply and a treaty was concluded with them. The fetials were sent to insist upon the evacuation by the Samnites of the territories of the allies of Rome and the withdrawal of their forces from the Lucanian frontiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They were met by emissaries from the Samnites, who warned them that if they appeared in any of the Samnite councils their inviolability would be no longer respected. On this being reported in Rome, the Assembly confirmed the resolution passed by the senate and ordered war to be made upon the Samnites</p> <p>In the allotment of their respective commands Etruria fell to Scipio and the Samnites to Fulvius.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Both consuls took the field.</p> <p>Scipio, who was anticipating a tedious campaign similar to the one of the previous year, was met by the enemy in battle formation at Volaterrae.
							<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The contest lasted the greater part of the day, with heavy loss on both sides.
							<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Night came on whilst they were still uncertain with whom the victory lay; the following morning made it clear, for the Etruscans had abandoned their camp in the dead of the night. When the Romans marched out to battle and saw that the enemy had by their action admitted their defeat, they went on to the deserted camp.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> This they took possession of, and as it was a standing camp and had been hurriedly abandoned, they secured a considerable amount of booty. The troops were marched back into the neighbourhood of Falerii, and after leaving the baggage with a small escort there they proceeded, in light marching order, to harry the Etruscan land.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Everything was laid waste with fire and sword; prey was driven in from all sides. Not only was the soil left an absolute waste for the enemy, but their fortified posts and villages were burnt.
							<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The Romans refrained from attacking the cities in which the terrified Etruscans had sought shelter.</p> <p>Cnaeus Fulvius sought a brilliant action at Bovianum in Samnium, and gained a decisive victory. He then carried Bovianum by storm, and not long afterwards Aufidena.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the year a colony was settled at Carseoli, in the country of the Aequicoli. The consul Fulvius celebrated a triumph over the Samnites.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Just as the consular elections were coming on, a rumour spread that the Etruscans and Samnites were levying immense armies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> According to the reports which were sent, the leaders of the Etruscans were attacked in all the cantonal council meetings for not having brought the Gauls over on any terms whatever to take part in the war; the Samnite government were abused for having employed against the Romans a force which was only raised to act against the Lucanians;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the enemy was arising in his own strength and in that of his allies to make war on Rome, and matters would not be settled without a conflict on a very much larger scale than formerly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Men of distinction were amongst the candidates for the consulship, but the gravity of the danger turned all eyes to Quintus Fabius Maximus . He at first simply declined to become a candidate, but when he saw the trend of popular feeling he distinctly refused to allow his name to stand:
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> <q direct="unspecified">Why,</q> he asked, <q direct="unspecified">do you want an old man like me, who has finished his allotted tasks and gained all the rewards they have brought? I am not the man I was either in strength of body or mind, and I fear lest some god should even deem my good fortune too great or too unbroken for human nature to enjoy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I have grown up to the measure of the glory of my seniors, and I would gladly see others rising to the height of my own renown.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There is no lack of honours in Rome for the strongest and most capable men, nor is there any lack of men to win the honour.</q> This display of modesty and unselfishness only made the popular feeling all the keener in his favour by showing how rightly it was directed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Thinking that the best way of checking it would be to appeal to the instinctive reverence for law, he ordered the law to be rehearsed which forbade any man from being re-elected consul within ten years.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Owing to the clamour the law was hardly heard, and the tribunes of the plebs declared that there was no impediment here; they would make a proposition to the Assembly that he should be exempt from its provisions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He, however, persisted in his refusal, and repeatedly asked what was the object in making laws if they were deliberately broken by those who made them; <q direct="unspecified">we,</q> said he,<q direct="unspecified">are now ruling the laws instead of the laws ruling us.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Notwithstanding his opposition the people began to vote, and as each century was called in, it declared without the slightest hesitation for Fabius. At last, yielding to the general desire of his countrymen, he said, <q direct="unspecified">May the gods approve what you have done and what you are going to do. Since, however, you are going to have your own way as far as I am concerned, give me the opportunity of using my influence with you so far as my colleague is concerned.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> I ask you to elect as my fellow-consul, P. Decius, a man whom I have found to work with me in perfect harmony, a man who is worthy of your confidence, worthy of his illustrious sire.</q><note anchored="yes" n="7" resp="ed">He spoke while the voting was still going on; probably only the <foreign lang="la">centuria praerogativa</foreign> had voted so far. The order in which the centuries were called up to vote was decided by lot, and the first was called the <q direct="unspecified">prerogative century.</q> The decision by lot, which played such a large part in the political administration, was regarded as the work of the gods, and therefore the vote of the prerogative century had often a determining influence on the result of the election.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The recommendation was felt to be well deserved, and all the centuries which had not yet voted elected Q. Fabius and P. Decius consuls.</p> <p>During the year a large number of people were prosecuted by the aediles for occupying more than the legal quantity of land. Hardly one could clear himself from the charge, and a very strong curb was placed upon inordinate covetousness.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Battle near Tifernum.</note> consuls were busy with their arrangements for the campaign, deciding which of them should deal with the Etruscans, and which with the Samnites, what troops they would each require, which field of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> operations each was best fitted for, when envoys arrived from Sutrium, Nepete, and Falerii bringing definite information that the local assemblies of Etruria were being convened to decide upon a peace policy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> On the strength of this information the whole weight of war was turned against the Samnites. In order to facilitate the transport of supplies, and also to make the enemy more uncertain as to the line of the Roman advance, Fabius led his legions by way of Sora, while Decius proceeded through the Sidicine district.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> When they had crossed the frontiers of Samnium they marched on a widely extended front, laying the country waste as they went on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They threw out their scouting parties still more widely, and so did not fail to discover the enemy near Tifernum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They had concealed themselves in a secluded valley, prepared to attack the Romans, should they enter the valley, from the rising ground on each side. Fabius removed the baggage into a safe place and left a small guard over it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He then informed his men that a battle was impending, and massing them into a solid square came up to the above-mentioned hiding-place of the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Samnites, finding all chance of a surprise hopeless, since matters would have to be decided by an action in the open, thought it better to meet their foes in a pitched battle. Accordingly they came down to the lower ground, and placed themselves in the hands of Fortune with more of courage than of hope.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> But whether it was that they had got together the whole strength out of every community in Samnium, or that their courage was stimulated by the thought that their very existence as a nation depended upon this battle, they certainly did succeed in creating a good deal of alarm in the Roman ranks, even though they were fighting in a fair field.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When Fabius saw that the enemy were holding their ground in every part of the field, he rode up to the first line with his son, Maximus, and Marcus Valerius, both
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> military tribunes, and ordered them to go to the cavalry and tell them that if they remembered any single occasion on which the republic had been aided by the efforts of the
					<milestone unit="section" n="12??"/> cavalry, they should that day strive their utmost to sustain the reputation of that invincible arm of the State, for the enemy were standing immovable against the infantry and all their hopes rested on the cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> He made a personal appeal to each of them, showering commendations upon them and holding out the prospect of great rewards.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Since, however, the cavalry charge might fail in its object, and attacking in force prove useless, he thought he ought to adopt a stratagem. Scipio, one of his staff, received instructions to draw off the hastati of the first legion and, attracting as little observation as possible, take them to the nearest hills.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Then climbing up where they could not be seen, they were suddenly to show themselves in the enemy's rear.</p> <p>The cavalry, led by the two young tribunes, dashed out in front of the standards, and their sudden appearance created almost as much confusion amongst their own people as amongst the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> The Samnite line stood perfectly firm against the galloping squadrons, nowhere could they be forced back or broken. Finding their attempt a failure, the cavalry retired behind the standards and took no further part in the fighting.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> This increased the courage of the enemy, and the Roman front could not have sustained the prolonged contest, met as they were by a resistance which was becoming more stubborn as its confidence rose, had not the consul ordered the second line to relieve the first.
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> These fresh troops checked the advance of the Samnites, who were now pressing forward. Just at this moment the standards were descried on the hills, and a fresh battle-shout arose from the Roman ranks.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The alarm which was created among the Samnites was greater than circumstances warranted, for Fabius exclaimed that his colleague Decius was coming, and every soldier, wild with
						<milestone unit="section" n="20??"/> joy, took up the cry and shouted that the other consul with his legions was at hand.
						<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> This mistake occurring so opportunely filled the Samnites with dismay; they dreaded, exhausted as they were by fighting, the prospect of being overwhelmed by a second army, fresh and unhurt. Unable to offer any further resistance they broke and fled, and owing to their scattered flight, the bloodshed was small when compared with the greatness of the victory; 3400 were killed, about 830 made prisoners, and 23 standards were captured.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before this battle took place the Samnites would have been joined by the Apulians had not the consul Decius anticipated their action by fixing his camp at Maleventum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He drew them into an engagement and routed them, and in this battle also there were more who escaped by flight than were slain; these amounted to 2000. Without troubling himself further about the Apulians, Decius led his army into Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There the two consular armies spent five months in ravaging and desolating the country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There were forty-five different places in Samnium where Decius at one time or another had fixed his camp; in the case of the other consul there were eightysix.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Nor were the only traces left those of ramparts and fosses, more conspicuous still were those which attested the devastation and depopulation of all the country round.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Fabius also captured the city of Cimetra, where 2900 became prisoners of war, 830 having been killed during the assault.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After this he returned to Rome for the elections and arranged for them to be held at an early date. The centuries who voted first declared without exception for Fabius. Amongst the candidates was the energetic and ambitious Appius Claudius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Anxious to secure the honour for himself, he was quite as anxious that both posts should be held by patricians, and he brought his utmost influence, supported by the whole of the nobility, to bear upon the electors so that they might return him together with Fabius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> At the outset Fabius refused, and alleged the same grounds for his refusal as he had alleged the year before. Then all the nobles crowded round his chair and begged him to extricate the consulship from the plebeian mire and restore both to the office itself and to the patrician houses the august dignity which they possessed of old.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As soon as he could obtain silence he addressed them in terms which calmed their excitement. He would, he said, have arranged to admit votes for two patricians if he saw that any one else than himself was
					<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> being elected, but as matters were he would not allow his name to stand, since it would be against the law and form a most dangerous precedent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> So L. Volumnius, a plebeian, was elected together with Appius Claudius; they had already been associated in a previous consulship. The nobles taunted Fabius and said that he refused to have Appius Claudius as a colleague because he was unquestionably his inferior in eloquence and state-craft.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the elections were over, the previous consuls received a six months' extension of their command and were ordered to prosecute the war in Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> P. Decius, who had been left by his colleague in Samnium and was now proconsul, continued his ravages of the Samnite fields until he had driven their army, which nowhere ventured to encounter him, outside their frontiers. They made for Etruria, and were in hopes that the object which they had failed to secure by their numerous deputations might be achieved now that they had a strong force and could back up their appeals by intimidation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They insisted upon a meeting of the Etruscan chiefs being convened.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When it had assembled they pointed out how for many years they had been fighting with the Romans, how they had tried in every possible way to sustain the weight of that war in their own strength, and how they had proved the assistance of their neighbours to be of small value.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They had sued for peace because they could no longer endure war, they had taken to war again because a peace which reduced them to slavery was heavier to bear than a war in which they could fight as free men. The only hope left to them now lay in the Etruscans.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They knew that they of all the nations of Italy were the richest in arms and men and money, and they had for their neighbours the Gauls, trained to arms from the cradle, naturally courageous to desperation and especially against the Romans, a nation whom they justly boast of having captured and then allowing them to ransom themselves with gold.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> If the Etruscans had the same spirit which Porsena and their ancestors once had there was no reason why they should not expel the Romans from the whole of their land as far as the Tiber and compel them to fight, not for their insupportable dominion over Italy, but for their very existence.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Samnite army had come to them completely provided with arms and a war chest, and were ready to follow them at once, even if they led them to an attack on Rome itself.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While they were thus busy with their intrigues in Etruria the warfare which the Romans were carrying on in Samnium was terribly destructive. When P. Decius had ascertained through his scouts the departure of the Samnite army he summoned a council of war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> <q direct="unspecified">Why,</q> he asked, <q direct="unspecified">are we roaming through the country districts, making war only upon the villages? Why are we not attacking the walled cities? There is no army to defend them, the army has abandoned its country and gone into voluntary exile.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> His proposal was unanimously adopted and he led them to the attack of Murgantia, a powerfully fortified city. Such was the eagerness of the soldiers, due partly to the affection they felt for their commander and partly to the expectation of a larger amount of plunder than they were securing in the country districts, that they stormed and captured the city in a single day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Two thousand one hundred combatants were cut off and made prisoners and an enormous quantity of plunder was seized.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To avoid loading the army with a lot of heavy baggage Decius called his men together and addressed them thus: <q direct="unspecified">Are you going to content yourselves with this one victory and this spoil? Raise your hopes and expectations to the height of your courage. All the cities of the Samnites and all the wealth left in them are yours now that their legions, routed in so many battles, have at last been driven by you beyond their frontiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Sell what you now hold and attract traders by the hope of profit to follow our armies; I shall frequently supply you with things for sale.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Let us go on to the city of Romulea where still greater spoil awaits you but not greater exertions.</q></p> <p>The booty was then sold and the men, urging on their commander, marched to Romulea. Here, too, no siege works were constructed, no artillery employed, the moment the standards were brought up to the walls no resistance on the part of the defenders could keep the men back; they planted their scalingladders just where they happened to be, and swarmed on to the walls.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The town was taken and sacked, 2300 were killed, 6ooo taken prisoners, and a vast amount of plunder secured, which the troops, as before, were
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> obliged to dispose of to the traders.</p> <p>The next place to be attacked was Ferentinum, and though no rest was allowed the men, they marched thither in the highest spirits.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Here, however, they had more trouble and more risk. The position had been made as strong as possible by nature and by art, and the walls were defended with the utmost energy, but a soldiery habituated to plunder overcame all obstacles.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> As many as 3000 of the enemy were killed round the walls; the plunder was given to the troops.</p> <p>In some annalists the greater part of the credit of these captures is given to Maximus; Decius they say took Murgantia, Ferentinum and Romulea being captured by Fabius.
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some again claim this honour for the new consuls, while a few restrict it to L. Volumnius, to whom they say Samnium was assigned as his sphere of action.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Samnites and Etruscans allied against Rome.</note> this campaign was going on in Samnium &mdash;whoever may have been the commander &mdash;a very serious war against Rome was being organised in Etruria, in which many nations were to take part.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The chief organiser was Gellius Egnatius, a Samnite. Almost all the Tuscan cantons had decided on war, the contagion had infected the nearest cantons in Umbria, and the Gauls were being solicited to help as mercenaries.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> All these were concentrating at the Samnite camp.</p> <p>When the news of this sudden rising reached Rome, L. Volumnius had already left for Samnium with the second and third legions and 15,000 allied troops; it was therefore decided that Appius Claudius should at the earliest possible moment enter Etruria. Two Roman legions followed him, the first and fourth, and 12,000 allies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He fixed his camp not far from the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The advantage gained by his prompt arrival did not, however, show itself in anywise or fortunate generalship on his part so much as the check imposed by the fear of Rome upon some of the Etrurian cantons which were meditating war. Several engage- ments took place in unfavourable positions and at unfortunate times, and the more the enemy's hopes of success, the more formidable he became.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Matters almost reached the point when the soldiers distrusted their general and the general had no confidence in his soldiers. I find it stated by some annalists that he sent a letter to his colleague summoning him from Samnium, but I cannot assert this as a fact since this very circumstance became a subject of dispute between the two consuls, who were now in office together for the second time;
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Appius denying that he had sent any letter and Volumnius insisting that he had been summoned by a letter from Appius</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Volumnius had by this time taken three fortified posts in Samnium in which as many as 3000 men were killed and almost half that number made prisoners. He had also sent Q. Fabius, the proconsul, with his veteran army, much to the satisfaction of the Lucanian magnates, to repress the disturbances which had been got up in that part of the country by the plebeian and indigent classes. Leaving the ravaging of the enemy's fields to Decius he proceeded with his whole force to Etruria.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>On his arrival he was universally welcomed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> As to the way Appius treated him, I think that if he had a clear conscience in the matter, that is, if he had written nothing, his anger was justifiable, but if he had really stood in need of help he showed a disingenuous and ungrateful spirit in concealing the fact.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When he went out to meet his colleague, almost before they had had time to exchange mutual greetings, he asked: <q direct="unspecified">Is all well, Volumnius? How are things going in Samnium? What induced you to leave your allotted province?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Volumnius replied that all was going on satisfactorily and that he had come because he had been asked to do so by letter. If it was a forgery and there was nothing for him to do in Etruria he would at once countermarch his troops and depart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> <q direct="unspecified">Well then,</q> said Appius, <q direct="unspecified">go, let nobody keep you here for it is by no means right that whilst perhaps you are hardly able to cope with your own war you should boast of having come to the assistance of others.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> <q direct="unspecified">May Hercules guide all for the best,</q> replied Volumnius. <q direct="unspecified">I would rather have taken all this trouble in vain than that anything should happen which would make one consular army insufficient for Etruria.</q></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As the consuls were parting from each other, the staffofficers and military tribunes stood round them; some of them implored their own commander not to reject the assistance of his colleague, assistance which he himself ought to have invited and which was now spontaneously offered;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> many of the others tried to stop Volumnius as he was leaving and appealed to him not to betray the safety of the republic through a wretched quarrel with his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They urged that if any disaster occurred the responsibility for it would fall on the one who abandoned the other, not on the other who was abandoned; it came to this &mdash;all the glory of success and all the disgrace of failure in Etruria was transferred to Volumnius.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> People would not inquire what words Appius had used, but what fortune the army was meeting with; he may have been dismissed by Appius, but his presence was demanded by the republic and by the army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He had only to test the feelings of the soldiers to find this out for himself.</p> <p>Amidst appeals and warnings of this character they almost dragged the reluctant consuls into a council of war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> There the dispute which had previously been witnessed by only a few went on at much greater length. Volumnius had not only the stronger case, but he showed himself by no means a bad speaker, even when compared with the exceptional eloquence of his colleague.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Appius remarked sarcastically that they ought to look upon it as due to him that they had a consul who was actually able to speak, instead of the dumb inarticulate man he once was.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In their former consulship, especially during the first months of office, he could not open his lips, now he was becoming quite a popular speaker. Volumnius observed, <q direct="unspecified">I would much rather that you had learnt from me to act with vigour and decision than that I should have learnt from you to be a clever speaker.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He finally made a proposal which would settle the question who was &mdash;not the better orator, for that was not what the republic needed, but &mdash;the better commander. Their two provinces were Etruria and Samnium; Appius might choose which he preferred, he, Volumnius, was willing to conduct operations either in Etruria or in Samnium.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>On this the soldiers began to clamour; they insisted that both consuls should carry on the war in Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When Volumnius saw that this was the general wish he said, <q direct="unspecified">Since I have made a mistake in interpreting my colleague's wishes I will take care that there shall be no doubt as to what it is that you want.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Signify your wishes by acclamation; do you wish me to stay or to go?</q> Such a shout arose in reply that it brought the enemy out of their camp; seizing their arms they came down to the battlefield.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then Volumnius ordered the battle signal to be sounded and the standards to be carried out of the camp. Appius, it is said, was for some time undecided, as he saw that whether he fought or remained inactive the victory would be his colleague's, but at last, fearing lest his legions also should follow Volumnius, he yielded to their loud demands and gave the signal for battle.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>On<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Defeat of the Allies.</note> both sales the dispositions were far from complete. The Samnite captain-general, Gellius Egnatius, had gone off with a few cohorts on a foraging expedition, and his troops commenced the battle in obedience to their own impulses rather than to any word of command.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The Roman armies again were not both led to the attack at the same time, nor was sufficient time allowed for their formation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Volumnius was engaged before Appius reached the enemy, so the battle began on an irregular front, and the usual opponents happened to be interchanged, the Etruscans facing Volumnius and the Samnites, after a short delay owing to their leader's absence, closing with Appius. The story runs that he lifted up his hands to heaven so as to be visible to those about the foremost standards and uttered this prayer: <q direct="unspecified">Bellona!
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> if thou wilt grant us victory to-day, I, in return, vow a temple to thee.</q> After this prayer it seemed as though the goddess had inspired him, he displayed a courage equal to his colleague's, or indeed to that of the whole army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> Nothing was lacking on the part of the generals to ensure success, and the rank and file in each of the consular armies did their utmost to prevent the other from being the first to achieve victory.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>The enemy were quite unable to withstand a force so much greater than any they had been accustomed to meet, and were in consequence routed and put to flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> The Romans pressed the attack when they began to give ground, and when they broke and fled, followed them up till they had driven them to their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/> There the appearance of Gellius and his cohorts led to a brief stand being made; soon, however, these were routed and the victors attacked the camp. Volumnius encouraging his men by his own example led the attack upon one of the gates in person, whilst Appius was kindling the courage of his troops by repeatedly invoking <q direct="unspecified">Bellona the victorious.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/> They succeeded in forcing their way through rampart and fosse; the camp was captured and plundered, and a very considerable amount of booty was discovered and given to the soldiery; 6900 of the enemy were killed, 2120 made prisoners.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Whilst<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">A Samnite Army surprised and routed.</note> both the consuls with the whole strength of Rome were devoting their energies more and more to the Etruscan war, fresh armies were raised in Samnium for the purpose of ravaging the territories which belonged to the feudatories of Rome. They passed through the Vescini into the country round Capua and Falernum and secured immense spoil.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Volumnius was returning to Samnium by forced marches, for the extended command of Fabius and Decius had almost expired, when he heard of the devastations which the Samnites were committing in Campania. He at once diverted his route in that direction to protect our allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When he was in the neighhourhood of Cales he saw for himself the fresh traces of the destruction that had been wrought, and the inhabitants informed him that the enemy were carrying off so much plunder that they could hardly keep any proper formation on the march.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> In fact their generals had openly given out that they dared not expose an army so heavily laden to the chances of battle, and they must at once return to Samnium and leave their plunder there, after which they would return for a fresh raid.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> However true all this might be, Volumnius thought he ought to get further information, and accordingly he despatched some cavalry to pick up any stragglers they might find among the raiders.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> On questioning them he learnt that the enemy were halted at the river Volturnus, and were going to move forward at the third watch and take the road to Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Satisfied with this information he marched on and fixed his camp at such a distance from the enemy that while it was not close enough for his arrival to be detected it was sufficiently near to allow of his surprising them while they were leaving their camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Some time before daylight he approached their camp and sent some men familiar with the Oscan language to find out what was going on. Mingling with the enemy, an easy matter in the confusion of a nocturnal departure, they found that the standards had already gone with only a few to defend them, the booty and those who were to escort it were just leaving, the army as a whole were incapable of any military evolution, for each was looking
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> after his own affairs, without any mutually arranged plan of action or any definite orders from their commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This seemed the moment for delivering his attack, and daylight was approaching, so he ordered the advance to be sounded and attacked the enemy's column. The Samnites were encumbered with their booty, only a few were in fighting trim; some hurried on and drove before them the animals they had seized, others halted, undecided whether to go on or retreat to the camp; in the midst of their hesitation they were surrounded and cut off.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Romans had now got over the rampart, and the camp became a scene of wild disorder and carnage. The confusion created in the Samnite column by the swiftness of the attack was increased by the sudden outbreak of their prisoners.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Some after releasing themselves broke the fetters of those round them, others snatched the weapons which were fastened up with the baggage and created in the centre of the column a tumult more appalling even than the battle which was going on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Then they achieved a most extraordinary feat. Statius Minacius, the general commanding, was riding up and down the ranks encouraging his men, when the prisoners attacked him, and after dispersing his escort, hurried him off, whilst still in the saddle, as a prisoner to the Roman consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The noise and the tumult recalled the cohorts who were at the head of the column, and the battle was resumed, but only for a short time, as a long resistance was impossible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> As many as 6ooo men were killed, there were 2500 prisoners, amongst them four military tribunes, thirty standards were taken, and, what gave the victors more pleasure than anything else, 7400 captives were rescued and the immense booty which had been taken from the allies recovered. Public notice was given inviting the owners to identify and recover what belonged to them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Everything for which no owner appeared on the appointed day was given to the soldiers, but they were obliged to sell it all that nothing might distract their thoughts from their military duties.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>This predatory incursion into Campania created great excitement in Rome, and it so happened that just at this time grave news was received from Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After the withdrawal of Volumnius' army, the whole country, acting in concert with the Samnite captain-general, Gellius Egnatius, had risen in arms; whilst the Umbrians were being called on to join the movement, and the Gauls were being approached with offers of lavish pay.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The senate, thoroughly alarmed at these tidings, ordered all legal and other business to be suspended, and men of all ages and of every class to be enrolled for service.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Not only were the freeborn and all within the military age obliged to take the oath, but cohorts were formed of the older men, and even the freedmen were formed into centuries. Arrangements were made for the defence of the City, and P. Sempronius took supreme command.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The senate was, however, relieved of some of its anxiety by the receipt of despatches from L. Volumnius, from which it was ascertained that the raiders of Campania had been routed and killed.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Thanksgivings for this success were ordered in honour of the consul, the suspension of business was withdrawn after lasting eighteen days, and the thanksgivings were of a most joyous character.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The next question was the protection of the district which had been devastated by the Samnites, and it was decided to settle bodies of colonists about the Vescinian and Falernian country.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> One was to be at the mouth of the Liris, now called the colony of Menturna, the other in the Vescinian forest where it is contiguous with the territory of Falernum. Here the Greek city of Sinope is said to have stood, and from this the Romans gave the place the name of Sinuessa.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> It was arranged that the tribunes of the plebs should get a plebiscite passed requiring P. Sempronius, the praetor, to appoint commissioners for the founding of colonies in those spots.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> But it was not easy to find people to be sent to what was practically a permanent outpost in a dangerously hostile country, instead of having fields allotted to them for cultivation.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The attention of the senate was diverted from these matters to the growing seriousness of the outlook in Etruria. There were frequent despatches from Appius warning them not to neglect the movement that was going on in that part of the world;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> four nations were in arms together, the Etruscans, the Samnites, the Umbrians, and the Gauls, and they were compelled to form two separate camps, for one place would not hold so great a multitude.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The date of the elections was approaching, and Volumnius was recalled to Rome to conduct them, and also to advise on the general policy. Before calling upon the centuries to vote he summoned the people to an Assembly. Here he dwelt at some length upon the serious nature of the war in Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Even, he said, when he and his colleague were conducting a joint campaign, the war was on too large a scale for any single general with his one army to cope with. Since then he understood that the Umbrians and an enormous force of Gauls had swollen the ranks of their enemies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The electors must bear in mind that two consuls were being elected on that day to act against four nations. The choice of the Roman people would, he felt certain, fall on the one man who was unquestionably the foremost of all their generals. Had he not felt sure of this he was prepared to nominate him at once as Dictator.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this speech no one felt the slightest doubt that Q. Fabius would be unanimously elected. The <q direct="unspecified">prerogative</q> centuries and all those of the first class were voting for him and Volumnius, when he again addressed the electors very much
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> in the terms he had employed two years before, and as on the former occasion when he yielded to the universal wish, so now he again requested that P. Decius might be his colleague.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He would be a support for his old age to lean upon, they had been together as censors, and twice as consuls, and he had learnt by experience that nothing went further to protect the State than harmony between colleagues. He felt that he could hardly at his time of life get accustomed to a new comrade in office, he could so much more easily share all his counsels with one whose character and disposition he knew.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Volumnius confirmed what Fabius had said. He bestowed a well-deserved encomium on Decius, and pointed out what an advantage in military operations is gained by harmony between the consuls,
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> and what mischief is wrought when they are at variance. He mentioned as an instance the recent misunderstanding between him and
					<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> his colleague which almost led to a national disaster, and he solemnly admonished Decius and Fabius that they should live together with one mind and one heart. They were, he continued, born commanders, great in action, unskilled in wordy debate, possessing, in fact, all the qualifications of a consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Those, on the other hand, who were clever and cunning in law, and practised pleaders, like Appius Claudius, ought to be employed in the City and on the bench; they should be elected praetors to administer justice.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The discussion in the Assembly lasted the whole day. On the morrow the elections were held for both consuls and praetors.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The consul's recommendation was acted upon; Q. Fabius and P. Decius were elected consuls, and Appius Claudius was returned as praetor; they were all elected in their absence. The senate passed a resolution, which the Assembly confirmed by a plebiscite, that Volumnius' command should be extended for a year.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Several<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Affairs in the City.</note> portents occurred this year and, with the view of averting them, the senate passed a decree that special intercessions should be offered for two days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The wine and incense were provided at the public cost, and both men and women attended the religious functions in great numbers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> This time of special observance was rendered memorable by a quarrel which broke out amongst the matrons in the chapel of the Patrician Pudicitia, which is in the Forum Boarium, against the round temple of Hercules.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Verginia, the daughter of Aulus Verginius, a patrician, had married the plebeian consul, L. Volumnius, and the matrons excluded her from their sacred rites because she had married outside the patriciate. This led to a brief altercation, which, as the women became excited, soon blazed up into a storm of passion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Verginia protested with perfect truth that she entered the temple of Pudicitia as a patrician and a pure woman, the wife of one man to whom she had been betrothed as a virgin, and she had nothing to be ashamed of in her husband or in his honourable career and the offices which he had held.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The effect of her high-spirited language was considerably enhanced by her subsequent action. In the Vicus Longus, where she lived, she shut off a portion of her house, sufficient to form a moderately sized chapel, and set up an altar there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> She then called the plebeian matrons together and told them how unjustly she had been treated by the patrician ladies. <q direct="unspecified">I am dedicating,</q> she said,<q direct="unspecified">this altar to the Plebeian Pudicitia, and I earnestly exhort you as matrons to show the same
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> spirit of emulation on the score of chastity that the men of this City display with regard to courage, so that this altar may, if possible, have the reputation of being honoured with a holier observance and by purer worshippers than that of the patricians.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The ritual and ceremonial practised at this altar was almost identical with that at the older one; no matron was allowed to sacrifice there whose moral character was not well attested, and who had had more than one husband.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Afterwards it was polluted by the presence of women of every kind, not matrons only, and finally passed into oblivion.</p> <p>The curule aediles, Cnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius, brought up several money-lenders for trial this year.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The proportion of their fines which was paid into the treasury was devoted to various public objects; the wooden thresholds of the Capitol were replaced by bronze, silver vessels were made for the three tables in the shrine of Jupiter, and a statue of the god himself, seated in a four-horsed chariot, was set up on the roof.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They also placed near the Ficus Ruminalis<note anchored="yes" n="8" resp="ed">See Vol. I. p. 6.</note> a group representing the Founders of the City as infants being suckled by the she-wolf. The street leading from the Porta Capena to the temple of Mars was paved, under their instructions, with stone slabs.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Some graziers were also prosecuted for exceeding the number of cattle allowed them on the public land, and the plebeian aediles, L. Aelius Paetus and C. Fulvius Curvus, spent the money derived from their fines on public games and a set of golden bowls to be placed in the temple of Ceres.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Consuls at Variance</note>. Fabius and P. Decius were now entering their year of office, the former being consul for the fifth time, the latter for the fourth.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Twice before they had been consuls together, they had held the censorship together, and the perfect unanimity between them, quite as much as their discharge of its duties, made their tenure of office a distinguished one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But this was not to last for ever; the conflict which broke out between them was, however, I think, due more to the antagonism of the two orders to which they belonged than to any personal feeling on their part.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The patrician senators were extremely anxious that Fabius should have Etruria assigned to him without going through the usual procedure; the plebeian senators urged Decius to insist upon the question being settled in the usual way by lot. There was, at all events, a sharp division of opinion in the senate, and, when it became apparent that the Fabian interest was the stronger, the matter was referred to the people.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As both were first of all soldiers, trusting more to deeds than to words, their speeches before the Assembly were brief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Fabius declared that it would be an unworthy proceeding if another should gather up the fruit beneath the tree which he had planted; he had opened up the Ciminian forest and made a way through pathless jungle for the arms of Rome. Why had they troubled him at his time of life, if they were going to carry on the war under another general?
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Then he turned to Decius: <q direct="unspecified">Surely,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">I have chosen an opponent, not a comrade, in office; Decius is annoyed at our three years of joint power having been so harmonious.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Finally, he asserted that he desired nothing more than that if they thought him worthy of that command, they should send him there; he had bowed to the will of the senate and should accept the decision of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> P. Decius, in reply, protested against the injustice of the senate. The patricians, he said, had done their utmost to exclude the plebeians from the great offices of the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Since personal merit had so far won the day that it no longer failed of recognition in any class of men, their object was now not only to stultify the deliberate decisions of the people as expressed by their votes, but even to turn the judgments which Fortune is ever passing into so many reasons for retaining their power, small as their number was.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> All the consuls before his time had drawn lots for their commands, now the senate was giving Fabius his province independently of the lot.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> If this was simply as a mark of honour, then he would admit that Fabius had rendered services both to the republic and to himself and he would gladly consent to anything that would add to his reputation, provided it did not involve casting a slur upon himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> But who could fail to see that when a peculiarly difficult and formidable war is entrusted to one consul without any resort to the lot, it means that the other consul is regarded as superfluous and useless?
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Fabius pointed with pride to his achievements in Etruria; Decius wished to be able to do so too, and possibly he might succeed in totally extinguishing the fire which the other had only smothered, and smothered in such a way that it was constantly breaking out where one least expected in fresh conflagrations.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He was prepared to concede honours and rewards to his colleague out of respect to his age and position, but when it was a question of danger or of fighting he did not give way, and would not voluntarily.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> If he gained nothing else from this dispute, he would at least gain this much, that the people should decide a question which was theirs to decide, rather than that the senate should show undue partiality. He prayed Jupiter Optimus Maximus and the immortal gods to grant to him the impartial chance of the lot with his colleague, if they were going to grant them each the same courage and good fortune in the conduct of the war.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> It was, at all events, a thing eminently fair in itself, and an excellent precedent for all time, and a thing which touched the good name of Rome very closely, that both the consuls should be men by either of whom the Etruscan war could be conducted without any risk of failure.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Fabius' only reply was to entreat the people to listen to some despatches which had been sent by Appius before they proceeded to vote. He then left the Assembly. The people were no less strong in his support than the senate had been, and Etruria was decreed to Fabius without any casting of lots.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Preparations to meet the four Nations.</note> this decision was come to, all the men of military age flocked to the consul, and every one began to give in his name, so eager were they to serve under him as their general.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Seeing himself surrounded by this crowd, he called out: <q direct="unspecified">I do not intend to enlist more than 4000 infantry and 6oo cavalry, and will take with me those of you who give in your names to-day and tomorrow.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> I am more concerned to bring you all back wealthy men than to have a large number of men for my fighting force.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>With this compact army full of confidence and hope &mdash;all the more so because he felt no need of a great host &mdash;he marched to the town of Aharna, which was not far from the enemy, and from there went on to Appius camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> He was still some miles distant from it when he was met by some soldiers sent to cut wood who were accompanied by an armed escort. When they saw the lictors marching in front of him, and heard that it was Fabius their consul, they were overjoyed and thanked the gods and the people of Rome for having sent him to them as their commander.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As they pressed round the consul to salute him, Fabius asked them where they were going, and on their replying that they were going to cut wood, <q direct="unspecified">What do you say?</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> he inquired; <q direct="unspecified">surely you have a ramparted camp?</q> They informed him that they had a double rampart and fosse round the camp, and yet they were in a state of mortal fear.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> <q direct="unspecified">Well, then,</q> he replied, <q direct="unspecified">go back and pull down your stockade, and you will have quite enough wood.</q> They returned into camp and began to demolish the rampart, to the great terror of those who
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> had remained in camp, and especially of Appius himself, until the news spread from one to another that they were acting under the orders of Q. Fabius, the consul. On the following day the camp was shifted, and Appius was sent back to Rome to take up his duties as praetor.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>From that time the Romans had no standing camp. Fabius said that it was bad for the army to remain fixed in one spot; it became more healthy and active by frequent marches and change of position.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> They made as long and frequent marches as the season allowed, for the winter was not yet over. As soon as spring set in, he left the second legion at Clusium, formerly called Camars, and placed L. Scipio in charge of the camp as propraetor.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He then returned to Rome to consult the senate as to future operations. He may have taken this step on his own initiative after finding from personal observation that the war was a bigger thing than he had believed it to be from the reports received, or he may have been summoned home by the senate; both reasons are assigned by our authorities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Some want to make it appear that he was compelled to return, owing to the action of Appius Claudius, who had sent alarming despatches about the state of things in Etruria, and was now adding to the alarm by his speeches in the senate and before the Assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He considered one general with only one army quite insufficient to cope with four nations; whether they combined their forces against him or acted separately, there was the danger of his being unable, single-handed, to meet all emergencies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He had left only two legions there, and less than 5000 infantry and cavalry had arrived with Fabius, and he advised that P. Decius should join his colleague in Etruria as soon as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Samnium could be handed over to L. Volumnius, or, if the consul preferred to keep to his own province, Volumnius should go to the support of Fabius with a full consular army.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>As the praetor's representations were producing a considerable impression, we are told that Decius gave it as his opinion that Fabius ought not to be interfered with, but left free to act as he thought best until he had either himself come to Rome, if he could do so with safety to the State, or had sent some member
					<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> of his staff from whom the senate could learn the actual state of things in Etruria, what force would be necessary, and how many generals would be required.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Immediately on his arrival in Rome, Fabius addressed the senate and also the Assembly on the subject of the war. His tone was calm and temperate, he did not exaggerate, nor did he underrate the difficulties. If, he said, he accepted a colleague's assistance it would be more out of consideration for other people's fears than to provide against any danger either to himself or to the republic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> If, however, they did give him a coadjutor to be associated with him in the command, how could he possibly overlook P. Decius, who had been so frequently his colleague, and whom he knew so well?
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was no one in the world whom he would sooner have; if Decius were with him he should always find his forces sufficient for the work and never find the enemy too numerous for him to deal with.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> If his colleague preferred some other arrangement they might give him L. Volumnius.</p> <p>The people, the senate, and his own colleague all agreed that Fabius should have a perfectly free hand in the matter, and when Decius made it clear that he was ready to go either to Samnium or to Etruria, there was universal joy and congratulation. Victory was already regarded as certain, and it looked as though a triumph, and not a serious war, had been decreed to the consuls.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>I find it stated in some authorities that Fabius and Decius both started for Etruria immediately on entering office, no mention being made of their not deciding their provinces by lot, or of the quarrel between the colleagues which I have described.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Some, on the other hand, were not satisfied with simply narrating the dispute, but have given in addition certain charges which Appius brought against the absent Fabius before the people, and the bitter attacks he made upon him in his presence, and mention is made of a second quarrel between the colleagues caused by Decius insisting that each should keep the province assigned to him.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> We find more agreement amongst the authorities from the time that both consuls left Rome for the scene of war.</p> <p>But before the consuls arrived in Etruria the Senonian Gauls came in immense numbers to Clusium with the intention of attacking the Roman camp and the legion stationed there.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Scipio was in command, and thinking to assist the scantiness of his numbers by taking up a strong position, he marched his force on to a hill which lay between his camp and the city.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> The enemy had appeared so suddenly that he had had no time to reconnoitre the ground, and he went on towards the summit after the enemy had already seized it, having approached it from the other side.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> So the legion was attacked in front and rear and completely surrounded. Some authors say that the entire legion was wiped out there, not a man being
						<milestone unit="section" n="11??"/> left to carry the tidings, and that though the consuls were not far from Clusium at the time, no report of the disaster reached them until Gaulish horsemen appeared with the heads of the slain hanging from their horses' chests and fixed on the points of their spears, whilst they chanted war-songs after their manner.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> According to another tradition they were not Gauls at all, but Umbrians, nor was there a great disaster; a foraging party commanded by L. Manlius Torquatus, a staff officer, was surrounded, but Scipio sent assistance from the camp, and in the end the Umbrians were defeated and the prisoners and booty recovered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>It is more probable that this defeat was inflicted by Gauls and not by Umbrians, for the fears of an irruption of Gauls which had been so often aroused were especially present to the minds of the citizens this year, and every precaution was taken to meet it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The force with which the consuls had taken the field consisted of four legions and a large body of cavalry, in addition to 1000 picked Campanian troopers detailed for this war, whilst the contingents furnished by the allies and the Latin League formed an even larger army than the Roman army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> But in addition to this large force two other armies were stationed not far from the City, confronting Etruria; one in the Faliscan district, another in the neighbourhood of the Vatican. The propraetors, Cnaeus Fulvius and L. Postumius Megellus, had been instructed to fix their standing camps in those positions.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="27"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Battle of Sentinum.</note> crossing the Apennines, the consuls descended into the district of Sentinum and fixed their camp about four miles distance from the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The four nations consulted together as to their plan of action, <note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="ed">This was a commanding position to take up, as Sentinum lay in Umbrian territory but close to the frontiers of the Gauls and Etruscans, and would therefore enable the consul to to strike, if opportunity offered, at any of the three.</note> and it was decided that they should not all be mixed up in one camp nor go into battle at the some
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> time. The Gauls were linked with the Samnites, the Umbrians with the Etrurians. They fixed upon the day of battle, the brunt of the fighting was to be reserved for the Gauls and Samnites, in the midst of the struggle the Etruscans and Umbrians were to attack the Roman
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> camp. These arrangements were upset by three deserters, who came in the secrecy of night to Fabius and disclosed the enemy's plans. They were rewarded for their information and dismissed with instructions to find out and report whatever fresh decision was arrived
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> at. The consuls sent written instructions to Fulvica and Postumius to bring their armies up to Clusium and ravage the enemy's country on their march as far as they possibly
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> could. The news of these ravages brought the Etruscans away from Sentinum to protect their own territory. Now that they had got them out of the way, the consuls tried hard to bring on an
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> engagement. For two days they sought to provoke the enemy to fight, but during those two days nothing took place worth mentioning; a few fell on both sides and enough exasperation was produced to make them desire a regular battle without, however, wishing to hazard everything on a decisive conflict.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>On the third day the whole force on both sides marched down into the plain. Whilst the two armies were standing ready to engage, a hind driven by a wolf from the mountains ran down into the open space between the two lines with the wolf in pursuit. Here they each took a different direction, the hind ran to the Gauls, the wolf to the
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Romans. Way was made for the wolf between the ranks; the Gauls speared the hind. On this a soldier in the front rank exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">In that place where you see the creature sacred to Diana lying dead, flight and carnage will begin; here the wolf, whole and unhurt, a creature sacred to Mars, reminds us of our Founder and that we too are of the race of
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Mars.</q></p> <p>The Gauls were stationed on the right, the Samnites on the left.<note anchored="yes" n="10" resp="ed">Where the Umbrians were and why they did not take part in this battle are questions to which our extant authorities vouchsafe no reply.</note> Q. Fabius posted the first and third legions on the right wing, facing the Samnites; to oppose the Gauls, Decius had the fifth and sixth legions, who formed the Roman
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> left. The second and fourth legions were engaged in Samnium with L. Volumnius the proconsul.</p> <p>When the armies first met they were so evenly matched that had the Etruscans and Umbrians been present, whether taking part in the battle or attacking the camp, the Romans must have been defeated.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="28"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But although neither side was gaining any advantage and Fortune had not yet indicated in any way to whom she would grant the victory, the fighting on the right wing was very different from that on the left.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Romans under Fabius were acting more on the defensive and were protracting the contest as long as possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Their commander knew that it was the habitual practice of both the Gauls and the Samnites to make a furious attack to begin with, and if that were successfully resisted, it was enough;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the courage of the Samnites gradually sank as the battle went on, whilst the Gauls, utterly unable to stand heat or exertion, found their physical strength melting away; in their first efforts they were more than men, in the end they were weaker than women.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Knowing this, he kept the strength of his men unimpaired against the time when the enemy usually began to show signs of defeat.</p> <p>Decius, as a younger man, possessing more vigour of mind, showed more dash;
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> he made use of all the strength he possessed in opening the attack, and as the infantry battle developed too slowly for him, he called on the cavalry.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Putting himself at the head of a squadron of exceptionally gallant troopers, he appealed to them as the pick of his soldiers to follow him in charging the enemy, for a twofold glory would be theirs if victory began on the left wing and, in that wing, with the cavalry. Twice they swept aside the Gaulish horse.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Making a third charge, they were carried too far, and whilst they were now fighting desperately in the midst of the enemy's cavalry they were thrown into consternation by a new style of warfare.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> Armed men mounted on chariots and baggage wagons came on with a thunderous noise of horses and wheels, and the horses of the Roman cavalry, unaccustomed to that kind of uproar, became uncontrollable through fright; the cavalry, after their victorious charges, were now scattered in frantic terror; horses and men alike were overthrown in their blind flight.
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Even the standards of the legionaries were thrown into confusion, and many of the front rank men were crushed by the weight of the horses and vehicles dashing through the lines.
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> When the Gauls saw their enemy thus demoralised they did not give them a moment's breathing space in which to recover themselves, but followed up at once with a fierce attack.
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Decius shouted to his men and asked them whither they were fleeing, what hope they had in flight; he tried to stop those who were retreating and recall the scattered units. Finding himself unable, do what he would, to check the demoralisation, he invoked the name of his father, P. Decius, and cried: <q direct="unspecified">Why do I any longer delay the destined fate of my family?
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This is the privilege granted to our house that we should be an expiatory sacrifice to avert dangers from the State. Now will I offer the legions of the enemy together with myself as a sacrifice to Tellus and the Dii Manes.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When he had uttered these words he ordered the pontiff, M. Livius, whom he had kept by his side all through the battle, to recite the prescribed form in which he was to devote <q direct="unspecified">himself and the legions of the enemy on behalf of the army of the Roman people, the Quirites.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He was accordingly devoted in the same words and wearing the same garb as his father, P. Decius, at the battle of Veseris in the Latin war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> After the usual prayers had been recited he uttered the following awful curse: <q direct="unspecified">I carry before me terror and rout and carnage and blood and the wrath of all the gods, those above and those below.
							<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> I will infect the standards, the armour, the weapons of the enemy with dire and manifold death, the place of my destruction shall also witness that of the Gauls and Samnites.</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> After uttering this imprecation on himself and on the enemy he spurred his horse against that part of the Gaulish line where they were most densely massed and leaping into it was slain by their missiles.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="29"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>From this moment the battle could hardly have appeared to any man to be dependent on human strength alone. After losing their leader, a thing which generally demoralises an army, the Romans arrested their flight and recommenced the struggle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The Gauls, especially those who were crowded round the consul's body, were discharging their missiles aimlessly and harmlessly as though bereft of their senses; some seemed paralysed, incapable of either fight or flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> But, in the other army, the pontiff Livius, to whom Decius had transferred his lictors and whom he had commissioned to act as propraetor, announced in loud tones that the consul's death had freed the Romans from all danger and given them the victory, the Gauls and Samnites were made over to Tellus the Mother and the Dii Manes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Decius was summoning and dragging down to himself the army which he had devoted together with himself, there was terror everywhere among the enemy, and the Furies were lashing them into madness.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Whilst the battle was thus being restored, L. Cornelius Scipio and C. Marcius were ordered by Fabius to bring up the reserves from the rear to the support of his colleagues. There they learnt the fate of P. Decius, and it was a powerful encouragement to them to dare everything for the republic.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The Gauls were standing in close order covered by their shields, and a hand-to-hand fight seemed no easy matter, but the staff officers gave orders for the javelins which were lying on the ground between the two armies to be gathered up and hurled at the enemy's shield wall.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Although most of them stuck in their shields and only a few penetrated their bodies, the closely massed ranks went down, most of them falling without having received a wound, just as though they had been struck by lightning. Such was the change that Fortune had brought about in the Roman left wing.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>On the right Fabius, as I have stated, was protracting the contest.. When he found that neither the battle-shout of the enemy, nor their onset, nor the discharge of their missiles were as strong as they had been at the beginning, he
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> ordered the officers in command of the cavalry to take their squadrons round to the side of the Samnite army, ready at a given signal to deliver as fierce a flank attack as possible. The infantry were at the same time to press steadily forwards and dislodge the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he saw that they were offering no resistance, and were evidently worn out, he massed all his support which he had kept in reserve for the supreme moment, and gave the signal for a general charge of infantry and cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The Samnites could not face the onslaught and fled precipitately past the Gauls to their camp, leaving their allies to fight as best they could.</p> <p>The Gauls were still standing in close order behind their shield wall.<note anchored="yes" n="11" resp="ed">We should hardly expect to find them still in this attitude after the overthrow mentioned above. Possibly only the front rank went down or the words may be merely the reinsertion of the identical sentence above by some wool-gathering copyist.</note>
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Fabius, on hearing of his colleague's death, ordered a squadron of Campanian horse, about 500 strong, to go out of action and ride round to take the Gauls in the rear.
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign> of the third legion were ordered to follow, and, wherever they saw the enemy's line disordered by the cavalry, to press home the attack and cut them down.
						<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He vowed a temple and the spoils of the enemy to Jupiter Victor, and then proceeded to the Samnite camp to which the whole crowd of panic-struck fugitives was being driven.
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> As they could not all get through the gates, those outside tried to resist the Roman attack and a battle began close under the rampart. It was here that Gellius Egnatius, the captain-general of the Samnites, fell.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Finally the Samnites were driven within their lines and the camp was taken after a brief struggle. At the same time the Gauls were attacked in the rear and overpowered; 25,000 of the enemy were killed in that day's fighting and 8000 made prisoners.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> The victory was by no means a bloodless one, for P. Decius lost
						<milestone unit="section" n="18??"/> 7000 killed and Fabius <date value="1700">1700</date>. After sending out a search party to find his colleague's body, Fabius had the spoils of the enemy collected into a heap and burnt as a sacrifice to Jupiter Victor.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> The consul's body could not be found that day as it was buried under a heap of Gauls; it was discovered the next day and brought back to camp amidst the tears of the soldiers.
						<milestone unit="section" n="20"/> Fabius laid aside all other business in order to pay the last rites to his dead colleague; the obsequies were conducted with every mark of honour and the funeral oration sounded the welldeserved praises of the deceased consul.</p>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Fabius celebrates his Triumph.</note> these occurrences in Umbria, Cnaeus Fulvius, the propraetor, was succeeding to the utmost of his wishes in Etruria. Not only did he carry destruction far and wide over the enemy's fields, but he fought a brilliant action with the united forces of
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> Perusia and Clusium in which more than 3000 of the enemy were killed and as many as 20 standards taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The remains of the Samnite army attempted to escape through the Pelignian territory, but were intercepted by the native troops, and out of 5000 as many as 1000 were killed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Great as the glory of the day on which the battle of Sentinum was fought must appear to any writer who adheres to the truth, it has by some writers been exaggerated beyond all belief.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They assert that the enemy's army amounted to 1,000,000 infantry and 46,000 cavalry, together with 1000 war chariots. That, of course, includes the Umbrians and Tuscans who are represented as taking part in the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> And by way of increasing the Roman strength they tell us that Lucius Volumnius commanded in the action as well as the consuls, and that their legions were supplemented by his army.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In the majority of the annalists the victory is assigned only to the two consuls; Volumnius is described as campaigning during that time in Samnium, and after driving a Samnite army on to Mount Tifernus, he succeeded, in spite of the difficulty of the position, in defeating and routing them.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Q. Fabius left Decius' army to hold Etruria and led back his own legions to the City to enjoy a triumph over the Gauls, the Etruscans, and the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> In the songs which the soldiers sang in the procession the glorious death of Decius was celebrated quite as much as the victory of Fabius, and they recalled the father's memory in their praises of the son who had rivalled his father in his devotion and all that it had done for the State.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Out of the spoils each soldier received eighty-two <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign> of bronze, with cloaks and tunics, rewards not to be despised in those days.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="31"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Progress of the Samnite War.</note> spite of these defeats neither the Etruscans nor the Samnites remained quiet. After the consul had withdrawn his army the Perusians recommenced hostilities, a force of Samnites
					<milestone unit="section" n="2??"/> descended into the country round Vescia and Formiae, plundering and harrying as they went, whilst another body invaded the district of Aesernum and the region round the Vulturnus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Appius Claudius was sent against these with Decius' old army; Fabius, who had marched into Etruria, slew 4500 of the Perusians, and took <date value="1740">1740</date> prisoners, who were ransomed at 310 <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign> per head; the rest of the booty was given to the soldiers.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Samnites, one body of which was pursued by Appius Claudius, the other by L. Volumnius, effected a junction in the Stellate district and took up a position there.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> A desperate battle was fought, the one army was furious against those who had so often taken up arms against them, the other felt that this was their last hope. The Samnites lost 16,300 killed and 2700 prisoners; on the side of the Romans 2700 fell.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>As far as military operations went, the year was a prosperous one, but it was rendered an anxious one by a severe pestilence and by alarming portents.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> In many places showers of earth were reported to have fallen, and a large number of men in the army under Appius Claudius were said to have been struck by lightning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The Sacred Books were consulted in view of these occurrences.</p> <p>During this year Q. Fabius Gurges, the consul's son, who was an aedile, brought some matrons to trial before the people on the charge of adultery. Out of their fines he obtained sufficient money to build the temple of Venus which stands near the Circus.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The Samnite wars are still with us, those wars which I have been occupied with through these last four books, and which have gone on continuously for six-and-forty years, in fact ever since the consuls, M. Valerius and A. Cornelius, carried the arms of Rome for the first time into Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> It is unnecessary now to recount the numberless defeats which overtook both nations, and the toils which they endured through all those years, and yet these things were powerless to break down the resolution or crush the spirit of that people;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> I will only allude to the events of the past year. During that period the Samnites, fighting sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction with other nations, had been defeated by Roman armies under Roman generals on four several occasions, at Sentinum, amongst the Paeligni, at Tifernum, and in the Stellate plains;
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> they had lost the most brilliant general they ever possessed; they now saw their allies &mdash;Etruscans, Umbrians, Gauls &mdash;overtaken by the same fortune that they had suffered; they were unable any longer to stand either in their own strength or in that afforded by foreign arms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> And yet they would not abstain from war; so far were they from being weary of defending their liberty, even though unsuccessfully, that they would rather be worsted than give up trying for victory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What sort of a man must he be who would find the long
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> story of those wars tedious, though he is only narrating or reading it, when they failed to wear out those who were actually engaged in them?</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="32"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Q. Fabius and P. Decius were succeeded in the consulship by L. Postumius Megellus and M. Atilius Regulus.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Samnium was assigned to both of them as the field of operations in consequence of information received that three armies had been raised there, one being destined for Etruria, another was to ravage Campania, and the third was intended for the defence of their frontiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Illness kept Postumius in Rome, but Atilius marched out at once in accordance with the senate's instructions, with the view of surprising the Samnite armies before they had started on their expeditions.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He met the enemy, as though they had had a previous understanding, at a point where he himself was stopped from entering the Samnite country and at the same time barred any movement on their part towards Roman territory or the peaceable lands of her allies.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The two camps confronted each other, and the Samnites, with the recklessness that comes of despair, ventured upon an enterprise which the Romans, who had been so often victorious, would hardly have undertaken, namely an attack on the enemy's camp. Their daring attempt did not achieve its end, but it was not altogether fruitless.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> During a great part of the day there had been so dense a fog that it was not only impossible to see anything beyond the rampart, but even people who were together were unable to see each other.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The Samnites, relying on their movements being concealed, came on in the dim twilight &mdash;what light there was being obscured by the fog &mdash;and
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> reached the outpost in front of the gate who were keeping a careless look-out, and who being thus attacked unawares had neither the strength nor the courage to offer any resistance. After disposing of the guard they entered the camp through the decuman gate and got
					<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> possession of the quaestor's tent, <note anchored="yes" n="12" resp="ed">This tent stood in the space between the <foreign lang="la">porta decumana</foreign> marked R and the <foreign lang="la">Via Quintana</foreign> marked Q in the plan of a Roman camp in the <bibl>Class. Dict.</bibl>, where also the cavalry of the allies are marked who would be the nearest to the inrushing enemy. The <foreign lang="la">Via Principalis</foreign> ran from the one <foreign lang="la">parta principalis</foreign> (T) to the other (U).</note> the quaestor, L. Opimius Pansa, being killed. Then there was a general call to arms.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="33"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul roused by the tumult ordered two of the allied cohorts, those from Luca and Suessa, which happened to be the nearest, to protect the headquarters' tent, and then he mustered the maniples in the <foreign lang="la">via principalis</foreign>.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> They got into line almost before they were in proper fighting trim, and they located the enemy by the direction of the shouting rather than by anything that they could see; as to his numbers they were quite unable to form any estimate.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Doubtful as to their position they at first retreated, and thus allowed the enemy to advance as far as the middle of the camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Seeing this the consul asked them whether they were going to be driven outside their rampart, and then try to recover their camp by assaulting it. Then they raised the battle-shout and steadily held their ground until they were able to take the offensive and force the
					<milestone unit="section" n="5??"/> enemy back, which they did persistently without giving him a moment's respite, until they had driven him outside the gate and past the rampart. Further than that they did not venture to go in pursuit, because the bad light made them fear the possibility of a surprise.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Content with having cleared the enemy out of the camp they retired within the rampart, having killed about 300. On the Roman side, the outposts who were killed and those who fell round the quaestor's tent amounted to 230.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The partial success of this daring manoeuvre raised the spirits of the Samnites, and they not only prevented the Romans from advancing but they even kept the foraging parties out of their fields, who had consequently to fall back on the pacified district of Sora.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The report of this occurrence which reached Rome, and which was a much more sensational one than the facts warranted, compelled the other consul, L. Postumius, to leave the City before his health was quite re-established.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> He issued a general order for his men to assemble at Sora, and previous to his departure he dedicated the temple to Victory which he had, when curule aedile, built out of the proceeds of fines.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> On rejoining his army he marched from Sora to his colleague's camp. The Samnites despaired of offering an effectual resistance to two consular armies and withdrew; the consuls then proceeded in different directions to lay waste their fields and storm their cities.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="34"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amongst the latter was Milionia, which Postumius unsuccessfully attempted to carry by assault.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> He then attacked the place by regular approaches, and after his <foreign lang="la">vineae</foreign> were brought up to the walls he forced an entrance. From ten o'clock in the morning till two in the afternoon fighting went on in all quarters of the town with doubtful result; at last the Romans got possession of the place;
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> 3200 Samnites were killed and 4700 made prisoners, in addition to the rest of the booty.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> From there the legions marched to Feritrum, but the townsfolk evacuated the place quietly during the night, taking with them all their possessions, everything which could be either driven or carried.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Immediately on his reaching the vicinity, the consul approached the walls with his men prepared for action, as though there was going to be as much fighting there as there had been at Milionia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> When he found that there was a dead silence in the city and no sign of arms or men was visible in the towers or on the walls, he checked his men, who were eager to get into the deserted fortifications, for fear he might be rushing blindly into a trap.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He ordered two troops of cavalry belonging to the Latin contingent to ride round the walls and make a thorough reconnaissance. They discovered one gate open and another near it also open, and on the road leading from these gates traces of the enemy's nocturnal flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Riding slowly up to the gates they obtained an uninterrupted view of the city through the straight streets, and brought back report to the consul that the city had been evacuated, as was clear from the unmistakable solitude and the things scattered about in the confusion of the night &mdash;evidence of their hasty flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> On receiving this information the consul led his army round to that side of the city which the cavalry had examined. Halting the standards near the gates, he ordered five horsemen to enter the city, and after going some distance three were to remain where they were, and two were to return and report to him what they had discovered.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> They reported that they had reached a point from which a view was obtained in all directions, and everywhere they saw a silent solitude.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The consul immediately sent some light-armed cohorts into the city, the rest of the army received orders to form an entrenched camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The soldiers who had entered the place broke open some of the houses and found a few old and sick people and such property left behind as they found too difficult to transport.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> This was appropriated, and it was ascertained from the prisoners that several cities in the neighbourhood had mutually agreed to leave their homes, and the Romans would probably find the same solitude in other cities.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> What the prisoners had said proved to be true, and the consul took possession of the abandoned towns.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="35"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The other consul, M. Atilius, found his task by no means so easy. He had received information that the Samnites were besieging Luceria, and he marched to its relief, but the enemy met him at the frontier of the Lucerine territory.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Exasperation and rage lent them a strength which made them a match for the Romans. The battle went on with changing fortunes and an indecisive result, but in the end the Romans were in the sorrier plight, for they were unaccustomed to defeat, and it was after the two armies had separated rather than in the battle itself that they realised how much greater the loss was on their side in both killed and wounded.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> When they were once more within their camp they became a prey to fears which, had they felt them whilst actually fighting, would have brought upon them a signal disaster. They passed an anxious night expecting that the Samnites would make an immediate attack on the camp, or that they would have to engage their victorious foe at daybreak.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> On the side of the enemy the loss was less, but certainly the courage displayed was not greater.</p> <p>As soon as it began to grow light the Romans were anxious to retire without fighting, but there was only one way and that led past the enemy; if they took that route it would amount to a challenge, for it would look as though they were directly advancing to attack the Samnite camp.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul issued a general order for the soldiers to arm for battle and follow him outside the rampart.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then gave the necessary instructions to the officers of his staff, the military tribunes, and the prefects of the allies.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> They all assured him that as far as they were concerned they would do everything that he wished them to do, but the men had lost heart, they had passed a sleepless night amidst the wounded and the groans of the dying, and had the enemy attacked the camp while it was still dark,
						<milestone unit="section" n="8??"/> they were in such a state of fright that they would have deserted their standards. As it was they were only kept from flight by a feeling of shame, in every other respect they were practically beaten men.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Under these circumstances the consul thought he ought to go round and address the soldiers personally.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> When he came to any who were showing reluctance to arm themselves he asked them why they were so slow and so cowardly; the enemy would come up to their camp unless they met him outside; they would have to fight to defend their tents if they refused to fight in front of their rampart.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Armed and fighting they had a chance of victory, but the men who awaited the enemy unarmed and defenceless would have to suffer either death or slavery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> To these taunts and reproaches they replied that they were exhausted with the fighting on the previous day, they had no strength or blood left, and the enemy seemed to be in greater force than ever.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Whilst this was going on the hostile army approached, and as they were now closer and could be seen more clearly the men declared that the Samnites were carrying stakes with them, and there was no doubt they intended to shut the camp in with a circumvallation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Then the consul loudly exclaimed that it would indeed be a disgrace if they submitted to such a galling insult from so dastardly a foe. <q direct="unspecified">Shall we,</q> he cried, <q direct="unspecified">be actually blockaded in our camp to perish ignominiously by hunger rather than, if we must die, die bravely at the sword's point?
						<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> Heaven forbid! Act, every man of you, as you deem worthy of yourselves!
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> I, the consul, M. Atilius, will go against the enemy alone if none will follow and fall amongst the standards of the Samnites sooner than see a Roman camp hedged in by circumvallation.</q></p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>The consul's words were welcomed by all his officers, and the rank and file, ashamed to hold back any longer, slowly put themselves in fighting trim and slowly marched out of camp. They moved in a long irregular column, dejected and to all appearance thoroughly cowed, but the enemy against whom they were advancing felt no more confidence and showed no more spirit than they did.
					<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> As soon as they caught sight of the Roman standards a murmur ran through the Samnite army from the foremost to the hindmost ranks that what they feared
					<milestone unit="section" n="19??"/> was actually happening, the Romans were coming out to oppose their march, there was no road open even for flight, they must either fall where they were or make their escape over the bodies of their prostrate foes.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="36"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They piled their knapsacks in the centre and formed up in order of battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> There was by this time only a narrow space between the two armies, and each side were standing motionless waiting for the others to raise the battle-shout and begin the attack.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Neither of them had any heart for fighting, and they would have marched off in opposite directions if they were not each apprehensive that the other would attack them on the retreat. In this timid and reluctant mood they commenced a feeble fight, without receiving any order to attack or raising any regular battle-shout, and not a man stirred a foot from where he stood.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Then the consul, in order to infuse some spirit into the combatants, sent a few troops of cavalry to make a demonstration; most of them were thrown from their horses and the rest got into hopeless confusion. A rush was made by the Samnites to overpower those who had been dismounted; this was met by a rush from the Roman ranks to protect their comrades.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> This made the fighting somewhat more lively, but the Samnites rushed forward with more dash and in greater numbers, whilst the disordered Roman cavalry on their terrified horses were riding down their own supports.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The demoralisation which began here extended to the whole army; there was a general flight, and the Samnites had none to fight with but the rearmost of their foes.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> At this critical moment the consul galloped back to the camp and posted a cavalry detachment before the gate with strict orders to treat as an enemy any one who made for the rampart whether Roman or Samnite. He then stopped his men who were running back to the camp in disorder, and in menacing tones called out, <q direct="unspecified">Where are you going, soldiers?
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Here, too, you will find armed men, and not one of you shall enter the camp while your consul is alive unless you come as victors; now make your choice whether you would rather fight with your own countrymen or with the enemy.</q>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> While the consul was speaking, the cavalry closed round the fugitives with levelled spears and peremptorily ordered them to return to the battlefield. Not only did the consul's courage help them to rally, but Fortune also favoured them. As the Samnites were not in close pursuit there was space enough for the standards to wheel round and the whole army to change front from the camp to the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Now the men began to encourage each other, the centurions snatched the standards from the hands of the bearers and carried them forward, pointing out at the same time to their men how few the enemy were, and in what loose order they were coming.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> In the middle of it all the consul, raising his hands towards heaven and speaking in a loud voice so that he might be well heard, vowed a temple to Jupiter Stator<note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="ed">Jupiter Stator=<q direct="unspecified">Jove the Stayer,</q> see Vol. I. p. 16.</note> if the Roman army stayed its flight and renewed the battle and defeated and slew the Samnites.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> The officers and men, infantry and cavalry alike, exerted themselves to the utmost to restore the battle. Even the divine providence seemed to have looked with favour on the Romans, so easily did matters take a favourable turn. The enemy were repulsed from the camp, and in a short time were driven back to the ground where the battle began.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Here their movements were hampered by the heap of knapsacks they had piled up in their centre; to prevent these from being plundered they took up their position round them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> But the Roman infantry pressed upon them in front and the cavalry attacked them in rear, so between the two they were all either killed or made prisoners. The latter amounted to 7800, these were all stripped and sent under the yoke.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The number of those killed was reported to be 4800. The Romans had not much cause for rejoicing over their victory, for when the consul reckoned up the losses sustained through the two days' fighting the number of missing was returned as 7800.</p> <p>During these incidents in Apulia, the Samnites made an attempt with a second army upon the Roman colony at Interamna, situated on the Latin road.
						<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> Failing to get possession of the city, they ravaged the fields and proceeded to carry off, along with their other plunder, a number of men and several head of cattle and some colonists whom they had captured.
						<milestone unit="section" n="17"/> They fell in with the consul, who was returning from his victorious campaign in Luceria, and not only lost their booty, but their long straggling column was quite unprepared for attack and was consequently cut up.
						<milestone unit="section" n="18"/> The consul issued a notice summoning the owners of the plundered property to Interamna to identify and recover what belonged to them, and leaving his army there, started for Rome to conduct the elections.
						<milestone unit="section" n="19"/> He requested to be allowed a triumph, but this honour was refused him on the ground that he had lost so many thousands of men, and also because he had sent his prisoners under the yoke without its having been made a condition of their surrender. <note anchored="yes" n="14" resp="ed">It would appear from this that the enemy when arranging the terms of surrender must expressly declare their consent to being thus treated. This condition was imposed by Pontius on the occasion of the Caudine disaster and accepted by the Romans (Book Ix. chap. iv.; see also chap. xlii. in the same book).</note></p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="37"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The other consul, Postumius, finding nothing for his troops to do amongst the Samnites, led them into Etruria and began to lay waste the district of Volsinia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The townsmen came out to defend their borders and a battle ensued not far from their walls ; 2800 of the Etruscans were killed, the rest were saved by the proximity of their city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He then passed over into the Rusellan territory; there, not only were the fields harried, but the town itself was successfully assaulted. More than 2000 were made prisoners, and under 2000 killed in the storming of the place. The peace which ensued this year in Etruria was more important and redounded more to the honour of Rome than even the war which led to it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Three very powerful cities, the chief cities in Etruria, Vulsinii, Perusia, and Arretium, sued for peace, and after agreeing to supply the troops with clothing and corn, they obtained the consul's consent to send spokesmen to Rome, with the result that they obtained a forty years' truce.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> Each of the cities was at once to pay an indemnity of 500,000 <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>.</p> <p>For these services the consul asked the senate to decree him a triumph.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> The request was made more as a matter of form, to comply with the established custom, than from any hope of obtaining it . He saw that some who were his personal enemies and others who were friends of his colleague refused his request on various grounds, some alleging that he had been
						<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> too late in taking the field, others that he had transferred his army from Samnium to Etruria without any orders from the senate, whilst a third party were actuated by a desire to solace Atilius for the refusal which he had met with.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> In face of this opposition he simply said: <q direct="unspecified">Senators, I am not so mindful of your authority as to forget that I am consul. By the same right and authority by which I have conducted wars, now that these wars have been brought to a successful close, Samnium and Etruria subdued, victory and peace secured, I shall celebrate my triumph.</q> And with that he left the senate.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>A sharp contention now broke out between the tribunes of the plebs. Some declared that they should interpose to prevent his obtaining a triumph in a way which violated all precedent, others asserted that they should give him their support in spite of their colleagues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> The matter was brought before the Assembly, and the consul was invited to be present. In his speech he alluded to the cases of the consuls M. Horatius and L. Valerius and the recent one of Gaius Marcius Rutilus, the father of the man who was censor at the time. All these, he said, had been allowed a triumph, not on the authority of the senate but by an order of the people.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He would have brought the question before the people himself had he not been aware that certain tribunes of the plebs who were bound hand and foot to the nobles would veto the proposal.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> He regarded the goodwill and favour of a unanimous people as tantamount to all the formal orders that were made.</p> <p>Supported by three of the tribunes against the veto of the remaining seven and against the unanimous voice of the senate he celebrated his triumph on the following day amidst a great outburst of popular enthusiasm.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>The records of this year vary widely from each other. Accord &mdash; ing to Claudius, Postumius, after taking some cities in Samnium, was routed and put to flight in Apulia, he himself being wounded, and was driven with a small body of his troops to Luceria; the victories in Etruria were won by Atilius and it was he who celebrated the triumph.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Fabius tells us that both consuls conducted the campaign in Samnium and at Luceria, and that the army was transferred to Etruria, but he does not say by which consul.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> He also states that at Luceria the losses were heavy on both sides, and that a temple was vowed to Jupiter Stator in that battle. This same vow Romulus had made many centuries before, but only the <foreign lang="la">fanum</foreign>, that is the site of the temple, had been consecrated.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> As the State had become thus doubly pledged, it became necessary to discharge its obligation to the god, and the senate made an order this year for the construction of the temple.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="38"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The year following was marked by the consulship of L. Papirius Cursor, who had not only inherited his father's glory but enhanced it by his management of a great war and a victory over the Samnites, second only to the one which his father had won.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> It happened that this nation had taken the same care and pains to adorn their soldiery with all the wealth of splendour as they had done on the occasion of the elder Papirius' victory. They had also called in the aid of the gods by submitting the soldiers to a kind of initiation into an ancient form of oath.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> A levy was conducted throughout Samnium under a novel regulation; any man within the military age who had not assembled on the captain-general's proclamation, or any one who
					<milestone unit="section" n="4??"/> had departed without permission, was devoted to Jupiter <note anchored="yes" n="15" resp="ed">The Lex Sacrata</note> and his life
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> forfeited. The whole of the army was summoned to Aquilonia, and 40,000 men, the full strength of Samnium, were concentrated there.</p> <p>A space, about 200 feet square, almost in the centre of their camp, was boarded off and covered all over with linen
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> cloth. In this enclosure a sacrificial service was conducted, the words being read from an old linen book by an aged priest, Ovius Paccius, who announced that he was taking that form of service from the old ritual of the Samnite religion. It was the form which their ancestors used when they formed their secret design of wresting Capua from the
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Etruscans. When the sacrifice was completed the captain-general sent a messenger to summon all those who were of noble birth or who were distinguished for their military
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> achievements. They were admitted into the enclosure one by one. As each was admitted he was led up to the altar, more like a victim than like one who was taking part in the service,
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> and he was bound on oath not to divulge what he saw and heard in that place. Then they compelled him to take an oath couched in the most terrible language, imprecating a
						<milestone unit="section" n="10??"/> curse on himself, his family, and his race if he did not go into battle where the commanders should lead him or if he either himself fled from battle or did not at once slay any one whom he saw
						<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> fleeing. At first there were some who refused to take this oath; they were massacred beside the altar, and their dead bodies lying amongst the scattered remains of the victims were a plain hint to the rest not to
						<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> refuse. After the foremost men among the Samnites had been bound by this dread formula, ten were especially named by the captain-general and told each to choose a comrade-in-arms, and these again to choose others until they had made up the number of 16,ooo. These were called the <q direct="unspecified">linen legion,</q> from the material with which the place where they had been sworn was covered. They were provided with resplendent armour and plumed helmets to distinguish them from the
						<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> others. The rest of the army consisted of something under 20,000 men, but they were not inferior to the linen legion either in their personal appearance or soldierly qualities or in the excellence of their equipment. This was the number of those in camp at Aquilonia, forming the total strength of Samnium.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="39"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consuls left the City. The first to go was Spurius Carvilius, to whom were assigned the legions which M. Atilius, the previous consul, had left in the district of Interamna.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> With these he advanced into Samnium, and while the enemy were taken up with their superstitious observance and forming secret plans, he stormed and captured the town of Amiternum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> Nearly 2800 men were killed there, and 4270 made prisoners. Papirius with a fresh army raised by senatorial decree successfully attacked the city of Duronia.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> He made fewer prisoners than his colleague, but slew a somewhat greater number. In both towns rich booty was secured. Then the consuls traversed Samnium in different directions; Carvilius, after ravaging the Atinate country, came to Cominium; Papirius reached Aquilonia, where the main army of the Samnites was posted.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">The Battle of Aquilonia.</note> some time his troops, while not quite inactive, abstained from any serious fighting. The time was spent in annoying the enemy when he was quiet, and retiring when he showed resistance &mdash;in threatening rather than in offering battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> As long as this practice went on day after day, of beginning and then desisting, even the slightest skirmish led to no result.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The other Roman camp was separated by an interval of 20 miles, but Carvilius was guided in all his measures by the advice of his distant colleague; his thoughts were dwelling more on Aquilonia, where the state of affairs was so critical, than on Cominium, which he was actually besieging.</p> <p>Papirius was at length perfectly ready to fight, and he sent a message to his colleague announcing his intention, if the auspices were favourable, of engaging the enemy the next day, and impressing upon him the necessity of attacking Cominium with his full strength, to give the Samnites no opportunity of sending succour to Aquilonia.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The messenger had the day for his journey, he returned in the night, bringing word back to the consul that his colleague approved of his plan.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Immediately after despatching the messenger Papirius ordered a muster of his troops, and addressed them preparatory to the battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> He spoke at some length upon the general character of the war they were engaged in, and especially upon the style of equipment which the enemy had adopted, which he said served for idle pageantry rather than for practical use.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Plumes did not inflict wounds, their painted and gilded shields would be penetrated by the Roman javelin, and an army resplendent in dazzling white would be stained with gore when the sword came into play.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> A Samnite army all in gold and silver had once been annihilated by his father, and those trappings had brought more glory as spoils to the victors than they had brought as armour to the wearers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> It might, perhaps, be a special privilege granted to his name and family that the greatest efforts which the Samnites had ever made should be frustrated and defeated under their generalship and that the spoils which they brought back should be sufficiently splendid to serve as decorations for the public places in the City.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> Treaties so often asked for, so often broken, brought about the intervention of the immortal gods, and if it were permitted to make to form any conjecture as to the feelings of the gods, he believed that they had never
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> been more incensed against any army than against this one of the Samnites It had taken part in infamous rites and been stained with the mingled blood of men and beasts;
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/> it was under the two-fold curse of heaven, filled with dread at the thought of the gods who witnessed the treaties made with Rome and horror-struck at the imprecations which were uttered when all
					<milestone unit="section" n="17??"/> oath was taken to break those treaties, an oath which the soldiers took under compulsion and which they recall with loathing. They dread alike the gods, their fellow-countrymen, and. the enemy.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="40"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These details the consul had gathered from information supplied by deserters, and his mention of them increased the exasperation of the troops. Assured of the favour of heaven and satisfied that humanly speaking they were more than a match for their foes, they clamoured with one voice to be led to battle, and were intensely disgusted at finding that it was put off till the morrow; they chafed angrily at the delay of a whole day and night.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After receiving the reply from his colleague, Papirius rose quietly in the third watch of the night and sent a <foreign lang="la">pullarius</foreign> to observe the omens.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> There was not a man, whatever his rank or condition, in the camp who was not seized by the passion for battle, the highest and lowest alike were eagerly looking forward to it;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> the general was watching the excited looks of the men, the men were looking at their general, the universal excitement extended even to those who were engaged in observing the sacred birds. The chickens refused to eat, but the <foreign lang="la">pullarius</foreign> ventured to misrepresent matters, and reported to the consul that they had eaten so greedily that the corn dropped from their mouths on to the ground.<note anchored="yes" n="16" resp="ed">The auspices were taken from the observation of birds, either from their flight, as in the case of the vultures seen by Romulus and Remus, or from their cries or notes, as in the case of the eagle mentioned as portending the royalty of the Tarquins, or thirdly from the way they took their food. These latter were sacred chickens kept in cages, which always accompanied the Imperator on his campaigns. The <foreign lang="la">pullarii</foreign> were the augurs in charge of the chickens whose business it was to take the auspices from them. If the birds refused their corn it was naturally regarded as a bad omen, but if, going to the other extreme, they picked it up so greedily that some fell from their bills, the omen was in the highest degree favourable. There was a special term applied to the way the corn thus dropped on to the ground, which was ultimately used a general description of the method of augury.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The consul, delighted at the news, gave out that the omens could not have been more favourable; they were going to engage the enemy under the guidance and blessing of heaven.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> He then gave the signal for battle.</p><p>Just as they were taking up their position, a deserter brought word that 20 cohorts of the Samnites, comprising about 400 men each, had gone to Cominium.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> He instantly despatched a message to his colleague in case he should not be aware of this movement, and ordered the standards to be advanced more rapidly. He had already posted the reserves in their respective positions and told off an officer to take command of each detach- ment.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> The right wing of the main army he entrusted to L. Volumnius, the left to L. Scipio, and two other members of his staff, C. Caedicius and T. Trebonius, were placed in command of the cavalry. He gave orders for Spurius Nautius to remove the pack-saddles from the mules and to take them together with three of the auxiliary cohorts by a circuitous route to some rising ground visible from the battlefield, where during
						<milestone unit="section" n="9??"/> the pro- gress of the fight he was to attract attention by raising as great a cloud of dust as possible.</p><p>While the consul was busy with these arrangements an alterca- tion began between the <foreign lang="la">pullarii</foreign> about the omens which had been observed in the morning. Some of the Roman Cavalry overheard it and thought it of sufficient importance to justify them in reporting to Spurius Papirius, the consul's nephew, that the omens were being called in question.
							<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> This young man, born in an age when men were not yet taught to despise the gods, inquired into the matter in order to make quite sure that what he was reporting was true and then laid it before the consul.
							<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He thanked him for the trouble be had taken and bade him have no fears. <q direct="unspecified">But,</q> he continued, <q direct="unspecified">if the man who is watching the omens makes a false report, he brings down the divine wrath on his own head.
								<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> As far as I am concerned, I have received the formal intimation that the chickens ate eagerly, there could be no more favourable omen for the Roman people and army.</q> He then issued instructions to the centurions to place the <foreign lang="la">pullarius</foreign> in front of the fighting line.
							<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> The standards of the Samnites were now advancing, followed by the army in gorgeous array; even to their enemies they presented a magnificent sight. Before the battle-shout was raised or the lines closed a chance javelin struck the <foreign lang="la">pullarius</foreign> and he fell in front of the standards.
							<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> When this was reported to the consul he remarked, <q direct="unspecified">The gods are taking their part in the battle, the guilty man has met with his punishment.</q> While the consul was speaking a crow in front of him gave a loud and distinct caw. The consul welcomed the augury and declared that the gods had never more plainly manifested their presence in human affairs. He then ordered the charge to be sounded and the battle-shout to be raised.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="41"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A savagely fought contest ensued. The two sides were, however, animated by very different feelings. The Romans went into battle eager for the fray, confident of victory, exasperated against the enemy and thirsting for his blood. The Samnites were, most of them, dragged in against their will by sheer compulsion and the terrors of religion, and they adopted defensive rather than aggressive tactics.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Accustomed as they had been for so many years to defeat, they would not have sustained even the first shout and charge of the Romans had not a still more awful object of fear possessed their minds and stayed them from flight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> They had before their eyes all that paraphernalia of the secret rite &mdash;the armed priests, the slaughtered remains of men and beasts scattered about indiscriminately, the altars sprinkled with the blood of the victims and of their murdered countrymen, the awful imprecations, the frightful curses which they had invoked on their family and race &mdash;these were the chains which bound them so that they could not flee.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> They dreaded their own countrymen more than the enemy.</p> <p>The Romans pressed on from both wings and from the centre and cut down men who were paralysed by fear of gods and men. Only a feeble resistance could be offered by those who were only kept from flight by fear.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The carnage had almost extended to the second line where the standards were stationed when there appeared in the side distance a cloud of dust as though raised by the tread of an immense army. It was Sp. Nautius &mdash;some say Octavius Maecius &mdash;the commander of the auxiliary cohorts.
						<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> They raised a dust out of all proportion to their numbers, for the camp-followers mounted upon the mules were dragging leafy boughs along the ground. At first the arms and standards gradually became visible through the beclouded light, and then a loftier and thicker Cloud of dust gave the appearance of cavalry closing the column.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> Not only the Samnites but even the Romans were deceived, and the consul endorsed the mistake by shouting to his front rank so that the enemy could hear: <q direct="unspecified">Cominium has fallen, my victorious colleague is coming on the field, do your best to win the victory before the glory of doing so falls to the other army!</q>
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> He rode along while saying this, and commanded the tribunes and centurions to open their ranks to allow passage for the cavalry. He had previously told Trebonius and Caedicius that when they saw him brandish his spear aloft they should launch the cavalry against the enemy with all the force they could.
						<milestone unit="section" n="9"/> His orders were carried out to the letter; the legionaries opened their ranks, the cavalry galloped through the open spaces, and with levelled spears charged the enemy's centre. Wherever they attacked they broke the ranks. Volumnius and Scipio followed up the cavalry charge and completed the discomfiture of the Samnites At last the dread of gods and men had yielded to a greater terror, the <q direct="unspecified">linen cohorts</q> were routed;
						<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> those who had taken the oath and those who had not alike fled; the only thing they feared now was the enemy.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The bulk of the infantry who survived the actual battle were driven either into their camp or to Aquilonia, the nobility and cavalry fled to Bovianum. The cavalry were pursued by cavalry, the infantry by infantry; the wings of the Roman army separated, the right directed its course towards the Samnite camp, the left to the city of Aquilonia. The first success fell to Volumnius, who captured the Samnite camp.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Scipio met with a more sustained resistance at the city, not because the defeated foe showed more courage there, but because stone walls are more difficult to surmount than the rampart of a camp. They drove the defenders from their wails with showers of stones.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> Scipio saw that unless his task was completed before the enemy had time to recover from their panic, an attack on a fortified city would be a somewhat slow affair. He asked his men whether they would be content to allow the enemy's camp to be captured by the other army, whilst they themselves after their victory were repulsed from the gates of the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> There was a universal shout of <q direct="unspecified">No!</q> On hearing this he held his shield above his head and ran to the gate, the men followed his example, and roofing themselves with their shields burst through into the city.<note anchored="yes" n="17" resp="ed">This evolution was frequently practised. The shield (<foreign lang="la">scutum</foreign>) of the Roman legionary was a ponderous arrangement of stout planks, convex on the outside, about 4 ft. long and 21/2 broad. In forming the shield roof they held their shields horizontally over thier heads, of course on the left arm, and as the shields were broad enough to touch each other, the appearance was that of a roof of gigantic tiles. This was called by the Romans a <foreign lang="la">testudo</foreign> (tortoise shell) and was frequently used as a protection for storming parties.</note> They dislodged the Samnites from the walls on either side of the gate, but as they were only a small body did not venture to penetrate into the interior of the city.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="42"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The consul was at first unaware of what was going on, and was anxious to recall his troops, for the sun was now rapidly sinking and the approaching night was making every place suspicious and dangerous, even for victorious troops.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> After he had ridden forward some distance he saw that the camp on his right hand had been captured, and he heard at the same time the mingled clamour of shouts and groans arising in the direction of the city on his left; just then the fighting at the gate was going on.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> As he approached more closely he saw his men on the walls and recognised that the position was no longer doubtful, since by the reckless daring of a few the opportunity for a brilliant success had been won. He at once ordered the troops whom he had recalled to be brought up and prepared for a regular attack on the city.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Those who were within bivouacked near the gate as night was approaching, and during the night the place was evacuated by the enemy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> The Samnite losses during the day amounted to 20,340 killed and 3870 made prisoners, whilst 97 standards were taken.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> It is noticed in the histories that hardly any other general ever appeared in such high spirits during the battle, either owing to his fearless temperament or to the confidence he felt in his final success.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was this dauntless and resolute character which prevented him from abandoning all idea of fighting when the omens were challenged. It was this, too, that made him in the very crisis of the struggle, at the moment when it is customary to vow temples to the gods, make a vow to Jupiter Victor that if he routed the legions of the enemy he would offer him a cup of sweetened wine before he drank anything stronger himself. This vow was acceptable to the gods and they changed the omens into favourable ones.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="43"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Capture of Cominium.</note> same good fortune attended the other consul at Cominium. At the approach of daylight he brought his whole force up to the walls so as to enclose the city with a ring of steel, and stationed strong bodies of troops before the gates to prevent any sortie from being made.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> Just as he was giving the signal for assault the alarming message reached him from his colleague about the 20 cohorts. This delayed the attack and necessitated the recall of a portion of his troops, who were ready and eager to begin the storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> He ordered D. Brutus Scaeva, one of his staff, to intercept the hostile reinforcements with the first legion and ten auxiliary cohorts with their complement of cavalry.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Wherever he fell in with them he was to hold them and stop their advance; if circumstances should make it necessary he was to offer them battle; in any case he was to prevent those troops from reaching Cominium.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then he went on with his preparations for the assault. Orders were issued for scaling ladders to be reared against the walls in all directions and an approach made to the gates under a shield roof. Simultaneously with the smashing in of the gates the storming parties clambered up on the walls on every side.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> Until they saw their enemy actually on the walls the Samnites had sufficient courage to try to keep them from approaching the city, but when they had to fight not by discharging their missiles from a distance, but at close quarters, when those who had forced their way on to the walls and overcome the disadvantage of being on lower ground were fighting on even terms
					<milestone unit="section" n="7??"/> with an enemy who was no match for them, the defenders abandoned their walls and towers and were driven back into the forum.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Here they made a desperate effort to retrieve their fortune, but after a brief struggle they threw down their arms and 11,400 men surrendered after losing 4880 killed.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Thus matters went at Cominium as they had gone at Aquilonia.</p> <p>In the country between these two cities, where a third battle was expected, nothing was seen of the 20 cohorts. When they were still seven miles from Cominium they were recalled by their comrades, and so did not come in for either battle.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Just as twilight was setting in, when they had reached a spot from which their camp and Aquilonia were both visible, a noise of shouting from both quarters made them call a halt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> Then in the direction of their camp, which had been set on fire by the Romans, flames sheeting up far and wide, a more certain indication of disaster, stopped them from going any further.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> They threw themselves down just where they were under arms, and passed a restless night waiting for and dreading the day.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> When it began to grew light, whilst they were still uncertain what direction to take, they were espied by the cavalry who had gone in pursuit of the Samnites in their nocturnal retreat from Aquilonia. The whole body were plainly discernible, with no entrenchments to protect them, no outposts on guard.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> They were visible, too, from the walls of the city, and in a short time the legionary cohorts were on their track. Thev made a hasty flight, and the infantry were unable to come up with them, but some 280 in the extreme rear were cut down by the cavalry. A great quantity of arms and 22 standards were left hehind in their hurry to escape.
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/> The other body who had escaped from Aquilenia reached Bovianum in comparative safety, considering the confusion which marked their retreat.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="44"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The rejoicings in each of the Roman armies were all the greater because of the success achieved by the other. The consuls, by mutual agreement, gave up the captured cities to be sacked by the soldiery.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> When they had cleared out the houses they set them on lire and in one day Aquilonia and Cominium were burnt to the ground. Amidst their own mutual congratulations and those of their soldiers, the consuls united their camps.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> In the presence of the two armies rewards and decorations were bestowed by both Carvilius and Papirius. Papirius had seen his men through many different actions in the open field, around their camp, under city walls, and the rewards he bestowed were well merited. Spurius Nautius, Spurius Papirius, his nephew, four centurions, and a maniple of hastati all received golden bracelets and crowns.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Sp. Nautius won his for his success in the manoeuvre by which he frightened the enemy with the appearance of a large army; the young Papirius owed his reward to the work he did with his cavalry in the battle and in the following night, when he harassed the retreat of the Samnites from Aquilonia;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> the centurions and men of the maniple were rewarded for having been the first to seize the gate and wall of the city. All the cavalry were presented with ornaments for their helmets and silver bracelets as rewards for their brilliant work in various localities.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Subsequently a council of war was held to settle whether the time had come for withdrawing both armies from Samnium, or, at all events, one of them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was thought best to continue the war, and to carry it on more and more ruthlessly in proportion as the Samnites became weaker, in order that they might hand over to the consuls who succeeded them a thoroughly subdued nation.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> As the enemy had now no army in a condition to fight in the open field, the war could only be carried on by attacking their cities, and the sack of those which they captured would enrich the soldiers, whilst the enemy, compelled to fight for their hearths and homes, would gradually become exhausted.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In pursuance of this plan the consuls sent despatches to Rome giving an account of their operations and then separated, Papirius marching to Saepinum, whilst Carvilius led his legions to the assault on Velia.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="45"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The contents of these despatches were listened to with every manifestation of delight, both in the senate and in the Assembly.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> A four days' thanksgiving was appointed as an expression of the public joy, and festal observances were kept up in every house.</p> <p>These successes were not only of great importance in themselves, but they came most opportunely for Rome, as it so happened that at that very time information was received that Etruria had again commenced hostilities.
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The question naturally occurred to people's minds, how would it have been possible to withstand Etruria if any reverse had been met with in Samnium? The Etruscans, acting upon a secret understanding with the Samnites, had seized the moment when both consuls and the whole force of Rome were employed against Samnium as a favourable opportunity for recommencing war.
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> Embassies from the allied states were introduced by M. Atilius the praetor into the senate and complained of the ravaging and burning of their fields by their Etruscan neighbours because they would not revolt from Rome.
						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> They appealed to the senate to protect them from the outrageous violence of their common foe, and were told in reply that the senate would see to it that their allies had no cause to regret their fidelity, and that the day was near when the Etruscans would be in the same
						<milestone unit="section" n="6??"/> position as the Samnites</p><p>Still, the senate would have been somewhat dilatory in dealing with the Etruscan question had not intelligence come to hand that even the Faliscans, who had for many years been on terms of friendship with Rome, had now made common cause with the Etruscans.
							<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> The proximity of this city to Rome made the senate take a more serious view of the position, and they decided to send the fetials to demand redress.
							<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> Satisfaction was refused, and by order of the people with the sanction of the senate war was formally declared against the Faliscans. The consuls were ordered to decide by lot which of them should transport his army from Samnium into Etruria.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>By this time Carvilius had taken from the Samnites three of their cities, Velia, Palumbinum, and Herculaneum. Velia he took after a few days' siege, Palumbinum on the day he arrived before its walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/> Herculaneum gave him more trouble; after an indecisive battle in which, however, his losses were somewhat the heavier he moved his camp close up to the town and shut up the enemy within their walls.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> The place was then stormed and captured. In these three captures the number of killed and prisoners amounted to 10,000, the prisoners forming a small majority of the total loss.</p> <p>On the consuls casting lots for their respective commands, Etruria fell to Carvilius, much to the satisfaction of his men, who were now unable to stand the intense cold of Samnium.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Papirius met with more resistance at Saepinum. There were frequent encounters, in the open field, on the march, and round the city itself when he was checking the sorties of the enemy. There was no question of siege operations, the enemy met him on equal terms, for the Samnites protected their walls with their arms quite as much as their walls protected them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> At last by dint of hard fighting he compelled the enemy to submit to a regular siege, and after pressing the siege with spade and sword he finally effected the capture of the place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> The victors were exasperated by the obstinate resistance, and the Samnites suffered heavily, losing no less than 7400 killed, while only 3000 were made prisoners. Owing to the Samnites having stored their property in a limited number of cities there was a vast amount of plunder, the whole of which was given to the soldiery.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="46"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Everything<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Papirius celebrates his Triumph.</note> was now deep in snow, and it was impossible to remain any longer in the open, so the consul withdrew his army from Samnium.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> On his approach to Rome a triumph was granted to him by universal consent. This triumph, which he celebrated while still in office, was a very brilliant one for those days.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/> The infantry and cavalry who marched in the procession were conspicuous with their decorations, many were wearing civic, mural, and vallarian crowns.<note anchored="yes" n="18" resp="ed">The <foreign lang="la">corona civica</foreign> (made of oak leaves) was awarded to the soldier who had saved a comrade's life in battle; the <foreign lang="la">corona muralis</foreign> to him who first entered the breach in storming a town; the <foreign lang="la">corona vallaris</foreign> was given to the man who first scaled the rampart in assaulting an enemy's camp.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> The spoils of the Samnites attracted much attention; their splendour and beauty were compared with those which the consul's father had won, and which were familiar to all through their being used as decorations of public places Amongst those in the victor's train were some prisoners of high rank distinguished for their own or their fathers' military services;
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/> there were also carried in the procession 2,533,000 bronze <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>, stated to be the proceeds of the sale of the prisoners, and <date value="1830">1830</date> pounds of silver taken from the cities. All the silver and bronze was stored in the treasury, none of this was given to the soldiers.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/> This created dissatisfaction amongst the plebs, which was aggravated by the collection of the war tax to provide the soldiers' pay, for if Papirius had not been so anxious to get the credit of paying the price of the prisoners into the treasury there would have been enough to make a gift to the soldiers and also to furnish their pay.</p> <p>He dedicated the temple of Quirinus.
						<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> I do not find in any ancient author that it was he who vowed this temple in the crisis of a battle, and certainly he could not have completed it in so short a time; it was vowed by his father when Dictator, and the son dedicated it when consul, and adorned it with the spoils of the enemy.
						<milestone unit="section" n="8"/> There was such a vast quantity of these that not only were the temple and the Forum adorned with them, but they were distributed amongst the allied peoples and the nearest colonies to decorate their public spaces and temples.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>After his triumph Papirius led his army into the neighbourhood of Vescia, as that district was still infested by the Samnites, and there he wintered.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>During<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Carvilius' Successes and Triumph.</note> this time Carvilius was making preparations to attack Troilum in Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/> He allowed 470 of its wealthiest citizens to leave the place after they had paid an enormous sum by way of ransom; the town with the rest of its population he took by storm.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/> Going on from there he carried five forts, positions of great natural strength. In these actions the enemy lost 2400 killed and 2000 prisoners. The Faliscans sued for peace, and he granted them a truce for one year on condition of their supplying a year's pay to his troops, and an indemnity of 100,000 <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign> of bronze coinage.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/> After these successes he went home to enjoy his triumph, a triumph less illustrious than his colleague's in regard of the Samnite campaign, but fully equal to it considering his series of successes in Etruria.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/> He brought into the treasury 380,000 <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign> out of the proceeds of the war, the rest he disposed of partly in contracting for the building of a temple to Fortis Fortuna, near the temple of that
					<milestone unit="section" n="15??"/> deity, which King Servius Tullius had dedicated, and partly as a donative to the soldiers, each legionary receiving 102 <foreign lang="la">ases</foreign>, the centurions and cavalry twice as much. This gift was all the more acceptable to the men after the niggardliness of his colleague.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>L. Postumius, one of his staff, was indicted before the people, but was protected by the consul's popularity. His prosecutor was M. Scantius, a tribune of the plebs, and the report was that he had evaded trial by being made a staff-officer, proceedings, therefore, could only be threatened without being carried out.</p> 
				<milestone unit="chapter" n="47"/>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The<note anchored="yes" type="sum" resp="ed">Various Notices.</note> year having now expired, new plebeian tribunes entered upon office, but there was a flaw in their election, and five days later others took their place.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/> The lustrum was closed this year by the censors, P. Cornelius Arvina and C. Marcius Rutilus. The census returns gave the population as numbering 262,321 . These were the twenty-sixth pair of censors since the first, the lustrum was the nineteenth.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This year, for the first time, those who had been crowned for their deeds in war were allowed to wear their decorations at the Roman Games, and then, too, for the first time, palms were given to the victors after a custom borrowed from Greece.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This year also the road from the temple of Mars to Bovillae was paved throughout its length by the curule aediles, who devoted to the purpose the fines levied on cattle-breeders.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>L. Papirius conducted the consular elections. The consuls elected were Q. Fabius Gurgites, the son of Maximus, and D. Junius Brutus Scaeva. Papirius himself was made praetor.</p> 
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The many incidents which helped to make the year a happy one served to console the citizens for one calamity, a pestilence which raged in the City and country districts alike. The mischief it did was looked upon as a portent. The Sacred Books were consulted to see what end or what remedy would be vouchsafed by the gods.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/> It was ascertained that Aesculapius must be sent for from Epidaurus. Nothing, however, was done that year, owing to the consuls being engrossed with the war, beyond the appointment of a day of public intercession to Aesculapius.</p>
