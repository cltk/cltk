<l n="tr">Than thy full meed of heaven: be what thou wilt&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">For neither Tartarus hopes to call thee king,</l>

<l n="tr">My bold endeavour, and pitying, even as I,</l>

<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="43" unit="card"/>In early spring-tide, when the icy drip</l>
<l n="tr">Melts from the mountains hoar, and Zephyr's breath</l>
<l n="tr">Unbinds the crumbling clod, even then 'tis time;</l>
<l n="tr">Press deep your plough behind the groaning ox,</l>
<l n="tr">And teach the furrow-burnished share to shine.</l>
<l n="tr">That land the craving farmer's prayer fulfils,</l>
<l n="tr">Which twice the sunshine, twice the frost has felt;</l>
<l n="tr">Ay, that's the land whose boundless harvest-crops</l>

<l n="tr">The winds and varying temper of the sky,</l>
<l n="tr">The lineal tilth and habits of the spot,</l>
<l n="tr">What every region yields, and what denies.</l>
<l n="tr">Here blithelier springs the corn, and here the grape,</l>
<l n="tr">There earth is green with tender growth of trees</l>
<l n="tr">And grass unbidden. See how from Tmolus comes</l>
<l n="tr">The saffron's fragrance, ivory from Ind,</l>

<l n="tr">And such the laws by Nature's hand imposed</l>
<l n="tr">On clime and clime, e'er since the primal dawn</l>
<l n="tr">When old Deucalion on the unpeopled earth</l>
<l n="tr">Cast stones, whence men, a flinty race, were reared.</l>
<l n="tr">Up then! if fat the soil, let sturdy bulls</l>
<l n="tr">Upturn it from the year's first opening months,</l>
<l n="tr">And let the clods lie bare till baked to dust</l>
<l n="tr">By the ripe suns of summer; but if the earth</l>
<l n="tr">Less fruitful just ere Arcturus rise</l>
<l n="tr">With shallower trench uptilt it&mdash;'twill suffice;</l>
<l n="tr">There, lest weeds choke the crop's luxuriance, here,</l>
<l n="tr">Lest the scant moisture fail the barren sand.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="71" unit="card"/>Then thou shalt suffer in alternate years</l>
<l n="tr">The new-reaped fields to rest, and on the plain</l>
<l n="tr">A crust of sloth to harden; or, when stars</l>
<l n="tr">Are changed in heaven, there sow the golden grain</l>
<l n="tr">Where erst, luxuriant with its quivering pod,</l>
<l n="tr">Pulse, or the slender vetch-crop, thou hast cleared,</l>
<l n="tr">And lupin sour, whose brittle stalks arise,</l>
<l n="tr">A hurtling forest. For the plain is parched</l>
<l n="tr">By flax-crop, parched by oats, by poppies parched</l>
<l n="tr">In Lethe-slumber drenched. Nathless by change</l>
<l n="tr">The travailing earth is lightened, but stint not</l>
<l n="tr">With refuse rich to soak the thirsty soil,</l>
<l n="tr">And shower foul ashes o'er the exhausted fields.</l>
<l n="tr">Thus by rotation like repose is gained,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor earth meanwhile uneared and thankless left.</l>
<l n="tr">Oft, too, 'twill boot to fire the naked fields,</l>
<l n="tr">And the light stubble burn with crackling flames;</l>
<l n="tr">Whether that earth therefrom some hidden strength</l>
<l n="tr">And fattening food derives, or that the fire</l>
<l n="tr">Bakes every blemish out, and sweats away</l>
<l n="tr">Each useless humour, or that the heat unlocks</l>
<l n="tr">New passages and secret pores, whereby</l>
<l n="tr">Their life-juice to the tender blades may win;</l>
<l n="tr">Or that it hardens more and helps to bind</l>
<l n="tr">The gaping veins, lest penetrating showers,</l>
<l n="tr">Or fierce sun's ravening might, or searching blast</l>
<l n="tr">Of the keen north should sear them. Well, I wot,</l>
<l n="tr">He serves the fields who with his harrow breaks</l>
<l n="tr">The sluggish clods, and hurdles osier-twined</l>
<l n="tr">Hales o'er them; from the far Olympian height</l>
<l n="tr">Him golden Ceres not in vain regards;</l>
<l n="tr">And he, who having ploughed the fallow plain</l>
<l n="tr">And heaved its furrowy ridges, turns once more</l>
<l n="tr">Cross-wise his shattering share, with stroke on stroke</l>
<l n="tr">The earth assails, and makes the field his thrall.</l>
<l n="tr"> Pray for wet summers and for winters fine,</l>
<l n="tr">Ye husbandmen; in winter's dust the crops</l>
<l n="tr">Exceedingly rejoice, the field hath joy;</l>
<l n="tr">No tilth makes <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName> lift her head so high,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor Gargarus his own harvests so admire.</l>
<l n="tr">Why tell of him, who, having launched his seed,</l>
<l n="tr">Sets on for close encounter, and rakes smooth</l>
<l n="tr">The dry dust hillocks, then on the tender corn</l>
<l n="tr">Lets in the flood, whose waters follow fain;</l>
<l n="tr">And when the parched field quivers, and all the blades</l>
<l n="tr">Are dying, from the brow of its hill-bed,</l>
<l n="tr">See! see! he lures the runnel; down it falls,</l>
<l n="tr">Waking hoarse murmurs o'er the polished stones,</l>
<l n="tr">And with its bubblings slakes the thirsty fields?</l>
<l n="tr">Or why of him, who lest the heavy ears</l>
<l n="tr">O'erweigh the stalk, while yet in tender blade</l>
<l n="tr">Feeds down the crop's luxuriance, when its growth</l>
<l n="tr">First tops the furrows? Why of him who drains</l>
<l n="tr">The marsh-land's gathered ooze through soaking sand,</l>
<l n="tr">Chiefly what time in treacherous moons a stream</l>
<l n="tr">Goes out in spate, and with its coat of slime</l>
<l n="tr">Holds all the country, whence the hollow dykes</l>
<l n="tr">Sweat steaming vapour?<milestone ed="p" n="118" unit="card"/>But no whit the more</l>
<l n="tr">For all expedients tried and travail borne</l>
<l n="tr">By man and beast in turning oft the soil,</l>
<l n="tr">Do greedy goose and Strymon-haunting cranes</l>
<l n="tr">And succory's bitter fibres cease to harm,</l>
<l n="tr">Or shade not injure. The great Sire himself</l>
<l n="tr">No easy road to husbandry assigned,</l>
<l n="tr">And first was he by human skill to rouse</l>
<l n="tr">The slumbering glebe, whetting the minds of men</l>
<l n="tr">With care on care, nor suffering realm of his</l>
<l n="tr">In drowsy sloth to stagnate. Before Jove</l>
<l n="tr">Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen;</l>
<l n="tr">To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">Even this was impious; for the common stock</l>
<l n="tr">They gathered, and the earth of her own will</l>
<l n="tr">All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.</l>
<l n="tr">He to black serpents gave their venom-bane,</l>
<l n="tr">And bade the wolf go prowl, and ocean toss;</l>
<l n="tr">Shooed from the leaves their honey, put fire away,</l>
<l n="tr">And curbed the random rivers running wine,</l>
<l n="tr">That use by gradual dint of thought on thought</l>
<l n="tr">Might forge the various arts, with furrow's help</l>
<l n="tr">The corn-blade win, and strike out hidden fire</l>
<l n="tr">From the flint's heart. Then first the streams were ware</l>
<l n="tr">Of hollowed alder-hulls: the sailor then</l>
<l n="tr">Their names and numbers gave to star and star,</l>
<l n="tr">Pleiads and Hyads, and Lycaon's child</l>
<l n="tr">Bright Arctos; how with nooses then was found</l>
<l n="tr">To catch wild beasts, and cozen them with lime,</l>
<l n="tr">And hem with hounds the mighty forest-glades.</l>
<l n="tr">Soon one with hand-net scourges the broad stream,</l>
<l n="tr">Probing its depths, one drags his dripping toils</l>
<l n="tr">Along the main; then iron's unbending might,</l>
<l n="tr">And shrieking saw-blade,&mdash;for the men of old</l>
<l n="tr">With wedges wont to cleave the splintering log;&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">Then divers arts arose; toil conquered all,</l>
<l n="tr">Remorseless toil, and poverty's shrewd push</l>
<l n="tr">In times of hardship. Ceres was the first</l>
<l n="tr">Set mortals on with tools to turn the sod,</l>
<l n="tr">When now the awful groves 'gan fail to bear</l>
<l n="tr">Acorns and arbutes, and her wonted food</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> gave no more. Soon, too, the corn</l>
<l n="tr">Gat sorrow's increase, that an evil blight</l>
<l n="tr">Ate up the stalks, and thistle reared his spines</l>
<l n="tr">An idler in the fields; the crops die down;</l>
<l n="tr">Upsprings instead a shaggy growth of burrs</l>
<l n="tr">And caltrops; and amid the corn-fields trim</l>
<l n="tr">Unfruitful darnel and wild oats have sway.</l>
<l n="tr">Wherefore, unless thou shalt with ceaseless rake</l>
<l n="tr">The weeds pursue, with shouting scare the birds,</l>
<l n="tr">Prune with thy hook the dark field's matted shade,</l>
<l n="tr">Pray down the showers, all vainly thou shalt eye,</l>
<l n="tr">Alack! thy neighbour's heaped-up harvest-mow,</l>
<l n="tr">And in the greenwood from a shaken oak</l>
<l n="tr">Seek solace for thine hunger.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="card"/>Now to tell</l>
<l n="tr">The sturdy rustics' weapons, what they are,</l>
<l n="tr">Without which, neither can be sown nor reared</l>
<l n="tr">The fruits of harvest; first the bent plough's share</l>
<l n="tr">And heavy timber, and slow-lumbering wains</l>
<l n="tr">Of the Eleusinian mother, threshing-sleighs</l>
<l n="tr">And drags, and harrows with their crushing weight;</l>
<l n="tr">Then the cheap wicker-ware of Celeus old,</l>
<l n="tr">Hurdles of arbute, and thy mystic fan,</l>
<l n="tr">Iacchus; which, full tale, long ere the time</l>
<l n="tr">Thou must with heed lay by, if thee await</l>
<l n="tr">Not all unearned the country's crown divine.</l>
<l n="tr">While yet within the woods, the elm is tamed</l>
<l n="tr">And bowed with mighty force to form the stock,</l>
<l n="tr">And take the plough's curved shape, then nigh the root</l>
<l n="tr">A pole eight feet projecting, earth-boards twain,</l>
<l n="tr">And share-beam with its double back they fix.</l>
<l n="tr">For yoke is early hewn a linden light,</l>
<l n="tr">And a tall beech for handle, from behind</l>
<l n="tr">To turn the car at lowest: then o'er the hearth</l>
<l n="tr">The wood they hang till the smoke knows it well.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="176" unit="card"/>Many the precepts of the men of old</l>
<l n="tr">I can recount thee, so thou start not back,</l>
<l n="tr">And such slight cares to learn not weary thee.</l>
<l n="tr">And this among the first: thy threshing-floor</l>
<l n="tr">With ponderous roller must be levelled smooth,</l>
<l n="tr">And wrought by hand, and fixed with binding chalk,</l>
<l n="tr">Lest weeds arise, or dust a passage win</l>
<l n="tr">Splitting the surface, then a thousand plagues</l>
<l n="tr">Make sport of it: oft builds the tiny mouse</l>
<l n="tr">Her home, and plants her granary, underground,</l>
<l n="tr">Or burrow for their bed the purblind moles,</l>
<l n="tr">Or toad is found in hollows, and all the swarm</l>
<l n="tr">Of earth's unsightly creatures; or a huge</l>
<l n="tr">Corn-heap the weevil plunders, and the ant,</l>
<l n="tr">Fearful of coming age and penury.</l>
<l n="tr">Mark too, what time the walnut in the woods</l>
<l n="tr">With ample bloom shall clothe her, and bow down</l>
<l n="tr">Her odorous branches, if the fruit prevail,</l>
<l n="tr">Like store of grain will follow, and there shall come</l>
<l n="tr">A mighty winnowing-time with mighty heat;</l>
<l n="tr">But if the shade with wealth of leaves abound,</l>
<l n="tr">Vainly your threshing-floor will bruise the stalks</l>
<l n="tr">Rich but in chaff. Many myself have seen</l>
<l n="tr">Steep, as they sow, their pulse-seeds, drenching them</l>
<l n="tr">With nitre and black oil-lees, that the fruit</l>
<l n="tr">Might swell within the treacherous pods, and they</l>
<l n="tr">Make speed to boil at howso small a fire.</l>
<l n="tr">Yet, culled with caution, proved with patient toil,</l>
<l n="tr">These have I seen degenerate, did not man</l>
<l n="tr">Put forth his hand with power, and year by year</l>
<l n="tr">Choose out the largest. So, by fate impelled,</l>
<l n="tr">Speed all things to the worse, and backward borne</l>
<l n="tr">Glide from us; even as who with struggling oars</l>
<l n="tr">Up stream scarce pulls a shallop, if he chance</l>
<l n="tr">His arms to slacken, lo! with headlong force</l>
<l n="tr">The current sweeps him down the hurrying tide.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="204" unit="card"/>Us too behoves Arcturus' sign observe,</l>
<l n="tr">And the Kids' seasons and the shining Snake,</l>
<l n="tr">No less than those who o'er the windy main</l>
<l n="tr">Borne homeward tempt the Pontic, and the jaws</l>
<l n="tr">Of oyster-rife <placeName key="perseus,Abydos,Mysia">Abydos</placeName>. When the Scales</l>
<l n="tr">Now poising fair the hours of sleep and day</l>
<l n="tr">Give half the world to sunshine, half to shade,</l>
<l n="tr">Then urge your bulls, my masters; sow the plain</l>
<l n="tr">Even to the verge of tameless winter's showers</l>
<l n="tr">With barley: then, too, time it is to hide</l>
<l n="tr">Your flax in earth, and poppy, Ceres' joy,</l>
<l n="tr">Aye, more than time to bend above the plough,</l>
<l n="tr">While earth, yet dry, forbids not, and the clouds</l>
<l n="tr">Are buoyant. With the spring comes bean-sowing;</l>
<l n="tr">Thee, too, Lucerne, the crumbling furrows then</l>
<l n="tr">Receive, and millet's annual care returns,</l>
<l n="tr">What time the white bull with his gilded horns</l>
<l n="tr">Opens the year, before whose threatening front,</l>

<l n="tr">Or haste thee to entrust the whole year's hope</l>
<l n="tr">To earth that would not. Many have begun</l>
<l n="tr">Ere Maia's star be setting; these, I trow,</l>
<l n="tr">Their looked-for harvest fools with empty ears.</l>
<l n="tr">But if the vetch and common kidney-bean</l>

<l n="tr">Pelusiac lentil, no uncertain sign</l>

<l n="tr">Then divers forms and bestial semblances</l>
<l n="tr">Shall mock thy grasp; for sudden he will change</l>
<l n="tr">To bristly boar, fell tigress, dragon scaled,</l>
<l n="tr">And tawny-tufted lioness, or send forth</l>
<l n="tr">A crackling sound of fire, and so shake of</l>
<l n="tr">The fetters, or in showery drops anon</l>
<l n="tr">Dissolve and vanish. But the more he shifts</l>
<l n="tr">His endless transformations, thou, my son,</l>
<l n="tr">More straitlier clench the clinging bands, until</l>
<l n="tr">His body's shape return to that thou sawest,</l>
<l n="tr">When with closed eyelids first he sank to sleep.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="card"/>So saying, an odour of ambrosial dew</l>
<l n="tr">She sheds around, and all his frame therewith</l>
<l n="tr">Steeps throughly; forth from his trim-combed locks</l>
<l n="tr">Breathed effluence sweet, and a lithe vigour leapt</l>
<l n="tr">Into his limbs. There is a cavern vast</l>
<l n="tr">Scooped in the mountain-side, where wave on wave</l>
<l n="tr">By the wind's stress is driven, and breaks far up</l>
<l n="tr">Its inmost creeks&mdash;safe anchorage from of old</l>
<l n="tr">For tempest-taken mariners: therewithin,</l>
<l n="tr">Behind a rock's huge barrier, Proteus hides.</l>
<l n="tr">Here in close covert out of the sun's eye</l>
<l n="tr">The youth she places, and herself the while</l>
<l n="tr">Swathed in a shadowy mist stands far aloof.</l>
<l n="tr">And now the ravening dog-star that burns up</l>
<l n="tr">The thirsty Indians blazed in heaven; his course</l>
<l n="tr">The fiery sun had half devoured: the blades</l>
<l n="tr">Were parched, and the void streams with droughty jaws</l>
<l n="tr">Baked to their mud-beds by the scorching ray,</l>
<l n="tr">When Proteus seeking his accustomed cave</l>
<l n="tr">Strode from the billows: round him frolicking</l>
<l n="tr">The watery folk that people the waste sea</l>
<l n="tr">Sprinkled the bitter brine-dew far and wide.</l>
<l n="tr">Along the shore in scattered groups to feed</l>
<l n="tr">The sea-calves stretch them: while the seer himself,</l>
<l n="tr">Like herdsman on the hills when evening bids</l>
<l n="tr">The steers from pasture to their stall repair,</l>
<l n="tr">And the lambs' bleating whets the listening wolves,</l>
<l n="tr">Sits midmost on the rock and tells his tale.</l>
<l n="tr">But Aristaeus, the foe within his clutch,</l>
<l n="tr">Scarce suffering him compose his aged limbs,</l>
<l n="tr">With a great cry leapt on him, and ere he rose</l>
<l n="tr">Forestalled him with the fetters; he nathless,</l>
<l n="tr">All unforgetful of his ancient craft,</l>
<l n="tr">Transforms himself to every wondrous thing,</l>
<l n="tr">Fire and a fearful beast, and flowing stream.</l>
<l n="tr">But when no trickery found a path for flight,</l>
<l n="tr">Baffled at length, to his own shape returned,</l>
<l n="tr">With human lips he spake, &ldquo;Who bade thee, then,</l>
<l n="tr">So reckless in youth's hardihood, affront</l>
<l n="tr">Our portals? or what wouldst thou hence?&rdquo;&mdash;But he,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Proteus, thou knowest, of thine own heart thou knowest;</l>
<l n="tr">For thee there is no cheating, but cease thou</l>
<l n="tr">To practise upon me: at heaven's behest</l>
<l n="tr">I for my fainting fortunes hither come</l>
<l n="tr">An oracle to ask thee.&rdquo; There he ceased.</l>
<l n="tr">Whereat the seer, by stubborn force constrained,</l>
<l n="tr">Shot forth the grey light of his gleaming eyes</l>
<l n="tr">Upon him, and with fiercely gnashing teeth</l>
<l n="tr">Unlocks his lips to spell the fates of heaven:</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="453" unit="card"/>&ldquo;Doubt not 'tis wrath divine that plagues thee thus,</l>
<l n="tr">Nor light the debt thou payest; 'tis Orpheus' self,</l>
<l n="tr">Orpheus unhappy by no fault of his,</l>
<l n="tr">So fates prevent not, fans thy penal fires,</l>
<l n="tr">Yet madly raging for his ravished bride.</l>
<l n="tr">She in her haste to shun thy hot pursuit</l>
<l n="tr">Along the stream, saw not the coming death,</l>
<l n="tr">Where at her feet kept ward upon the bank</l>
<l n="tr">In the tall grass a monstrous water-snake.</l>
<l n="tr">But with their cries the Dryad-band her peers</l>
<l n="tr">Filled up the mountains to their proudest peaks:</l>
<l n="tr">Wailed for her fate the heights of <placeName key="tgn,7002754">Rhodope</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">And tall Pangaea, and, beloved of Mars,</l>
<l n="tr">The land that bowed to Rhesus, <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> no less</l>
<l n="tr">With <placeName key="tgn,7002660">Hebrus</placeName>' stream; and Orithyia wept,</l>
<l n="tr">Daughter of Acte old. But Orpheus' self,</l>
<l n="tr">Soothing his love-pain with the hollow shell,</l>
<l n="tr">Thee his sweet wife on the lone shore alone,</l>
<l n="tr">Thee when day dawned and when it died he sang.</l>
<l n="tr">Nay to the jaws of Taenarus too he came,</l>
<l n="tr">Of Dis the infernal palace, and the grove</l>
<l n="tr">Grim with a horror of great darkness&mdash;came,</l>
<l n="tr">Entered, and faced the Manes and the King</l>
<l n="tr">Of terrors, the stone heart no prayer can tame.</l>
<l n="tr">Then from the deepest deeps of Erebus,</l>
<l n="tr">Wrung by his minstrelsy, the hollow shades</l>
<l n="tr">Came trooping, ghostly semblances of forms</l>
<l n="tr">Lost to the light, as birds by myriads hie</l>
<l n="tr">To greenwood boughs for cover, when twilight-hour</l>
<l n="tr">Or storms of winter chase them from the hills;</l>
<l n="tr">Matrons and men, and great heroic frames</l>
<l n="tr">Done with life's service, boys, unwedded girls,</l>
<l n="tr">Youths placed on pyre before their fathers' eyes.</l>
<l n="tr">Round them, with black slime choked and hideous weed,</l>
<l n="tr">Cocytus winds; there lies the unlovely swamp</l>
<l n="tr">Of dull dead water, and, to pen them fast,</l>
<l n="tr">Styx with her ninefold barrier poured between.</l>
<l n="tr">Nay, even the deep Tartarean Halls of death</l>
<l n="tr">Stood lost in wonderment, and the Eumenides,</l>
<l n="tr">Their brows with livid locks of serpents twined;</l>
<l n="tr">Even Cerberus held his triple jaws agape,</l>
<l n="tr">And, the wind hushed, Ixion's wheel stood still.</l>
<l n="tr">And now with homeward footstep he had passed</l>
<l n="tr">All perils scathless, and, at length restored,</l>
<l n="tr">Eurydice to realms of upper air</l>
<l n="tr">Had well-nigh won, behind him following&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">So Proserpine had ruled it&mdash;when his heart</l>
<l n="tr">A sudden mad desire surprised and seized&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">Meet fault to be forgiven, might Hell forgive.</l>
<l n="tr">For at the very threshold of the day,</l>
<l n="tr">Heedless, alas! and vanquished of resolve,</l>
<l n="tr">He stopped, turned, looked upon Eurydice</l>
<l n="tr">His own once more. But even with the look,</l>
<l n="tr">Poured out was all his labour, broken the bond</l>
<l n="tr">Of that fell tyrant, and a crash was heard</l>
<l n="tr">Three times like thunder in the meres of hell.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="494" unit="card"/>&lsquo;Orpheus! what ruin hath thy frenzy wrought</l>
<l n="tr">On me, alas! and thee? Lo! once again</l>
<l n="tr">The unpitying fates recall me, and dark sleep</l>
<l n="tr">Closes my swimming eyes. And now farewell:</l>
<l n="tr">Girt with enormous night I am borne away,</l>
<l n="tr">Outstretching toward thee, thine, alas! no more,</l>
<l n="tr">These helpless hands.&rsquo; She spake, and suddenly,</l>
<l n="tr">Like smoke dissolving into empty air,</l>
<l n="tr">Passed and was sundered from his sight; nor him</l>
<l n="tr">Clutching vain shadows, yearning sore to speak,</l>
<l n="tr">Thenceforth beheld she, nor no second time</l>
<l n="tr">Hell's boatman brooks he pass the watery bar.</l>
<l n="tr">What should he do? fly whither, twice bereaved?</l>
<l n="tr">Move with what tears the Manes, with what voice</l>
<l n="tr">The Powers of darkness? She indeed even now</l>
<l n="tr">Death-cold was floating on the Stygian barge!</l>
<l n="tr">For seven whole months unceasingly, men say,</l>
<l n="tr">Beneath a skyey crag, by thy lone wave,</l>
<l n="tr">Strymon, he wept, and in the caverns chill</l>
<l n="tr">Unrolled his story, melting tigers' hearts,</l>
<l n="tr">And leading with his lay the oaks along.</l>
<l n="tr">As in the poplar-shade a nightingale</l>
<l n="tr">Mourns her lost young, which some relentless swain,</l>
<l n="tr">Spying, from the nest has torn unfledged, but she</l>
<l n="tr">Wails the long night, and perched upon a spray</l>
<l n="tr">With sad insistence pipes her dolorous strain,</l>
<l n="tr">Till all the region with her wrongs o'erflows.</l>
<l n="tr">No love, no new desire, constrained his soul:</l>
<l n="tr">By snow-bound <placeName key="tgn,1123466">Tanais</placeName> and the icy north,</l>
<l n="tr">Far steppes to frost Rhipaean forever wed,</l>
<l n="tr">Alone he wandered, lost Eurydice</l>
<l n="tr">Lamenting, and the gifts of Dis ungiven.</l>
<l n="tr">Scorned by which tribute the Ciconian dames,</l>
<l n="tr">Amid their awful Bacchanalian rites</l>
<l n="tr">And midnight revellings, tore him limb from limb,</l>
<l n="tr">And strewed his fragments over the wide fields.</l>
<l n="tr">Then too, even then, what time the <placeName key="tgn,7002660">Hebrus</placeName> stream,</l>
<l n="tr">Oeagrian Hebrus, down mid-current rolled,</l>
<l n="tr">Rent from the marble neck, his drifting head,</l>
<l n="tr">The death-chilled tongue found yet a voice to cry</l>
<l n="tr">&lsquo;Eurydice! ah! poor Eurydice!&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">With parting breath he called her, and the banks</l>
<l n="tr">From the broad stream caught up &lsquo;Eurydice!&rsquo;&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="528" unit="card"/>So Proteus ending plunged into the deep,</l>
<l n="tr">And, where he plunged, beneath the eddying whirl</l>
<l n="tr">Churned into foam the water, and was gone;</l>
<l n="tr">But not Cyrene, who unquestioned thus</l>
<l n="tr">Bespake the trembling listener: &ldquo;Nay, my son,</l>
<l n="tr">From that sad bosom thou mayst banish care:</l>
<l n="tr">Hence came that plague of sickness, hence the nymphs,</l>
<l n="tr">With whom in the tall woods the dance she wove,</l>
<l n="tr">Wrought on thy bees, alas! this deadly bane.</l>
<l n="tr">Bend thou before the Dell-nymphs, gracious powers:</l>
<l n="tr">Bring gifts, and sue for pardon: they will grant</l>
<l n="tr">Peace to thine asking, and an end of wrath.</l>
<l n="tr">But how to approach them will I first unfold&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">Four chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk,</l>
<l n="tr">That browse to-day the green Lycaean heights,</l>
<l n="tr">Pick from thy herds, as many kine to match,</l>
<l n="tr">Whose necks the yoke pressed never: then for these</l>
<l n="tr">Build up four altars by the lofty fanes,</l>
<l n="tr">And from their throats let gush the victims' blood,</l>
<l n="tr">And in the greenwood leave their bodies lone.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, when the ninth dawn hath displayed its beams,</l>
<l n="tr">To Orpheus shalt thou send his funeral dues,</l>
<l n="tr">Poppies of Lethe, and let slay a sheep</l>
<l n="tr">Coal-black, then seek the grove again, and soon</l>
<l n="tr">For pardon found adore Eurydice</l>
<l n="tr">With a slain calf for victim.&rdquo;<milestone ed="p" n="548" unit="card"/>No delay:</l>
<l n="tr">The self-same hour he hies him forth to do</l>
<l n="tr">His mother's bidding: to the shrine he came,</l>
<l n="tr">The appointed altars reared, and thither led</l>
<l n="tr">Four chosen bulls of peerless form and bulk,</l>
<l n="tr">With kine to match, that never yoke had known;</l>
<l n="tr">Then, when the ninth dawn had led in the day,</l>
<l n="tr">To Orpheus sent his funeral dues, and sought</l>
<l n="tr">The grove once more. But sudden, strange to tell</l>
<l n="tr">A portent they espy: through the oxen's flesh,</l>
<l n="tr">Waxed soft in dissolution, hark! there hum</l>
<l n="tr">Bees from the belly; the rent ribs overboil</l>
<l n="tr">In endless clouds they spread them, till at last</l>
<l n="tr">On yon tree-top together fused they cling,</l>
<l n="tr">And drop their cluster from the bending boughs.</l>
<l n="tr"><milestone ed="p" n="559" unit="card"/>So sang I of the tilth of furrowed fields,</l>
<l n="tr">Of flocks and trees, while Caesar's majesty</l>
<l n="tr">Launched forth the levin-bolts of war by deep</l>
<l n="tr"><placeName key="tgn,1123842">Euphrates</placeName>, and bare rule o'er willing folk</l>
<l n="tr">Though vanquished, and essayed the heights of heaven.</l>
<l n="tr">I Virgil then, of sweet Parthenope</l>
<l n="tr">The nursling, wooed the flowery walks of peace</l>
<l n="tr">Inglorious, who erst trilled for shepherd-wights</l>
