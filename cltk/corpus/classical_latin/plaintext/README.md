There are multiple, overlapping libraries for Latin language support.

- The Packard Humanities Index (PHI), disc #5, is the most comprehensive collection of Classical Latin. It was originally distributed on a CD. Some of the contents of the collection are copyrighted, so you must comile these yourself, using either the corpus compiler (available through <code>from cltk.compiler import Compile</code>). The contents of this disc are also [available online](http://latin.packhum.org/) and downloadable through [this crawler](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/phi5_crawler). Please see (instructions for loading a PHI5 disc into the CLTK)[http://cltk.readthedocs.org/en/latest/classical_latin.html#compile-phi5].

- The 7th PHI disc contains non-literary, documentary Greek and Latin sources. To compile this, see the cltk's Compiler.

- The Latin Library is chronologically expansive, containing an array of texts from Archaic to Neoclassical Latin. The collection available here was imported from the deprecated [Latin Library Toolkit](https://github.com/kylepjohnson/latin_language_toolkit). Everything in the Latin Library is in the public domain.
