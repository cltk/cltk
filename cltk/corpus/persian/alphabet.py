Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən/ or /ˈpɜːrʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi, is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. 
It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies.
It is mostly written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script.
