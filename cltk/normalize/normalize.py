"""The normalizer aims to maximally reduce the variation between the orthography of texts written in the Anglo-Norman dialect
to bring it in line with “orthographe commune”. It is heavily inspired by Pope (1956).
Spelling variation is not consistent enough to ensure the highest accuracy; the normalizer in its current format should
therefore be used as a last resort.


The normalizer, word tokenizer, stemmer, lemmatizer, and list of stopwords for OF/MF were developed as part of Google Summer of Code 2017.

Anglo-French spelling variants normalized to "orthographe commune", from M. K. Pope (1956)

- word-final d - e.g. vertud vs vertu
- use of <u> over <ou>

- <eaus> for <eus>, <ceaus> for <ceus>

- triphtongs:
    - <iu> for <ieu>
    - <u> for <eu>
    - <ie> for <iee>
    - <ue> for <uee>
    - <ure> for <eure>

- "epenthetic vowels" - e.g. averai for avrai

- <eo> for <o>
- <iw>, <ew> for <ieux>

- final <a> for <e>
