"""
The phonology module aims to provide tools that:

- phonetically/phonologically transcribe words of a given language,
- syllabify words.

For some specific languages, there exist, for example, a word stresser
(i.e. a function that gives which syllable is stressed).

These tasks are interesting in themselves for historical linguists or teachers.
They are also essential for more high-level tasks such as prosody analyzers.

Like for all CLTK modules, the phonology module may be extended and improved if a set of features does not suit
your needs because they are insufficient or they do not follow rules you want to test
(agreement on phonology of extinct languages is often weak).
