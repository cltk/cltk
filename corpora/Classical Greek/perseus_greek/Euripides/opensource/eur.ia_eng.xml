<sp n="Agamemnon">
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Leda, the daughter of Thestius, had three children, maidens, <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/> Phoebe, Clytemnestra my wife, and Helen; the foremost of the favored sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> came to woo Helen; but terrible threats of spilling his rival's blood were uttered by each of them, if he should fail to win the girl. <milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/> Now the matter filled Tyndareus, her father, with perplexity, whether to give her or not, how he might best succeed. This thought occurred to him: the suitors should swear to each other and join right hands and pour libations <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/> with burnt-sacrifice, binding themselves by this curse: whoever wins the child of Tyndareus for wife, they will assist that man, in case a rival takes her from his house and goes his way, robbing her husband of his rights; and march against that man in armed array and raze his city to the ground, <milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> Hellene no less than barbarian. Now when they had once pledged their word and old Tyndareus with no small cleverness had beguiled them by his shrewd device, he allowed his daughter to choose from among her suitors the one towards whom the sweet breezes of Aphrodite might carry her. <milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/> Her choice fell on Menelaus; would she had never taken him! Then there came to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> from the Phrygians the man who, <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> legend says, judged the goddesses' dispute; in robes of gorgeous hue, ablaze with gold, in true barbaric pomp; <milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/> and he, finding Menelaus gone from home, carried Helen off, in mutual desire, to his steading on Ida. Goaded to frenzy, Menelaus flew through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, invoking the ancient oath exacted by Tyndareus and declaring the duty of helping the injured husband.
</p>
<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="card"/>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/> And so the Hellenes, brandishing their spears and donning their harness, came here to the narrow straits of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> with armaments of ships and troops, with many horses and chariots, and they chose me to captain them all for the sake of Menelaus, <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/> since I was his brother. Would that some other had gained that distinction instead of me! But after the army was gathered and come together, we still remained at <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> weatherbound. In our perplexity, we asked Calchas, the seer, <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/> and he answered that we should sacrifice my own child Iphigenia to Artemis, whose home is in this land, and we would sail and sack the Phrygians' capital &lsqb;if we sacrificed her, but if we did not, these things would not happen&rsqb;. When I heard this, I commanded Talthybius <milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/> with loud proclamation to disband the whole army, as I could never bear to slay my daughter. Whereupon my brother, bringing every argument to bear, persuaded me at last to face the crime; so I wrote in a folded scroll and sent to my wife, <milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/> bidding her despatch our daughter to me on the pretence of wedding Achilles, at the same time magnifying his exalted rank and saying that he refused to sail with the Achaeans, unless a bride of our lineage should go to <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName>. Yes, this was the inducement I offered my wife, <milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/> &lsqb;inventing, as I did, a sham marriage for the maiden. Of all the Achaeans we alone know the real truth, Calchas, Odysseus, Menelaus and myself; but that which I then decided wrongly, I now rightly countermand again in this scroll, which you, old man, have found me <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/> opening and resealing beneath the shade of night. Up now and away with this missive to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and I will tell you by word of mouth all that is written here, the contents of the folded scroll, for you are loyal to my wife and house.&rsqb;
</p>
<milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="card"/>
<p>Old man, come here and stand before my dwelling.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I come; what new schemes now, king Agamemnon?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Will you hurry?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I am hurrying. It is little enough sleep old age allows me <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> and keenly it watches over my eyes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>What can that star be, steering its course there?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Sirius, still shooting over the zenith on his way near the Pleiads' sevenfold track.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>The birds are still at any rate <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> and the sea is calm, hushed are the winds, and silence broods over the Euripus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Then why are you outside your tent, why so restless, my lord Agamemnon? All is yet quiet here in <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> the watch on the walls is not yet astir. Let us go in.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>I envy you, old man, yes, and every man who leads a life secure, unknown and unrenowned; but little I envy those in office.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> And yet it is there that we place the be-all and end-all of existence</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Yes, but that is where the danger comes; and ambition, sweet though it seems, brings sorrow with its near approach. At one time the unsatisfied claims of the gods <milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/> upset our life, at another the numerous peevish fancies of our subjects shatter it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I do not like these sentiments in one who is a chief. It was not to enjoy all blessings that <milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/> Atreus begot you, Agamemnon; but you must experience joy and sorrow alike, mortal as you are. Even though you like it not, this is what the gods decree. But you, after letting your taper spread its light abroad, <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/> write the letter which is still in your hands and then erase the same words again, sealing and reopening the tablet, then flinging it to the ground with floods <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/> of tears, and leaving nothing undone in your aimless behavior to stamp you mad. What is it that troubles you? what news is there affecting you, king? Come, share with me your story; <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/> you will be telling it to a loyal and trusty heart ; for Tyndareus sent me that day to form part of your wife's dowry and to wait upon the bride with loyalty.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/> &ldquo;Daughter of Leda, in addition to my first letter, I am sending you word &mdash;.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Say on and make it plain, that what my tongue utters may accord with what you have written.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>&ldquo;Not to despatch your daughter to <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>'s deep-gulfed wing, to the waveless bay of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>, for after all we will celebrate our child's wedding at another time.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>And how will Achilles, cheated of his bride, <milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/> curb the fury of his indignation against you and your wife? Here also is a danger. Make clear what you are saying.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>It is his name, not himself that Achilles is lending, knowing nothing of the marriage or of my scheming <milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/> or my professed readiness to betroth my daughter to him for a husband's embrace.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>A dreadful venture yours, king Agamemnon, you that, by promise of your daughter's hand to the son of the goddess, <milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/> were bringing the maid here to be sacrificed for the Danaids.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Ah me! I am utterly distraught; alas! bewilderment comes over me. Away! hurry your steps, <milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/> yielding nothing to old age.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I will make haste, king.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Do not sit down by woodland fountains; scorn the witcheries of sleep.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Hush!<note anchored="yes" resp="Coleridge">The old man cuts short Agamemnon's warnings, as being an un-called-for reflection on his own loyalty.</note></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>And when you pass any place where roads diverge, <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/> cast your eyes all round, taking heed that no mule-wagon eacape you, passing by on rolling wheels, bearing my child to the ships of the Danaids.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>It shall be so.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Start then from the bolted gates, <milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/> and if you meet the escort, start them back again, and drive at full speed to the abodes of the Cyclopes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>But tell me, how shall my message find credit with your wife or child?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/> Preserve the seal which you bear on this tablet. Away! Already the dawn is growing grey, lighting the lamp of day and the fire of the sun's four steeds; <milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/> help me in my trouble. <stage>Exit Old man.</stage></p>
<p>No mortal is prosperous or happy to the last, for no one was ever born to a painless life.<stage>Exit Agamemnon.</stage>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>To the sandy beach <milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/> of sea-coast <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> I have come after a voyage through the tides of narrow Euripus, leaving <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, my city which feeds the waters <milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/> of far-famed Arethusa near the sea, so that I might behold the army of the Achaeans and the ships rowed by those godlike heroes; for our husbands tell us <milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/> that fair-haired Menelaus and high-born Agamemnon are leading them to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> on a thousand ships in quest of Helen, whom <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> the herdsman <milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/> carried off from the banks of reedy Eurotas, his gift from Aphrodite, when that queen of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> entered beauty's contest with Hera and Pallas at the gushing fountain.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="antistrophe" n="1">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/> Through the grove of Artemis, rich with sacrifice, I sped my course, my cheek stained with red from maiden modesty, in my eagerness to see the soldiers' camp, <milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/> the tents of the mail-clad Danaids, and their crowd of horses. I saw two met together in council; one was Aias, son of Oileus; the other Aias, son of Telamon, crown of glory to the men of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>; <milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/> and I saw Protesilaus and Palamedes, sprung from the son of Poseidon, sitting there amusing themselves with intricate figures at checkers; Diomedes too <milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/> at his favorite sport of hurling quoits; and Meriones, Ares' son, a marvel to mankind, stood at his side; likewise I beheld the son of Laertes, who came from his island hills, and with him Nireus, <milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/> handsomest of the Achaeans.<milestone ed="p" n="206" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="mesode">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Achilles next, that nimble runner, swift on his feet as the wind, whom Thetis bore and Chiron trained, I saw <milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/> upon the beach, racing in full armor along the shingle, and straining every nerve to beat a team of four horses, <milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/> as he sped round the track on foot; and Eumelus, the grandson of Pheres, their driver, was shouting when I saw him, goading on his lovely steeds, <milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/> with their bits of chased gold-work; the center pair, that bore the yoke, had dappled coats picked out with white, while the tracehorses, on the outside, facing the turning-post in the course, <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/> were bays with spotted fetlocks. Close beside them Peleus' son leapt on his way, in all his harness, keeping abreast <milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/> the rail by the axle-box.<milestone ed="p" n="231" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="strophe" n="2">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Next I sought the countless fleet, a wonder to behold, that I might fill my girlish eyes with gazing, a sweet delight. <milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/> The warlike Myrmidons from <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName> held the right wing with fifty swift cruisers, upon whose sterns, right at the ends, stood Nereid goddesses <milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/> in golden effigy, the ensign of Achilles' armament.<milestone ed="p" n="242" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="antistrophe" n="2">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Near these were moored the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> ships in equal numbers, over which Mecisteus' <milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/> son, whom Talaus his grandfather reared, and Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, were in command; next in order, Theseus' son was stationed at the head of sixty ships from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, having the goddess <milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/> Pallas set in a winged chariot drawn by steeds with solid hoof, a lucky sight for mariners.<milestone ed="p" n="253" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="strophe" n="3">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Then I saw <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>'s fleet of fifty sails <milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/> decked with ensigns; these had Cadmus at the stern holding a golden dragon at the beaks of the vessels, and earth-born Leitus <milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/> was their admiral. And there were ships from <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>; and from <placeName key="tgn,7010899">Locris</placeName> came the son of Oileus with an equal contingent, leaving famed Thronium's citadel.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="antistrophe" n="3">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/> And from <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, the Cyclopes' town, Atreus' son sent a hundred well-manned galleys, and Adrastos was with him in command, as friend with friend, <milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/> that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> might exact vengeance on the one who had fled her home to wed a foreigner. Also I saw upon Gerenian Nestor's prows from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> <milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/> the ensign of his neighbour Alpheus, four-footed like a bull.<milestone ed="p" n="277" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="strophe" n="4">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Moreover there was a squadron of twelve Aenianian sail under King Gouneus; and then near them <milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/> the lords of Elis, whom all the people named Epeians; and Eurytus was lord of these; Iikewise he led the Taphian warriors with the white oar-blades, the subjects of Meges, <milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/> son of Phyleus, who had left the isles of the Echinades, where sailors cannot land.<milestone ed="p" n="288" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>
<div2 type="antistrophe" n="4">
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Lastly, Aias, reared in <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/> was joining his right wing to the left of those near whom he was posed, closing the line with his outermost ships, twelve barques obedient to the helm, as I heard and then <milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/> saw the crews; the one who brings his barbaric boats to grapple Aias shall obtain no safe return. There I saw <milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/> the naval armament, but some things I heard at home about the gathered army, of which I still have a recollection.<milestone ed="p" n="303" unit="card"/></p></sp></div2>

<p>Yes, but a mind unstable is an unjust possession, disloyal to friends. <milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/> Now I am anxious to test you, and do not seek from rage to turn aside from the truth, nor will I on my part overstrain the case. Do you remember when you were all eagerness to captain the Danaids against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, making a pretence of declining, though eager for it in your heart; how humble you were then, taking each man by the hand <milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/> and keeping open doors for every fellow-townsman who cared to enter, affording each in turn chance to speak with you, even though some did not wish it, seeking by these methods to purchase popularity from all bidders? Then when you had secured the command, there came a change over your manners; you were no longer so cordial as before to former friends, <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/> but hard of access, seldom to be found at home. But the man of real worth ought not to change his manners in the hour of prosperity, but should then show himself most staunch to friends, when his own good fortune can help them most effectually.
</p>
<milestone ed="p" n="349" unit="card"/>
<p>This was the first cause I had to reprove you, for it was here I first discovered your villainy; <milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/> but afterwards, when you came to <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> with all the gathered hosts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, you were of no account; no! the want of a favorable breeze filled you with consternation at the chance dealt out by the gods. Then the Danaids began demanding that you should send the fleet away instead of vainly toiling on at <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>; what dismay and confusion was then depicted in your looks, to think that you, with a thousand <milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/> ships at your command, had not occupied the plains of Priam with your armies! And you would ask my counsel, &ldquo;What am I to do? What scheme can I devise, where find one?&rdquo;&mdash;to save yourself being stripped of your command and losing your fair fame. Next when Calchas bade you offer your daughter in sacrifice to Artemis, declaring that the Danaids should then sail, you were overjoyed, <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/> and gladly undertook to offer the girl, and of your own accord&mdash;never allege compulsion&mdash;you are sending word to your wife to despatch your daughter here on pretence of wedding Achilles. And after all you turn round and have been caught casting your letter to this effect: &ldquo;I will no longer be my daughter's murderer.&rdquo; Exactly so! <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/> This is the same air that heard you say it. Countless others have done the same; they make an effort while in power, and then retire dishonorably, sometimes owing to the senselessness of the citizens, sometimes deservedly, because they are too feeble of themselves to maintain their watch upon the state. <milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/> For my part, I am more sorry for our unhappy <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, whose purpose was to read these worthless foreigners a lesson, while now she will let them escape and mock her, thanks to you and your daughter. May I never appoint a man to rule my country or lead its warriors because of his courage! Sense is what the general must have; <milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/> since any man, with ordinary intelligence, can govern a state.<milestone ed="p" n="376" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<p>I wish to rebuke you in turn, briefly, not lifting my eyes too high shamelessly, but in more sober fashion, <milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/> as a brother; for it is a good man's way to be considerate. Tell me, why this burst of fury, these bloodshot eyes? who wrongs you? what is it you want? are you longing to have a virtuous wife? <placeName key="tgn,1131671">WeIl</placeName>, I cannot supply you; for she, whom you once had, was ill-controlled by you. Am I then, a man who never went astray, to suffer for your sins? <milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/> or is it my popularity that galls you? No! it is the longing you have to keep a beautiful woman in your embrace, casting reason and honor to the winds. A bad man's pleasures are like himself. Am I mad, if I change to wiser counsels, after previously deciding amiss? Yours is the madness rather in wishing to recover <milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/> a wicked wife, once you had lost her&mdash;a stroke of heaven-sent luck. Those foolish suitors swore that oath to Tyndareus in their longing to wed; but Hope was the goddess that led them on, I think, and she it was that brought it about rather than you and your strength. So take the field with them; they are ready for it in the folly of their hearts; for the deity is not without insight, but is able to discern <milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/> where oaths have been wrongly pledged or forcibly extorted. I will not slay my children, nor shall your interests be prospered by justice in your vengeance for a worthless wife, while I am left wasting, night and day, in sorrow for what I did to one of my own flesh and blood, contrary to all law and justice. <milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/> Here is your answer shortly given, clear and easy to understand; and if you will not come to your senses, I shall do the best for myself.<milestone ed="p" n="402" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<stage>entering hurriedly.</stage><p>Agamemnon, lord of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>! <milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/> I have come and bring you your daughter, whom you call Iphigenia in your home; and her mother, your wife Clytemnestra, is with her, and the child Orestes, a sight to gladden you after your long absence from your home; <milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/> but they had been travelling long and far, they are now resting their tender feet at the waters of a fair spring, they and their horses, for we turned these loose in the grassy meadow to browse their fill. But I have come as their forerunner to prepare you for their reception; <milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/> for the army knows already of your daughter's arrival, so quickly did the rumor spread; and all the people are running together to the sight, that they may see your child; for Fortune's favorites enjoy world-wide fame and have all eyes fixed on them. <milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/> Some say: &ldquo;Is it a wedding, or what is happening? or has king Agamemnon from fond yearning summoned his daughter here?&rdquo; From others you would have heard: &ldquo;They are presenting the maiden to Artemis, queen of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>, previous to marriage; who can the bridegroom be, that is to lead her home?&rdquo;</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/> Come, then, begin the rites, that is the next step, by getting the baskets ready; crown your heads&mdash;you too, lord Menelaus; prepare the wedding hymn; let flutes sound throughout the tents with noise of dancer's feet; for this is a happy day, that has come for the maid.<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/> You have my thanks; now go within; for the rest it will be well, as Fate proceeds. <stage>Exit Messenger.</stage></p>
<p>Ah, woe is me! unhappy wretch, what can I say? where shall I begin? To what cruel straits have I been plunged! A god has outwitted me, proving far cleverer <milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/> than any cunning of mine. What an advantage humble birth possesses! for it is easy for her sons to weep and tell out all their sorrows; while to the high-born man come these same sorrows, but we heve dignity <milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/> throned over our life and are the people's slaves. I, for instance, am ashamed to weep, and no less ashamed, poor wretch, to check my tears at the dreadful pass to which I am brought.</p>
<p>Enough; what am I to tell my wife? <milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/> how shall I welcome her? with what face meet her? for she too has undone me by coming uninvited in this my hour of sorrow; yet it was only natural she should come with her daughter to prepare the bride and perform the fondest duties, where she will discover my villainy. <milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/> And for this poor maid&mdash;why maid? Death, it seems, will soon make her his bride&mdash;how I pity her! Thus will she plead to me, I think: &ldquo;My father, will you slay me? May you yourself make such a marriage, and whoever is a friend to you!&rdquo; <milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/> While Orestes, from his station near us, will cry in childish accents, inarticulate, yet fraught with meaning. Alas! to what utter ruin <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, the son of Priam, the cause of these troubles, has brought me by his union with Helen!</p></sp>
<sp>

<p>I give it; yours is the victory, mine the sorrow.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>By Pelops our reputed grandsire and Atreus our father, <milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/> I swear to tell you the truth from my heart, without any covert purpose, but only what I think. The sight of you in tears made me pity you, and in return I shed a tear for you myself; I withdraw from my former proposals, <milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/> ceasing to be a cause of fear to you; yes, and I will put myself in your present position; and I counsel you, do not slay your child or prefer my interests to yours; for it is not just that you should grieve, while I am glad, or that your children should die, while mine still see the light of day. <milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/> What is it, after all, I seek? If I am set on marriage, could I not find a bride as choice elsewhere? Was I to lose a brother&mdash;the last I should have lost&mdash;to win a Helen, getting bad for good? I was mad, impetuous as a youth, till I perceived, <milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/> on closer view, what slaying children really meant. Moreover I am filled with compassion for the hapless maiden, doomed to bleed that I may wed, when I reflect that we are kin. What has your daughter to do with Helen?</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/> Let the army be disbanded and leave <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>; dry those streaming eyes, brother, and do not provoke me to tears. Whatever concern you have in oracles that affect your child, let it be none of mine; into your hands I resign my share. <milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/> A sudden change, you'll say, from my dread proposals? A natural course for me; affection for my brother caused the change. These are the ways of a man not devoid of virtue, to pursue on each occasion what is best.</p></sp>

<p>I thank you, Menelaus, for this unexpected suggestion; it is an honorable proposal, worthy of you. Sometimes love, sometimes the selfishness of their families, causes a quarrel between brothers; I loathe <milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/> a relationship of this kind which is bitterness to both. But it is useless, for circumstances compel me to carry out the murderous sacrifice of my daughter.</p></sp>

<p>Don't you think, then, he will arise among the Argives and tell them the oracles that Calchas delivered, <milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/> saying of me that I undertook to offer Artemis a victim, and after all am proving false? Then, when he has carried the army away with him, he will bid the Argives slay us and sacrifice the girl; and if I escape to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, they will come and destroy the place, <milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/> razing it to the ground, Cyclopean walls and all. That is my trouble. Woe is me! to what perplexities the gods have brought me at this pass! Take one precaution for me, Menelaus, as you go through the army, that Clytemnestra does not learn this, <milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/> till I have taken my child and devoted her to death, that my affliction may be attended with the fewest tears. <stage>Turning to the Chorus.</stage> And you, foreign women, keep silence. <stage>Exit Menelaus.</stage><milestone ed="p" n="543" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<sp n="Clytemnestra">
<speaker>Clytemnestra</speaker>
<p>Well, now listen; for I will unfold my meaning and no longer employ dark riddles. In the first place&mdash;to reproach you first with this&mdash;it was not of my own free will but by force that you took and wed me, <milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="line"/> after slaying Tantalus, my former husband, and dashing my baby on the ground when you had torn him from my breast with brutal violence. Then those two sons of Zeus, who were my brothers, came flashing on horseback to war with you;<milestone ed="p" n="1155" unit="line"/> but Tyndareus, my old father, rescued you because of your suppliant prayers, and you in turn had me to wife.</p>
<p>Once I was reconciled to you upon this footing, you will bear me witness I have been a blameless wife to you and your family, chaste in love, <milestone ed="p" n="1160" unit="line"/> an honor to your house, that so your coming in might be with joy and your going out with gladness. And it is seldom a man secures a wife like this, though the getting of a worthless woman Is no rarity. Besides three daughters, of one of whom you are heartlessly depriving me, <milestone ed="p" n="1165" unit="line"/> I am the mother of this son of yours. If anyone asks you your reason for slaying her, tell me, what will you say? or must I say it for you? &ldquo;It is that Menelaus may recover Helen.&rdquo; An honorable exchange, indeed, to pay a wicked woman's price in children's lives! <milestone ed="p" n="1170" unit="line"/> It is buying what we most detest with what we hold most dear. Again, if you go forth with the army, leaving me in your halls and are long absent at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, what will my feelings be at home, do you think? when I behold each vacant chair <milestone ed="p" n="1175" unit="line"/> and her chamber now deserted, and then sit down alone in tears, making ceaseless lamentation for her, &ldquo;Ah! my child, he that begot you has slain you himself, he and no one else, nor are was it by another's hand, leaving behind him such a return to his home.&rdquo; <milestone ed="p" n="1180" unit="line"/> For it needs now only a trifling pretext for me and the daughters remaining to give you the reception it is right you should receive. I adjure you by the gods, do not compel me to sin against you, or sin yourself.
</p>
<milestone ed="p" n="1185" unit="card"/>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1185" unit="line"/> Well; suppose you sacrifice the child; what prayer will you utter, when it is done? what will the blessing be that you will invoke upon yourself as you are slaying our daughter? An ill returning, seeing the disgrace that speeds your going forth? Is it right that I should pray for any luck to attend you? Surely we should deem the gods devoid of sense, <milestone ed="p" n="1190" unit="line"/> if we harbored a kindly feeling towards murder? Shall you embrace your children on your coming back to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>? No, you have no right. Will any child of yours ever face you, if you have surrendered one of them to death? Has this ever entered into your calculations, or does your one duty consist <milestone ed="p" n="1195" unit="line"/> in carrying a scepter about and marching at the head of an army? When you might have made this fair proposal among the Argives; &ldquo;Is it your wish, Achaeans, to sail for <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>'s shores? Why then, cast lots whose daughter has to die.&rdquo; For that would have been a fair course for you to pursue, instead of picking out <milestone ed="p" n="1200" unit="line"/> your own child for the victim and presenting her to the Danaids; or Menelaus, as it was his concern, should have slain <placeName key="perseus,Hermione">Hermione</placeName> for her mother. As it is, I, who still am true to your bed, must lose my child; while she, who went astray, <milestone ed="p" n="1205" unit="line"/> will return with her daughter, and live in happiness at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.

Do not destroy me before my time, for it is sweet to look upon the light, and do not force me to visit scenes below. <milestone ed="p" n="1220" unit="line"/> I was the first to call you father, you the first to call me child; I was the first to sit upon your knee and give and take the fond caress.

By Pelops, I entreat you spare me, by your father Atreus and my mother here, who suffers now a second time the pangs <milestone ed="p" n="1235" unit="line"/> she felt before when bearing me! What have I to do with the marriage of <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> and Helen? Why is his coming to prove my ruin, father?

Yes, by your beard we two fond hearts implore your pity, the one a baby, a full-grown maid the other. By summing all my pleas in one, I will prevail in what I say: <milestone ed="p" n="1250" unit="line"/> to gaze upon the light is man's most cherished gift; that life below is nothingness, and whoever longs for death is mad. Better live a life of woe than die a death of glory!</p></sp>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="1540" unit="line"/> Dear mistress, you shall learn all clearly; from the outset will I tell it, unless my memory fails me somewhat and confuses my tongue in its account. As soon as we reached the grove of Artemis, the child of Zeus, and the flowery meadows, <milestone ed="p" n="1545" unit="line"/> where the Achaean troops were gathered, bringing your daughter with us, at once the Argive army began assembling; but when king Agamemnon saw the maiden on her way to the grove to be sacrificed, he gave one groan, and, turning away his face, let the tears burst <milestone ed="p" n="1550" unit="line"/> from his eyes, as he held his robe before them. But the maid, standing close by her father, spoke thus: &ldquo;O my father, here I am; willingly I offer my body for my country and all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="1555" unit="line"/> that you may lead me to the altar of the goddess and sacrifice me, since this is Heaven's ordinance. May good luck be yours for any help that I afford! and may you obtain the victor's gift and come again to the land of your fathers. So then let none of the Argives lay hands on me, <milestone ed="p" n="1560" unit="line"/> for I will bravely yield my neck without a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke; and each man marvelled, as he heard the maiden's brave speech. But in the midst Talthybius stood up, for this was his duty, and bade the army refrain from word or deed; <milestone ed="p" n="1565" unit="line"/> and Calchas, the seer, drawing a sharp sword from its scabbard laid it in a basket of beaten gold, and crowned the maiden's head. Then the son of Peleus, taking the basket and with it lustral water in his hand, ran round the altar of the goddess <milestone ed="p" n="1570" unit="line"/> uttering these words: &ldquo;O Artemis, you child of Zeus, slayer of wild beasts, that wheel your dazzling light amid the gloom, accept this sacrifice which we, the army of the Achaeans and Agamemnon with us, offer to you, pure blood from a beautiful maiden's neck; <milestone ed="p" n="1575" unit="line"/> and grant us safe sailing for our ships and the sack of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s towers by our spears.&rdquo; Meanwhile the sons of Atreus and all the army stood looking on the ground.

<p>&lsqb;But the priest, seizing his knife, offered up a prayer and was closely scanning the maiden's throat to see where he should strike. <milestone ed="p" n="1580" unit="line"/> It was no slight sorrow filled my heart, as I stood by with bowed head; when there was a sudden miracle! Each one of us distinctly heard the sound of a blow, but none saw the spot where the maiden vanished. The priest cried out, and all the army took up the cry <milestone ed="p" n="1585" unit="line"/> at the sight of a marvel all unlooked for, due to some god's agency, and passing all belief, although it was seen; for there upon the ground lay a deer of immense size, magnificent to see, gasping out her life, with whose blood the altar of the goddess was thoroughly bedewed. <milestone ed="p" n="1590" unit="line"/> Then spoke Calchas thus&mdash;his joy you can imagine&mdash;&ldquo;You captains of this leagued Achaean army, do you see this victim, which the goddess has set before her altar, a mountain-roaming deer? This is more welcome to her by far than the maid, <milestone ed="p" n="1595" unit="line"/> that she may not defile her altar by shedding noble blood. Gladlyshe has accepted it, and is granting us a prosperous voyage for our attack on <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>. Therefore take heart, sailors, each man of you, and away to your ships, for today <milestone ed="p" n="1600" unit="line"/> we must leave the hollow bays of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> and cross the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> main.&rdquo; Then, when the sacrifice was wholly burnt to ashes in the blazing flame, he offered such prayers as were fitting, that the army might win return; but Agamemnon sends me to tell you this, <milestone ed="p" n="1605" unit="line"/> and say what heaven-sent luck is his, and how he has secured undying fame throughout the length of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>.
