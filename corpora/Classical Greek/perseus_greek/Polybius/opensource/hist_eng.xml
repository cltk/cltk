<head>Introduction</head>
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Introduction. The importance and magnitude of the subject.</note>
<p>Had the praise of History been passed over by former
Chroniclers it would perhaps have been incumbent upon me to urge the choice and
special study of records of this sort, as the
readiest means men can have of correcting their
knowledge of the past. But my predecessors have not been
sparing in this respect. They have all begun and ended, so to
speak, by enlarging on this theme: asserting again and again
that the study of History is in the truest sense an education,
and a training for political life; and that the most instructive,
or rather the only, method of learning to bear with dignity
the vicissitudes of fortune is to recall the catastrophes of
others. It is evident, therefore, that no one need think it his
duty to repeat what has been said by many, and said well.
Least of all myself: for the surprising nature of the events
which I have undertaken to relate is in itself sufficient to challenge and stimulate the attention of every one, old or young, to
the study of my work. Can any one be so indifferent or idle
as not to care to know by what means, and under what kind
of polity, almost the whole inhabited world was conquered and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-219" to="-167">219</dateRange>-167.</note>
brought under the dominion of the single city of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and
that too within a period of not quite fifty-three
years? Or who again can be so completely
absorbed in other subjects of contemplation or study, as to
think any of them superior in importance to the accurate understanding of an event for which the past affords no precedent.

<div2 id="b1c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Importance and Magnitude of the Subject</head>
<p>We shall best show how marvellous and vast our subject is by comparing the most famous Empires
which preceded, and which have been the

There are but three that deserve even to be so
compared and measured: and they are these.
The Persians for a certain length of time were possessed of
a great empire and dominion. But every time they ventured beyond the limits of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, they found not only their
empire, but their own existence also in danger. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">2. <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. B. C. <dateRange from="-405" to="-394">405</dateRange>-394.</note>
The Lacedaemonians, after contending for supremacy in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> for many generations, when they did get
it, held it without dispute for barely twelve
years.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">3. <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</note>The Macedonians obtained dominion
in <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> from the lands bordering on the Adriatic to the
<placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName>,&mdash;which after all is but a small fraction of this
continent,&mdash;and, by the destruction of the Persian Empire,
they afterwards added to that the dominion of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. And
yet, though they had the credit of having made themselves
masters of a larger number of countries and states than any
people had ever done, they still left the greater half of the inhabited world in the hands of others. They never so much
as thought of attempting <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, or <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>: and as to
<placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, to speak the plain truth, they never even knew of the
most warlike tribes of the West. The Roman conquest, on
the other hand, was not partial. Nearly the whole inhabited
world was reduced by them to obedience: and they left
behind them an empire not to be paralleled in the past or
rivalled in the future. Students will gain from my narrative
a clearer view of the whole story, and of the numerous and
important advantages which such exact record of events
offers.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>The Starting-point of the History</head>
<p>My History begins in the 140th Olympiad. The events
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-220" to="-217">220</dateRange>-217. The History starts from the 140th Olympiad, when the tendency towards unity first shows itself.</note>
from which it starts are these. In <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, what
is called the Social war: the first waged by
Philip, son of Demetrius and father of Perseus,
in league with the Achaeans against the Aetolians. In <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, the war for the possession of
<pb n="3"/>
<placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName> which Antiochus and Ptolemy
Philopator carried on against each other.  In
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, and their neighbourhood, the conflict between
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, generally called the Hannibalian war.
My work thus begins where that of Aratus of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> leaves off.
Now up to this time the word's history had been, so to speak,
a series of disconnected transactions, as widely separated in
their origin and results as in their localities. But from this
time forth History becomes a connected whole: the affairs of
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> are involved with those of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,
and the tendency of all is to unity. This is why I
have fixed upon this era as the starting-point of my work.
For it was their victory over the Carthaginians in this war,
and their conviction that thereby the most difficult and most
essential step towards universal empire had been taken, which
encouraged the Romans for the first time to stretch out their
hands upon the rest, and to cross with an army into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>
and <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.</p>
<p>Now, had the states that were rivals for universal empire
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A sketch of their previous history necessary to explain the success of the Romans.</note>
been familiarly known to us, no reference perhaps to their previous history would have been
necessary, to show the purpose and the forces
with which they approached an undertaking of
this nature and magnitude. But the fact is that
the majority of the Greeks have no knowledge of the previous
constitution, power, or achievements either of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. I therefore concluded that it was necessary to prefix this
and the next book to my History. I was anxious that no one,
when fairly embarked upon my actual narrative, should feel at
a loss, and have to ask what were the designs entertained by
the Romans, or the forces and means at their disposal, that
they entered upon those undertakings, which did in fact
lead to their becoming masters of land and sea everywhere
in our part of the world. I wished, on the contrary, that
these books of mine, and the prefatory sketch which they
contained, might make it clear that the resources they
started with justified their original idea, and sufficiently explained their final success in grasping universal empire and
dominion.

<div2 id="b1c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Comprehensive View</head>
<p>There is this analogy between the plan of my History
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The need of a comprehensive view of history as well as a close study of an epoch.</note>
and the marvellous spirit of the age with which
I have to deal. Just as Fortune made almost all
the affairs of the world incline in one direction,
and forced them to converge upon one and the
same point; so it is my task as an historian to
put before my readers a compendious view of the
part played by Fortune in bringing about the general catastrophe.<note anchored="yes" resp="fww">lines 8 and 9: "the general catastrophe" should read "her general purpose".</note> It was this peculiarity which originally challenged
my attention, and determined me on undertaking this work.
And combined with this was the fact that no writer of our
time has undertaken a general history. Had any one done so
my ambition in this direction would have been much diminished. But, in point of fact, I notice that by far the greater
number of historians concern themselves with isolated wars
and the incidents that accompany them: while as to a general
and comprehensive scheme of events, their date, origin, and
catastrophe, no one as far as I know has undertaken to
examine it. I thought it, therefore, distinctly my duty neither
to pass by myself, nor allow any one else to pass by, without
full study, a characteristic specimen of the dealings of Fortune
at once brilliant and instructive in the highest degree. For
fruitful as Fortune is in change, and constantly as she is producing dramas in the life of men, yet never assuredly before
this did she work such a marvel, or act such a drama, as that
which we have witnessed. And of this we cannot obtain a
comprehensive view from writers of mere episodes. It would
be as absurd to expect to do so as for a man to imagine
that he has learnt the shape of the whole world, its entire
arrangement and order, because he has visited one after the
other the most famous cities in it; or perhaps merely examined
them in separate pictures. That would be indeed absurd: and
it has always seemed to me that men, who are persuaded that
they get a competent view of universal from episodical
history, are very like persons who should see the limbs of
some body, which had once been living and beautiful,
scattered and remote; and should imagine that to be quite
as good as actually beholding the activity and beauty of the
living creature itself. But if some one could there and then
<pb n="5"/>
reconstruct the animal once more, in the perfection of its
beauty and the charm of its vitality, and could display it
to the same people, they would beyond doubt confess that
they had been far from conceiving the truth, and had
been little better than dreamers. For indeed some idea
of a whole may be got from a part, but an accurate knowledge and clear comprehension cannot. Wherefore we
must conclude that episodical history contributes exceedingly little to the familiar knowledge and secure grasp of
universal history. While it is only by the combination
and comparison of the separate parts of the whole,&mdash;by observing their likeness and their difference,&mdash;that a man can
attain his object: can obtain a view at once clear and complete; and thus secure both the profit and the delight of
History.</p></div2>

<head>The Romans in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName></head>
<p>I shall adopt as the starting-point of this book the
first occasion on which the Romans crossed
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-264" to="-261">264</dateRange>-261. I begin my preliminary account in the 129th Olympiad, and with the circumstances which took the Romans to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note>
the sea from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. This is just where the
History of Timaeus left off; and it falls in the
129th Olympiad. I shall accordingly have
to describe what the state of their affairs in
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was, how long that settlement had lasted,
and on what resources they reckoned, when
they resolved to invade <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. For this was
the first place outside <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> in which they set foot. The
precise cause of their thus crossing I must state without
comment; for if I let one cause lead me back to another, my
point of departure will always elude my grasp, and I shall
never arrive at the view of my subject which I wish to present. As to dates, then, I must fix on some era agreed
upon and recognised by all: and as to events, one that admits of distinctly separate treatment; even though I may
be obliged to go back some short way in point of time, and
take a summary review of the intermediate transactions. For
if the facts with which one starts are unknown, or even open
to controversy, all that comes after will fail of approval and
belief. But opinion being once formed on that point, and a
general assent obtained, all the succeeding narrative becomes
intelligible.

<head>Roman Dominion in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName></head>
<p>It was in the nineteenth year after the sea-fight at
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-387" to="-386">387</dateRange>-386. The rise of the Roman dominion may be traced from the retirement of the Gauls from the city. From that time one nation after another in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> fell into their hands.</note>
<placeName key="tgn,6000070">Aegospotami</placeName>, and the sixteenth before the battle
at Leuctra; the year in which the Lacedaemonians made what is called the Peace of
Antalcidas with the King of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>; the year
in which the elder Dionysius was besieging
<placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName> after beating the Italian Greeks on
the river Elleporus; and in which the Gauls
took <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself by storm and were occupying
the whole of it except the Capitol. With these
Gauls the Romans made a treaty and settlement
which they were content to accept: and having thus become
beyond all expectation once more masters of their own country,
they made a start in their career of expansion; and in the
succeeding period engaged in various wars with their neighbours. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Latini.</note> First, by dint of valour, and the good
fortune which attended them in the field, they
mastered all the Latini; then they went to war with the
Etruscans; then with the Celts; and next with
the Samnites, who lived on the eastern and
northern frontiers of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Etruscans, Gauls, and Samnites.</note> Some time after
this the Tarentines insulted the ambassadors of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and,
in fear of the consequences, invited and obtained the assistance of Pyrrhus. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Pyrrhus, B. C. <date value="-280">280</date>.</note> This happened in the year
before the Gauls invaded <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, some of whom
perished near <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, while others crossed into
<placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Then it was that the Romans&mdash;having reduced the
Etruscans and Samnites to obedience, and conquered the
Italian Celts in many battles&mdash;attempted for the first time the
reduction of the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Southern <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.</note> The nations

the art of war. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Pyrrhus finally quits <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, B. C. <date value="-274">274</date>.</note> Accordingly, they entered upon the war with

<p>Not long before the period we are now

Agathocles, having for some time cast greedy
eyes upon <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, owing to its beauty and wealth, no

done, they seized promiscuously the wives and

and city found ready imitators of their conduct.
The people of <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>, when Pyrrhus was crossing to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, felt a double anxiety. They were
dismayed at the thought of his approach, and at the same time
were afraid of the Carthaginians as being masters
of the sea. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Pyrrhus in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, B. C. <dateRange from="-278" to="-275">278</dateRange>-275.</note> They accordingly asked and obtained
a force from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to guard and support them.
The garrison, four thousand in number, under the command
of a Campanian named Decius Jubellius, entered the city,
and for a time preserved it, as well as their own faith. But at
last, conceiving the idea of imitating the Mamertines, and
having at the same time obtained their co-operation, they
broke faith with the people of <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>, enamoured of the
pleasant site of the town and the private wealth of the citizens,
and seized the city after having, in imitation of the Mamertines,
first driven out some of the people and put others to the sword.
Now, though the Romans were much annoyed at this transaction,<pb n="8"/>  they could take no active steps, because they were deeply
engaged in the wars I have mentioned above. But having
got free from them they invested and besieged the troops.
They presently took the place and killed the greater number
in the assault,&mdash;for the men resisted desperately,
knowing what must follow,&mdash;but took more
than three hundred alive. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-271">271</date>. C. Quintus Claudus, L. Genucius Clepsina, Coss.</note> These were sent to

enjoyed the alliance of the Roman captors of
<placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>, not only exercised absolute control

<p>Not long before this the military forces of the Syracusans<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The rise of Hiero. He is elected General by the army, B. C. <dateRange from="-275" to="-274">275</dateRange>-274.</note>
had quarrelled with the citizens, and while stationed near Mergan&egrave; elected commanders from
their own body. These were Artemidorus and
Hiero, the latter of whom afterwards became
King of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. At this time he was quite a young man, but
had a certain natural aptitude for kingcraft and the politic conduct of affairs. Having taken over the command, and having by
means of some of his connexions made his way into the city,
he got his political opponents into his hands; but conducted
the government with such mildness, and in so lofty a spirit,
that the Syracusans, though by no means usually acquiescing
in the election of officers by the soldiers, did on this occasion
<pb n="9"/>
unanimously approve of Hiero as their general. His first step
made it evident to close observers that his hopes soared above
the position of a mere general.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c9" type="chapter" n="9">

<p>He noticed that among the Syracusans the despatch of

troops, and of magistrates in command of them, was always the
signal for revolutionary movements of some sort or another.
He knew, too, that of all the citizens Leptines
enjoyed the highest position and credit, and that
among the common people especially he was
by far the most influential man existing. He
accordingly contracted a relationship by marriage with him, that
he might have a representative of his interests left at home at
such times as he should be himself bound to go abroad with
the troops for a campaign. After marrying the daughter of

Centuripa, and drew up his line resting on the

had got rid of the mutinous and seditious element in the army;

which I have just stated, to a complete defeat

an embassy to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to offer a surrender of their city, and to
beg assistance on the ground of the ties of race which united
them. The Romans were long in doubt. The inconsistency
of sending such aid seemed manifest. A little while ago they
had put some of their own citizens to death, with the extreme
penalties of the law, for having broken faith with the people
of <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>: and now so soon afterwards
to assist the Mamertines, who had done precisely the same to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> as well as <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>,
involved a breach of equity very hard to
justify. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The motives of the Romans in acceding to this prayer,&mdash;jealousy of the growing power of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.</note>
But while fully alive to these points,
they yet saw that Carthaginian aggrandisement
was not confined to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, but had embraced many districts in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> as well; and that <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> was, besides,
mistress of all the islands in the Sardinian and Tyrrhenian seas:
they were beginning, therefore, to be exceedingly anxious lest,
if the Carthaginians became masters of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> also, they should
find them very dangerous and formidable neighbours, surrounding them as they would on every side, and occupying a
position which commanded all the coasts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Now it was
clear that, if the Mamertines did not obtain the assistance
they asked for, the Carthaginians would very soon reduce
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. For should they avail themselves of the voluntary
offer of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and become masters of it, they were certain
before long to crush <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> also, since they were already

motives proved too strong, after all, to allow of
the Senate coming to any decision; for the inconsistency of aiding the Messenians appeared
to them to be evenly balanced by the advantages
to be gained by doing so. The people, however,
had suffered much from the previous wars, and
wanted some means of repairing the losses which they had sustained in every department. Besides these national advantages
to be gained by the war, the military commanders suggested
that individually they would get manifest and important benefits
from it. They accordingly voted in favour of giving the aid. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-264">264</date>. Appius Claudius Caudex. M. Fulvius Flaccus, Coss.</note> The

and false representations, to oust the Carthaginian commander
who was already in possession of the citadel, invited Appius

thinking it a favourable opportunity for totally

the Chalcidian Mount, whereby the garrison were cut off from
that way out as well as from the other. The Roman Consul
Appius, for his part, gallantly crossed the strait by night and
got into <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. But he found that the enemy had completely surrounded the town and were vigorously pressing on
the attack; and he concluded on reflection that the siege
could bring him neither credit nor security so long as the enemy
commanded land as well as sea. He accordingly first endeavoured
<pb n="12"/>to relieve the Mamertines from the contest altogether
by sending embassies to both of the attacking forces. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">After vain attempts at negotiation, Appius determines to attack Hiero.</note> Neither

<p>Next morning, when Appius was assured of their

made up his mind to attack the Carthaginians
without delay. Accordingly, he issued orders
to the soldiers to despatch their preparations
early, and at daybreak commenced his sally.
Having succeeded in engaging the enemy, he killed a large
number of them, and forced the rest to fly precipitately to the
neighbouring towns. These successes sufficed to raise the
siege of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>: and thenceforth he scoured the territory of
<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and her allies with impunity, and laid it waste without finding any one to dispute the possession of the open

<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; and this was the period at which it took

the Romans, after the disaster which they sustained in the loss of
their own city, began their upward career; and how and when,

the idea of attempting conquests external to it. This must
account in future parts of my work for my taking, when treating of the most important states, a preliminary survey of their
previous history. In doing so my object will be to secure
such a vantage-ground as will enable us to see with clearness
from what origin, at what period, and in what circumstances
they severally started and arrived at their present position.

to come to my subject, after a brief and summary statement of the events of which my introductory books are to treat. Of these the first
in order of time are those which befell the
Romans and Carthaginians in their war for the
possession of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. Next comes the Libyan or
Mercenary war; immediately following on which
are the Carthaginian achievements in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>,
first under Hamilcar, and then under Hasdrubal. In the course of these events, again,
occurred the first expedition of the Romans
into <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName> and the Greek side of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>; and,
besides that, their struggles within <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with
the Celts. In <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> at the same time the
war called after Cleomenes was in full action.
With this war I design to conclude my prefatory sketch and my second book.</p>
<p>To enter into minute details of these events is unnecessary,
and would be of no advantage to my readers. It is not part
of my plan to write a history of them: my sole object is to
recapitulate them in a summary manner by way of introduction to the narrative I have in hand. I will, therefore,
touch lightly upon the leading events of this period in a comprehensive sketch, and will endeavour to make the end of it
dovetail with the commencement of my main history. In this
<pb n="14"/>
way the narrative will acquire a continuity; and I shall be shown
to have had good reason for touching on points already treated by
others: while by such an arrangement the studiously inclined
will find the approach to the story which has to be told made
intelligible and easy for them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The first Punic war deserves more detailed treatment, as furnishing a better basis for comparing <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> than subsequent wars.</note> I shall, however,
endeavour to describe with somewhat more
care the first war which arose between the
Romans and Carthaginians for the possession
of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. For it would not be easy to mention any war that lasted longer than this one;
nor one in which the preparations made were
on a larger scale, or the efforts made more
sustained, or the actual engagements more numerous, or the
reverses sustained on either side more signal. Moreover,
the two states themselves were at the precise period of their
history when their institutions were as yet in their original integrity, their fortunes still at a moderate level, and their forces
on an equal footing. So that those who wish to gain a fair
view of the national characteristics and resources of the two
had better base their comparison upon this war rather than
upon those which came after.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Philinus and Fabius Pictor</head>
<p>But it was not these considerations only which induced me to undertake the history of this war.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">This is rendered more necessary by the partisan misrepresentations of Philinus and Fabius Pictor.</note>
I was influenced quite as much by the fact
that Philinus and Fabius, who have the reputation of writing with the most complete knowledge about it, have given us an inadequate
representation of the truth. Now, judging from
their lives and principles, I do not suppose that these writers
have intentionally stated what was false; but I think that they
are much in the same state of mind as men in love. Partisanship and complete prepossession made Philinus think that
all the actions of the Carthaginians were characterised by
wisdom, honour, and courage: those of the Romans by the
reverse. Fabius thought the exact opposite. Now in other
relations of life one would hesitate to exclude such warmth of
sentiment: for a good man ought to be loyal to his friends
and patriotic to his country; ought to be at one with his
friends in their hatreds and likings. But directly a man
<pb n="15"/>
assumes the moral attitude of an historian he ought to forget all
considerations of that kind. There will be many occasions
on which he will be bound to speak well of his enemies, and
even to praise them in the highest terms if the facts demand
it: and on the other hand many occasions on which it will be
his duty to criticise and denounce his own side, however dear
to him, if their errors of conduct suggest that course. For as
a living creature is rendered wholly useless if deprived of its
eyes, so if you take truth from History what is left is but an
idle unprofitable tale. Therefore, one must not shrink either
from blaming one's friends or praising one's enemies; nor be
afraid of finding fault with and commending the same persons
at different times. For it is impossible that men engaged in
public affairs should always be right, and unlikely that they
should always be wrong. Holding ourselves, therefore, entirely
aloof from the actors, we must as historians make statements
and pronounce judgment in accordance with the actions themselves.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Misrepresentations of Philinus and Fabius</head>
<p>The writers whom I have named exemplify the truth
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philinus's misrepresentations.</note>
of these remarks. Philinus, for instance, commencing the narrative with his second book,
says that the "Carthaginians and Syracusans
engaged in the war and sat down before <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>; that the
Romans arriving by sea entered the town, and immediately
sallied out from it to attack the Syracusans; but that after
suffering severely in the engagement they retired into <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>;
and that on a second occasion, having issued forth to attack
the Carthaginians, they not only suffered severely but lost a
considerable number of their men captured by the enemy."
But while making this statement, he represents Hiero as so
destitute of sense as, after this engagement, not only to have
promptly burnt his stockade and tents and fled under cover of
night to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, but to have abandoned all the forts which
had been established to overawe the Messenian territory.
Similarly he asserts that "the Carthaginians immediately after
their battle evacuated their entrenchment and dispersed into
various towns, without venturing any longer even to dispute
the possession of the open country; and that, accordingly,
their leaders seeing that their troops were utterly demoralised
<pb n="16"/>
determined in consideration not to risk a battle: that the
Romans followed them, and not only laid waste the territory
of the Carthaginians and Syracusans, but actually sat down
before <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> itself and began to lay siege to it." These
statements appear to me to be full of glaring inconsistency,
and to call for no refutation at all. The very men whom he
describes to begin with as besieging <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, and as victorious
in the engagements, he afterwards represents as running away,
abandoning the open country, and utterly demoralised:
while those whom he starts by saying were defeated and
besieged, he concludes by describing as engaging in a pursuit,
as promptly seizing the open places, and finally as besieging
<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. Nothing can reconcile these statements. It is impossible. Either his initial statement, or his account of the
subsequent events, must be false. In point of fact the latter
part of his story is the true one. The Syracusans and Carthaginians <emph>did</emph> abandon the open country, and the Romans <emph>did</emph>
immediately afterwards commence a siege of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and
of <placeName key="perseus,Echetla">Echetla</placeName>, which lies in the district between the Syracusan
and Carthaginian pales. For the rest it must necessarily be
acknowledged that the first part of his account is false; and
that whereas the Romans were victorious in the engagements
under <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, they have been represented by this historian
as defeated. Through the whole of this work we shall find
Philinus acting in a similar spirit: and much the same may be
said of Fabius, as I shall show when the several points arise.</p>
<p>I have now said what was proper on the subject of this
digression. Returning to the matter in hand I will endeavour
by a continuous narrative of moderate dimensions to guide
my readers to a true knowledge of this war.</p></div2>

Hiero began, from a review of all these points, to
conclude that the prospects of the Romans were
brighter than those of the Carthaginians. Inclining therefore
from these considerations to the side of the former, he began
sending messages to the Consuls, proposing peace and friendship
with them. The Romans accepted his offer, their chief motive
being the consideration of provisions: for as the Carthaginians
had command of the sea, they were afraid of being cut off at
every point from their supplies, warned by the fact that the
legions which had previously crossed had run very short in
that respect. They therefore gladly accepted Hiero's offers
of friendship, supposing that he would be of signal service
to them in this particular. The king engaged to restore his
prisoners without ransom, and to pay besides an indemnity of
a hundred talents of silver. The treaty being arranged on
these terms, the Romans thenceforth regarded the Syracusans
as friends and allies: while King Hiero, having thus placed
himself under the protection of the Romans, never failed to
supply their needs in times of difficulty; and for the rest of
his life reigned securely in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, devoting his energies to
gaining the gratitude and good opinion of the Greeks. And in
point of fact no monarch ever acquired a greater reputation,
or enjoyed for a longer period the fruits of his prudent policy

thereupon decided not to send all their forces,
as they had intended doing, but only two
legions. For they thought that the gravity of
the war was lessened by the adhesion of the
king, and at the same time that the army would thus be
better off for provisions. But when the Carthaginian government saw that Hiero had become their enemy, and that the
<pb n="18"/>
Romans were taking a more decided part in Sicilian politics,
they conceived that they must have a more formidable force
to enable them to confront their enemy and
maintain their own interests in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">They select <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> as their headquarters.</note> Accordingly, they enlisted mercenaries from over sea

perceiving that <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> possessed the greatest natural advantages as a place of arms, and was the most powerful city in
their province, they collected their supplies and their forces into
it, deciding to use this city as their headquarters for the war.</p>
<p>On the Roman side <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-262">262</date>.</note> a change of commanders had now
taken place. The Consuls who made the
treaty with Hiero had gone home, and their
successors, Lucius Postumius and Quintus Mamilius, were
come to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> with their legions. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The new Consuls, Lucius Postumius Megellus and Quintus Mamilius Vitulus, determine to lay siege to <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>.</note> Observing
the measure which the Carthaginians were taking, and the forces they were concentrating at
<placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, they made up their minds to take

Accordingly they suspended every other department of the war, and bearing down upon <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> itself with their whole army, attacked it in force; pitched their
camp within a distance of eight stades from the city; and confined the Carthaginians within the walls. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Carthaginians make an unsuccessful sally.</note> Now
it was just harvest-time, and the siege was
evidently destined to be a long one: the
soldiers, therefore, went out to collect the corn with greater
hardihood than they ought to have done. Accordingly the
Carthaginians, seeing the enemy scattered about the fields,
sallied out and attacked the harvesting-parties. They easily
routed these; and then one portion of them made a rush to
destroy the Roman entrenchment, the other to attack the
pickets. But the peculiarity of their institutions saved the
Roman fortunes, as it had often done before. Among them it
is death for a man to desert his post, or to fly from his station
on any pretext whatever. Accordingly on this, as on other
occasions, they gallantly held their ground against opponents
many times their own number; and though they lost many of
<pb n="19"/>
their own men, they killed still more of the enemy, and at last
outflanked the foes just as they were on the point of demolishing the palisade of the camp. Some they put to the sword,
and the rest they pursued with slaughter into the city.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c18" type="chapter" n="18">
<head>Relief Comes from <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName></head>
<p>The result was that thenceforth the Carthaginians were
somewhat less forward in making such attacks, and the Romans
more cautious in foraging.</p>
<p>Finding that the Carthaginians would not come out to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans form two strongly-entrenched camps.</note>
meet them at close quarters any more, the
Roman generals divided their forces: with one
division they occupied the ground round the
temple of Asclepius outside the town; with the
other they encamped in the outskirts of the city on the side
which looks towards Heracleia. The space between the
camps on either side of the city they secured by two trenches,
&mdash;the inner one to protect themselves against sallies from the
city, the outer as a precaution against attacks from without,
and to intercept those persons or supplies which always
make their way surreptitiously into cities that are sustaining
a siege. The spaces between the trenches uniting the camps
they secured by pickets, taking care in their disposition to
strengthen the several accessible points. As for food and other
war material, the other allied cities all joined in collecting and
bringing these to Herbesus for them: and thus they supplied
themselves in abundance with necessaries, by continually
getting provisions living and dead from this town, which was
conveniently near. For about five months then they remained in the same position, without being able to obtain
any decided advantage over each other beyond the casualties
which occurred in the skirmishes. But the Carthaginians
were beginning to be hard pressed by hunger, owing to the
number of men shut up in the city, who amounted to no less
than fifty thousand: and Hannibal, who had been appointed
commander of the besieged forces, beginning by this time to
be seriously alarmed at the state of things, kept perpetually
sending messages to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> explaining their critical state,
and begging for assistance. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A relief comes from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>.</note>Thereupon the

that the Romans found themselves in the position of besieged
as much as in that of besiegers; for they were reduced by
short supplies of food and scarcity of necessaries to such a
condition that they more than once contemplated raising the
siege. And they would have done so at last
had not Hiero, by using every effort and contrivance imaginable, succeeded in keeping them
supplied with what satisfied, to a tolerable extent, their most
pressing wants. This was Hanno's first step. His next was

of which he had about fifty, and the whole of
the rest of his army, and advanced at a rapid
pace from Heracleia; having previously issued
orders to the Numidian cavalry to precede him,
and to endeavour, when they came near the enemies' stockade,
to provoke them and draw their cavalry out; and, having
done so, to wheel round and retire until they met him. The
Numidians did as they were ordered, and advanced up to one
of the camps. Immediately the Roman cavalry poured out
and boldly charged the Numidians: the Libyans retired, according to their orders, until they reached Hanno's division:
then they wheeled round; surrounded, and repeatedly charged
the enemy; killed a great number of them, and chased the
rest up to their stockade. After this affair Hanno's force
encamped over against the Romans, having seized the hill
called Torus, at a distance of about a mile and a quarter from
their opponents. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">After two months, Hanno is forced to try to relieve <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, but is defeated in a pitched battle, and his army cut to pieces.</note> For two months they remained in position without any decisive action,
though skirmishes took place daily. But as
<pb n="21"/>
Hannibal all this time kept signalling and
sending messages from the town to Hanno,&mdash;
telling him that his men were impatient of the famine, and
that many were even deserting to the enemy owing to the
distress for food,&mdash;the Carthaginian general determined to
risk a battle, the Romans being equally ready,
for the reasons I have mentioned.  So both
parties advanced into the space between the
camps and engaged. The battle lasted a
long time, but at last the Romans turned the advanced
guard of Carthaginian mercenaries. The latter fell back
upon the-elephants and the other divisions posted in their
rear; and thus the whole Punic army was thrown into confusion. The retreat became general: the larger number of
the men were killed, while some effected their escape into
Heracleia; and the Romans became masters of most of the
elephants and all the baggage. Now night came on, and the
victors, partly from joy at their success, partly from fatigue,
kept their watches somewhat more carelessly than usual; accordingly Hannibal, having given up hope of
holding out, made up his mind that this state
of things afforded him a good opportunity of
escape. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal escapes by night; and the Romans enter and plunder <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>.</note>He started about midnight from the
town with his mercenary troops, and having
choked up the trenches with baskets stuffed full of chaff, led
off his force in safety, without being detected by the enemy.
When day dawned the Romans discovered what had happened,
and indeed for a short time were engaged with Hannibal's rear;
but eventually they all made for the town gates. There they
found no one to oppose them: they therefore threw themselves
into the town, plundered it, and secured a large number of
captives, besides a great booty of every sort and description.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c20" type="chapter" n="20">
<head>The Romans Build Ships</head>
<p>Great was the joy of the Roman Senate when the news
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">This success inspires the Senate with the idea of expelling the Carthaginians from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note>
of what had taken place at <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> arrived.
Their ideas too were so raised that they no longer
confined themselves to their original designs.
They were not content with having saved the
Mamertines, nor with the advantages gained
in the course of the war; but conceived the
<pb n="22"/>
idea that it was possible to expel the Carthaginians entirely
from the island, and that if that were done their own power
would receive a great increase: they accordingly engaged in
this policy and directed their whole thoughts to this subject.
As to their land forces they saw that things were going on as
well as they could wish. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-261">261</date>.</note> For the Consuls elected
in succession to those who had besieged
<placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Titus Otacilius
Crassus, appeared to be managing the Sicilian business as well
as circumstances admitted. Yet so long as the Carthaginians
were in undisturbed command of the sea, the balance of
success could not incline decisively in their favour. For
instance, in the period which followed, though they were now
in possession of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>, and though consequently many
of the inland towns joined the Romans from dread of their
land forces, yet a still larger number of seaboard towns held
aloof from them in terror of the Carthaginian fleet. Seeing
therefore that it was ever more and more the case that the
balance of success oscillated from one side to the other from
these causes; and, moreover, that while <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was repeatedly
ravaged by the naval force, <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> remained permanently uninjured; they became eager to get upon the sea and meet the
Carthaginians there.</p>
<p>It was this branch of the subject that more than anything else induced me to give an account of this war at somewhat greater length than I otherwise should have done. I was
unwilling that a first step of this kind should be unknown,&mdash;
namely how, and when, and why the Romans first started a navy.</p>
<p>It was, then, because they saw that the war they had undertaken lingered to a weary length, that they first
thought of getting a fleet built, consisting of a
hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes. But
one part of their undertaking caused them
much difficulty. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans boldly determine to build ships and meet the Carthaginians at sea.</note> Their shipbuilders were entirely
unacquainted with the construction of quinqueremes, because no one in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> had at that time employed
vessels of that description. There could be no more signal
proof of the courage, or rather the extraordinary audacity of
the Roman enterprise. Not only had they no resources for it
<pb n="23"/>
of reasonable sufficiency; but without any resources for it at
all, and without having ever entertained an idea of naval war,&mdash;
for it was the first time they had thought of it,&mdash;they nevertheless handled the enterprise with such extraordinary audacity,
that, without so much as a preliminary trial, they took upon
themselves there and then to meet the Carthaginians at sea,
on which they had for generations held undisputed supremacy.
Proof of what I say, and of their surprising audacity, may be
found in this. When they first took in hand to send troops
across to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> they not only had no decked vessels but
no war-ships at all, not so much as a single galley: but they
borrowed quinqueremes and triremes from <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> and
<placeName key="perseus,Locri">Locri</placeName>, and even from <placeName key="perseus,Elea">Elea</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1094981">Neapolis</placeName>; and having thus
collected a fleet, boldly sent their men across upon it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A Carthaginian ship used as a model.</note> It
was on this occasion that, the Carthaginians
having put to sea in the Strait to attack them,
a decked vessel of theirs charged so furiously
that it ran aground, and falling into the hands of the Romans
served them as a model on which they constructed their whole
fleet. And if this had not happened it is clear that they would
have been completely hindered from carrying out their design
by want of constructive knowledge.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c21" type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Gn. Cornelius Scipio Asina Surrenders</head>
<p>Meanwhile, however, those who were charged with the
shipbuilding were busied with the construction of the vessels;
while others collected crews and were engaged in teaching
them to row on dry land: which they contrived to do in the
following manner. They made the men sit on rower's benches
on dry land, in the same order as they would sit on the benches
in actual vessels: in the midst of them they stationed the
Celeustes, and trained them to get back and draw in their
hands all together in time, and then to swing forward and
throw them out again, and to begin and cease these movements at the word of the Celeustes. By the time these
preparations were completed the ships were built. They
therefore launched them, and, after a brief preliminary practice
of real sea-rowing, started on their coasting

he sailed with the above-mentioned ships and
anchored off the town. But having been informed in <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> of what had taken place, the Carthaginian general
Hannibal despatched Bo&omacr;des, a member of the Senate, with
a squadron of twenty ships. He accomplished the voyage at
night and shut up Gnaeus and his men within the harbour.
When day dawned the crews made for the shore and ran
away, while Gnaeus, in utter dismay, and not knowing in the
least what to do, eventually surrendered to the enemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The rest of the Roman fleet arrive and nearly capture Hannibal.</note> The

afterwards, though the disaster of Gnaeus was

within an ace of falling into the same glaring mistake. For
having been informed that the Roman fleet in its voyage along
the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> was close at hand, he conceived a wish to
get a clear view of the enemy's number and disposition. He
accordingly set sail with fifty ships, and just as he was rounding the "Italian Headland" he fell in with the enemy, who
were sailing in good order and disposition. He lost most
of his ships, and with the rest effected his own escape in a
manner beyond hope or expectation.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c22" type="chapter" n="22">
<head>The Victory of <placeName key="tgn,7003904">Mylae</placeName></head>
<p>When the Romans had neared the coasts of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and
learnt the disaster which had befallen Gnaeus, their first step
was to send for Gaius Duilius, who was in command of the
land forces. Until he should come they stayed where they
were; but at the same time, hearing that the enemy's fleet was
no great way off, they busied themselves with preparations
for a sea-fight. Now their ships were badly fitted out and
not easy to manage, and so some one suggested to them as
<pb n="25"/>
likely to serve their turn in a fight the construction of what
were afterwards called "crows." Their mechanism was this. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The "<foreign lang="la">corvi</foreign>" or "crows," for boarding,</note> A round pole was placed in the
prow, about twenty-four feet high, and with a
diameter of four palms. The pole itself had a pulley on the
top, and a gangway made with cross planks nailed together,
four feet wide and thirty-six feet long, was made to swing round
it. Now the hole in the gangway was oval shaped, and went
round the pole twelve feet from one end of the gangway, which
had also a wooden railing running down each side of it to
the height of a man's knee. At the extremity of this gangway was fastened an iron spike like a miller's pestle,
sharpened at its lower end and fitted with a ring at its
upper end. The whole thing looked like the machines for
braising corn. To this ring the rope was fastened with
which, when the ships collided, they hauled up the "crows,"
by means of the pulley at the top of the pole, and dropped
them down upon the deck of the enemy's ship, sometimes over
the prow, sometimes swinging them round when the ships
collided broadsides. And as soon as the "crows" were fixed
in the planks of the decks and grappled the ships together, if
the ships were alongside of each other, the men leaped on
board anywhere along the side, but if they were prow to prow,
they used the "crow" itself for boarding, and advanced over
it two abreast. The first two protected their front by holding
up before them their shields, while those who came after
them secured their sides by placing the rims of their shields
upon the top of the railing. Such were the preparations
which they made; and having completed them they watched
an opportunity of engaging at sea.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Operations in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName></head>
<p>As for Gaius Duilius, he no sooner heard of the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Victory of Duilius at <placeName key="tgn,7003904">Mylae</placeName>, B. C. <date value="-260">260</date>.</note>
disaster which had befallen the commander of
the navy than handing over his legions to the
military Tribunes he transferred himself to the
fleet. There he learnt that the enemy was
plundering the territory of <placeName key="tgn,7003904">Mylae</placeName>, and at once sailed to attack
him with the whole fleet. No sooner did the Carthaginians
sight him than with joy and alacrity they put to sea with a
hundred and thirty sail, feeling supreme contempt for the
<pb n="26"/>
Roman ignorance of seamanship. Accordingly they all sailed
with their prows directed straight at their enemy: they did not
think the engagement worth even the trouble of ranging their
ships in any order, but advanced as though to seize a booty
exposed for their acceptance. Their commander was that
same Hannibal who had withdrawn his forces from <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> by a secret night movement, and he was on board a
galley with seven banks of oars which had once belonged to
King Pyrrhus. When they neared the enemy, and saw the
"crows" raised aloft on the prows of the several ships, the
Carthaginians were for a time in a state of perplexity; for they
were quite strangers to such contrivances as these engines.
Feeling, however, a complete contempt for their opponents,
those on board the ships that were in the van of the squadron
charged without flinching. But as soon as they came to
close quarters their ships were invariably tightly grappled
by these machines; the enemy boarded by means of the
"crows," and engaged them on their decks; and in the end
some of the Carthaginians were cut down, while others surrendered in bewildered terror at the battle in which they
found themselves engaged, which eventually became exactly
like a land fight. The result was that they lost the first
thirty ships engaged, crews and all. Among them was captured the commander's ship also, though Hannibal himself
by an unexpected piece of luck and an act of great daring
effected his escape in the ship's boat. The rest of the Carthaginian squadron were sailing up with the view of charging; but as they were coming near they saw what had
happened to the ships which were sailing in the front, and
accordingly sheered off and avoided the blows of the engines.
Yet trusting to their speed, they managed by a man&oelig;uvre to
sail round and charge the enemy, some on their broadside
and others on their stern, expecting by that method to avoid
danger. But the engines swung round to meet them in
every direction, and dropped down upon them so infallibly,
that no ships could come to close quarters without being
grappled. Eventually the Carthaginians turned and fled, bewildered at the novelty of the occurrence, and with a loss of
fifty ships.

He passed the word to the crews of his own

enemy were still embarking, others were already putting
out to sea, and that the advanced squadron were considerably ahead of the rest, they stood round and went to
meet them. They succeeded in surrounding and destroying
all of them except the Consul's ship, and that they all but
captured with its crew. This last, however, by the perfection
of its rowers and its consequent speed, effected a desperate
escape. Meanwhile the remaining ships of the Romans were
sailing up and gradually drawing close together. Having got
into line, they charged the enemy, took ten ships with their
crews, and sunk eight. The rest of the Carthaginian ships
retired to the Liparean Islands.</p>
<p>The result of this battle was that both sides concluded that <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Winter of B.C. <dateRange from="-257" to="-256">257</dateRange>-<date value="-256">256</date>.</note>
they were now fairly matched, and accordingly made more

<div2 id="b1c26" type="chapter" n="26">
<head>Preparations for Battle</head>
<p>Now it was the purpose of the Romans to sail across
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Preparations for the Battle of Ecnomus.</note>
to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> and transfer the war there, in order
that the Carthaginians might find the danger
affecting themselves and their own country
rather than <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. But the Carthaginians were determined to
prevent this. They knew that <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> was easily invaded, and
that the invaders if they once effected a landing would meet
with little resistance from the inhabitants; and they therefore
made up their minds not to allow it, and were eager rather to
bring the matter to a decisive issue by a battle at sea. The
one side was determined to cross, the other to prevent their
crossing; and their enthusiastic rivalry gave promise of a
desperate struggle. The preparations of the Romans were
made to suit either contingency, an engagement at sea or a
disembarkation on the enemy's soil. Accordingly they picked
out the best hands from the land army and divided the whole
force which they meant to take on board into four divisions. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Roman forces. 330 ships, with average of 420 men (300 rowers + 120 marines) = 138,600 men.</note>
Each division had alternative titles; the first
was called the "First Legion" or the "First
Squadron,"&mdash;and so on with the others. The
fourth had a third title besides. They were
called "Triarii," on the analogy of land armies.
The total number of men thus making up
the naval force amounted to nearly one hundred and forty
thousand, reckoning each ship as carrying three hundred
rowers and one hundred and twenty soldiers. The Carthaginans, on the other hand, made their preparations almost exclusively with a view to a naval engagement. Their numbers,
if we reckon by the number of their ships, were
over one hundred and fifty thousand men. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Carthaginian numbers, 150,000 men.</note> The
mere recital of these figures must, I should
imagine, strike any one with astonishment at the magnitude of
the struggle, and the vast resources of the contending states.
An actual view of them itself could hardly be more impressive
than the bare statement of the number of men and ships.
<pb n="30"/></p>
<p>Now the Romans had two facts to consider: First, that
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman order at Ecnomus.</note>
circumstances compelled them to face the open
sea; and, secondly, that their enemies had the
advantage of fast sailing vessels. They therefore took every precaution for keeping their line unbroken
and difficult to attack. They had only two ships with six
banks of oars, those, namely, on which the Consuls Marcus
Atilius and Lucius Manlius respectively were sailing. These
they stationed side by side in front and in a line with each other.
Behind each of these they stationed ships one behind the other
in single file&mdash;the first squadron behind the one, and the
second squadron behind the other. These were so arranged
that, as each ship came to its place, the two files diverged
farther and farther from each other; the vessels being also
stationed one behind the other with their prows inclining outwards. Having thus arranged the first and second squadrons
in single file so as to form a wedge, they stationed the third
division in a single line at its base; so that the whole finally
presented the appearance of a triangle. Behind this base they
stationed the horse-transports, attaching them by towing-ropes
to the ships of the third squadron. And to the rear of them
they placed the fourth squadron, called the Triarii, in a single
line, so extended as to overlap the line in front of them at both
extremities. When these dispositions were complete the
general appearance was that of a beak or wedge, the apex of
which was open, the base compact and strong; while the
whole was easy to work and serviceable, and at the same time
difficult to break up.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c27" type="chapter" n="27">
<head>The Battle of Ecnomus</head>
<p>Meanwhile the Carthaginian commanders had briefly
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The disposition of the Carthaginian fleet.</note>
addressed their men. They pointed out to
them that victory in this battle would ensure the war in the future being confined to
the question of the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; while
if they were beaten they would have hereafter to fight for their
native land and for all that they held dear. With these words
they passed the word to embark. The order was obeyed
with universal enthusiasm, for what had been said brought
home to them the issues at stake; and they put to sea in
the full fervour of excited gallantry, which might well have
<pb n="31"/>
struck terror into all who saw it. When their commanders
saw the arrangement of the enemies' ships they adapted
their own to match it. Three-fourths of their force they
posted in a single line, extending their right wing towards the
open sea with a view of outflanking their opponents, and
placing their ships with prows facing the enemy; while the
other fourth part was posted to form a left wing of the whole, the
vessels being at right angles to the others and close to the shore.
The two Carthaginian commanders were Hanno and Hamilcar.
The former was the general who had been defeated in the engagement at <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><ref target="b1c19" targOrder="U">ch. 19</ref>.</note> He
now commanded the right wing, supported by beaked vessels
for charging, and the fastest sailing quinqueremes for outflanking, the enemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><ref target="b1c25" targOrder="U">ch. 25</ref>.</note> The latter, who had been
in the engagement off <placeName key="perseus,Tyndaris">Tyndaris</placeName>, had charge of
the left wing. This officer, occupying the central position of
the entire line, on this occasion employed a stratagem which
I will now describe. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle.</note> The battle began by the
Romans charging the centre of the Carthaginians, because they observed that it was weakened by their
great extension. The ships in the Carthaginian centre, in
accordance with their orders, at once turned and fled with a
view of breaking up the Roman close order. They began to
retire with all speed, and the Romans pursued them with exultation. The consequence was that, while the first and second
Roman squadrons were pressing the flying enemy, the third and
fourth "legions" had become detached and were left behind,
&mdash;the former because they had to tow the horse-transports,
and the "Triarii" because they kept their station with them
and helped them to form a reserve. But when the Carthaginians thought that they had drawn the first and second squadron
a sufficient distance from the main body a signal was hoisted
on board Hamilcar's ship, and they all simultaneously swung
their ships round and engaged their pursuers. The contest
was a severe one. The Carthaginians had a great superiority
in the rapidity with which they man&oelig;uvred their ships. They
darted out from their line and rowed round the enemy: they
approached them with ease, and retired with despatch. But
the Romans, no less than the Carthaginians, had their reasons
<pb n="32"/>
for entertaining hopes of victory: for when the vessels got
locked together the contest became one of sheer strength:
their engines, the "crows," grappled all that once came to

person and were witnesses of their behaviour in battle.</p></div2>

<head>The Siege of Aspis</head>
<p>This was the state of affairs on the centre. But
meanwhile Hanno with the right wing, which had held aloof
when the first encounter took place, crossing the open sea,
charged the ships of the Triarii and caused them great
difficulty and embarrassment: while those of the Carthaginians
who had been posted near the land man&oelig;uvred into line,
and getting their ships straight, charged the men who were
towing the horse-transports. These latter let go the towingropes, grappled with the enemy, and kept up a desperate
struggle.</p>
<p>So that the engagement was in three separate divisions,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Three separate battles.</note>
or rather there were three sea-fights going on at
wide intervals from each other. Now in these
three engagements the opposing parties were in
each case fairly matched, thanks to the original disposition of
the ships, and therefore the victory was in each case closely
contested. However the result in the several cases was very
much what was to be expected where forces were so equal.

engaged in securing his prizes, Marcus observing the struggle
in which the Triarii and horse-transports were involved, went
with all speed to their assistance, taking with him all the
ships of the second squadron which were undamaged. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Second squadron under Regulus.</note> As soon as he had reached and

picked up courage, though they were then getting much

fight. It was now the turn for the Carthaginians to be in
difficulties. They were charged in front and on the rear,
and found to their surprise that they were being surrounded
by the relieving squadron. They at once gave way and
retreated in the direction of the open sea.
<pb n="33"/></p>
<p>While this was going on, Lucius, who was sailing back to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Third squadron relieved by Regulus and Manlius.</note>
rejoin his colleague, observed that the third
squadron had got wedged in by the Carthaginians close in shore. Accordingly he and
Marcus, who had by this time secured the safety of the transports and Triarii, started together to relieve their imperilled
comrades, who were now sustaining something very like a
blockade. And the fact is that they would long before this
have been utterly destroyed had not the Carthaginians been
afraid of the "crows," and confined themselves to surrounding
and penning them in close to land, without attempting to
charge for fear of being caught by the grappling-irons. The
Consuls came up rapidly, and surrounding the Carthaginians
captured fifty of their ships with their crews, while some few
of them managed to slip away and escape by keeping close
to the shore.</p>
<p>Such was the result of the separate engagements. But the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">General result.</note>
general upshot of the whole battle was in favour
of the Romans. Twenty-four of their vessels were
destroyed; over thirty of the Carthaginians. Not a single
Roman ship was captured with its crew; sixty-four of the
Carthaginians were so taken.</p></div2>

<head>The Siege of Aspis</head>
<p>After the battle the Romans took in a fresh supply of
victual, repaired and refitted the ships they had captured,
bestowed upon the crews the attention which they had
deserved by their victory, and then put to sea with a view
of continuing their voyage to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. Their leading ships made
the shore just under the headland called the Hermaeum, which
is the extreme point on the east of the Gulf of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, and
runs out into the open sea in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Siege of Aspis. (Clupea.)</note> There
they waited for the rest of the ships to come up, and having
got the entire fleet together coasted along until
they came to the city called Aspis. Here they
disembarked, beached their ships, dug a trench,
and constructed a stockade round them; and on the inhabitants of the city refusing to submit without compulsion,
they set to work to besiege the town. Presently those of the
Carthaginians who had survived the sea-fight came to land
also; and feeling sure that the enemy, in the flush of their
<pb n="34"/>
victory, intended to sail straight against <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> itself, they
began by keeping a chain of advanced guards at outlying
points to protect the capital with their military and naval
forces. But when they ascertained that the Romans had
disembarked without resistance and were engaged in besieging Aspis, they gave up the idea of watching for the
descent of the fleet; but concentrated their forces, and devoted themselves to the protection of the capital and its
environs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Romans had taken Aspis, had placed in it a<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aspis taken.</note>
garrison to hold it and its territory, and had
besides sent home to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to announce the
events which had taken place and to ask for instructions as
to the future,&mdash;what they were to do, and what arrangements
they were to make. Having done this they made active
preparations for a general advance and set about plundering
the country. They met with no opposition in this: they
destroyed numerous dwelling houses of remarkably fine construction, possessed themselves of a great number of cattle;
and captured more than twenty thousand slaves whom they
took to their ships. In the midst of these proceedings the
messengers arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with orders that one Consul
was to remain with an adequate force, the other was to bring
the fleet to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">M. Atilius Regulus remains in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, winter of B. C. <dateRange from="-256" to="-255">256</dateRange>-<date value="-255">255</date>.</note> Accordingly Marcus was

<p>The Carthaginians now saw that their enemies contemplated a lengthened occupation of the country. They
therefore proceeded first of all to elect two of their own
citizens, Hasdrubal son of Hanno, and Bostarus, to the office
of general; and next sent to Heracleia a pressing summons to
Hamilcar. He obeyed immediately, and arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>
with five hundred cavalry and five thousand infantry. He was
forthwith appointed general in conjunction with the other two,
and entered into consultation with Hasdrubal and his colleague
as to the measures necessary to be taken in the present crisis.

They decided to defend the country and not to allow it to be

<p>A few days afterwards Marcus sallied forth on one of his<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. 256-<date value="-255">255</date>. The operations of Regulus in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>.</note>
marauding expeditions. Such towns as were
unwalled he carried by assault and plundered,
and such as were walled he besieged. Among
others he came to the considerable town of Adys, and having
placed his troops round it was beginning with all speed to raise
siege works. The Carthaginians were both eager to relieve
the town and determined to dispute the possession of the open
county. They therefore led out their army; but their operations were not skilfully conducted. They indeed seized and
encamped upon a piece of rising ground which commanded
the enemy; but it was unsuitable to themselves. Their best
hopes rested on their cavalry and their elephants, and yet they
abandoned the level plain and cooped themselves up in a position at once steep and difficult of access. The enemy, as might
have been expected, were not slow to take advantage of this
mistake. The Roman commanders were skilful enough to
understand that the best and most formidable part of the forces
opposed to them was rendered useless by the nature of the
ground. They did not therefore wait for them to come down
to the plain and offer battle, but choosing the time which
suited themselves, began at daybreak a forward movement on
both sides of the hill. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Defeat of the Carthaginians near Adys.</note> In the battle which
followed the Carthaginians could not use their
cavalry or elephants at all; but their mercenary
troops made a really gallant and spirited sally. They even
forced the first division of the Romans to give way and fly:
but they advanced too far, and were surrounded and routed by
the division which was advancing from the other direction.
This was immediately followed by the whole force being
dislodged from their encampment. The elephants and cavalry
as soon as they gained level ground made good their retreat
without loss; but the infantry were pursued by the Romans.
The latter however soon desisted from the pursuit. They
presently returned, dismantled the enemy's entrenchment, and
destroyed the stockade; and from thenceforth overran the
whole country-side and sacked the towns without opposition
<pb n="36"/>
Among others they seized the town called Tunes. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Tunes.</note> This place

was not long since they had sustained a disaster
at sea: and now they had met with one on land,
not from any failure of courage on the part of
their soldiers, but from the incompetency of their
commanders. Simultaneously with these misfortunes, they were suffering from an inroad of the Numidians,
who were doing even more damage to the country than the
Romans. The terror which they inspired drove the country
folk to flock for safety into the city; and the city itself had to
face a serious famine as well as a panic, the former from the
numbers that crowded into it, the latter from the hourly
expectation of a siege. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Spring of B. C. 255. Regulus proposes harsh terms.</note> But Regulus had
different views. The double defeat sustained
by the Carthaginians, by land as well as by sea,
convinced him that the capture of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> was a question of
a very short time; and he was in a state of great anxiety lest
his successor in the Consulship should arrive from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in
time to rob him of the glory of the achievement. He therefore invited the Carthaginians to make terms. They were
only too glad of the proposal, and sent their leading citizens
to meet him. The meeting took place: but the commissioners
could not bring their minds to entertain his proposals; they
were so severe that it was almost more than they could bear to
listen to them at all. Regulus regarded himself as practically
master of the city, and considered that they ought to regard
any concession on his part as a matter of favour and pure
grace. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The terms rejected.</note> The Carthaginians on the other hand
concluded that nothing worse could be imposed on them if they suffered capture than was
now enjoined. They therefore returned home without
accepting the offers of Regulus, and extremely exasperated by
his unreasonable harshness. When the Carthaginian Senate
<pb n="37"/>
heard the conditions offered by the Roman general, though
they had almost relinquished every hope of safety, they came
to the gallant and noble resolution that they would brave
anything, that they would try every possible means and endure
every extremity, rather than submit to terms so dishonourable
and so unworthy of their past history.</p></div2>

brought a large number of men with him, and
among them a certain Lacedaemonian named Xanthippus, a
man trained in the Spartan discipline, and of large experience
in war. When this man was informed of their defeat, and of
how it had taken place, and when he had reviewed the military
resources still left to the Carthaginians, and the number of
their cavalry and elephants, he did not take long to come to
a decided conclusion. He expressed his opinion to his friends
that the Carthaginians had owed their defeat, not to the
superiority of the Romans, but to the unskilfulness of their
own commanders. The dangerous state of their affairs caused
the words of Xanthippus to get abroad quickly among the
people and to reach the ears of the generals; and the men in
authority determined to summon and question him. He
appeared, and laid his views before the magistrates; in which
he showed to what they owed their present disasters, and that
if they would take his advice and keep to the flat parts of the
country alike in marching, encamping, and giving battle, they
would be able with perfect ease to secure safety for themselves
and to defeat their opponents in the field. The generals
accepted the suggestion, resolved to follow his advice, and
there and then put their forces at his command. Among the
multitude the observation of Xanthippus was passed from
mouth to mouth, and gave rise, as was to be expected, to
a good deal of popular rumour and sanguine talk. This
was confirmed when he had once handled the troops. The
way in which he got them into order when he had led them
outside the town; the skill with which he man&oelig;uvred the
separate detachments, and passed the word of command
down the ranks in due conformity to the rules of tactics, at
<pb n="38"/>
once impressed every one with the contrast to the blundering
of their former generals. The multitude expressed their
approbation by loud cheers, and were for engaging the enemy
without delay, convinced that no harm could happen to them
as long as Xanthippus was their leader. The generals took
advantage of this circumstance, and of the extraordinary
recovery which they saw had taken place in the spirits of
the people. They addressed them some exhortations befitting the occasion, and after a few days' delay got their
forces on foot and started. Their army consisted of twelve
thousand infantry, four thousand cavalry, and nearly a hundred
elephants.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>The Defeat of Regulus</head>
<p>The Romans at once noticed a change. They saw
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The new strategy of the Carthaginians.</note>
that the Carthaginians chose level country for
their line of march, and flat places for their
encampments. This novelty puzzled and rather
alarmed them, yet their prevailing feeling was an eager desire
to come to close quarters with the enemy. They therefore
advanced to a position about ten stades from them and employed the first day in pitching a camp there. Next day,
while the chief officers of the Carthaginians were discussing
in a council of war what dispositions were called for, and
what line of strategy they were to adopt, the common soldiers,
in their eagerness for the engagement, collected in groups,
shouted out the name of Xanthippus, and showed that their
opinion was in favour of an immediate forward movement.
Influenced by the evident enthusiasm and eagerness of the
army, and by the appeals of Xanthippus that they should not
let the opportunity slip, the generals gave orders to the men
to get ready, and resigned to Xanthippus the entire direction
of affairs, with full authority to act as he thought most advantageous. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The dispositions for the battle.</note> He at once acted upon this authority.
He ordered out the elephants, and placed them
in a single line in front of the whole army.
The heavy phalanx of the Carthaginians he stationed at a
moderate interval in the rear of these. He divided the
mercenaries into three corps. One he stationed on the right
wing; while the other two, which consisted of the most active,
he placed with the cavalry on both wings. When the Romans
<pb n="39"/>
saw that the enemy were drawn up to offer them battle
they readily advanced to accept it. They were however
alarmed at the elephants, and made special arrangements
with a view to resist their charge. They stationed the velites
in the van, and behind them the legionaries, many maniples
deep, while they divided the cavalry between the two wings.
Their line of battle was thus less extended than usual, but
deeper. And though they had thereby made a sufficient provision against the elephants, yet being far out-numbered in
cavalry, their provision in that part of the field was altogether
inadequate. At length both sides had made their dispositions
according to their respective plans of operation, and had placed
their several men in the posts assigned to them: and now they
were standing drawn up in order, and were each of them
watching for the right moment for beginning the attack.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c34" type="chapter" n="34">
<head>Roman Defeat</head>
<p>No sooner had Xanthippus given the order to the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle.</note>
men on the elephants to advance and disperse
the lines in front of them, and to his cavalry to
outflank both wings and charge the enemy, than the Roman
army&mdash;clashing their shields and spears together after their
usual custom, and simultaneously raising their battle-cry&mdash;
charged the enemy. The Roman cavalry being far outnumbered by the Carthaginians were soon in full retreat on
both wings. But the fortune of the several divisions of the
infantry was various. Those stationed on the left wing&mdash;
partly because they could avoid the elephants and partly
because they thought contemptuously of the mercenaries&mdash;
charged the right wing of the Carthaginians, succeeded in
driving them from their ground, and pursued them as far as
their entrenchment. Those stationed in front of the elephants were less fortunate. The maniples in front were thrown
into utter confusion by the crushing weight of the animals:
knocked down and trampled upon by them they perished in
heaps upon the field; yet owing to its great depth the main
body remained for a time unbroken. But it
was not for long. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans are beaten and annihilated.</note> The maniples on the rear
found themselves outflanked by the cavalry,
and were forced to face round and resist them: those on the
other hand who forced their way to the front through the elephants,
<pb n="40"/>  and had now those beasts on their rear, found themselves confronted by the phalanx of Carthaginians, which
had not yet been in action and was still in close unbroken
order, and so were cut to pieces. This was followed by a
general rout. Most of the Romans were trampled to death
by the enormous weight of the elephants; the rest were
shot down in their ranks by the numerous cavalry: and
there were only a very few who attempted to save themselves by flight. But the flatness of the country was unfavourable to escape in this manner. Some of the fugitives were
destroyed by the elephants and cavalry; while only those who
fled with the general Regulus, amounting perhaps to five hundred, were after a short pursuit
made prisoners with him to a man. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Regulus made prisoner.</note></p>
<p>On the Carthaginian side there fell about eight hundred of
the mercenaries, those namely who had been stationed opposite the left wing of the Romans. On the part of the Romans
about two thousand survived. These were those whom I have
already described as having chased the Carthaginian right wing
to their entrenchment, and who were thus not involved in the
general engagement. The rest were entirely destroyed with
the exception of those who fled with Regulus. The surviving
maniples escaped with considerable difficulty to the town of
Aspis. The Carthaginians stripped the dead, and taking with
them the Roman general and the rest of their prisoners,
returned to the capital in a high state of exultation at the turn
their affairs had now taken.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c35" type="chapter" n="35">
<head>Lessons from the Event</head>
<p>This event conveys many useful lessons to a thoughtful observer. Above all, the disaster of Regulus gives the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Eurip. fr.</note>
clearest possible warning that no one should feel too confident
of the favours of Fortune, especially in the hour of success.
Here we see one, who a short time before refused all pity
or consideration to the fallen, brought incontinently to beg them for his own life. Again, we
are taught the truth of that saying of Euripides&mdash;
<quote lang="en">One wise man's skill is worth a world in arms.</quote>
For it was one man, one brain, that defeated the numbers
which were believed to be invincible and able to accomplish
<pb n="41"/>
anything; and restored to confidence a whole city that was
unmistakably and utterly ruined, and the spirits of its army
which had sunk to the lowest depths of despair. I record these
things in the hope of benefiting my readers. There are two
roads to reformation for mankind&mdash;one through misfortunes of
their own, the other through those of others: the former is the
most unmistakable, the latter the less painful. One should
never therefore voluntarily choose the former, for it makes reformation a matter of great difficulty and danger; but we
should always look out for the latter, for thereby we can
without hurt to ourselves gain a clear view of the best course
to pursue. It is this which forces us to consider that the
knowledge gained from the study of true history is the best of
all educations for practical life. For it is history, and history
alone, which, without involving us in actual danger, will mature
our judgment and prepare us to take right views, whatever may
be the crisis or the posture of affairs.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c36" type="chapter" n="36">
<head>Xanthippus Leaves <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName></head>
<p>To return to our narrative. Having obtained this
complete success the Carthaginians indulged
in every sign of exultation. Thanksgivings
were poured out to God, and joyful congratulations interchanged among themselves. But Xanthippus, by
whose means such a happy change had been brought about
and such an impulse been given to the fortunes of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>,
did not remain there long, but took ship for home again. In
this he showed his wisdom and discernment. For it is the
nature of extraordinary and conspicuous achievements to exasperate jealousies and envenom slander; against which a native
may perhaps stand with the support of kinsfolk and friends,
but a foreigner when exposed to one or the other of them is
inevitably overpowered before long and put in danger. There
is however another account sometimes given of the departure
of Xanthippus, which I will endeavour at a more suitable
opportunity to set forth. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Xanthippus quits Carthage.</note></p>
<p>Upon this unlooked-for catastrophe in the Libyan campaign, the Roman government at once set to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans prepare a fleet to relieve their beaten army.</note>
work to fit out a fleet to take off the men who
were still surviving there; while the Carthaginians followed up their success by sitting
<pb n="42"/>
down before Aspis, and besieging it, being anxious to get the
survivors of the battle into their hands. But failing to capture the place, owing to the gallantry and determined courage
of these men, they eventually raised the siege. When they
heard that the Romans were preparing their fleet, and were
intending to sail once more against <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, they set about
shipbuilding also, partly repairing old vessels and partly constructing new. Before very long they had manned and
launched two hundred ships, and were on the watch for the
coming of their enemies. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. 255. Coss. Ser. Fulvius Paetinus Nobilior, M. Aemilius Paullus.</note> By the beginning of

<div2 id="b1c37" type="chapter" n="37">
<head>The Roman Fleet Wrecked</head>
<p>The passage was effected in safety, and the coast of
Camarina was reached: but there they experienced so terrible
a storm, and suffered so dreadfully, as almost to
beggar description. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The fleet is lost in a storm.</note> The disaster was indeed
extreme: for out of their three hundred and
sixty-four vessels eighty only remained. The rest were either
swamped or driven by the surf upon the rocks and headlands,
where they went to pieces and filled all the seaboard with
corpses and wreckage. No greater catastrophe is to be found
in all history as befalling a fleet at one time. And for this
Fortune was not so much to blame as the commanders themselves. They had been warned again and again by the pilots
not to steer along the southern coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> facing the
Libyan sea, because it was exposed and yielded no safe anchorage; and because, of the two dangerous constellations, one had
not yet set and the other was on the point of
rising (for their voyage fell between the rising of Orion and that of the Dog Star). <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Between June 28 and July 26.</note> Yet they
<pb n="43"/>
attended to none of these warnings; but, intoxicated by their
recent success, were anxious to capture certain cities as they
coasted along, and in pursuance of this idea thoughtlessly exposed themselves to the full fury of the open sea. As far as these
particular men were concerned, the disaster which they brought
upon themselves in the pursuit of trivial advantages convinced
them of the folly of their conduct. But it is a peculiarity of
the Roman people as a whole to treat everything as a question
of main strength; to consider that they must of course accomplish whatever they have proposed to themselves; and that
nothing is impossible that they have once determined upon.
The result of such self-confidence is that in many things they
do succeed, while in some few they conspicuously fail, and
especially at sea. On land it is against men only and their
works that they have to direct their efforts: and as the forces
against which they exert their strength do not differ intrinsically from their own, as a general rule they succeed; while
their failures are exceptional and rare. But to contend with the
sea and sky is to fight against a force immeasurably superior to
their own: and when they trust to an exertion of sheer strength
in such a contest the disasters which they meet with are signal.
This is what they experienced on the present occasion: they
have often experienced it since; and will continue to do so,
as long as they maintain their headstrong and foolhardy notion
that any season of the year admits of sailing as well as
marching.</p></div2>

<head>The Romans Build More Ships</head>
<p>When the Carthaginians heard of the destruction which
had befallen the Roman fleet, they made up their minds that
as their late victory had made them a match for their enemy
on land, so now the Roman catastrophe had made them a
match for him at sea. Accordingly they devoted themselves
with still greater eagerness than before to their naval and military preparations. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Carthaginians renew operations in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note> And first, they lost no time in

began fitting out two hundred ships and making all other

preparations necessary for a naval expedition. Hasdrubal
reached <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> safely, and immediately set to work to

grievous misfortune: but being absolutely resolved not to give
in, they determined once more to put two hundred and twenty
vessels on the stocks and build afresh. These
were finished in three months, an almost incredibly short time, and the new Consuls Aulus
Atilius and Gnaeus Cornelius fitted out the
fleet and put to sea. As they passed through

battering rams. The tower next the sea was destroyed with

and so what is called the <placeName key="tgn,7013527">New Town</placeName> was carried by assault;

and Gaius Sempronius put again to sea with
their full strength, and after touching at <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
started thence for <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. There, as they coasted
along the shore, they made a great number of
descents upon the country without accomplishing anything of importance in any of them. At length they
came to the island of the Lotophagi called M&emacr;nix, which is
not far from the Lesser Syrtis. There, from ignorance of the
waters, they ran upon some shallows; the tide receded, their
ships went aground, and they were in extreme peril. However,
<pb n="45"/>
after a while the tide unexpectedly flowed back again, and by
dint of throwing overboard all their heavy goods they just
managed to float the ships. After this their return voyage was
more like a flight than anything else. When they reached
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and had made the promontory of <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> they cast
anchor at <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>. Thence they weighed anchor for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
and rashly ventured upon the open sea-line as the shortest;
but while on their voyage they once more encountered so
terrible a storm that they lost more than a hundred and
fifty ships.</p>
<p>The Romans after this misfortune, though they are eminently persistent in carrying out their undertakings, yet owing to the severity and frequency<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-252">252</date>.</note>
of their disasters, now yielded to the force of circumstances
and refrained from constructing another fleet. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-251">251</date>. Coss. Lucius Caecilius Metellus, G. Furius Pacilus.</note> All the hopes
still left to them they rested upon their land

Consuls Lucius Caecilius and Gaius Furius with
their legions to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; but they only manned
sixty ships to carry provisions for the legions.
The fortunes of the Carthaginians had in their turn considerably improved owing to the catastrophes I have described.
They now commanded the sea without let or hindrance,
since the Romans had abandoned it; while in their land
forces their hopes were high. Nor was it unreasonable
that it should be so. The account of the battle in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>
had reached the ears of the Romans: they had heard that
the elephants had broken their ranks and had killed the large
part of those that fell: and they were in such terror of them,
that though during two years running after that time they
had on many occasions, in the territory either of <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> or
<placeName key="perseus,Selinus">Selinus</placeName>, found themselves in order of battle within five or six
stades of the enemy, they never plucked up courage to begin
an attack, or in fact to come down upon level ground at all,
all because of their fear of an elephant charge.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-252" to="-251">252</dateRange>-251.</note> And in these two seasons all they did was to

while to mountainous districts and such as were difficult to

<pb n="46"/>
by their land forces induced the Roman government to
change their minds and once more to attempt
success at sea. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-250">250</date>.</note> Accordingly, in the second consulship of Caius Atilius and Lucius Manlius, we find them

<div2 id="b1c40" type="chapter" n="40">
<head>Roman Victory at <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName></head>
<p>Meanwhile Hasdrubal noticed the terror displayed by
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-251">251</date>.</note>
the Romans whenever they had lately found
themselves in the presence of the enemy. He
learnt also that one of the Consuls had departed and gone
to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and that Caecilius was lingering in <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> with
the other half of the army, with the view of
protecting the corn-crops of the allies just
then ripe for the harvest. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Skirmishing at <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>.</note> He therefore got
his troops in motion, marched out, and encamped on the
frontier of the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>. Caecilius saw well
enough that the enemy had become supremely confident, and
he was anxious to draw him on; he therefore kept his men
within the walls. Hasdrubal imagined that Caecilius dared
not come out to give him battle. Elated with this idea, he
pushed boldly forward with his whole army and marched over
the pass into the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>. But though he was
destroying all the standing crops up to the very walls of the
town, Caecilius was not shaken from his resolution, but kept
persistently to it, until he had induced him to cross the river
which lay between him and the town. But no sooner had the
Carthaginians got their elephants and men across, than
Caecilius commenced sending out his light-armed troops to
harass them, until be had forced them to get their whole army
into fighting order. When he saw that everything was happening as he designed it, he placed some of his light troops to
line the wall and moat, with instructions that if the elephants
came within range they should pour volleys of their missiles
upon them; but that whenever they found themselves being
forced from their ground by them, they should retreat into the
moat, rush out of it again, and hurl darts at the elephants
which happened to be nearest. At the same time he gave
orders to the armourers in the market-place to carry the
missiles and heap them up outside at the foot of the wall.
<pb n="47"/>
Meanwhile he took up his own position with his maniples at
the gate which was opposite the enemy's left wing, and kept
despatching detachment after detachment to reinforce his
skirmishers. The engagement commenced by them becoming
more and more general, a feeling of emulation took possession
of the officers in charge of the elephants. They wished
to distinguish themselves in the eyes of Hasdrubal, and
they desired that the credit of the victory should be theirs:
they therefore, with one accord, charged the advanced skirmishing parties of the enemy, routed them with ease, and
pursued them up to the moat. But no sooner did the elephants thus come to close quarters than they were wounded by
the archers on the wall, and overwhelmed with volleys of pila
and javelins which poured thick and fast upon them from the
men stationed on the outer edge of the moat, and who had
not yet been engaged,&mdash;and thus, studded all over with darts,
and wounded past all bearing, they soon got beyond control.
They turned and bore down upon their own masters, trampling
men to death, and throwing their own lines into utter disorder
and confusion. When Caecilius saw this he led out his men
with promptitude. His troops were fresh; the enemy were in
disorder; and he charged them diagonally on the flank: the
result was that he inflicted a severe defeat upon them, killed a
large number, and forced the rest into precipitate flight. Of the
elephants he captured ten along with their Indian riders: the
rest which had thrown their Indians he managed to drive into
a herd after the battle, and secured every one of them. This
achievement gained him the credit on all hands of having substantially benefited the Roman cause, by once more restoring
confidence to the army, and giving them the command of the
open country.</p></div2>

<head>Siege of <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName></head>
<p>The announcement of this success at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was received with extreme delight; not so much at the blow inflicted
on the enemy by the loss of their elephants, as at the confidence
inspired in their own troops by a victory over these animals. With
their confidence thus restored, the Roman government recurred
to their original plan of sending out the Consuls upon this service
with a fleet and naval forces; for they were eager, by all means
in their power, to put a period to the war. Accordingly, in
<pb n="48"/>
the fourteenth year of the war, the supplies necessary for
the despatch of the expedition were got ready, and the Consuls set sail for <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> with two hundred ships. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-250">250</date>. C. Caecilius Regulus II., L. Manlius Vulso II.</note>
They dropped anchor at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>; and the
army having met them there, they began to
besiege it by sea and land. Their view was
that if they could obtain possession of this
town they would have no difficulty in transferring the seat
of war to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. The Carthaginian leaders were of the same
opinion, and entirely agreed with the Roman view of the value
of the place. They accordingly subordinated everything else
to this; devoted themselves to the relief of the place at all
hazards; and resolved to retain this town at any sacrifice: for
now that the Romans were masters of all the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
except <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName>, it was the only foothold they had left in the
island.</p>
<p>To understand my story a knowledge of the topography of
the district is necessary. I will therefore endeavour in a few
words to convey a comprehension to my readers of its
geographical position and its peculiar advantages.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c42" type="chapter" n="42">
<head>The Topography of <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName></head>
<p><placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, then, lies towards Southern Italy very much in
the same relative position as the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> does to the rest
of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. The only difference is that the one is an island,
the other a peninsula; and consequently in the former case
there is no communication except by sea, in the latter there is
a land communication also. The shape of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> is a triangle,
of which the several angles are represented by promontories:
that to the south jutting out into the Sicilian Sea is called
Pachynus; that which looks to the north forms the western
extremity of the Straits of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> and is about twelve
stades from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, its name is Pelorus; while the third
projects in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> itself, and is conveniently
situated opposite the promontories which cover <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, at a
distance of about a thousand stades: it looks somewhat south
of due west, dividing the Libyan from the Sardinian Sea, and
is called <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. On this last there is a city of the same
name. It was this city that the Romans were now besieging.
It was exceedingly strongly fortified: for besides its walls there
was a deep ditch running all round it, and on the side of the
<pb n="49"/>
sea it was protected by lagoons, to steer through which into
the harbour was a task requiring much skill and practice.</p>
<p>The Romans made two camps, one on each side of the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Siege of <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, B. C. <date value="-250">250</date>.</note>
town, and connected them with a ditch,
stockade, and wall. Having done this, they
began the assault by advancing their siege-works
in the direction of the tower nearest the sea, which commands
a view of the Libyan main. They did this gradually, always
adding something to what they had already constructed; and
thus bit by bit pushed their works forward and extended them
laterally, till at last they had brought down not only this tower,
but the six next to it also; and at the same time began battering all the others with battering-rams. The siege was carried
on with vigour and terrific energy: every day some of the
towers were shaken and others reduced to ruins; every
day too the siege-works advanced farther and farther, and
more and more towards the heart of the city. And though
there were in the town, besides the ordinary inhabitants, as
many as ten thousand hired soldiers, the consternation and
despondency became overwhelming. Yet their commander
Himilco omitted no measure within his power. As fast
as the enemy demolished a fortification he threw up a new
one; he also countermined them, and reduced the assailants
to straits of no ordinary difficulty. Moreover, he made
daily sallies, attempted to carry or throw fire into the siegeworks, and with this end in view fought many desperate
engagements by night as well as by day: so determined was
the fighting in these struggles, that sometimes the number of
the dead was greater than it ordinarily is in a pitched battle.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c43" type="chapter" n="43">
<head>Treason in <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName></head>
<p>But about this time some of the officers of highest
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Attempted treason in <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>.</note>
rank in the mercenary army discussed among
themselves a project for surrendering the town
to the Romans, being fully persuaded that the
men under their command would obey their orders. They
got out of the city at night, went to the enemy's camp, and
held a parley with the Roman commander on the subject.
But Alexon the Achaean, who on a former occasion had saved
<placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> from destruction when the mercenary troops of
<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> made a plot to betray it, was on this occasion
<pb n="50"/>
once more the first to detect this treason, and to report it to the
general of the Carthaginians. The latter no sooner heard it
than he at once summoned a meeting of those officers who
were still in their quarters; and exhorted them to loyalty with
prayers and promises of liberal bounties and favours, if they
would only remain faithful to him, and not join in the treason
of the officers who had left the town. They received his
speech with enthusiasm, and were there and then commissioned
by him, some to go to the Celts accompanied by Hannibal,
who was the son of the Hannibal killed in <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and who
had a previous acquaintance with that people gained in the
expedition against them; others to fetch the rest of the
mercenary troops, accompanied by Alexon, because he was
liked and trusted by them. These officers then proceeded to
summon a meeting of their men and address them. They
pledged their own credit for the bounties promised them
severally by the General, and without difficulty persuaded the
men to remain staunch. The result was that when the
officers, who had joined in the secret mission, returned to the
walls and tried to address their men, and communicate the
terms offered by the Romans, so far from finding any adherents,
they could not even obtain a hearing, but were driven from
the wall with volleys of stones and darts. But this treason
among their mercenaries constituted a serious danger: the
Carthaginians had a narrow escape from absolute ruin, and
they owed their preservation from it to that same Alexon whose
fidelity had on a former occasion preserved for <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName>
her territory, constitution, and freedom.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c44" type="chapter" n="44">
<head>A Fruitless Sortie</head>
<p>Meanwhile the Carthaginians at home knew nothing of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal relieves <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>.</note>
what was going on. But they could calculate
the requirements of a besieged garrison; and
they accordingly filled fifty vessels with soldiers,
furnished their commander Hannibal, a son of Hamilcar, and
an officer and prime favourite of Adherbal's, with instructions
suitable to the business in hand, and despatched him with all
speed: charging him to be guilty of no delay, to omit no
opportunity, and to shrink from no attempt however venturesome to relieve the besieged. He put to sea with his ten
thousand men, and dropped anchor at the islands called
<pb n="51"/>
Aegusae, which lie in the course between <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> and
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, and there looked out for an opportunity of making
<placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. At last a strong breeze sprang up in exactly the
right quarter: he crowded all sail and bore down before the
wind right upon the entrance of the harbour, with his men
upon the decks fully armed and ready for battle. Partly from
astonishment at this sudden appearance, partly from dread of
being carried along with the enemy by the violence of the
gale into the harbour of their opponents, the Romans did not
venture to obstruct the entrance of the reinforcement; but
stood out at sea overpowered with amazement at the audacity
of the enemy.</p>
<p>The town population crowded to the walls, in an agony of
anxiety as to what would happen, no less than in an excess of
joy at the unlooked-for appearance of hope, and cheered on the
crews as they sailed into the harbour, with clapping hands
and cries of gladness. To sail into the harbour was an
achievement of great danger; but Hannibal accomplished it
gallantly, and, dropping anchor there, safely disembarked his
soldiers. The exultation of all who were in the city was not
caused so much by the presence of the reinforcement, though
they had thereby gained a strong revival of hope, and a large
addition to their strength, as by the fact that the Romans had
not dared to intercept the course of the Carthaginians.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c45" type="chapter" n="45">
<head>Running the Blockade</head>

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A sally from <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>.</note>
saw that both divisions of his troops were in
high spirits and eager for service,&mdash;the original
garrison owing to the presence of the reinforcement, the newly arrived because they had as yet had no experience of the hardships of the situation. He wished to take
advantage of the excited feelings of both parties, before they
cooled, in order to organise an attempt to set fire to the works of
the besiegers. He therefore summoned the whole army to a
meeting, and dwelt upon the themes suitable to the occasion
at somewhat greater length than usual. He raised their zeal
to an enthusiastic height by the magnitude of his promises for
individual acts of courage, and by declaring the favours and
rewards which awaited them as an army at the hands of the
Carthaginians. His speech was received with lively marks of
<pb n="52"/>
satisfaction; and the men with loud shouts bade him delay no
more, but lead them into the field. For the present, however,
he contented himself with thanking them and expressing his
delight at their excellent spirit, and bidding them go early to
rest and obey their officers, dismissed them. But shortly
afterwards he summoned the officers; assigned to them severally
the posts best calculated for the success of the undertaking;
communicated to them the watchword and the exact moment
the movement was to be made; and issued orders to the commanders to be at the posts assigned with their men at the
morning watch. His orders were punctually obeyed: and at
daybreak he led out his forces and made attempts upon the
siege-works at several points. But the Romans had not been
blind to what was coming, and were neither idle nor unprepared.
Wherever help was required it was promptly rendered;
and at every point they made a stout resistance to the enemy.
Before long there was fighting all along the line, and an
obstinate struggle round the entire circuit of the wall; for the
sallying party were not less than twenty thousand strong, and
their opponents more numerous still. The contest was all
the hotter from the fact that the men were not fighting in
their regular ranks, but indiscriminately, and as their own
judgment directed; the result of which was that a spirit of
personal emulation arose among the combatants, because,
though the numbers engaged were so great, there was a series
of single combats between man and man, or company and
company. However, it was at the siege-works themselves that
the shouting was loudest and the throng of combatants the
densest. At these troops had been massed deliberately for
attack and defence. The assailants strove their utmost to
dislodge the defenders, the defenders exerted all their courage
to hold their ground and not yield an inch to the assailants,&mdash;
and with such emulation and fury on both sides, that they
ended by falling at their posts rather than yield. But there
were others mingled with these, carrying torchwood and tow
and fire, who made a simultaneous attack upon the batteringrams at every point: hurling these fiery missiles against them
with such audacity, that the Romans were reduced to the last
extremity of danger, being quite unable to overpower the
<pb n="53"/>
attack of the enemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">It fails.</note> But the general of the Carthaginians,
seeing that he was losing large numbers in the
engagement, without being able to gain the
object of the sortie, which was to take the siege-works, ordered
his trumpeters to sound a recall. So the Romans, after
coming within an ace of losing all their siege-gear, finally kept
possession of the works, and were able to maintain them all
without dispute.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c46" type="chapter" n="46">
<head>Hannibal the Rhodian</head>
<p>After this affair Hannibal eluded the enemy's watch,
and sailed out of the harbour by night with his ships to
<placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName>, to join the Carthaginian Commander-in-Chief,
Adherbal. <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName> is about one hundred and twenty
stades from <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, and was always an object of special
care to the Carthaginians from the convenience of its position
and the excellence of its harbour.</p>
<p>Now the Carthaginian government were anxious to learn<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal the Rhodian offers to run the blockade.</note>
the state of affairs at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, but could not
do so because the garrison was strictly blockaded, and the Romans were exceedingly vigilant. In this difficulty a nobleman, called Hannibal the Rhodian, came to them, and offered to run the
blockade, to see what was going on in <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> with his own
eyes, and to report. The offer delighted them, but they did
not believe in the possibility of its fulfilment with the Roman
fleet lying at the very entrance of the channel. However, the
man fitted out his own private vessel and put to sea. He
first crossed to one of the islands lying off <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. Next
day he obtained a wind in the right quarter, and about ten
o'clock in the morning actually sailed into the harbour in the
full view of the enemy, who looked on with amazement at his
audacity. Next day he lost no time in setting about a return
voyage. The Roman Consul had determined on taking extra
precautions for watching the sea near the channel: with this
view he had during the night got ready his ten fastest-sailing
vessels, and taking up a position on shore close to the harbour
mouth, was watching with his own eyes what would happen.
The whole army was watching also; while the ships on both
sides of the mouth of the channel got as close to the shallows
as it was possible to approach, and there rested with their oars
<pb n="54"/>
out, and ready to run down and capture the ship that was
about to sail out. The Rhodian, on his side, attempted no
concealment. He put boldly to sea, and so confounded the
enemy by his audacity, and the speed of his vessel, that he not
only sailed out without receiving any damage to ship or crew,
scudding along the bows of the enemy as though they were
fixed in their places, but even brought his ship to, after running a short way ahead, and, with his oars out and ready,
seemed to challenge the foe to a contest. When none of them
ventured to put out to attack him, because of the speed of his
rowing, he sailed away: having thus with his one ship successfully defied the entire fleet of the enemy. From this time he
frequently performed the same feat, and proved exceedingly
serviceable both to the government at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and the
besieged garrison. To the former by informing them from
time to time of what was pressingly necessary; and to the latter
by inspiring them with confidence, and dismaying the Romans
by his audacity.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c47" type="chapter" n="47">
<head>The Rhodian is Captured</head>
<p>What contributed most to encourage him to a repetition of the feat was the fact that by frequent experience
he had marked out the course for himself by clear land
marks. As soon as he had crossed the open sea, and
was coming into sight, he used to steer as though he were
coming from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, keeping the seaward tower exactly on his
bows, in such a way as to be in a line with the city towers
which faced towards <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>; and this is the only possible
course to hit the mouth of the channel with the wind astern.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">His example is followed by others.</note>
The successful boldness of the Rhodian inspired
several of those who were acquainted with these
waters to make similar attempts. The Romans
felt themselves to be in a great difficulty; and what was taking
place determined them to attempt blocking up the mouth of
the harbour. The greater part of the attempted work was a
failure: the sea was too deep, and none of the material which
they threw into it would hold, or in fact keep in the least
compact. The breakers and the force of the current dislodged
and scattered everything that was thrown in, before it could
even reach the bottom. But there was one point where the
water was shallow, at which a mole was with infinite labour
<pb n="55"/>
made to hold together; and upon it a vessel with four banks
of oars and of unusually fine build stuck fast
as it was making the outward passage at night,
and thus fell into the hands of the enemy.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Rhodian is at length captured.</note>
The Romans took possession of it, manned it with a picked
crew, and used it for keeping a look out for all who should
try to enter the harbour, and especially for the Rhodian. He
had sailed in, as it happened, that very night, and was afterwards putting out to sea again in his usual open manner. He
was, however, startled to see the four-banked vessel put out
to sea again simultaneously with himself. He recognised
what ship it was, and his first impulse was to escape her by his
superior speed. But finding himself getting overhauled by
the excellence of her rowers, he was finally compelled to
bring to and engage at close quarters. But in a struggle of
marines he was at a complete disadvantage: the enemy were
superior in numbers, and their soldiers were picked men; and
he was made prisoner. The possession of this ship of superior
build enabled the Romans, by equipping her with whatever
was wanted for the service she had to perform, to intercept all
who were adventurous enough to try running the blockade of
<placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>.</p></div2>

<head>The Roman Siege-Works Burnt</head>
<p>Meanwhile, the besieged were energetically carrying
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A storm having damaged the siege-works, the Lilybaeans succeed in burning them.</note>
on counterworks, having abandoned the hope
of damaging or destroying the constructions of
the enemy. But in the midst of these proceedings a storm of wind, of such tremendous
violence and fury, blew upon the machinery of
the engines, that it wrecked the pent-houses,
and carried away by its force the towers erected to cover
them. Some of the Greek mercenaries perceived the advantage such a state of things offered for the destruction of the
siege-works, and communicated their idea to the commander.
He caught at the suggestion, and lost no time in making every
preparation suitable to the undertaking. Then the young men
mustered at three several points, and threw lighted brands into
the enemy's works. The length of time during which these
works had been standing made them exactly in the proper state
to catch fire easily; and when to this was added a violent wind,
<pb n="56"/>
blowing right upon the engines and towers, the natural result
was that the spreading of the fire became rapid and destructive;
while all attempts on the Roman side to master it, and rescue
their works, had to be abandoned as difficult or wholly
impracticable. Those who tried to come to the rescue were
so appalled at the scene, that they could neither fully grasp
nor clearly see what was going on. Flames, sparks, and
volumes of smoke blew right in their faces and blinded them;
and not a few dropped down and perished without ever getting
near enough to attempt to combat the fire. The same
circumstances, which caused these overwhelming difficulties to
the besiegers, favoured those who were throwing the fire-brands
in exactly the same proportion. Everything that could obscure
their vision or hurt them was blown clean away and carried
into the faces of the enemy; while their being able to see the
intervening space enabled the shooters to take a good aim at
those of the enemy who came to the rescue, and the throwers
of the fire-brands to lodge them at the proper places for the
destruction of the works. The violence of the wind, too,
contributed to the deadly effect of the missiles by increasing
the force of their blows. Eventually the destruction was so
complete, that the foundations of the siege-towers and the
blocks of the battering-rams were rendered unusable by the
fire. In spite of this disaster, though they gave up the idea
of assaulting the place any longer by means of their works,
the Romans still persisted. They surrounded the town with
a ditch and stockade, threw up an additional wall to secure
their own encampment, and left the completion of their
purpose to time. Nor were the besieged less determined.
They repaired the part of their walls which had been thrown
down, and prepared to endure the siege with good courage.</p></div2>

land on his right. By daybreak the leading ships could be
seen coming towards <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName>; and at the first sight of them
Adherbal was overwhelmed with surprise. He quickly recovered his self-possession however: and, fully appreciating
the significance of the enemy's attack, he determined to try
every man&oelig;uvre, and hazard every danger, rather than allow
himself and his men to be shut up in the blockade which
threatened them. He lost no time in collecting his rowingcrews upon the beach, and summoning the mercenary soldiers
who were in the town by proclamation. When the muster
had taken place, he endeavoured to impress upon them in
a few words what good hopes of victory they had, if they
were bold enough to fight at sea; and what hardships they
would have to endure in a blockade, if they hesitated from
any fear of danger and played the coward. The men
showed a ready enthusiasm for the sea-fight, and demanded
with shouts that he would lead them to it without delay.
He thanked them, praised their zeal, and gave the order
to embark with all speed, to keep their eyes upon his ship,
and follow in its wake. Having made these instructions
clear as quickly as he could, he got under weigh himself
<pb n="58"/>
first, and guided his fleet close under the rocks, on the
opposite side of the harbour to that by which the enemy were
entering.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c50" type="chapter" n="50">
<head>The Roman Fleet Meets Resistance</head>
<p>When the Consul Publius saw, to his surprise, that the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Unexpected resistance of Adherbal. The Roman fleet checked.</note>
enemy, so far from giving in or being
dismayed at his approach, were determined
upon fighting him at sea: while of his own ships
some were already within the harbour, others
just in the very entrance channel, and others still on their
way towards it; he at once issued orders to all the ships to
turn round and make the best of their way out again.
The result of this was that, as some of the ships were in the
harbour, and others at the entrance, they fouled each other
when they began reversing their course; and not only did a
great confusion arise among the men, but the ships got their
oars broken also in the collisions which occurred. However,
the captains exerted themselves to get the ships into line
close under the shore, as they successively cleared the harbour,
and with their prows directed towards the enemy. Publius
himself was originally bringing up the rear of the entire squadron;
but he now, while the movement was actually in execution,
turned towards the open sea and transferred himself to a position on the left wing of the fleet. At the same moment Adherbal
succeeded in outflanking the left of his opponents with five vessels
furnished with charging beaks. He turned his own ship with
its prow towards the enemy, and brought to. As each of the
others came up, and fell into line with him, he sent orders to
them by his staff officers to do the same as he had done. Thus
they all fell in and formed a complete line. The signal which
had been agreed upon before was given, and an advance was begun, which was made at first without disarranging the line. The
Romans were still close in-shore, waiting for the coming out of
their ships from the harbour; and this proximity to the land
proved of infinite disadvantage to them in the engagement.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c51" type="chapter" n="51">
<head>Naval Battle Off Drepana</head>
<p>And now the fleets were within a short distance of each
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle.</note>
other: the signals were raised from the ships
of the respective commanders; the charge was
made; and ship grappled with ship. At first the engagement
was evenly balanced, because each fleet had the pick of their
<pb n="59"/>
land forces serving as marines on board. But as it went on
the many advantages which, taking it as a whole, the Carthaginians possessed, gave them
a continually increasing superiority. Owing to the better construction of their ships they
had much the advantage in point of speed, while their position
with the open sea behind them materially contributed to their
success, by giving them freer space for their man&oelig;uvres. Were
any of them hard pressed by the enemy? Their speed secured
them a sure escape, and a wide expanse of water was open to
their flight. There they would swing round and attack the leading ships which were pursuing them: sometimes rowing round
them and charging their broadsides, at other times running
alongside them as they lurched awkwardly round, from the weight
of the vessels and the unskilfulness of the crews. In this way
they were charging perpetually, and managed to sink a large
number of the ships. Or was one of their number in danger?
They were ready to come to the rescue, being out of danger
themselves, and being able to effect a movement to right or
left, by steering along the sterns of their own ships and through
the open sea unmolested. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans beaten.</note> The case of the
Romans was exactly the reverse. If any of
them were hard pressed, there was nowhere for
them to retreat, for they were fighting close to the shore; and
any ship of theirs that was hard driven by the enemy either
backed into shallow water and stuck fast, or ran ashore and
was stranded. Moreover, that most effective of all man&oelig;uvres
in sea fights,&mdash;sailing through the enemy's line and appearing on their stern while they are engaged with others,&mdash;was
rendered impossible for them, owing to the bulk of their
vessels; and still more so by the unskilfulness of their crews.
Nor, again, were they able to bring help from behind to those
who wanted it, because they were hemmed in so close to the
shore that there was not the smallest space left in which those
who wished to render such help might move. When the
Consul saw how ill things were going for him all along the
line; when he saw some of his ships sticking fast in the
shallows, and others cast ashore; he took to flight. Thirty
other ships which happened to be near him followed him as he
sailed from the left, and coasted along the shore. But the
<pb n="60"/>
remaining vessels, which amounted to ninety-three, the Carthaginians captured with their crews, except in the case of those
who ran their ships ashore and got away.</p></div2>

<head>Roman Transports for the Camp</head>
<p>The result of this sea fight gave Adherbal a high reputation at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>; for his success was looked upon as wholly

handed over to the Quaestors half his transports and some of
his war-ships, and sent them off, being very anxious that
what the army needed should reach them promptly. He remained at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> himself, waiting for such of his ships as

<pb n="61"/>
supplies of corn from the allies in the central districts of the
island.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c53" type="chapter" n="53">
<head>Carthalo Attackes the Roman Transports</head>
<p>Meanwhile Adherbal sent the prisoners he had taken
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Carthalo tries to intercept the transports.</note>
in the sea fight, and the captured vessels, to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>; and
giving Carthalo his colleague thirty vessels, in addition to the
seventy in command of which he had come, despatched him
with instructions to make a sudden attack upon the enemy's
ships that were at anchor off <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, capture all he could,
and set fire to the rest. In obedience to these
instructions Carthalo accomplished his passage
just before daybreak, fired some of the vessels,
and towed off others. Great was the commotion at the
quarters of the Romans. For as they hurried to the rescue of
the ships, the attention of Himilco, the commander of the
garrison, was aroused by their shouts; and as the day was
now beginning to break, he could see what was happening, and
despatched the mercenary troops who were in the town.
Thus the Romans found themselves surrounded by danger on
every side, and fell into a state of consternation more than
usually profound and serious. The Carthaginian admiral
contented himself with either towing off or breaking up some
few of their vessels, and shortly afterwards coasted along under
the pretence of making for Heracleia: though he was really
lying in wait, with the view of intercepting those who were
coming by sea to the Roman army. When his look-out men
brought him word that a considerable number of vessels of all
sorts were bearing down upon him, and were now getting
close, he stood out to sea and started to meet them: for the
success just obtained over the Romans inspired him with such
contempt for them, that he was eager to come to an engagement. The vessels in question were those which had been
despatched in advance under the charge of the Quaestors
from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. And they too had warning of their danger.
Light boats were accustomed to sail in advance of a squadron,
and these announced the approach of the enemy to the
Quaestors; who being convinced that they were not strong
enough to stand a battle at sea, dropped anchor under a small
fortified town which was subject to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and which, though
it had no regular harbour, yet possessed roadsteads, and headlands
<pb n="62"/>  projecting from the mainland, and surrounding the
roadsteads, so as to form a convenient refuge. There they
disembarked; and having set up some catapults and balistae,
which they got from the town, awaited the approach of the
enemy. When the Carthaginians arrived, their first idea was
to blockade them; for they supposed that the men would
be terrified and retreat to the fortified town, leaving
them to take possession of the vessels without resistance.
Their expectations, however, were not fulfilled; and finding
that the men on the contrary resisted with spirit, and that
the situation of the spot presented many difficulties of every
description, they sailed away again after towing off some
few of the transports laden with provisions, and retired to a
certain river, in which they anchored and kept a look out for
the enemy to renew their voyage.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c54" type="chapter" n="54">
<head>Shipwreck of the Roman Fleet</head>
<p>In complete ignorance of what had happened to his
advanced squadron, the Consul, who had remained behind at
<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, after completing all he meant to do there, put to sea;
and, after rounding Pachynus, was proceeding on his voyage
to <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. The appearance of the enemy was once more
signalled to the Carthaginian admiral by his look-out men,
and he at once put out to sea, with the view of engaging them
as far as possible away from their comrades. Junius saw the
Carthaginian fleet from a considerable distance, and observing
their great numbers did not dare to engage them, and yet
found it impossible to avoid them by flight because they were
now too close. He therefore steered towards land, and
anchored under a rocky and altogether dangerous part of the
shore; for he judged it better to run all risks rather than
allow his squadron, with all its men, to fall into the hands
of the enemy. The Carthaginian admiral saw what he had
done; and determined that it was unadvisable for him to
engage the enemy, or bring his ships near such a dangerous
place. He therefore made for a certain headland between the
two squadrons of the enemy, and there kept a look out upon
both with equal vigilance. Presently, however, the weather
became rough, and there was an appearance of an unusually
dangerous disturbance setting in from the sea. The Carthaginian pilots, from their knowledge of the particular localities,
<pb n="63"/>  and of seamanship generally, foresaw what was coming;
and persuaded Carthalo to avoid the storm and
round the promontory of Pachynus.<note anchored="yes">The dangerous nature of the S. Coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was well known to the
pilots. See above, <ref target="b1c37" targOrder="U">ch. 37</ref>.</note><note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman fleet is wrecked.</note> He
had the good sense to take their advice: and
accordingly these men, with great exertions and extreme difficulty, did get round the promontory and anchored in safety;
while the Romans, being exposed to the storm in places entirely destitute of harbours, suffered such complete destruction,
that not one of the wrecks even was left in a state available for
use. Both of their squadrons in fact were completely disabled
to a degree past belief.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c55" type="chapter" n="55">
<head>The Romans Take Mount Eryx</head>
<p>This occurrence caused the Carthaginian interests to

look up again and their hopes to revive. But
the Romans, though they had met with partial
misfortunes before, had never suffered a naval
disaster so complete and final. They, in fact, abandoned the
sea, and confined themselves to holding the country; while the
Carthaginians remained masters of the sea, without wholly
despairing of the land.</p>
<p>Great and general was the dismay both at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and in<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Lucius Junius perseveres in the siege. B. C. <date value="-248">248</date>.</note>
the camp at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. Yet they did not
abandon their determination of starving out that
town. The Roman government did not allow
their disasters to prevent their sending provisions into the
camp overland; and the besiegers kept up the investment as
strictly as they possibly could. Lucius Junius joined the
camp after the shipwreck, and, being in a state of great distress at what had happened, was all eagerness to strike some
new and effective blow, and thus repair the disaster which
had befallen him. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>.</note> Accordingly he took the first slight opening that offered to surprise and seize <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>;
and became master both of the temple of

between <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName>, but nearer to <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName>
of the two. It is by far the greatest mountain in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> next
to <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>; and on its summit, which is flat, stands the
<pb n="64"/>
temple of Erycinian Aphrodite, confessedly the most splendid of all the temples in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for its wealth and general
magnificence. The town stands immediately below the
summit, and is approached by a very long and steep
ascent. Lucius seized both town and temple; and established a garrison both upon the summit and at the foot
of the road to it from <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName>. He kept a strict guard
at both points, but more especially at the foot of the ascent,

to the coast of <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> and seized on a place
called Hercte, which lies between <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> and
<placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> on the coast, and is reputed the best situation in
the district for a safe and permanent camp. For it is a
mountain rising sheer on every side, standing out above the
surrounding country to a considerable height. The table-land
on its summit has a circumference of not less than a hundred
stades, within which the soil is rich in pasture and suitable for
agriculture; the sea-breezes render it healthy; and it is entirely
free from all dangerous animals. On the side which looks towards the sea, as well as that which faces the central part of the
island, it is enclosed by inaccessible precipices; while the spaces
between them require only slight fortifications, and of no great
extent, to make them secure. There is in it also an eminence,
which serves at once as an acropolis and as a convenient tower
of observation, commanding the surrounding district. It also
commands a harbour conveniently situated for the passage
from <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, in which there is always
abundant depth of water; finally, it can only be reached by
three ways&mdash;two from the land side, one from the sea, all of
them difficult. Here Hamilcar entrenched himself. It was a
bold measure: but he had no city which he could count upon
as friendly, and no other hope on which he could rely; and
<pb n="65"/>
though by so doing he placed himself in the very midst of the
enemy, he nevertheless managed to involve the Romans in
many struggles and dangers. To begin with, he would start
from this place and ravage the sea-board of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> as far as
<placeName key="perseus,Cumae">Cumae</placeName>; and again on shore, when the Romans had pitched a

way, and forced them to engage in numerous skirmishes, for the
space of nearly three years. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-247" to="-244">247</dateRange>-<date value="-244">244</date>.</note> Of these combats

<div2 id="b1c57" type="chapter" n="57">
<head>The Two Sides Evenly Matched</head>
<p>It is like the case of two boxers, eminent alike for
their courage and their physical condition, engaged in a formal
contest for the prize. As the match goes on, blow after blow
is interchanged without intermission; but to anticipate, or keep
account of every feint or every blow delivered is impossible
for combatants and spectators alike. Still one may conceive a
sufficiently distinct idea of the affair by taking into account
the general activity of the men, the ambition actuating
each side, and the amount of their experience, strength,
and courage. The same may be said of these two generals.
No writer could set down, and no reader would endure the
wearisome and profitless task of reading, a detailed statement
of the transactions of every day; why they were undertaken,
and how they were carried out. For every day had its ambuscade on one side or the other, its attack, or assault. A
general assertion in regard to the men, combined with the
actual result of their mutual determination to conquer, will
give a far better idea of the facts. It may be said then, generally, that nothing was left untried,&mdash;whether it be stratagems
which could be learnt from history, or plans suggested by the
necessities of the hour and the immediate circumstances of the
case, or undertakings depending upon an adventurous spirit
and a reckless daring. The matter, however, for several
reasons, could not be brought to a decisive issue. In the first
place, the forces on either side were evenly matched: and in
the second place, while the camps were in the case of both
equally impregnable, the space which separated the two was
very small. The result of this was that skirmishes between
<pb n="66"/>
detached parties on both sides were always going on during
the day, and yet nothing decisive occurred. For though the
men actually engaged in such skirmishes from time to time
were cut to pieces, it did not affect the main body. They
had only to wheel round to find themselves out of the reach
of danger behind their own defences. Once there, they could
face about and again engage the enemy.</p></div2>

to seize the town which lay between these two spots. There
ensued a siege of the Romans who were on the summit,
supported by them with extraordinary hardihood and adventurous daring: while the Carthaginians, finding themselves
between two hostile armies, and their supplies brought to them
with difficulty, because they were in communication with the
sea at only one point and by one road, yet held out with a
determination that passes belief. Every contrivance which
skill or force could sustain did they put in use against each
other, as before; every imaginable privation was submitted
to; surprises and pitched battles were alike tried: and
finally they left the combat a drawn one, not, as Fabius says,
from utter weakness and misery, but like men still unbroken
and unconquered. The fact is that before either party had got
completely the better of the other, though they had maintained
the conflict for another two years, the war happened to be decided in quite a different manner. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-243" to="-242">243</dateRange>-<date value="-242">242</date>.</note></p>

<head>The Romans Once More Build a Fleet</head>
<p>So it was with the Romans and Carthaginians. They
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans once more fit out a fleet.</note>
were worn out by the labours of the war; the perpetual
succession of hard fought struggles was at last driving them
to despair; their strength had become paralysed, and their
resources reduced almost to extinction by war-taxes and expenses extending over so many years. And yet the Romans
did not give in. For the last five years indeed they had
entirely abandoned the sea, partly because of the disasters they
had sustained there, and partly because they felt confident of
deciding the war by means of their land forces; but they now
determined for the third time to make trial of their fortune
in naval warfare. They saw that their operations were not
succeeding according to their calculations, mainly owing to
the obstinate gallantry of the Carthaginian general. They
therefore adopted this resolution from a conviction that by
this means alone, if their design were but well directed, would
they be able to bring the war to a successful conclusion. In
their first attempt they had been compelled to abandon the sea
by disasters arising from sheer bad luck; in their second by
the loss of the naval battle off <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName>. This third attempt
was successful: they shut off the Carthaginian forces at <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>
from getting their supplies by sea, and eventually put a period
to the whole war. Nevertheless it was essentially an effort of
despair. The treasury was empty, and would
not supply the funds necessary for the undertaking, which were, however, obtained by the
patriotism and generosity of the leading citizens. They undertook singly, or by two or three combining, according to their
means, to supply a quinquereme fully fitted out, on the understanding that they were to be repaid if the expedition was
successful. By these means a fleet of two hundred quinqueremes were quickly prepared, built on the model of the
ship of the Rhodian. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. 242. Coss. C. Lutatius Catulus, A. Postumius Albinus.</note> Gaius Lutatius was then

besieging it. And while he pushed on these operations with
all his might, he did not at the same time lose sight of the
approach of the Carthaginian fleet. He kept in mind the
original idea of this expedition, that it was by a victory at sea
alone that the result of the whole war could be decided. He
did not, therefore, allow the time to be wasted or unemployed.
He practised and drilled his crews every day in the manoeuvres which they would be called upon to perform; and by
his attention to discipline generally brought his sailors in a
very short time to the condition of trained athletes for the
contest before them.</p></div2>

<head>Battle of the Aegusian Islands</head>
<p>That the Romans should have a fleet afloat once more,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Carthaginians send Hanno with a fleet.</note>
and be again bidding for the mastery at sea, was
a contingency wholly unexpected by the Carthaginians. They at once set about fitting out
their ships, loaded them with corn and other provisions, and
despatched their fleet: determined that their troops round
<placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> should not run short of necessary provisions. Hanno,
who was appointed to command the fleet, put to sea and
arrived at the island called Holy Isle. He was eager as
soon as possible, if he could escape the observation of the
enemy, to get across to <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>; disembark his stores; and having
thus lightened his ships, take on board as marines those of the
mercenary troops who were suitable to the service, and Barcas
with them; and not to engage the enemy until he had thus
reinforced himself. But Lutatius was informed of the arrival
of Hanno's squadron, and correctly interpreted their design.
He at once took on board the best soldiers of his army, and
crossed to the Island of Aegusa, which lies directly opposite
<placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>. There he addressed his forces some words
suitable to the occasion, and gave full instructions to the
pilots, with the understanding that a battle was to be fought
on the morrow. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">10th March B. C. <date value="-241">241</date>. A strong breeze is blowing.</note> At daybreak the next morning
Lutatius found that a strong breeze had sprung
up on the stern of the enemy, and that an advance towards them in the teeth of it would be
difficult for his ships. The sea too was rough and boisterous:
and for a while he could not make up his mind what he had
<pb n="69"/>
better do in the circumstances. Finally, however, he was decided by the following considerations. If he boarded the enemy's
fleet during the continuance of the storm, he would only have
to contend with Hanno, and the levies of sailors which he had
on board, before they could be reinforced by the troops, and with
ships which were still heavily laden with stores: but if he waited
for calm weather, and allowed the enemy to get across and
unite with their land forces, he would then have to contend
with ships lightened of their burden, and therefore in a more
navigable condition, and against the picked men of the land
forces; and what was more formidable than anything else,
against the determined bravery of Hamilcar. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Lutatius however decides to fight.</note> He made up
his mind, therefore, not to let the present opportunity slip; and when he saw the enemy's ships
crowding sail, he put to sea with all speed. The
rowers, from their excellent physical condition, found no
difficulty in overcoming the heavy sea, and Lutatius soon
got his fleet into single line with prows directed to the
foe.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c61" type="chapter" n="61">
<head>The Battle of Aegusa</head>
<p>When the Carthaginians saw that the Romans were
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle of Aegusa.</note>
intercepting their passage across, they lowered
their masts, and after some words of mutual
exhortation had been uttered in the several
ships, closed with their opponents. But the respective
state of equipment of the two sides was exactly the converse of what it had been in the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Drepana">Drepana</placeName>; and
the result of the battle was, therefore, naturally reversed also.
The Romans had reformed their mode of shipbuilding, and
had eased their vessels of all freight, except the provisions
necessary for the battle: while their rowers having been
thoroughly trained and got well together, performed their
office in an altogether superior manner, and were backed up by
marines who, being picked men from the legions, were all but
invincible. The case with the Carthaginians was exactly the
reverse. Their ships were heavily laden and therefore unmanageable in the engagement; while their rowers were entirely
untrained, and merely put on board for the emergency; and
such marines as they had were raw recruits, who had never
had any previous experience of any difficult or dangerous
<pb n="70"/>
service. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Victory of the Romans.</note> The fact is that the Carthaginian government never
expected that the Romans would again attempt to dispute the
supremacy at sea: they had, therefore, in contempt for them,
neglected their navy. The result was that, as soon as they
closed, their manifold disadvantages quickly decided the battle
against them. They had fifty ships sunk, and
seventy taken with their crews. The rest set
their sails, and running before the wind, which
luckily for them suddenly veered round at the nick of time
to help them, got away again to Holy Isle. The Roman
Consul sailed back to <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName> to join the army, and there
occupied himself in making arrangements for the ships and men
which he had captured; which was a business of considerable
magnitude, for the prisoners made in the battle amounted to
little short of ten thousand.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c62" type="chapter" n="62">
<head>End of the First Punic War</head>
<p>As far as strength of feeling and desire for victory were
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Barcas makes terms.</note>
concerned, this unexpected reverse did not diminish the
readiness of the Carthaginians to carry on the war; but when
they came to reckon up their resources they were at a complete
standstill. On the one hand, they could not any longer
send supplies to their forces in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, because
the enemy commanded the sea: on the other, to
abandon and, as it were, to betray these, left
them without men and without leaders to carry on the war.
They therefore sent a despatch to Barcas with all speed, leaving
the decision of the whole matter in his hands. Nor was their
confidence misplaced. He acted the part of a gallant general
and a sensible man. As long as there was any reasonable hope
of success in the business he had in hand, nothing was too
adventurous or too dangerous for him to attempt; and if any
general ever did so, he put every chance of victory to the
fullest proof. But when all his endeavours miscarried, and no
reasonable expectation was left of saving his troops, he yielded
to the inevitable, and sent ambassadors to treat of peace and
terms of accommodation. And in this he showed great good
sense and practical ability; for it is quite as much the duty of
a leader to be able to see when it is time to give in, as when
it is the time to win a victory. Lutatius was ready enough to
listen to the proposal, because he was fully aware that the
<pb n="71"/>
resources of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> were at the lowest ebb from the strain of the
war; and eventually it was his fortune to put
an end to the contest by a treaty of which I here
give the terms. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The treaty, B, C, 242</note> "Friendship is established between
the Carthaginians and Romans on the following terms, provided
always that they are ratified by the Roman people. The Carthaginians shall evacuate the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>: they shall not make
war upon Hiero, nor bear arms against the Syracusans or their
allies. The Carthaginians shall give up to the Romans all

<div2 id="b1c63" type="chapter" n="63">
<head>The Longest and Harshest War in History</head>
<p>When this treaty was sent to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the people refused
to accept it, but sent ten commissioners to examine into the
business. Upon their arrival they made no change in the
general terms of the treaty, but they introduced some slight
alterations in the direction of increased severity towards
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. Thus they reduced the time allowed for the
payment of the indemnity by one half; they added a thousand

<p>Such were the conditions on which the war was ended, after<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Greatness of the war.</note>
lasting twenty-four years continuously. It was
at once the longest, most continuous, and most
severely contested war known to us in history.
Apart from the other battles fought and the preparations made,
which I have described in my previous chapters, there were two
sea-fights, in one of which the combined numbers of the two
fleets exceeded five hundred quinqueremes, in the other nearly
approached seven hundred. In the course of the war, counting
what were destroyed by shipwreck, the Romans lost seven
hundred quinqueremes, the Carthaginians five hundred. Those
therefore who have spoken with wonder of the sea-battles
of an Antigonus, a Ptolemy, or a Demetrius, and the greatness
of their fleets, would we may well believe have been overwhelmed with astonishment at the hugeness of these proportions if they had had to tell the story of this war.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">i(storh/santas.</foreign> There seems no need to give this word the unusual
sense of <foreign lang="la">narratum legere</foreign> here, as some do.</note> If, further,
<pb n="72"/>
we take into consideration the superior size of the quinqueremes,
compared with the triremes employed by the Persians against
the Greeks, and again by the Athenians and Lacedaemonians
in their wars with each other, we shall find that never in the
whole history of the world have such enormous forces contended
for mastery at sea.</p>
<p>These considerations will establish my original observation, and show the falseness of the opinion entertained by
certain Greeks. It was <emph>not</emph> by mere chance or without
knowing what they were doing that the Romans struck their
bold stroke for universal supremacy and dominion, and
justified their boldness by its success. No: it was the natural
result of discipline gained in the stern school of difficulty and
danger.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c64" type="chapter" n="64">
<head>Why <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> is No Longer a Naval Power</head>
<p>And no doubt the question does naturally arise here
as to why they find it impossible in our days to man so many
ships, or take the sea with such large fleets, though masters of
the world, and possessing a superiority over others many times
as great as before. The explanation of this difficulty will be
clearly understood when we come to the description of their
civil constitution. I look upon this description as a most
important part of my work, and one demanding close attention
on the part of my readers. For the subject is calculated to
afford pleasure in the contemplation, and is up to this time
so to speak absolutely unknown, thanks to historians, some of
whom have been ignorant, while others have given so confused
an account of it as to be practically useless. For the present
it suffices to say that, as far as the late war was concerned, the
two nations were closely matched in the character of the
designs they entertained, as well as in the lofty courage they
showed in prosecuting them: and this is especially true of
the eager ambition displayed on either side to secure the
supremacy. But in the individual gallantry of their men the
Romans had decidedly the advantage; while we must credit
the Carthaginians with the best general of the day both for
genius and daring. I mean Hamilcar Barcas, own father of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>'s future enemy Hannibal.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c65" type="chapter" n="65">
<head>The Sequel of the First Punic War</head>
<p>The confirmation of this peace was followed by events
which involved both nations in a struggle of an identical or
<pb n="73"/>
similar nature. At <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the late war was succeeded by a
social war against the Faliscans, which, however, they brought
to a speedy and successful termination by the
capture of <placeName key="tgn,7006788">Falerii</placeName> after only a few days' siege. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">War between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7006788">Falerii</placeName>.</note>
The Carthaginians were not so fortunate. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The mercenary war, B. C. <date value="-241">241</date>.</note>Just
about the same time they found themselves confronted by three
enemies at once, their own mercenaries, the
Numidians, and such Libyans as joined the former in their revolt. And this war proved to be
neither insignificant nor contemptible. It exposed them to frequent and terrible alarms; and, finally, it became a question to
them not merely of a loss of territory, but of their own bare
existence, and of the safety of the very walls and buildings of
their city. There are many reasons that make it worth while
to dwell upon the history of this war: yet I must give only a
summary account of it, in accordance with the original plan of
this work. The nature and peculiar ferocity of the struggle,
which has been generally called the "truceless war," may be
best learnt from its incidents. It conveys two important
lessons: it most conspicuously shows those who employ
mercenaries what dangers they should foresee and provide
against; and secondly, it teaches how wide the distinction is
between the character of troops composed of a confused mass
of uncivilised tribes, and of those which have had the benefit
of education, the habits of social life, and the restraints of law.
But what is of most importance to us is, that we may trace
from the actual events of this period the causes which led to
the war between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> in the time of Hannibal.
These causes have not only been a subject of dispute among
historians, but still continue to be so among those who were
actually engaged; it is therefore a matter of importance to
enable students to form an opinion on this matter as nearly as
possible in accordance with the truth.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c66" type="chapter" n="66">
<head>Mischief Brewing Among the Mercenaries</head>
<p>The course of events at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> subsequent to the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</note>
peace was as follows: As soon as possible
after it was finally ratified Barcas withdrew the
troops at <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, and then immediately laid down his command. Gesco, who was commandant of the town, proceeded to transport the soldiers into
<pb n="74"/>
<placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. But foreseeing what was likely to happen, he very
prudently embarked them in detachments, and did not send
them all in one voyage. His object was to gain time for the
Carthaginian government; so that one detachment should
come to shore, receive the pay due to them, and depart from
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to their own country, before the next detachment was
brought across and joined them. In accordance with this idea
Gesco began the transportation of the troops. But the Government&mdash;partly because the recent expenses had reduced their
finances to a low ebb, partly because they felt certain that, if
they collected the whole force and entertained them in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, they would be able to persuade the mercenaries to
accept something less than the whole pay due to them&mdash;did
not dismiss the detachments as they landed, but kept them
massed in the city. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The mercenaries sent to Sicca,</note> But when this resulted in the commission
of many acts of lawlessness by night and day, they began to
feel uneasy at their numbers and their growing licentiousness;
and required the officers, until such time as arrangements for
discharging their pay should have been made, and the rest of
the army should have arrived, to withdraw with
all their men to a certain town called Sicca,
receiving each a piece of gold for their immediate necessities. As far as quitting the city was concerned
they were ready enough to obey; but they desired to leave
their heavy baggage there as before, on the ground that they
would soon have to return to the city for their wages. But
the Carthaginian government were in terror lest, considering
the length of their absence and their natural desire for the
society of wives or children, they would either not quit the city
at all; or, if they did, would be sure to be enticed by these feelings to return, and that thus there would be no decrease of
outrages in the city. Accordingly they forced them to take
their baggage with them: but it was sorely against the will of
the men, and roused strong feelings of animosity among them.
These mercenaries being forced to retire to Sicca, lived there
as they chose without any restraint upon their lawlessness.
For they had obtained two things the most demoralising for
hired forces, and which in a word are in themselves the allsufficient source and origin of mutinies,&mdash;relaxation of discipline
<pb n="75"/>
and want of employment.<note anchored="yes">Sicca Venerea, so called from a temple of Venus, was notorious for its
licentiousness. <bibl n="V. Max. 2.6.15">Valer. Max. 2, 6, 15</bibl>.</note> For lack of something better to do,
some of them began calculating, always to their own advantage,
the amount of pay owing to them; and thus making out the
total to be many times more than was really due, they gave out
that this was the amount which they ought to demand from
the Carthaginians. Moreover they all began to call to mind
the promises made to them by the generals in their harangues,
delivered on various occasions of special danger, and to entertain
high hopes and great expectations of the amount of compensation which awaited them. The natural result followed.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c67" type="chapter" n="67">
<head>The Beginning of the Outbreak</head>
<p>When the whole army had mustered at Sicca, and Hanno,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The beginning of the outbreak, B. C. <date value="-241">241</date>.</note>
now appointed general in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, far from satisfying
these hopes and the promises they had received,
talked on the contrary of the burden of the taxes
and the embarrassment of the public finances; and actually
endeavoured to obtain from them an abatement even from the
amount of pay acknowledged to be due to them; excited and
mutinous feelings at once began to manifest themselves. There
were constant conferences hastily got together, sometimes in
separate nationalities, sometimes of the whole army; and there
being no unity of race or language among them, the whole camp
became a babel of confusion, a scene of inarticulate tumult, and
a veritable revel of misrule. For the Carthaginians being
always accustomed to employ mercenary troops of miscellaneous
nationalities, in securing that an army should consist of several
different races, act wisely as far as the prevention of any rapid
combinations for mutiny, or difficulty on the part of the commanders in overawing insubordination, are concerned: but the
policy utterly breaks down when an outburst of anger, or
popular delusion, or internal dissension, has actually occurred;
for it makes it impossible for the commander to soothe excited
feelings, to remove misapprehensions, or to show the ignorant
their error. Armies in such a state are not usually content
with mere human wickedness; they end by assuming the
ferocity of wild beasts and the vindictiveness of insanity.</p>
<p>This is just what happened in this case. There were in the
army Iberians and Celts, men from <placeName key="tgn,7003236">Liguria</placeName> and the Balearic
<pb n="76"/>
Islands, and a considerable number of half-bred Greeks,
mostly deserters and slaves; while the main body consisted of
Libyans. Consequently it was impossible to collect and address
them <foreign lang="fr">en masse,</foreign> or to approach them with this view by any
means whatever. There was no help for it: the general could
not possibly know their several languages; and to make a
speech four or five times on the same subject, by the mouths
of several interpreters, was almost more impossible, if I may say
so, than that. The only alternative was for him to address his
entreaties and exhortations to the soldiers through their officers.
And this Hanno continually endeavoured to do. But there
was the same difficulty with them. Sometimes they failed to
understand what he said: at others they received his words
with expressions of approval to his face, and yet from error or
malice reported them in a contrary sense to the common soldiers. The result was a general scene of uncertainty, mistrust,
and misunderstanding. And to crown all, they took it into
their heads that the Carthaginian government had a design in
thus sending Hanno to them: that they purposely did not
send the generals who were acquainted with the services they
had rendered in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and who had been the authors of the
promises made to them; but had sent the one man who had
not been present at any of these transactions. Whether that
were so or not, they finally broke off all negotiations with
Hanno; conceived a violent mistrust of their several commanders; and in a furious outburst of anger with the Carthaginians started towards the city, and pitched their camp about
a hundred and twenty stades from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, at the town of
Tunes, to the number of over twenty thousand.</p></div2>

It was a grave mistake to have collected so
large a number of mercenaries into one place
without any warlike force of their own citizens
to fall back upon: but it was a still graver mistake to have
delivered up to them their children and wives, with their heavy
baggage to boot; which they might have retained as hostages,
and thus have had greater security for concerting their own
measures, and more power of ensuring obedience to their
orders. However, being thoroughly alarmed at the action

of the men in regard to their encampment, they went every
length in their eagerness to pacify their anger. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Attempts to pacify them.</note> They sent
them supplies of provisions in rich abundance,
to be purchased exactly on their own terms,
and at their own price. Members of the Senate
were despatched, one after the other, to treat with them; and
they were promised that whatever they demanded should be
conceded if it were within the bounds of possibility. Day by
day the ideas of the mercenaries rose higher. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The demands of the mercenaries.</note> For their contempt
became supreme when they saw the dismay and excitement in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>; their confidence in themselves was profound; and their engagements
with the Roman legions in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> had convinced
them, that not only was it impossible for the Carthaginians to
face them in the field, but that it would be difficult to find any
nation in the world who could. Therefore, when the Carthaginians conceded the point of their pay, they made a further
claim for the value of the horses they had lost. When this
too was conceded, they said that they ought to receive the
value of the rations of corn due to them from a long time previous, reckoned at the highest price reached during the war.
And in short, the ill-disposed and mutinous among them being
numerous, they always found out some new demand which
made it impossible to come to terms. Upon the Carthaginian
government, however, pledging themselves to the full extent
of their powers, they eventually agreed to refer the matter to
the arbitration of some one of the generals who had been
actually engaged in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. Now they were displeased with
Hamilcar Barcas, who was one of those under whom they had
fought in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, because they thought that their present unfavourable position was attributable chiefly to him. They
thought this from the fact that he never came to them as an

command. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The dispute referred to the arbitration of Gesco.</note> But towards Gesco their feelings

<p>Gesco came to Tunes by sea, bringing the money with
him. There he held a meeting first of the officers, and then
of the men, according to their nationalities; rebuked them for
their past behaviour, and endeavoured to convince them as to
their duty in the present: but most of all he dwelt upon their
obligation in the future to show themselves well-disposed towards the people whose pay they had been so long enjoying.
Finally, he proceeded to discharge the arrears of pay, taking
each nationality separately. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Spendius.</note> But there was a certain Campanian in the army, a runaway Roman slave

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Math&omacr;s.</note> He was seconded by a Libyan called Math&omacr;s,

the party of Spendius; and taking the Libyans aside, suggested
to them that, when the men of other races had received their
pay, and taken their departure to their several countries, the
Carthaginians would wreak upon them the full weight of the
resentment which they had, in common with themselves, incurred; and would look upon their punishment as a means of
striking terror into all the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>. It did not
take long to rouse the men by such arguments, nor were they
at a loss for a pretext, however insignificant. In discharging

with desperate courage and persistence: sometimes summoning their officers, sometimes calling a meeting of the men
according to their nationalities and remonstrating with them.
But on one occasion the Libyans, not having received their
wages as soon as they considered that they ought to have been
paid to them, approached Gesco himself with
some insolence. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Gesco and his staff seized and thrown into chains</note> With the idea of rebuking
their precipitancy he refused to produce the pay,
and bade them "go and ask their general Math&omacr;s
for it." This so enraged them, that without a moment's delay
they first made a raid upon the money that was kept in
readiness, and then arrested Gesco and the Carthaginians
with him. Math&omacr;s and Spendius thought that the speediest
way to secure an outbreak of war was for the men to commit
some outrage upon the sanctity of law and in violation of their
engagements. They therefore co-operated with the mass of
the men in their reckless outrages; plundered the baggage of
the Carthaginians along with their money; manacled Gesco and
his staff with every mark of insolent violence, and committed
<pb n="80"/>
them into custody. Thenceforth they were at open war with
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, having bound themselves together by oaths which
were at once impious and contrary to the principles universally
received among mankind.</p>
<p>This was the origin and beginning of the mercenary, or, as<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-240">240</date>.</note>
it is also called, the Libyan war. Math&omacr;s lost no
time after this outrage in sending emissaries to
the various cities in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, urging them to assert their freedom,
and begging them to come to their aid and join them in their
undertaking. The appeal was successful: nearly all the cities
in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> readily listened to the proposal that they should revolt
against <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, and were soon zealously engaged in sending
them supplies and reinforcements. They therefore divided
themselves into two parties; one of which laid siege to <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>,
the other to <placeName key="tgn,7001083">Hippo Zarytus</placeName>, because these two cities refused
to participate in the revolt.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c71" type="chapter" n="71">
<head>Despair at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName></head>
<p>Three things must be noticed in regard to the Carthaginians. First, among them the means of life of private
persons are supplied by the produce of the land; secondly, all
public expenses for war material and stores are discharged
from the tribute paid by the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>; and thirdly, it is
their regular custom to carry on war by means of mercenary
troops. At this moment they not only found themselves unexpectedly deprived of all these resources at once, but saw
each one of them actually employed against
themselves. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Despair at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.</note> Such an unlooked-for event
naturally reduced them to a state of great
discouragement and despair. After the long agony of the
Sicilian war they were in hopes, when the peace was ratified,
that they might obtain some breathing space and some period
of settled content. The very reverse was now befalling them.
They were confronted by an outbreak of war still more difficult
and formidable. In the former they were disputing with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>: but this was a domestic war, and
the issue at stake was the bare existence of themselves and
their county. Besides, the many battles in which they had
been engaged at sea had naturally left them ill supplied with
arms, sailors, and vessels. They had no store of provisions
ready, and no expectation whatever of external assistance from
<pb n="81"/>
friends or allies. They were indeed now thoroughly taught
the difference between a foreign war, carried on beyond the
seas, and a domestic insurrection and disturbance.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c72" type="chapter" n="72">
<head>Revolt in the Country</head>
<p>And for these overpowering miseries they had themselves to thank more than any one else. During the late war
they had availed themselves of what they regarded as a reasonable pretext for exercising their supremacy over the inhabitants
of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> with excessive harshness. They had exacted half of
all agricultural produce; had doubled the tribute of the towns;
and, in levying these contributions, had refused to show any
grace or indulgence whatever to those who were in embarrassed
circumstances. Their admiration and rewards were reserved,
not for those generals who treated the people with mildness
and humanity, but exclusively for those who like Hanno secured them the most abundant supplies and war material,
though at the cost of the harshest treatment of the provincials.</p>
<p>These people therefore needed no urging to revolt: a<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Revolt of the country people.</note>
single messenger sufficed. The women, who
up to this time had passively looked on while
their husbands and fathers were being led off to
prison for the non-payment of the taxes, now bound themselves by an oath in their several towns
that they would conceal nothing that they possessed; and, stripping off their ornaments, unreservedly contributed them to furnish pay for the
soldiers. They thus put such large means into the hands of
Math&omacr;s and Spendius, that they not only discharged the
arrears due to the mercenaries, which they had promised them
as an inducement to mutiny, but remained well supplied for
future needs. A striking illustration of the fact that true policy
does not regard only the immediate necessities of the hour,
but must ever look still more keenly to the future.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c73" type="chapter" n="73">
<head>The Carthaginians Prepare</head>
<p>No such considerations, however, prevented the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hanno's management of the war.</note>
Carthaginians in their hour of distress from
appointing Hanno general; because he had the
credit of having on a former occasion reduced
the city called <placeName key="tgn,7016671">Hecatompylos</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, to obedience. They
also set about collecting mercenaries; arming their own citizens
who were of military age; training and drilling the city cavalry;
<pb n="82"/>
and refitting what were left of their ships, triremes, penteconters, and the largest of the pinnaces. Meanwhile Math&omacr;s,
being joined by as many as seventy thousand Libyans, distributed these fresh troops between the two forces which were
besieging <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001083">Hippo Zarytus</placeName>, and carried on those
sieges without let or hindrance. At the same time they kept
firm possession of the encampment at Tunes, and had thus
shut out the Carthaginians from the whole of outer <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>.
For <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> itself stands on a projecting peninsula in a gulf,
nearly surrounded by the sea and in part also by a lake. The
isthmus that connects it with <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> is three miles broad: upon
one side of this isthmus, in the direction of the open sea and
at no great distance, stands the city of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, and on the other
stands Tunes, upon the shore of the lake. The mercenaries
occupied both these points, and having thus cut off the Carthaginians from the open country, proceeded to take measures
against <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> itself. They made frequent excursions up to
the town wall, sometimes by day and sometimes by night, and
were continually throwing the citizens into a state of alarm and
absolute panic.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c74" type="chapter" n="74">
<head>Failures of Hanno</head>
<p>Hanno, however, was busying himself with some success in providing defences. In this department of a general's
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fails to relieve <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>.</note>
duty he showed considerable ability; but he was quite a
different man at the head of a sally in force: he was not
sagacious in his use of opportunities, and managed the whole
business with neither skill nor promptitude. It was thus that
his first expedition miscarried when he went to
relieve <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>. The number of his elephants,
of which he had as many as a hundred, struck
terror into the enemy; yet he made so poor a use of this
advantage that, instead of turning it into a complete victory,
he very nearly brought the besieged, as well as himself, to
utter destruction. He brought from <placeName key="tgn,7016143">Carthage</placeName> catapults and
darts, and in fact all the apparatus for a siege; and having
encamped outside <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> undertook an assault upon the
enemy's entrenchment. The elephants forced their way into
the camp, and the enemy, unable to withstand their weight and
the fury of their attack, entirely evacuated the position. They
lost a large number from wounds inflicted by the elephants'
<pb n="83"/>
tusks; while the survivors made their way to a certain hill,
which was a kind of natural fortification thickly covered with
trees, and there halted, relying upon the strength of the position. But Hanno, accustomed to fight with Numidians and
Libyans, who, once turned, never stay their flight till they
are two days removed from the scene of the action, imagined
that he had already put an end to the war and had gained a
complete victory. He therefore troubled himself no more
about his men, or about the camp generally, but went inside
the town and occupied himself with his own personal comfort.
But the mercenaries, who had fled in a body on to the hill,
had been trained in the daring tactics of Barcas, and accustomed from their experience in the Sicilian warfare to retreat
and return again to the attack many times in the same day.
They now saw that the general had left his army and gone
into the town, and that the soldiers, owing to their victory,
were behaving carelessly, and in fact slipping out of the camp
in various directions: they accordingly got themselves into
order and made an assault upon the camp; killed a large
number of the men; forced the rest to fly ignominiously to
the protection of the city walls and gates; and possessed
themselves of all the baggage and apparatus belonging to
the besieged, which Hanno had brought outside the town in
addition to his own, and thus put into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>But this was not the only instance of his incompetence.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hanno's continued ill success.</note>
A few days afterwards, near a place called
Gorza, he came right upon the enemy, who lay
encamped there, and had two opportunities of
securing a victory by pitched battles; and two more by surprising them, as they changed quarters close to where he was.
But in both cases he let the opportunities slip for want of
care and proper calculation.</p></div2>

<head>Hamilcar Barcas Becomes Commander in Chief</head>
<p>The Carthaginians, therefore, when they saw his mismanagement of the campaign, once more placed
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hamilcar Barcas takes the command.</note>
Hamilcar Barcas at the head of affairs; and despatched him to the war as commander-in-chief,
with seventy elephants, the newly-collected mercenaries, and
the deserters from the enemy; and along with them the
cavalry and infantry enrolled from the citizens themselves,
<pb n="84"/>
amounting in all to ten thousand men. His appearance from
the first produced an immediate impression. The expedition
was unexpected; and he was thus able, by the dismay which it
produced, to lower the courage of the enemy. He succeeded
in raising the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, and showed himself worthy of
his former achievements, and of the confidence felt in him by
the people. What he accomplished on this service was this.</p>
<p>A chain of hills runs along the isthmus connecting <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName><note anchored="yes" place="marg">He gets his men across the Macaras.</note>
with the mainland, which are difficult of access, and are crossed
by artificial passes into the mainland; of these hills Math&omacr;s
had occupied all the available points and posted guards there.
Besides these there is a river called Macaras (Bagradas), which
at certain points interrupts the passage of travellers from the
city to the mainland, and though for the most
part impassable, owing to the strength of its
stream, is only crossed by one bridge. This
means of egress also Math&omacr;s was guarding securely, and had
built a town on it. The result was that, to say nothing of
the Carthaginians entering the mainland with an army, it was
rendered exceedingly difficult even for private individuals, who
might wish to make their way through, to elude the vigilance
of the enemy. This did not escape the observation and care
of Hamilcar; and while revolving every means and every
chance of putting an end to this difficulty about a passage, he
at length hit upon the following. He observed that where
the river discharges itself into the sea its mouth got silted up
in certain positions of the wind, and that then the passage
over the river at its mouth became like that over a marsh.
He accordingly got everything ready in the camp for the
expedition, without telling any one what he was going to do;
and then watched for this state of things to occur. When the
right moment arrived, he started under cover of night; and by
daybreak had, without being observed by any one, got his army
across this place, to the surprise of the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> as well
as of the enemy. Marching across the plain, he led his men
straight against the enemy who were guarding the bridge.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c76" type="chapter" n="76">
<head>Hamilcar Barcas Defeats Spendius</head>
<p>When he understood what had taken place Spendius advanced into the plain to meet Hamilcar. The force from the city
at the bridge amounted to ten thousand men; that from before
<pb n="85"/>
<placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> to more than fifteen thousand men; both of which now
advanced to support each other. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">And defeats Spendius.</note> When they had
effected a junction they imagined that they had
the Carthaginians in a trap, and therefore with
mutual words of exhortation passed the order to engage, and at
once commenced. Hamilcar was marching with his elephants in
front, his cavalry and light troops next, while his heavy armed
hoplites brought up the rear. But when he saw the precipitation
of the enemy's attack, he passed the word to his men to turn
to the rear. His instructions were that the troops in front
should, after thus turning to the rear, retire with all speed:
while he again wheeled to the right about what had been originally his rear divisions, and got them into line successively so as
to face the enemy. The Libyans and mercenaries mistook the
object of this movement, and imagined that the Carthaginians
were panic-stricken and in full retreat. Thereupon they broke
from their ranks and, rushing forward, began a vigorous hand
to hand struggle. When, however, they found that the cavalry
had wheeled round again, and were drawn up close to the hoplites, and that the rest of the army also was being brought up,
surprise filled the Libyans with panic; they immediately turned
and began a retreat as precipitate and disorderly as their
advance. In the blind flight which followed some of them
ran foul of their own rearguard, who were still advancing, and
caused their own destruction or that of their comrades; but
the greater part were trampled to death by the cavalry and
elephants who immediately charged. As many as six thousand of the Libyans and foreign troops were killed, and about
two thousand taken prisoners. The rest made good their
escape, either to the town on the bridge or to the camp near
<placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>. After this victory Hamilcar followed close upon the
heels of the enemy, carried the town on the bridge by assault,
the enemy there abandoning it and flying to Tunes, and then
proceeded to scour the rest of the district: some of the towns
submitting, while the greater number he had to reduce by
force. And thus he revived in the breasts of the Carthaginians
some little spirit and courage, or at least rescued them from
the state of absolute despair into which they had fallen.</p></div2>

<head>Mathos Harasses Hamilcar</head>
<p>Meanwhile Math&omacr;s himself was continuing the siege
<pb n="86"/>
of <placeName key="tgn,7001083">Hippo Zarytus</placeName>, and he now counselled Autaritus, the
leader of the Gauls, and Spendius to stick close
to the skirts of the enemy, avoiding the plains,
because the enemy were strong in cavalry
and elephants, but marching parallel with them on the slopes
of the mountains, and attacking them whenever they saw them
in any difficulty. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Math&omacr;s harasses Hamilcar's march.</note> While suggesting these tactics, he at the
same time sent messengers to the Numidians and Libyans,
entreating them to come to their aid, and not to let slip the
opportunity of securing their own freedom. Accordingly,
Spendius took with him a force of six thousand men, selected
from each of the several nationalities at Tunes, and started,
keeping along a line of hills parallel to the Carthaginians.
Besides these six thousand he had two thousand Gauls under
Autaritus, who were all that were left of the original number,
the rest having deserted to the Romans during the period of
the occupation of <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName>. Now it happened that, just when
Hamilcar had taken up a position in a certain plain which
was surrounded on all sides by mountains, the reinforcements
of Numidians and Libyans joined Spendius. The Carthaginians, therefore, suddenly found a Libyan encampment
right on their front, another of Numidians on their rear, and
that of Spendius on their flank; and it seemed impossible to
escape from the danger which thus menaced them on every
side.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c78" type="chapter" n="78">
<head>Nar&aacute;vas Joins Hamilcar</head>
<p>But there was at that time a certain Nar&aacute;vas, a Numidian
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hamilcar is joined by the Numidian Nar&aacute;vas.</note>
of high rank and warlike spirit, who entertained
an ancestral feeling of affection for the Carthaginians, rendered especially warm at that
time by admiration for Hamilcar. He now thought that he
had an excellent opportunity for an interview and association
with that general; and accordingly came to the Carthaginian
quarters with a body of a hundred Numidians, and boldly approaching the outworks, remained there waving his hand.
Wondering what his object could be Hamilcar sent a horseman
to see; to whom Nar&aacute;vas said that he wished for an interview
with the general. The Carthaginian leader still showing hesitation and incredulity, Nar&aacute;vas committed his horse and javelins
to the care of his guards, and boldly came into the camp unarmed.
<pb n="87"/>  His fearlessness made a profound impression not unmixed with surprise. No further objection, however, was made
to his presence, and the desired interview was accorded; in
which he declared his good-will to the Carthaginians generally,
and his especial desire to be friends with Barcas. "This was
the motive of his presence," he said; "he was come with the
full intention of taking his place by his side and of faithfully
sharing all his actions and undertakings." Hamilcar, on hearing these words, was so immensely charmed by the young man's
courage in coming, and his honest simplicity in the interview,
that he not only consented to accept his co-operation, but promised also with an oath that he would give him his daughter in
marriage if he kept faith with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to the end. The agreement having been thus made, Nar&aacute;vas came with his division of
Numidians, numbering two thousand. Thus reinforced Hamilcar
offered the enemy battle; which Spendius, having joined forces
with the Libyans, accepted; and descending into
the plain engaged the Carthaginians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Again defeats Spendius.</note> In the
severe battle which followed Hamilcar's army
was victorious: a result which he owed partly to the excellent
behaviour of the elephants, but particularly to the brilliant
services rendered by Nar&aacute;vas. Autaritus and Spendius managed
to escape; but of the rest as many as ten thousand were killed and
four thousand taken prisoners. When the victory was completed,
Hamilcar gave permission to those of the prisoners who chose
to enlist in his army, and furnished them with arms from the
spoils of the enemy's slain: those who did not choose to accept
this offer he summoned to a meeting and harangued them.
He told them that the crimes committed by them up to that
moment were pardoned, and they were permitted to go their
several ways, wheresoever they chose, but on condition that
none of them bore arms against <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> again: if any one of
them were ever caught so doing, he warned them distinctly
that he would meet with no mercy.</p></div2>

<head>The Mutineers Resolve to Murder Gesco</head>
<p>This conspiracy of Math&omacr;s and Spendius caused an

finally put him and his compatriots to the sword. The

to the captives alarmed Math&omacr;s and Spendius
and Autaritus Gaul. They were afraid that
conciliatory treatment of this sort would induce
the Libyans, and the main body of the mercenaries, to embrace with eagerness the impunity
thus displayed before their eyes. They consulted together, therefore, how they might by some new act
of infamy inflame to the highest pitch of fury the feelings of
their men against the Carthaginians. They finally determined
upon the following plan. They summoned a meeting of the
soldiers; and when it was assembled, they introduced a bearer
of a despatch which they represented to have been sent by
their fellow conspirators in <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>. The despatch warned
them to keep a careful watch over Gesco and all his fellow
prisoners (whom, as has been stated, they had treacherously
seized in Tunes), as certain persons in the camp were secretly
negotiating with the Carthaginians for their release. Taking
this as his text, Spendius commenced by urging the men not
to put any trust in the indulgence shown by the Carthaginian
general to the prisoners of war, "For," said he, "it is with no
intention of saving their lives that he adopted this course in
regard to the prisoners; his aim was, by releasing them, to get
us into his power, that punishment might not be confined to
some of us, but might fall on all at once." He went on to
<pb n="89"/>
urge them to be on their guard, lest by letting Gesco's party
go they should teach their enemies to despise them; and should
also do great practical damage to their own interests, by suffering a man to escape who was an excellent general, and likely
to be a most formidable enemy to themselves. Before he had
finished this speech another courier arrived, pretending to
have been sent by the garrison at Tunes, and bearing a
despatch containing warnings similar to that from <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c80" type="chapter" n="80">
<head>The Murder of Gesco</head>
<p>It was now the turn of Autaritus the <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. "Your only
hope," he said, "of safety is to reject all hopes which rest on
the Carthaginians. So long as any man clings to the idea of
indulgence at their hands, he cannot possibly be a genuine
ally of yours. Never trust, never listen, never attend to anyone, unless he recommend unrelenting hostility and implacable
hatred towards the Carthaginians: all who speak on the other
side regard as traitors and enemies." After this preface, he
gave it as his advice that they should put to death with torture
both Gesco and those who had been seized with him, as well
as the Carthaginian prisoners of war who had been captured
since. Now this Autaritus was the most effective speaker of
any, because he could make himself understood to a large
number of those present at a meeting. For, owing to his
length of service, he knew how to speak Phoenician; and
Phoenician was the language in which the largest number of
men, thanks to the length of the late war, could listen to
with satisfaction. Accordingly his speech was received with
acclamation, and he stood down amidst loud applause. But
when many came forward from the several nationalities at
the same time; and, moved by Gesco's former kindnesses to
themselves, would have deprecated at least the infliction of
torture, not a word of what they said was understood: partly
because many were speaking at the same time, and partly
because each spoke in his own language. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Murder of Gesco.</note> But when at
length it was disclosed that what they meant was to dissuade
the infliction of torture, upon one of those present shouting
out "Throw!" they promptly stoned to death all who had
come forward to speak; and their relations
buried their bodies, which were crushed into
shapeless masses as though by the feet of elephants. Still they at
<pb n="90"/>
least were buried. But the followers of Spendius now seized
Gesco and his fellow prisoners, numbering about seven
hundred, led them outside the stockade, and having made
them march a short distance from the camp, first cut off their
hands, beginning with Gesco, the man whom a short while
before they had selected out of all <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> as their benefactor
and had chosen as arbitrator in their controversy. When they
had cut off their hands, they proceeded to lop off the extremities of the unhappy men, and having thus mutilated
them and broken their legs, they threw them still alive into a
trench.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c81" type="chapter" n="81">
<head>Atrocities of the Mutineers</head>
<p>When news of this dreadful affair reached the Carthaginians, they were powerless indeed to do anything, but they were
filled with horror; and in a transport of agony despatched messengers to Hamilcar and the second general Hanno, entreating
them to rally to their aid and avenge the unhappy victims;
and at the same time they sent heralds to the authors of this
crime to negotiate for the recovery of the dead bodies. But
the latter sternly refused; and warned the messengers to send
neither herald nor ambassador to them again; for the same
punishment which had just befallen Gesco awaited all who
came. And for the future they passed a resolution, which
they encouraged each other to observe, to put every Carthaginian whom they caught to death with torture; and that
whenever they captured one of their auxiliaries they would cut
off his hands and send him back to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. And this
resolution they exactly and persistently carried out. Such
horrors justify the remark that it is not only the bodies of men,
and the ulcers and imposthumes which are bred in them, that
grow to a fatal and completely incurable state of inflammation,
but their souls also most of all. For as in the case of
ulcers, sometimes medical treatment on the one hand only
serves to irritate them and make them spread more rapidly,
while if, on the other hand, the medical treatment is stopped,
having nothing to check their natural destructiveness, they
gradually destroy the substance on which they feed; just so at
times it happens that similar plague spots and gangrenes fasten
upon men's souls; and when this is so, no wild beast can be
more wicked or more cruel than a man. To men in such a
<pb n="91"/>
frame of mind if you show indulgence or kindness, they regard
it as a cover for trickery and sinister designs, and only become
more suspicious and more inflamed against the authors of it;
while if you retaliate, their passions are aroused to a kind of
dreadful rivalry, and then there is no crime too monstrous or
too cruel for them to commit. The upshot with these men
was, that their feelings became so brutalised that they lost the
instincts of humanity: which we must ascribe in the first place,
and to the greatest extent, to uncivilised habits and a
wretchedly bad early training; but many other things contributed to this result, and among them we must reckon as
most important the acts of violence and rapacity committed by
their leaders, sins which at that time were prevalent among

<p>Alarmed by the recklessness displayed by the enemy,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Quarrels of Hanno and Hamilcar.</note>
Hamilcar summoned Hanno to join him, being convinced that
a consolidation of the two armies would give him the best
chance of putting an end to the whole war. Such of the
enemy as he took in the field he put to execution on the spot,
while those who were made prisoners and brought to him he
threw to the elephants to be trampled to death; for he now
made up his mind that the only possibility of
finishing the war was to entirely destroy the
enemy. But just as the Carthaginians were
beginning to entertain brighter hopes in regard to the
war, a reverse as complete as it was unexpected brought
their fortunes to the lowest ebb. For these two generals,
when they had joined forces, quarrelled so bitterly with
each other, that they not only omitted to take advantage of
chances against the enemy, but by their mutual animosity gave
the enemy many opportunities against themselves. Finding
this to be the case, the Carthaginian government sent out
instructions that one of the generals was to retire, the other to
remain, and that the army itself was to decide which of them
it should be. This was one cause of the reverse in the fortunes
of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> at this time. Another, which was almost contemporaneous, was this. Their chief hope of furnishing the army
with provisions and other necessaries rested upon the supplies
that were being brought from a place to which they give the
<pb n="92"/>
name of Emporiae: but as these supplies were on their way,
they were overtaken by a storm at sea and entirely destroyed.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Revolt of <placeName key="tgn,7001083">Hippo Zarytus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>.</note> This was all the more fatal because <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> was lost to them
at the time, as we have seen, and that island had always been
of the greatest service to them in difficulties of this sort. But
the worst blow of all was the revolt of the
cities of <placeName key="tgn,7001083">Hippo Zarytus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, the only
cities in all <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> that had been faithful to
them, not only in the present war, but also at the time of the
invasion of Agathocles, as well as that of the Romans. To
both these latter they had offered a gallant resistance; and,
in short, had never at any time adopted any policy hostile to
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. But now they were not satisfied with simply revolting
to the Libyans, without any reason to allege for their conduct.
With all the bitterness of turncoats, they suddenly paraded
an ostentatious friendship and fidelity to them, and gave
practical expression to implacable rage and hatred towards the
Carthaginians. They killed every man of the force which had
come from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to their aid, as well as its commander,
and threw the bodies from the wall. They surrendered their
town to the Libyans, while they even refused the request of
the Carthaginians to be allowed to bury the corpses of their
unfortunate soldiers, Math&omacr;s and Spendius were so elated by
these events that they were emboldened to attempt <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>
itself. But Barcas had now got Hannibal as his coadjutor,
who had been sent by the citizens to the army in the place of
Hanno,&mdash;recalled in accordance with the sentence of the
army, which the government had left to their discretion in
reference to the disputes that arose between the two generals.
Accompanied, therefore, by this Hannibal and by Nar&aacute;vas,
Hamilcar scoured the country to intercept the supplies of
Math&omacr;s and Spendius, receiving his most efficient support in
this, as in other things; from the Numidian Nar&aacute;vas.</p></div2>

<p>Such being the position of their forces in the field, the

of it was more forward to do so than ever, from
a conviction that it was for his interest, with a
view alike to his own sovereignty and to his friendship with
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> should not perish, and so leave the

his reasoning was entirely sound and prudent. It is never
right to permit such a state of things; nor to help any one to
build up so preponderating a power as to make resistance to
it impossible, however just the cause. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Friendly disposition of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note> Not that the Romans
themselves had failed to observe the obligations
of the treaty, or were showing any failure of
friendly dispositions; though at first a question
had arisen between the two powers, from the following circumstance. At the beginning of the war, certain persons
sailing from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with provisions for the mutineers, the Carthaginians captured them and forced them to land in their own
harbour; and presently had as many as five hundred such persons in their prisons. This caused considerable annoyance at
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>: but, after sending ambassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and recovering possession of the men by diplomatic means, the Romans
were so much gratified that, by way of returning the favour,
they restored the prisoners made in the Sicilian war whom they
still retained; and from that time forth responded cheerfully
and generously to all requests made to them. They allowed
their merchants to export to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> whatever from time to
time was wanted, and prohibited those who were exporting to
the mutineers. When, subsequently, the mercenaries in
<placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, having revolted from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, invited their interference
on the island, they did not respond to the invitation; nor when
the people of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> offered them their submission did they
accept it, but kept strictly to the engagements contained in
the treaty.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c84" type="chapter" n="84">
<head>Hamilcar's Tactical Superiority</head>
<p>The assistance thus obtained from these allies encouraged the Carthaginians to maintain their resistance: while
Math&omacr;s and Spendius found themselves quite as much in the
position of besieged as in that of besiegers; for Hamilcar's
force reduced them to such distress for provisions that they
<pb n="94"/>
were at last compelled to raise the siege. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-238">238</date>. Hamilcar, with assistance from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, surrounds Math&omacr;s and Spendius.</note> However, after a
short interval, they managed to muster the most
effective of the mercenaries and Libyans, to the
number in all of fifty thousand, among whom,
besides others, was Zarzas the Libyan, with
his division, and commenced once more to watch
and follow on the flank of Hamilcar's march.
Their method was to keep away from the level country, for
fear of the elephants and the cavalry of Nar&aacute;vas; but to seize
in advance of him all points of vantage, whether it were rising
ground or narrow pass. In these operations they showed
themselves quite a match for their opponents in the fury of
their assault and the gallantry of their attempts; but their
ignorance of military tactics frequently placed them at a
disadvantage. It was, in fact, a real and practical illustration
of the difference between scientific and unscientific warfare:
between the art of a general and the mechanical movements
of a soldier. Like a good draught-player, by isolating and
surrounding them, he destroyed large numbers in detail
without coming to a general engagement at all; and in
movements of more importance he cut off many without
resistance by enticing them into ambushes; while he threw
others into utter dismay by suddenly appearing where they
least expected him, sometimes by day and sometimes by night:
and all whom he took alive he threw to the elephants.
Finally, he managed unexpectedly to beleaguer them on
ground highly unfavourable to them and convenient for his
own force; and reduced them to such a pitch of distress that,
neither venturing to risk an engagement nor being able to run
away, because they were entirely surrounded by a trench and
stockade, they were at last compelled by starvation to feed on
each other: a fitting retribution at the hands of Providence for
their violation of all laws human and divine in their conduct
to their enemies. To sally forth to an engagement they did
not dare, for certain defeat stared them in the face, and they
knew what vengeance awaited them if they were taken; and
as to making terms, it never occurred to them to mention it,
they were conscious that they had gone too far for that. They
still hoped for the arrival of relief from Tunes, of which their
<pb n="95"/>
officers assured them, and accordingly shrank from no suffering
however terrible.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c85" type="chapter" n="85">
<head>Hamilcar Captures Spendius</head>
<p>But when they had used up for food the captives in
this horrible manner, and then the bodies of their slaves,
and still no one came to their relief from Tunes, their
sufferings became too dreadful to bear; and the common
soldiers broke out into open threats of violence against
their officers. Thereupon Autaritus, Zarzas, and Spendius
decided to put themselves into the hands of the enemy and
to hold a parley with Hamilcar, and try to make terms.
They accordingly sent a herald and obtained permission for
the despatch of an embassy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Spendius and Autaritus fall into the hands of Hamilcar.</note>It consisted of
ten ambassadors, who, on their arrival at the
Carthaginian camp, concluded an agreement
with Hamilcar on these terms: "The Carthaginians may select any ten men they choose from the enemy,
and allow the rest to depart with one tunic apiece." No
sooner had these terms been agreed to, than Hamilcar said at
once that he selected, according to the terms of the agreement,
the ten ambassadors themselves. The Carthaginians thus got
possession of Autaritus, Spendius, and the other most conspicuous officers. The Libyans saw that their officers were arrested,
and not knowing the terms of the treaty, believed that some
perfidy was being practised against them, and accordingly flew
to seize their arms. Hamilcar thereupon surrounded them
with his elephants and his entire force, and destroyed them to
a man. This slaughter, by which more than forty thousand
perished, took place near a place called the Saw, so named from
its shape resembling that tool.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c86" type="chapter" n="86">
<head>Math&omacr;s Captures Hannibal</head>
<p>This achievement of Hamilcar revived the hopes of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Siege of Math&omacr;s in Tunes.</note>
the Carthaginians who had been in absolute despair: while he, in conjunction with Nar&aacute;vas
and Hannibal, employed himself in traversing
the country and visiting the cities. His victory secured the
submission of the Libyans; and when they had come in, and
the greater number of the towns had been reduced to
obedience, he and his colleagues advanced to attack Tunes,
and commenced besieging Math&omacr;s. Hannibal pitched his
camp on the side of the town nearest to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, and
<pb n="96"/>
Hamilcar on the opposite side. When this was done they
brought the captives taken from the army of Spendius and
crucified them in the sight of the enemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Defeat and death of Hannibal.</note> But observing that
Hannibal was conducting his command with
negligence and over-confidence, Math&omacr;s assaulted the ramparts, killed many of the Carthaginians, and drove the entire army from the camp. All the
baggage fell into the hands of the enemy, and Hannibal himself was made a prisoner. They at once took him up to the
cross on which Spendius was hanging, and after the infliction
of exquisite tortures, took down the latter's body and fastened
Hannibal, still living, to his cross; and then slaughtered thirty
Carthaginians of the highest rank round the corpse of Spendius.
It seemed as though Fortune designed a competition in cruelty,
giving either side alternately the opportunity of outdoing the
other in mutual vengeance. Owing to the distance of the two
camps from each other it was late before Barcas discovered
the attack made from the town; nor, when he had discovered it,
could he even then go to the rescue with the necessary speed,
because the intervening country was rugged and difficult. He
therefore broke up his camp, and leaving Tunes marched
down the bank of the river Macaras, and pitched his camp
close to its mouth and to the sea.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b1c87" type="chapter" n="87">
<head>Final Defeat of the Mutineers</head>
<p>This unexpected reverse reduced the Carthaginians
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">By a final effort the Carthaginians raise a reinforcement for Hamilcar.</note>
once more to a melancholy state of despair.
But though their recent elation of spirit was followed so closely by this depression, they did not
fail to do what they could for their own preservation. They selected thirty members of
the Senate; with them they associated Hanno, who had some
time ago been recalled; and, arming all that were left of
military age in the city, despatched them to Barcas, with the
feeling that they were now making their supreme effort. They
strictly charged the members of the Senate to use every effort
to reconcile the two generals Hamilcar and Hanno, and to
make them forget their old quarrel and act harmoniously, in
view of the imminence of the danger. Accordingly, after the
employment of many various arguments, they induced the
generals to meet; and Hanno and Barcas were compelled to
<pb n="97"/>
give in and yield to their representations. The result was
that they ever afterwards co-operated with each other so cordially, that Math&omacr;s found himself continually worsted in the
numerous skirmishes which took place round the town called
<placeName key="tgn,7000642">Leptis</placeName>, as well as certain other towns; and at last became
eager to bring the matter to the decision of a general engagement, a desire in which the Carthaginians also shared in an
equal degree. Both sides therefore having determined upon
this course: they summoned all their allies to join them-in confronting the peril, and collected the garrisons stationed in the
various towns, conscious that they were about to stake their all
on the hazard. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Math&omacr;s beaten and captured.</note> All being ready on either side for the conflict,
they gave each other battle by mutual consent,
both sides being drawn up in full military
array. When victory declared itself on the
side of the Carthaginians, the larger number of the Libyans
perished on the field; and the rest, having escaped to a certain
town, surrendered shortly afterwards; while Math&omacr;s himself
was taken prisoner by his enemies.</p></div2>

held out, feeling that they had no reasonable
grounds for obtaining terms, because their
original acts of hostility left them no place for mercy or
pardon. So true is it that even in such outbreaks, however
criminal in themselves, it is of inestimable advantage to
be moderate, and to refrain from wanton acts which commit
their perpetrator beyond all power of forgiveness. Nor did
their attitude of defiance help these cities. Hanno invested
one and Barcas the other, and quickly reduced them to accept

dreadful danger; but its termination enabled her not only to
re-establish her authority over <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, but also to inflict condign punishment upon the authors of the revolt. For the last
act in the drama was performed by the young men conducting

ground that the lordship over <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> more properly belonged to them, and were preparing to take measures against
those who caused the revolt of the island, the Romans voted
to declare war against them, on the pretence that they were
making warlike preparations, not against <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, but against
themselves. The Carthaginians, however, having just had an
almost miraculous escape from annihilation in the recent war,
were in every respect disabled from renewing their quarrel with

twelve hundred talents into the bargain, that they might not

immediately succeeded these, touching summarily upon each
in accordance with my original plan.</p>
<p>As soon as they had brought the Libyan war to a conclusion<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-238" to="-229">238</dateRange>. Hamilcar and his son Hannibal sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>.</note>

was at the time in command of the fleet.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Situation in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName></head>
<p>It was at this same period that the Romans for the first
<note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>.</note>
time crossed to <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName> and that part of
<placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> with an army. The history of this expedition must not be treated as immaterial; but must be carefully studied by those who wish to understand clearly the
story I have undertaken to tell, and to trace the progress and
consolidation of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Agron, king of the Illyrians, was the son of Pleuratus, and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B C. <dateRange from="-233" to="-232">233</dateRange>-232.</note>
possessed the most powerful force, both by
land and sea, of any of the kings who had
reigned in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName> before him. By a bribe received from
Demetrius he was induced to promise help to the Medionians,
who were at that time being besieged by the
Aetolians, who, being unable to persuade the
Medionians to join their league, had determined
to reduce the city by force. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Siege of Medion in <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>.</note> They accordingly levied their
full army, pitched their camp under the walls of the city, and
kept up a continuous blockade, using every means to force
their way in, and every kind of siege-machine. But when
the time of the annual election of their Strategus drew near,
the besieged being now in great distress, and seeming likely
every day to surrender, the existing Strategus made an appeal
to the Aetolians. He argued that as he had had during
his term of office all the suffering and the danger, it was but
fair that when they got possession of the town he should have
the apportioning of the spoil, and the privilege of inscribing his
name on such arms as should be preserved for dedication.
This was resisted by some, and especially by those who were
candidates for the office, who urged upon the Assembly not to
prejudge this matter, but to leave it open for fortune to determine who was to be invested with this honour; and, finally, the
Aetolians decided that whoever was general when the city was
taken should share the apportioning of the spoils, and the
honour of inscribing the arms, with his predecessor.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>The Illyrians Relieve Medion</head>
<p>The decision was come to on the day before the election
of a new Strategus, and the transference of the command had,
<pb n="101"/>
according to the Aetolian custom, to take place. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Illyrians relieve Medion.</note> But on
that very night a hundred galleys with five
thousand Illyrians on board, sailed up to land
near Medion. Having dropped anchor at
daybreak, they effected a disembarkation with secrecy and
despatch; they then formed in the order customary in their
country, and advanced in their several companies against the
Aetolian lines. These last were overwhelmed with astonishment at the unexpected nature and boldness of the move; but
they had long been inspired with overweening self-confidence,
and having full reliance in their own forces were far from being
dismayed. They drew up the greater part of their hoplites
and cavalry in front of their lines on the level ground, and
with a portion of their cavalry and their light infantry they
hastened to occupy some rising ground in front of their camp,
which nature had made easily defensible. A single charge,
however, of the Illyrians, whose numbers and close order gave
them irresistible weight, served to dislodge the light-armed
troops, and forced the cavalry who were on the ground with
them to retire to the hoplites. But the Illyrians, being on the
higher ground, and charging down from it upon the Aetolian
troops formed up on the plain, routed them without difficulty; the
Medionians at the same time making a diversion in their favour
by sallying out of the town and charging the Aetolians. Thus,
after killing a great number, and taking a still greater number prisoners, and becoming masters also of their arms and
baggage, the Illyrians, having carried out the orders of their
king, conveyed their baggage and the rest of the booty to their
boats, and immediately set sail for their own country.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Death of Agron of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName></head>
<p>This was a most unexpected relief to the Medionians.
They met in public assembly and deliberated on the whole
business, and especially as to the inscribing the arms reserved
for dedication. They decided, in mockery of the Aetolian
decree, that the inscription should contain the name of the
Aetolian commander on the day of battle, and of the candidates
for succession to his office. And indeed Fortune seems, in what
happened to them, to have designed a display of her power to
the rest of mankind. The very thing which these men were
in momentary expectation of undergoing at the hands of their
<pb n="102"/>
enemies, she put it in their power to inflict upon those
enemies, and all within a very brief interval. The unexpected
disaster of the Aetolians, too, may teach all the world not to
calculate on the future as though it were the actually existent,
and not to reckon securely on what may still turn out quite
otherwise, but to allow a certain margin to the unexpected.
And as this is true everywhere and to every man, so is it
especially true in war.</p>

the events of the expedition, King Agron was
so beside himself with joy at the idea of having
conquered the Aetolians, whose confidence in
their own prowess had been extreme, that, giving
himself over to excessive drinking and other similar indulgences,
he was attacked by a pleurisy of which in a few days he died.
His wife Teuta succeeded him on the throne; and managed
the various details of administration by means of friends whom
she could trust. But her woman's head had been turned by
the success just related, and she fixed her gaze upon that, and
had no eyes for anything going on outside the country. Her
first measure was to grant letters of marque to privateers,
authorising them to plunder all whom they fell in with; and
she next collected a fleet and military force as large as the
former one, and despatched them with general instructions to
the leaders to regard every land as belonging to an enemy.</p></div2>

bargain, they disembarked and took the town and everything
in it at the first blow, the Gauls within the walls acting in
collusion with them. When this news was known, the
Epirotes raised a general levy and came in haste to the
rescue. Arriving in the neighbourhood of Phoenice, they
pitched their camp so as to have the river which flows
past Phoenice between them and the enemy, tearing up
the planks of the bridge over it for security. But news
being brought them that Scerdilaidas with five thousand
Illyrians was marching overland by way of the pass near
<placeName key="tgn,7010918">Antigoneia</placeName>, they detached some of their forces to guard that
town; while the main body gave themselves over to an
unrestrained indulgence in all the luxuries which the country
could supply; and among other signs of demoralisation they
neglected the necessary precaution of posting sentries and
night pickets. The division of their forces, as well as the
careless conduct of the remainder, did not escape the observation
of the Illyrians; who, sallying out at night, and replacing the
planks on the bridge, crossed the river safely, and having
secured a strong position, remained there quietly for the rest
of the night. At daybreak both armies drew up their forces
in front of the town and engaged. In this battle the Epirotes
were decidedly worsted: a large number of them fell, still
more were taken prisoners, and the rest fled in the direction
of the country of the Atintanes.</p></div2>

hopes which they had cherished, the Epirotes
turned to the despatch of ambassadors to the
Aetolians and Achaeans, earnestly begging for
their assistance. Moved by pity for their misfortunes, these nations consented; and an army
of relief sent out by them arrived at Helicranum.
Meanwhile the Illyrians who had occupied Phoenice, having
effected a junction with Scerdilaidas, advanced with him to this
place, and, taking up a position opposite to this army of relief,
wished at first to give it battle. But they were embarrassed
by the unfavourable nature of the ground; and just then a
despatch was received from Teuta, ordering their instant
return, because certain Illyrians had revolted to the Dardani
<pb n="104"/>
Accordingly, after merely stopping to plunder <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, they made
a truce with the inhabitants, by which they undertook to deliver
up all freemen, and the city of Phoenice, for a fixed ransom.
They then took the slaves they had captured and the rest of
their booty to their galleys, and some of them sailed away;
while those who were with Scerdilaidas retired by land through
the pass at <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Antigoneia</placeName>, after inspiring no small or ordinary terror
in the minds of the Greeks who lived along the coast. For
seeing the most securely placed and powerful city of <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>
thus unexpectedly reduced to slavery, they one and all began
henceforth to feel anxious, not merely as in former times for
their property in the open country, but for the safety of their
own persons and cities.</p>
<p>The Epirotes were thus unexpectedly preserved: but so far
from trying to retaliate on those who had wronged them, or expressing gratitude to those who had come to their relief, they
sent ambassadors in conjunction with the Acarnanians to
Queen Teuta, and made a treaty with the Illyrians, in virtue
of which they engaged henceforth to co-operate with them and
against the Achaean and Aetolian leagues. All which proceedings showed conclusively the levity of their conduct towards
men who had stood their friends, as well as an originally shortsighted policy in regard to their own interests.</p></div2>

the younger of the two ambassadors used a plainness of speech

upon the decks of the Achaean ships and captured them
by the superior number of their armed men. In this way
they took four triremes, and sunk one quinquereme with
all hands, on board of which Margos of Caryneia was sailing,
who had all his life served the Achaean league with complete

In speaking then of the history of the Etruscan Empire,
we should not refer to the district occupied by them at the
present time, but to these northern plains, and to what they
did when they inhabited them. Their chief intercourse was
with the Celts, because they occupied the adjoining districts;
who, envying the beauty of their lands, seized some slight
pretext to gather a great host and expel the Etruscans from
<pb n="115"/>
the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, which they at once took possession
of themselves. First, the country near the source of the
<placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> was occupied by the Laevi and Lebecii; after them the
Insubres settled in the country, the largest tribe of all; and
next them, along the bank of the river, the <placeName key="tgn,7005868">Cenomani</placeName>. But
the district along the shore of the Adriatic was held by another
very ancient tribe called Ven&ebreve;ti, in customs and dress nearly
allied to Celts, but using quite a different language, about
whom the tragic poets have written a great many wonderful
tales. South of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, in the Apennine district, first
beginning from the west, the Ananes, and next them the Boii
settled. Next them, on the coast of the Adriatic, the <placeName key="tgn,7008343">Lingones</placeName>;
and south of these, still on the sea-coast, the <placeName key="tgn,1035697">Senones</placeName>. These
are the most important tribes that took possession of this part of the country. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Their character.</note> They lived
in open villages, and without any permanent buildings. As
they made their beds of straw or leaves, and fed on meat,
and followed no pursuits but those of war and agriculture,
they lived simple lives without being acquainted with any
science or art whatever. Each man's property, moreover,
consisted in cattle and gold; as they were the only things
that could be easily carried with them, when they wandered
from place to place, and changed their dwelling as their
fancy directed. They made a great point, however, of friendship: for the man who had the largest number of clients or
companions in his wanderings, was looked upon as the most
formidable and powerful member of the tribe.<note anchored="yes">Compare the description of the Gauls given by Caesar, <bibl n="Caes. Gal. 6.11">B. G. 6, 11-20</bibl>.

<head>Early Conflicts between Gauls and Romans</head>
<p>In the early times of their settlement they did not
merely subdue the territory which they occupied, but rendered
also many of the neighbouring peoples subject to them, whom
they overawed by their audacity. Some time afterwards they
conquered the Romans in battle, and pursuing the flying

with the exception of the Capitol. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Battle of the Allia, 18th July, B. C. <date value="-390">390</date>.</note> But a circumstance intervened which recalled them home,
an invasion, that is to say, of their territory by
the Ven&ebreve;ti. Accordingly they made terms with the Romans,
handed back the city, and returned to their own land; and
subsequently were occupied with domestic wars. Some of the
tribes, also, who dwelt on the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, comparing their own barren
districts with the rich territory occupied by the others, were continually making raids upon them, and collecting their force
to attack them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Latin war, B. C. <dateRange from="-349" to="-340">349</dateRange>-340.</note> This gave the Romans time
to recover their strength, and to come to terms
with the people of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>. When, thirty
years after the capture of the city, the Celts came again as far
as Alba, the Romans were taken by surprise; and
having had no intelligence of the intended invasion, nor time to collect the forces of the Socii, did not
venture to give them battle. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-360">360</date>.</note> But when another invasion in

spirit, being eager to engage them and fight a decisive battle. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-348">348</date>.</note>

After this alarm they kept quiet for thirteen
years; at the end of which period, seeing
that the power of the Romans was growing formidable, they
made a peace and a definite treaty with them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c19" type="chapter" n="19">
<head>Gallic Wars</head>
<p>They abided by this treaty for thirty years: but at that
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-299">299</date>.</note>
time, alarmed by a threatening movement on the part of the
Transalpine tribes, and fearing that a dangerous war was
imminent, they diverted the attack of the invading horde from themselves by presents and
appeals to their ties of kindred, but incited them to attack the
Romans, joining in the expedition themselves. They directed
their march through Etruria, and were joined by the Etruscans;
and the combined armies, after taking a great quantity of booty,
got safely back from the Roman territory. But when they got
<pb n="117"/>
home, they quarrelled about the division of the spoil, and in
the end destroyed most of it, as well as the flower of their own
force. This is the way of the Gauls when they have appropriated their neighbours' property; and it mostly arises from
brutal drunkenness, and intemperate feeding. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-297">297</date></note>
In the fourth year after this, the Samnites
and Gauls made a league, gave the Romans battle in the
neighbourhood of Camerium, and slew a large number.
Incensed at this defeat, the Romans marched out a few days
afterwards, and with two Consular armies engaged the enemy in
the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Sentinum">Sentinum</placeName>; and, having killed the greater number of them, forced the survivors to retreat in hot haste each
to his own land. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-283">283</date>.</note> Again, after another interval
of ten years, the Gauls besieged <placeName key="perseus,Arretium">Arretium</placeName> with

The Praetor Lucius<note anchored="yes">Lucius Caecilius, <bibl n="Liv. Per. 12">Livy, Ep. 12</bibl>.</note> having fallen in this battle, Manius
Curius was appointed in his place. The ambassadors, sent

an expedition against them, which was met by the tribe called
the <placeName key="tgn,1035697">Senones</placeName>. In a pitched battle the army of the <placeName key="tgn,1035697">Senones</placeName> were
cut to pieces, and the rest of the tribe expelled from the county;
into which the Romans sent the first colony which they ever

same fate for themselves, the Boii made a general levy, summoned the Etruscans to join them, and set out to war. They
mustered their forces near the lacus Vadimonis, and there gave
the Romans battle; in which the Etruscans indeed suffered a loss
of more than half their men, while scarcely any of
the Boii escaped. But yet in the very next year
the same two nations joined forces once more; and arming even
those of them who had only just reached manhood, gave the
Romans battle again; and it was not until they had been utterly

defeated in this engagement that they humbled themselves so

<p>These events took place in the third year before Pyrrhus
crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and in the fifth before the destruction of the
Gauls at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>. For at this period fortune seems to have
plagued the Gauls with a kind of epidemic of war. But the
Romans gained two most important advantages from these
events. First, their constant defeats at the hands of the Gauls
had inured them to the worst that could befall them; and so,
when they had to fight with Pyrrhus, they came to the contest
like trained and experienced gladiators. And in the second
place, they had crushed the insolence of the Gauls just in time
to allow them to give an undivided attention, first to the war
with Pyrrhus for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and then to the war

<head>War with Insubres and Boii and Gaesatae</head>
<p>After these defeats the Gauls maintained an unbroken
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-236">236</date>. </note>
peace with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> for forty-five years. But when the generation which had witnessed the actual struggle had passed away,
and a younger generation of men had taken their places, filled
with unreflecting hardihood, and who had neither experienced
nor seen any suffering or reverse, they began, as was natural, to
disturb the settlement; and on the one hand
to let trifling causes exasperate them against
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and on the other to invite the Alpine Gauls to join the
fray. At first these intrigues were carried on by their chiefs
without the knowledge of the tribesmen; and accordingly,
when an armed host of Transalpine Gauls arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName>,
the Boii were suspicious; and forming a conspiracy against their
own leaders, as well as against the new-comers, they put their
own two kings Atis and Galatus to death, and cut each other
to pieces in a pitched battle. Just then the Romans, alarmed
at the threatened invasion, had despatched an army; but learning that the Gauls had committed this act of self-destruction, it
returned home again. In the fifth year after this alarm, in
the Consulship of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the Romans
<pb n="119"/>
divided among their citizens the territory of Picenum, from
which they had ejected the <placeName key="tgn,1035697">Senones</placeName> when they
conquered them: a democratic measure introduced by Gaius Flaminius, and a policy which we must
pronounce to have been the first step in the demoralisation of
the people, as well as the cause of the next Gallic war. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-232">232</date></note> For
many of the Gauls, and especially the Boii whose lands were

from the conviction that the object of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in her wars with
them was no longer supremacy and empire over them, but
their total expulsion and destruction.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c22" type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Several Gallic Tribes Join Forces</head>
<p>Accordingly the two most extensive tribes, the Insubres
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-231">231</date></note>
and Boii, joined in the despatch of messengers
to the tribes living about the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> and on the
Rhone, who from a word which means "serving for hire," are
called Gaesatae. To their kings Concolitanus and Aneroetes
they offered a large sum of gold on the spot; and, for the future,
pointed out to them the greatness of the wealth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and
all the riches of which they would become possessed, if they
took it. In these attempts to inflame their cupidity and induce
them to join the expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> they easily succeeded.
For they added to the above arguments pledges of their own
alliance; and reminded them of the campaign of their own
ancestors in which they had seized <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself, and had been
masters of all it contained, as well as the city itself, for seven
months; and had at last evacuated it of their own free will,
and restored it by an act of free grace, returning unconquered
and scatheless with the booty to their own land. These arguments made the leaders so eager for the expedition, that there
never at any other time came from that part of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> a larger
host, or one consisting of more notable warriors. Meanwhile,
the Romans, informed of what was coming, partly by report
and partly by conjecture, were in such a state of constant alarm
and excitement, that they hurriedly enrolled legions, collected
supplies, and sent out their forces to the frontier, as though
the enemy were already in their territory, before the Gauls
had stirred from their own lands.</p>
<p>It was this movement of the Gauls that, more than anything
else, helped the Carthaginians to consolidate their power in
<pb n="120"/>
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>. For the Romans, as I have said, looked upon the
Celtic question as the more pressing one of the two, as being so
near home; and were forced to wink at what was going on in
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, in their anxiety to settle it satisfactorily first. Having,

formidable army, furnished with a variety of
armour, in the eighth year after the distribution
of the lands of Picenum. The Insubres and
Boii remained loyal to the agreement they had
made with them: but the Ven&ebreve;ti and <placeName key="tgn,7005868">Cenomani</placeName> being induced
by embassies from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to take the Roman side, the Celtic
kings were obliged to leave a portion of their forces behind, to
guard against an invasion of their territory by those tribes.
They themselves, with their main army, consisting of one hundred and fifty thousand foot, and twenty thousand horse and
chariots, struck camp and started on their march, which was
to be through Etruria, in high spirits. As soon as it was
known at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> that the Celts had crossed the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, one of
the Consuls, Lucius Aemilius Papus, was sent with an army to
<placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName> to guard against the passage of the enemy, and one
of the Praetors into Etruria: for the other Consul, Gaius

There was universal terror in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, for the danger threatening
them was believed to be great and formidable. And naturally
so: for the old fear of the Gauls had never been eradicated from
their minds. No one thought of anything else: they were
incessantly occupied in mustering the legions, or enrolling new
ones, and in ordering up such of the allies as were ready
for service. The proper magistrates were ordered to give in
lists of all citizens of military age; that it might at once be
known to what the total of the available forces amounted.
And such stores of corn, and darts, and other military equipments
<pb n="121"/>  were collected as no one could remember on any
former occasion. From every side assistance was eagerly
rendered; for the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, in their terror at the
Gallic invasion, no longer thought of the matter as a question
of alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or of the war as undertaken to support
Roman supremacy, but each people regarded it as a danger
menacing themselves and their own city and territory. The
response to the Roman appeal therefore was prompt.</p></div2>

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman resources.</note>
great the power was which Hannibal subsequently ventured to attack, and what a mighty
empire he faced when he succeeded in inflicting upon the Roman people the most severe disasters, I
must now state the amount of the forces they could at that
time bring into the field. The two Consuls had marched out
with four legions, each consisting of five thousand two hundred
infantry and three hundred cavalry. Besides this there were
with each Consul allies to the number of thirty thousand
infantry and two thousand cavalry. Of Sabines and Etruscans
too, there had come to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, for that special occasion, four
thousand horse and more than fifty thousand foot. These
were formed into an army and sent in advance into Etruria,
under the command of one of the Praetors. Moreover, the
Umbrians and Sarsinatae, hill tribes of the Apennine district,
were collected to the number of twenty thousand; and with
them were twenty thousand Ven&ebreve;ti and <placeName key="tgn,7005868">Cenomani</placeName>. These
were stationed on the frontier of the Gallic territory, that they
might divert the attention of the invaders, by making an
incursion into the territory of the Boii. These were the forces
guarding the frontier. In <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself, ready as a reserve
in case of the accidents of war, there remained twenty thousand
foot and three thousand horse of citizens, and thirty thousand
foot and two thousand horse of the allies. Lists of men for
service had also been returned, of Latins eighty thousand foot
and five thousand horse; of Samnites seventy thousand foot and
seven thousand horse; of Iapygians and Messapians together
fifty thousand foot and sixteen thousand horse; and of Lucanians
thirty thousand foot and three thousand horse; of Marsi, and

<p>There will be another opportunity of treating the

subject in greater detail; for the present I
must return to the Celts. Having entered
Etruria, they began their march through the
country, devastating it as they chose, and without any
opposition; and finally directed their course against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
itself. But when they were encamped under the walls of
<placeName key="perseus,Clusium">Clusium</placeName>, which is three days' march from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, news was
brought them that the Roman forces, which were on duty in
Etruria, were following on their rear and were close upon them;
upon which they turned back to meet them, eager to offer
them battle. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Praetor's army defeated at <placeName key="perseus,Clusium">Clusium</placeName>.</note> The two armies came in sight
of each other about sunset, and encamped for
the night a short distance apart. But when
night fell, the Celts lit their watch fires; and leaving their
cavalry on the ground, with instructions that, as soon as
daylight made them visible to the enemy, they should follow
by the same route, they made a secret retreat along the road
to <placeName key="perseus,Faesulae">Faesulae</placeName>, and took up their position there; that they
might be joined by their own cavalry, and might disconcert
the attack of the enemy. Accordingly, when at daybreak the
Romans saw that the cavalry were alone, they believed that
the Celts had fled, and hastened in pursuit of the retreating
horse; but when they approached the spot where the enemy
were stationed, the Celts suddenly left their position and fell
upon them. The struggle was at first maintained with fury on
<pb n="123"/>
both sides: but the courage and superior numbers of the
Celts eventually gave them the victory. No less than six
thousand Romans fell: while the rest fled, most of whom
made their way to a certain strongly fortified height, and there
remained. The first impulse of the Celts was to besiege
them: but they were worn out by their previous night march,
and all the suffering and fatigue of the day; leaving therefore
a detachment of cavalry to keep guard round the hill, they
hastened to procure rest and refreshment, resolving to besiege
the fugitives next day unless they voluntarily surrendered.</p></div2>

<p>But meanwhile Lucius Aemilius, who had been stationed

on the coast of the Adriatic at <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName>,
having been informed that the Gauls had
entered Etruria and were approaching <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
set off to the rescue; and after a rapid march appeared on
the ground just at the critical moment. He pitched his
camp close to the enemy; and the fugitives on the hill, seeing
his watch fires, and understanding what had happened, quickly
recovered their courage and sent some of their men unarmed
to make their way through the forest and tell the Consul what
had happened. This news left the Consul as he thought no
alternative but to fight. He therefore ordered the Tribunes to
lead out the infantry at daybreak, while he, taking command
of the cavalry, led the way towards the hill. The Gallic
chieftains too had seen his watch fires, and understood that the
enemy was come; and at once held council of war. The
advice of King Aneroestes was, "that seeing the amount of
booty they had taken,&mdash;an incalculable quantity indeed of
captives, cattle, and other spoil,&mdash;they had better not run
the risk of another general engagement, but return home in
safety; and having disposed of this booty, and freed themselves
from its incumbrance, return, if they thought good, to make
another determined attack upon <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>." Having resolved to
follow the advice of Aneroestes in the present juncture, the
chiefs broke up their night council, and before daybreak struck
camp, and marched through Etruria by the road which follows
the coast of the Ligurian bay. While Lucius, having taken off
the remnant of the army from the hill, and combined it with
his own forces, determined that it would not be by any means
<pb n="124"/>
advantageous to offer the enemy regular battle; but that it was
better to dog their footsteps, watching for favourable times and
places at which to inflict damage upon them, or wrest some of
their booty from their hands.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c27" type="chapter" n="27">
<head>Atilius Meets the Gauls</head>
<p>Just at that time the Consul Gaius Atilius had crossed
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Atilius landing at <placeName key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName> intercepts the march of the Gauls.</note>
from <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and having landed at <placeName key="perseus,Pisae">Pisae</placeName> was
on his way to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and therefore he and
the enemy were advancing to meet each
other. When the Celts were at <placeName key="perseus,Telamon">Telamon</placeName> in
Etruria, their advanced guard fell in with that of Gaius, and
the men being made prisoners informed the Consul in answer
to questions of what had taken place; and told him that both the
armies were in the neighbourhood: that of the Celts, namely,
and that of Lucius close upon their rear. Though somewhat
disturbed at the events which he thus learnt, Gaius regarded
the situation as a hopeful one, when he considered that the
Celts were on the road between two hostile armies. He therefore ordered the Tribunes to martial the legions and to advance
at the ordinary pace, and in line as far as the breadth of the
ground permitted; while he himself having surveyed a piece
of rising ground which commanded the road, and under which
the Celts must march, took his cavalry with him and hurried
on to seize the eminence, and so begin the battle in person;
convinced that by these means he would get the principal
credit of the action for himself. At first the Celts not knowing
anything about the presence of Gaius Atilius, but supposing
from what was taking place, that the cavalry of Aemilius had outmarched them in the night, and were seizing the points or vantage
in the van of their route, immediately detached some cavalry and
light armed infantry to dispute the possession of this eminence.
But having shortly afterwards learnt the truth about the presence
of Gaius from a prisoner who was brought in, they hurriedly
got their infantry into position, and drew them up so as to
face two opposite ways, some, that is, to the front and others to
the rear. For they knew that one army was following on their
rear; and they expected from the intelligence which had reached
them, and from what they saw actually occurring, that they
would have to meet another on their front.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c28" type="chapter" n="28">

<p>Aemilius had heard of the landing of the legions at
<pb n="125"/>
<placeName key="perseus,Pisae">Pisae</placeName>, but had not expected them to be already so far on
their road; but the contest at the eminence proved to him
that the two armies were quite close. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle of the horse. Atilius falls.</note>He
accordingly despatched his horse at once to
support the struggle for the possession of the
hill, while he marshalled his foot in their usual order, and
advanced to attack the enemy who barred his way. The
Celts had stationed the Alpine tribe of the Gaesatae to face
their enemies on the rear, and behind them the Insubres; on
their front they had placed the Taurisci, and the Cispadane
tribe of the Boii, facing the legions of Gaius. Their waggons
and chariots they placed on the extremity of either wing, while
the booty they massed upon one of the hills that skirted the
road, under the protection of a guard. The army of the Celts
was thus double-faced, and their mode of marshalling their
forces was effective as well as calculated to inspire terror. The
Insubres and Boii were clothed in their breeches and light
cloaks; but the Gaesatae from vanity and bravado threw these
garments away, and fell in in front of the army naked, with
nothing but their arms; believing that, as the ground was in
parts encumbered with brambles, which might possibly catch
in their clothes and impede the use of their weapons, they
would be more effective in this state. At first the only actual
fighting was that for the possession of the hill: and the numbers
of the cavalry, from all three armies, that had joined in
the struggle made it a conspicious sight to all. In the
midst of it the Consul Gaius fell, fighting with reckless bravery
in the thick of the battle, and his head was brought to the
king of the Celts. The Roman cavalry, however, continued the
struggle with spirit, and finally won the position and overpowered
their opponents. Then the foot also came to close quarters.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c29" type="chapter" n="29">
<head>A Peculiar and Surprising Battle</head>
<p>It was surely a peculiar and surprising battle to witness,
and scarcely less so to hear described. A battle, to begin
with, in which three distinct armies were engaged, must have
presented a strange and unusual appearance, and must have
been fought under strange and unusual conditions. Again, it
must have seemed to a spectator open to question, whether the
position of the Gauls were the most dangerous conceivable, from
being between two attacking forces; or the most favourable, as
<pb n="126"/>
enabling them to meet both armies at once, while their own two
divisions afforded each other a mutual support: and, above all,
as putting retreat out of the question, or any hope of safety except in victory. For this is the peculiar advantage of having an
army facing in two opposite directions. The Romans, on the
other hand, while encouraged by having got their enemy between two of their own armies, were at the same time dismayed
by the ornaments and clamour of the Celtic host. For there
were among them such innumerable horns and trumpets, which
were being blown simultaneously in all parts of their army, and
their cries were so loud and piercing, that the noise seemed not
to come merely from trumpets and human voices, but from
the whole country-side at once. Not less terrifying was the
appearance and rapid movement of the naked warriors in the
van, which indicated men in the prime of their strength and
beauty: while all the warriors in the front ranks were richly
adorned with gold necklaces and bracelets. These sights
certainly dismayed the Romans; still the hope they gave of a
profitable victory redoubled their eagerness for the battle.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>Great Slaughter of the Gauls</head>
<p>When the men who were armed with the <foreign lang="la">pilum</foreign> advanced in front of the legions, in accordance
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The infantry engage.</note>
with the regular method of Roman warfare,
and hurled their <foreign lang="la">pila</foreign> in rapid and effective
volleys, the inner ranks of the Celts found their jerkins
and leather breeches of great service; but to the naked
men in the front ranks this unexpected mode of attack caused
great distress and discomfiture. For the Gallic shields not
being big enough to cover the man, the larger the naked body
the more certainty was there of the <foreign lang="la">pilum</foreign> hitting. And at last,
not being able to retaliate, because the pilum-throwers were
out of reach, and their weapons kept pouring in, some of them,
in the extremity of their distress and helplessness, threw themselves with desperate courage and reckless violence upon the
enemy, and thus met a voluntary death; while others gave
ground step by step towards their own friends, whom they
threw into confusion by this manifest acknowledgment of their
panic. Thus the courage of the Gaesatae had broken down
before the preliminary attack of the <foreign lang="la">pilum.</foreign> But when the
throwers of it had rejoined their ranks, and the whole Roman
<pb n="127"/>
line charged, the Insubres, Boii, and Taurisci received the
attack, and maintained a desperate hand-to-hand fight. Though
almost cut to pieces, they held their ground with unabated
courage, in spite of the fact that man for man, as well as collectively, they were inferior to the Romans in point of arms.
The shields and swords of the latter were proved to be manifestly
superior for defence and attack, for the Gallic sword can only
deliver a cut, but cannot trust. And when, besides the Roman
horse charged down from the high ground on their flank, and
attacked them vigorously, the infantry of the Celts were cut
to pieces on the field, while their horse turned and fled.</p></div2>

a few of his people in escaping to a place of security; and
there put an end to his own life and that of his friends.
Lucius Aemilius, the surviving Consul, collected the spoils of

inspired the Romans with a hope that they might be able to

accordingly the Consuls of the next year, Quintus
Fulvius Flaccus and Titus Manlius Torquatus,
were both sent out with their legions, and military preparations on a large scale, against them. By a rapid attack they
terrified the Boii into making submission to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; but the

seems impossible that the Roman march should have extended so far.</note> Having secured the friendship of this tribe, they crossed into the country
of the Insubres, near the confluence of the <placeName key="tgn,7000486">Adua</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>.
They suffered some annoyance from the enemy, as they were
crossing the river, and as they were pitching their camp; and
after remaining for a short time, they made terms with the
Insubres and left their country. After a circuitous march of
several days, they crossed the River Clusius, and came into the
territory of the <placeName key="tgn,7005868">Cenomani</placeName>. As these people were allies of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, they reinforced the army with some of their men,
which then descended once more from the Alpine regions
into the plains belonging to the Insubres, and began laying
waste their land and plundering their houses. The Insubrian
chiefs, seeing that nothing could change the determination of
the Romans to destroy them, determined that they had
better try their fortune by a great and decisive battle.
They therefore mustered all their forces, took down from the
temple of Minerva the golden standards, which are called "the
immovables," and having made other necessary preparations,
in high spirits and formidable array, encamped opposite to
their enemies to the number of fifty thousand. Seeing themselves thus outnumbered, the Romans at first determined to
avail themselves of the forces of the allied Celtic tribes; but
when they reflected on the fickle character of the Gauls, and
that they were about to fight with an enemy of the same race
as these auxiliary troops, they hesitated to associate such men
with themselves, at a crisis of such danger, and in an action of
such importance. However, they finally decided to do this.
They themselves stayed on the side of the river next the
enemy: and sending the Celtic contingent to the other side,
they pulled up the bridges; which at once precluded any
fear of danger from them, and left themselves no hope of safety
<pb n="129"/>
except in victory; the impassable river being thus in their rear.
These dispositions made, they were ready to engage.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>Tactics Against the Gauls</head>
<p>The Romans are thought to have shown uncommon
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Battle with the Insubres.</note>
skill in this battle; the Tribunes instructing
the troops how they were to conduct themselves both collectively and individually. They
had learned from former engagements that Gallic tribes
were always most formidable at the first onslaught, before their
courage was at all damped by a check; and that the swords
with which they were furnished, as I have mentioned before, could only give one downward cut with any effect,
but that after this the edges got so turned and the blade
so bent, that unless they had time to straighten them with
their foot against the ground, they could not deliver a second
blow. The Tribunes accordingly gave out the spears of the
Triarii, who are the last of the three ranks, to the first ranks,
or Hastati: and ordering the men to use their swords only,
after their spears were done with, they charged the Celts
full in front. When the Celts had rendered their swords useless
by the first blows delivered on the spears, the Romans close
with them, and rendered them quite helpless, by preventing them
from raising their hands to strike with their swords, which is
their peculiar and only stroke, because their blade has no point.
The Romans, on the contrary, having excellent points to their
swords, used them not to cut but to thrust: and by thus
repeatedly hitting the breasts and faces of the enemy, they
eventually killed the greater number of them. And this was due
to the foresight of the Tribunes: for the Consul Flaminius is
thought to have made a strategic mistake in his arrangements
for this battle. By drawing up his men along the very brink
of the river, he rendered impossible a man&oelig;uvre characteristic
of Roman tactics, because he left the lines no room for their
deliberate retrograde movements; for if, in the course of the
battle, the men had been forced ever so little from their ground,
they would have been obliged by this blunder of their leader to
throw themselves into the river. However, the valour of the
soldiers secured them a brilliant victory, as I have said, and
they returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with abundance of booty of every kind,
and of trophies stripped from the enemy.

desiring peace and making unlimited offers of
submission, the new Consuls, Marcus Claudius
Marcellus and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus,
were urgent that no peace should be granted them. Thus
frustrated, they determined to try a last chance, and once more
took active measures to hire thirty thousand Gaesatae,&mdash;the
Gallic tribe which lives on the <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>. Having obtained these,
they held themselves in readiness, and waited for the attack of
their enemies. At the beginning of spring the Consuls assumed
command of their forces, and marched them into the territory
of the Insubres; and there encamped under the walls of the
city of Acerrae, which lies between the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>,
and laid siege to it. The Insubres, being unable to render
any assistance, because all the positions of vantage had been
seized by the enemy first, and being yet very anxious to break
up the siege of Acerrae, detached a portion of their forces to
affect a diversion by crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName> and laying siege to
<placeName key="perseus,Clastidium">Clastidium</placeName>. Intelligence of this movement being brought to
the Consuls, Marcus Claudius, taking with him his cavalry and
some light infantry, made a forced march to relieve the besieged inhabitants. When the Celts heard of his approach,
they raised the siege; and, marching out to meet him, offered
him battle. At first they held their ground against a furious
charge of cavalry which the Roman Consul launched at them;
but when they presently found themselves surrounded by the
enemy on their rear and flank, unable to maintain the
fight any longer, they fled before the cavalry; and many of
them were driven into the river, and were swept away by the
stream, though the larger number were cut down by their
enemies. Acerrae also, richly stored with corn, fell into the
hands of the Romans: the Gauls having evacuated it, and
retired to <placeName key="perseus,Mediolanum">Mediolanum</placeName>, which is the most commanding position in the territory of the Insubres. Gnaeus followed them
closely, and suddenly appeared at <placeName key="perseus,Mediolanum">Mediolanum</placeName>. The Gauls at
first did not stir; but upon his starting on his return march to
Acerrae, they sallied out, and having boldly attacked his rear,
killed a good many men, and even drove a part of it into
flight; until Gnaeus recalled some of his vanguard, and urged
<pb n="131"/>
them to stand and engage the enemy. The Roman soldiers
obeyed orders, and offered a vigorous resistance to the attacking party. The Celts, encouraged by their success, held their
ground for a certain time with some gallantry, but before long
turned and fled to the neighbouring mountains. Gnaeus followed
them, wasting the country as he went, and took <placeName key="perseus,Mediolanum">Mediolanum</placeName>
by assault. At this the chiefs of the Insubres, despairing of

desperate determination and boldness of the enemy, for the
obstinacy of the battles fought, and for the number of those

recorded in history, but which, regarded as a specimen of
scientific strategy, is utterly contemptible. The Gauls showed
no power of planning or carrying out a campaign, and in
everything they did were swayed by impulse rather than by
sober calculation. As I have seen these tribes, after a short
struggle, entirely ejected from the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, with
the exception of some few localities lying close to the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, I
thought I ought not to let their original attack upon <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> pass
unrecorded, any more than their subsequent attempts, or their
final ejectment: for it is the function of the historian to record
and transmit to posterity such episodes in the drama of
Fortune; that our posterity may not from ignorance of the past
be unreasonably dismayed at the sudden and unexpected invasions of these barbarians, but may reflect how shortlived and
easily damped the spirit of this race is; and so may stand to
their defence, and try every possible means before yielding an
inch to them. I think, for instance, that those who have
recorded for our information the invasion of

superiority in supplies, arms, or numbers, would scarcely
deter any one from putting the last possible hope to the test,
in a struggle for the integrity and the safety of his city and its
territory, if he had before his eyes the surprising result of those
expeditions; and remembered how many myriads of men, what
daring confidence, and what immense armaments were baffled

history of all known parts of the world at once, because there
was something in the state of our own times which made such
a plan peculiarly feasible,&mdash;of which I shall speak more at
length hereafter,&mdash;it will be proper, before entering on my main
subject, to touch briefly on the state of the most important of
the recognised nations of the world.</p>
<p>Of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> I need not speak before the time at
which my history commences. The previous history of these
countries has been written by a number of historians
already, and is known to all the world; nor in our days has
any change specially remarkable or unprecedented occurred to
them demanding a reference to their past.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The progress of the Achaean league.</note> But in regard to
the Achaean league, and the royal family of
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, it will be in harmony with my
design to go somewhat farther back: for
the latter has become entirely extinct; while the Achaeans,
as I have stated before, have in our time made extraordinary progress in material prosperity and internal unity.
For though many statesmen had tried in past times to induce
the Peloponnesians to join in a league for the common interests
of all, and had always failed, because every one was working
to secure his own power rather than the freedom of the whole;
yet in our day this policy has made such progress, and been
carried out with such completeness, that not only is there in
the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> a community of interests such as exists between allies or friends, but an absolute identity. of laws, weights,
measures, and currency.<note anchored="yes">That is, each city struck its own coin, but on a common standard of
weight and value. See P. Gardner's Introduction to Catalogue of Greek
Coins (<placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>) in the British Museum, p. xxiv.</note> All the States have the same magistrates, senate, and judges. Nor is there any difference
between the entire <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> and a single city, except in
the fact that its inhabitants are not included within the
same wall; in other respects, both as a whole and in their
<pb n="134"/>
individual cities, there is a nearly absolute assimilation of
institutions.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c38" type="chapter" n="38">
<head>Origin of the Name "Achaean"</head>
<p>It will be useful to ascertain, to begin with, how it
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The origin of the name as embracing all the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>.</note>
came to pass that the name of the Achaeans
became the universal one for all the inhabitants of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. For the original
bearers of this ancestral name have no
superiority over others, either in the size of their territory
and cities, or in wealth, or in the prowess of their men. For
they are a long way off being superior to the Arcadians
and Lacedaemonians in number of inhabitants and extent
of territory; nor can these latter nations be said to yield
the first place in warlike courage to any Greek people
whatever. Whence then comes it that these nations, with
the rest of the inhabitants of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, have been
content to adopt the constitution and the name of the
Achaeans? To speak of chance in such a matter would not
be to offer any adequate solution of the question, and would
be a mere idle evasion. A cause must be sought; for without
a cause nothing, expected or unexpected, can be accomplished. The cause then, in my opinion, was this. Nowhere
could be found a more unalloyed and deliberately established
system of equality and absolute freedom, and, in a word, of
democracy, than among the Achaeans. This constitution
found many of the Peloponnesians ready enough to adopt
it of their own accord: many were brought to share in it by
persuasion and argument: some, though acting under compulsion at first, were quickly brought to acquiesce in its benefits;
for none of the original members had any special privilege
reserved for them, but equal rights were given to all comers:
the object aimed at was therefore quickly attained by the two
most unfailing expedients of equality and fraternity. This
then must be looked upon as the source and original cause
of Peloponnesian unity and consequent prosperity.</p>
<p>That this was the original principle on which the Achaeans
acted in forming their constitution might be demonstrated by
many proofs; but for the present purpose it will be sufficient
to allege one or two in confirmation of my assertion.</p></div2>

<head>The First Achaean League</head>
<p>And first: When the burning of the Pythagorean

intervention of the Achaeans above all others, and showed
the greatest confidence in them, in regard to the measures to
be adopted for removing the evils that oppressed them. Nor
was this the only occasion on which they displayed this preference. For shortly afterwards there was a general movement
among them to adopt the model of the Achaean constitution.
The first states to move in the matter were <placeName key="perseus,Croton">Croton</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Sybaris">Sybaris</placeName>,
and Caulonia, who began by erecting a common temple to Zeus
Homorios,<note anchored="yes">The MS. vary between <foreign lang="greek">o(ma/rios</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(mo/rios.</foreign> The latter form seems to

to conduct their constitution according to their

when the Lacedaemonians met with their unexpected reverse

throughout the country, and especially among the

this could not have been from any special view of their power,
for at that time they were perhaps the weakest state in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>;
it was rather from a conviction of their good faith and high
principles, in regard to which there was but one opinion
universally entertained. At that period of their history, however, they possessed only the elements of success; success
itself, and material increase, were barred by the fact that they
had not yet been able to produce a leader worthy of the
occasion. Whenever any man had given indications of such
ability, he was systematically thrust into the background and
hampered, at one time by the Lacedaemonian government, and
at another, still more effectually, by that of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</p></div2>

here, as well as in a future portion of my work, the political
measures of Aratus, because he has left a record of them himself in an admirably honest and lucid book of commentaries.</p>
<p>I think the easiest method for myself, and most intelligible
to my readers, will be to start from the period of the restoration of the Achaean league and federation, after its disintegration into separate states by the Macedonian kings: from which
time it has enjoyed an unbroken progress towards the state of
completion which now exists, and of which I have already
spoken at some length.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c41" type="chapter" n="41">
<head>The Second League</head>
<p>The period I mean is the 124th Olympiad. In this
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">124th Olympiad, B. C. <dateRange from="-284" to="-280">284</dateRange>-280.</note>
occurred the first league of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName>,
and the deaths of Ptolemy son of Lagus,

<pb n="137"/>
the period before this the state of <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> was as follows. It
was ruled by kings from the time of Tisamenus, son of Orestes,
who, being expelled from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> on the return of the Heraclidae,
formed a kingdom in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>. The last of this royal line to
maintain his power was Ogyges, whose sons so alienated the
people by their unconstitutional and tyrannical government,
that a revolution took place and a democracy was established.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">First Achaean league.</note>
In the period subsequent to this, up to the
time of the establishment of the supreme
authority of Alexander and Philip, their fortunes were subject to various fluctuations, but they always
endeavoured to maintain intact in their league a democratical
form of government, as I have already stated. This league
consisted of twelve cities, all of them still surviving, with the
exception of <placeName key="perseus,Olenus">Olenus</placeName>, and Helice which was engulfed by the
sea before the battle of Leuctra. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-371">371</date>.</note> The other
ten were <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName>, Pharae, Tritaea, Leontium, Aegium, Aegeira, <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Bura">Bura</placeName>, Caryneia.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-323" to="-284">323</dateRange>-<dateRange from="-284" to="-280">284</dateRange>.</note> In the
period immediately succeeding Alexander, and
before the above-named 124th Olympiad, these
cities, chiefly through the instrumentality of the Macedonian
kings, became so estranged and ill-disposed to each other,
and so divided and opposed in their interests, that some of
them had to submit to the presence of foreign garrisons, sent
first by Demetrius and Cassander, and afterwards by Antigonus
Gonatas, while others even fell under the power of Tyrants;
for no one set up more of such absolute rulers in the Greek
states than this last-named king.</p>
<p>But about the 124th Olympiad, as I have said, a change<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. 284-280, Second Achaean league.</note>
of sentiment prevailed among the Achaean
cities, and they began again to form a league.
This was just at the time of Pyrrhus's invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. The first to take this step were the peoples
of <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, Tritaea, and Pharae. And as they thus
formed the nucleus of the league, we find no column extant recording the compact between these cities. But about
five years afterwards the people of Aegium expelled their
foreign garrison and joined the league; next, the people
of <placeName key="perseus,Bura">Bura</placeName> put their tyrant to death and did the same; simultaneously,
<pb n="138"/>  the state of Caryneia was restored to the league.
For Iseas, the then tyrant of Caryneia, when he saw the expulsion of the garrison from Aegium, and the death of the
despot in <placeName key="perseus,Bura">Bura</placeName> at the hands of Margos and the Achaeans,
and when he saw that he was himself on the point of being attacked on all sides, voluntarily laid down his office; and having
obtained a guarantee for his personal safety from the Achaeans,
formally gave in the adhesion of his city to the league.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c42" type="chapter" n="42">
<head>Policy of the Achaean League</head>
<p>My object in thus going back in point of time was,
first, to show clearly at what epoch the Achaeans entered into
the second league, which exists at this day, and which were the
first members of the original league to do so; and, secondly,
that the continuity of the policy pursued by the Achaeans
might rest, not on my word only, but on the evidence of the
actual facts. It was in virtue of this policy,&mdash;by holding
out the bait of equality and freedom, and by invariably
making war upon and crushing those who on their own account, or with the support of the kings, enslaved any of the
states within their borders, that they finally accomplished the
design which they had deliberately adopted, in some cases by
their own unaided efforts, and in others by the help of their
allies. For in fact whatever was effected in this direction, by
the help of these allies in after times, must be put down to
the credit of the deliberately adopted policy of the Achaeans
themselves. They acted indeed jointly with others in many
honourable undertakings, and in none more so than with the
Romans: yet in no instance can they be said to have
aimed at obtaining from their success any advantage for a
particular state. In return for the zealous assistance rendered
by them to their allies, they bargained for nothing but the
freedom of each state and the union of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. But
this will be more clearly seen from the record of their actual
proceedings.</p></div2>

by Antigonus; and by his success freed the inhabitants of the
<placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> from a source of serious alarm: and having thus
liberated <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> he caused it to join the league.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Victory of Lutatius off the insulae Aegates, B. C. <date value="-241">241</date>.</note> In his

tribute to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>
<p>Having made this remarkable progress in his design in so
short a time, Aratus continued thenceforth in the position of

of his whole policy to one single end; which was to expel
Macedonians from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, to depose the despots,

as to the encroaching spirit of the Aetolians, and
in both cases with signal skill and success; although their

pitch, that they had actually made a formal compact with each

<p>After the death of Antigonus, however, the Achaeans
made terms with the Aetolians, and joined them energetically

estrangement and hostility, there gradually grew up a sentiment
of brotherhood and affection between the two peoples. Upon

the death of Demetrius, after a reign of only ten years,
just about the time of the first invasion of

rewards and honours for those of them who consented, and
threatening those who refused with still greater vengeance
from the Achaeans. There was therefore a general movement
among them to voluntarily restore their several states to freedom and to join the league. I ought however to say that
Ludiades of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, in the lifetime of Demetrius, of

their natural inclination to unjust and selfish

breaking up the union of Achaean states, as they had before succeeded in partitioning those of <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName> with Alexander,<note anchored="yes">Alexander II. of <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, son of Pyrrhus, whom he succeeded B.

Lacedaemonians to join them in their hostility to the league,
they would easily subdue it, by selecting a favourable opportunity for their attack, and securing that it should be assaulted
on all sides at once. And they would in all probability have
succeeded, but that they had left out the most important element in the calculation, namely, that in Aratus they had to
reckon with an opponent to their plans of ability equal to
almost any emergency. Accordingly, when they attempted
this violent and unjust interference in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, so far from
succeeding in any of their devices, they, on the contrary,
strengthened Aratus, the then president of the league, as well as
the league itself. So consummate was the ability with which

They were ashamed indeed to attack the Achaeans
openly, because they could not ignore their
recent obligations to them in the war with
Demetrius: but they were plotting with the

an appeal to arms against those who, after all, had done them no
wrong: yet they now allowed themselves to be treated with such
treachery, and submitted without remonstrance to the loss of
the most important towns, solely with the view of creating in
Cleomenes a formidable antagonist to the Achaeans. These
facts were not lost upon Aratus and the other officers of the
league: and they resolved that, without taking the initiative in
going to war with any one, they would resist the attempts of
the Lacedaemonians. Such was their determination, and for a
time they persisted in it: but immediately afterwards Cleomenes began to build the hostile fort in the territory of

<head>The Cleomenic War</head>
<p>This was the origin of what is called the Cleomenic

on their own resources for facing the Lacedaemonians. They looked upon it as more honourable not to look to others for preservation, but to guard their
own territory and cities themselves; and at the same time the

clearly what would happen, and fearing the
reckless audacity of the Aetolians, Aratus
determined that his first duty was to be well
beforehand in frustrating their plans. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aratus applies to Antigonus Doson.</note> He satisfied himself
that Antigonus was a man of activity and practical ability,
with some pretensions to the character of a man of honour;
he however knew perfectly well that kings look on no man
as a friend or foe from personal considerations, but ever
measure friendships and enmities solely by the standard of
expediency. He, therefore, conceived the idea of addressing
himself to this monarch, and entering into friendly relations
with him, taking occasion to point out to him the certain result of
his present policy. But to act openly in this matter he thought
inexpedient for several reasons. By doing so he would not
only incur the opposition of Cleomenes and the Aetolians, but
would cause consternation among the Achaeans themselves,
because his appeal to their enemies would give the impression
that he had abandoned all the hopes he once had in them.
This was the very last idea he desired should go abroad; and
he therefore determined to conduct this intrigue in secrecy.
<pb n="143"/>
The result of this was that he was often compelled to speak
and act towards the public in a sense contrary to his true
sentiments, that he might conceal his real design by suggesting one of an exactly opposite nature. For which reason
there are some particulars which he did not even commit to
his own commentaries.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c48" type="chapter" n="48">
<head>Aratus Involves <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName></head>
<p>It did not escape the observation of Aratus that the
people of Megalopolis would be more ready than others to seek
the protection of Antigonus, and the hopes of safety offered by
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>; for their neighbourhood to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> exposed them
to attack before the other states; while they were unable to get
the help which they ought to have, because the Achaeans were
themselves hard pressed and in great difficulties. Besides
they had special reasons for entertaining feelings of affection
towards the royal family of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, founded
on the favours received in the time of Philip,

general design under pledge of secrecy to Nicophanes and
Cercidas of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, who were family friends of his own
and of a character suited to the undertaking; and by their means
experienced no difficulty in inducing the people of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>
to send envoys to the league, to advise that an application for
help should be made to Antigonus. Nicophanes and Cercidas
were themselves selected to go on this mission to the league,
and thence, if their view was accepted, to Antigonus. The
league consented to allow the people of Megalopolis to send
the mission; and accordingly Nicophanes lost no time in obtaining an interview with the king. About the interests of his
own country he spoke briefly and summarily, confining himself
to the most necessary statements; the greater part of his
speech was, in accordance with the directions of Aratus,
concerned with the national question.</p></div2>

<head>Message to Antigonus Doson from Aratus</head>
<p>The points suggested by Aratus for the envoy to dwell
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The message to Antigonus Doson.</note>
on were "the scope and object of the understanding between the Aetolians and Cleomenes,
and the necessity of caution on the part primarily
of the Achaeans, but still more even on that of Antigonus himself: first, because the Achaeans plainly could not resist the
attack of both; and, secondly, because if the Aetolians and
<pb n="144"/>
Cleomenes conquered them, any man of sense could easily see
that they would not be satisfied or stop there. For the
encroaching spirit of the Aetolians, far from being content to
be confined by the boundaries of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, would find
even those of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> too narrow for them. Again, the ambition
of Cleomenes was at present directed to the supremacy in the
<placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>: but this obtained, he would promptly aim at that
of all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, in which it would be impossible for him to
succeed without first crushing the government of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.
They were, therefore, to urge him to consider, with a view to
the future, which of the two courses would be the more to his
own interests,&mdash;to fight for supremacy in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in conjunction with the Achaeans and Boeotians against Cleomenes in
the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>; or to abandon the most powerful race, and to
stake the Macedonian empire on a battle in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, against a
combined force of Aetolians and Boeotians, with the Achaeans
and Lacedaemonians to boot. If the Aetolians, from regard
to the goodwill shown them by the Achaeans in the time of
Demetrius, were to pretend to be anxious to keep the peace
as they were at present doing, they were to assert that the
Achaeans were ready to engage Cleomenes by themselves;
and if fortune declared in their favour they would want no
assistance from any one: but if fortune went against them,
and the Aetolians joined in the attack, they begged him to
watch the course of events, that he might not let things go
too far, but might aid the Peloponnesians while they were
still capable of being saved. He had no need to be anxious
about the good faith or gratitude of the Achaeans: when the
time for action came, Aratus pledged himself to find guarantees
which would be satisfactory to both parties; and similarly
would himself indicate the moment at which the aid should
be given."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c50" type="chapter" n="50">
<head>Antigonus Doson Will Help the League</head>
<p>These arguments seemed to Antigonus to have been
put by Aratus with equal sincerity and ability: and after
listening to them, he eagerly took the first necessary step by
writing a letter to the people of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> with an offer of
assistance, on condition that such a measure should receive the
consent of the Achaeans. When Nicophanes and Cercidas
returned home and delivered this despatch from the king,
<pb n="145"/>
reporting at the same time his other expressions of goodwill and
zeal in the cause, the spirits of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> were
greatly elated; and they were all eagerness to attend the
meeting of the league, and urge that measures should be taken
to secure the alliance of Antigonus, and to put the management of the war
in his hands with all despatch. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aratus wishes to do without the king if possible.</note>
Aratus learnt privately from Nicophanes the
king's feelings towards the league and towards
himself; and was delighted that his plan had not failed, and
that he had not found the king completely alienated from
himself, as the Aetolians hoped he would be. He regarded
it also as eminently favourable to his policy, that the people
of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> were so eager to use the Achaean league
as the channel of communication with Antigonus. For his
first object was if possible to do without this assistance; but
if he were compelled to have recourse to it, he wished that
the invitation should not be sent through himself personally,
but that it should rather come from the Achaeans as a nation.
For he feared that, if the king came, and conquered Cleomenes
and the Lacedaemonians in the war, and should then adopt any
policy hostile to the interests of the national constitution, he
would have himself by general consent to bear the blame of
the result: while Antigonus would be justified, by the injury
which had been inflicted on the royal house of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>
in the matter of the Acrocorinthus. Accordingly when
Megalopolitan envoys appeared in the national council,
and showed the royal despatch, and further declared the
general friendly disposition of the king, and added an appeal
to the congress to secure the king's alliance without delay;
and when also the sense of the meeting was clearly shown
to be in favour of taking this course, Aratus rose, and, after
setting forth the king's zeal, and complimenting the meeting
upon their readiness to act in the matter, he proceeded to
urge upon them in a long speech that "They should try if
possible to preserve their cities and territory by their own
efforts, for that nothing could be more honourable or more
expedient than that: but that, if it turned out that fortune
declared against them in this effort, they might then have
recourse to the assistance of their friends; but not until they
<pb n="146"/>
had tried all their own resources to the uttermost." This
speech was received with general applause: and it was decided
to take no fresh departure at present, and to endeavour to
bring the existing war to a conclusion unaided.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c51" type="chapter" n="51">
<head>The Achaeans Must Appeal to Antigonus</head>
<p>But when Ptolemy, despairing of retaining the league's
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Euergetes, jealous of the Macedonian policy of Aratus, helps Cleomenes.</note>
friendship, began to furnish Cleomenes with
supplies,&mdash;which he did with a view of setting
him up as a foil to Antigonus, thinking the
Lacedaemonians offered him better hopes than
the Achaeans of being able to thwart the policy of the Macedonian kings.; and when the Achaeans themselves had suffered
three defeats,&mdash;one at Lycaeum in an engagement with Cleomenes whom they had met on a march; and again in a pitched
battle at Ladocaea in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, in which
Lydiades fell; and a third time decisively at a place called Hecatomboeum in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName> where their whole forces had
been engaged,&mdash;after these misfortunes, no further delay was
possible, and they were compelled by the force of circumstances
to appeal unanimously to Antigonus. Thereupon Aratus sent
his son to Antigonus, and ratified the terms of the subvention.
The great difficulty was this: it was believed to be certain that
the king would send no assistance, except on the condition of
the restoration of the Acrocorinthus, and of having the city
of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> put into his hands as a base of operations in this
war; and on the other hand it seemed impossible that the
Achaeans should venture to put the Corinthians in the king's
power against their own consent. The final determination of
the matter was accordingly postponed, that they might
investigate the question of the securities to be given to the
king.</p></div2>

<p>Meanwhile, on the strength of the dismay caused by
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Achaeans offer to surrender the Acrocorinthus to Antigonus.</note>
his successes, Cleomenes was making an unopposed progress through the cities, winning
some by persuasion and others by threats. In
this way he got possession of Caphyae, <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName>,

a siege of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>. But this in reality relieved the Achaeans
from a very grave difficulty. For the Corinthians by ordering
<pb n="147"/>
Aratus, as Strategus of the league, and the Achaeans to
evacuate the town, and by sending messages to Cleomenes
inviting his presence, gave the Achaeans a ground of action
and a reasonable pretext for moving. Aratus was quick to
take advantage of this; and, as the Achaeans were in actual
possession of the Acrocorinthus, he made his peace with the
royal family of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> by offering it to Antigonus; and
at the same time gave thus a sufficient guarantee for friendship
in the future, and further secured Antigonus a base of
operations for the war with <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</p>
<p>Upon learning of this compact between the league and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cleomenes prepares to resist.</note>
Antigonus, Cleomenes raised the siege of
<placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName> and pitched his camp near the Isthmus;
and, having thrown up a line of fortification
uniting the Acrocorinthus with the mountain called the
"Ass's Back," began from this time to expect with confidence
the empire of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. But Antigonus had made his
preparations long in advance, in accordance with the suggestion
of Aratus, and was only waiting for the right moment to act. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antigonus comes to the Isthmus, B. C. <date value="-224">224</date>.</note>
And now the news which he received convinced him that the entrance of Cleomenes
into <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, at the head of an army, was only
a question of a very few days: he accordingly despatched

this must be regarded as the chief cause of the improvement
which took place in their fortunes; for this reverse checked the
ardour of Cleomenes and damped the courage of his soldiers
in advance, as was clearly shown by what took place afterwards.
For though Cleomenes had already possession of more advantageous posts, and was in the enjoyment of more abundant
supplies than Antigonus, and was at the same time inspired
with superior courage and ambition: yet, as soon as he was informed that <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> was in the hands of the Achaeans, he at once
drew back, abandoned all these advantages, and retreated from
the Isthmus with every appearance of precipitation, in terror of
being completely surrounded by his enemies. At first he retired
upon <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and for a time made some attempt to regain the
town. But the Achaeans offered a gallant resistance; and the
Argives themselves were stirred up to do the same by remorse

attempt also, he marched back to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> by way of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>.</p></div2>

to Aegium to attend the meeting of the Achaean league.
There he made a statement of his own proceedings, and consulted with the meeting as to the measures to be taken in the

army, and went into winter quarters at <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.</p>

on the march. On the third day he arrived at

But the vigour displayed by the Macedonians in conducting
the siege, and especially in the digging of mines, soon reduced
the Tegeans to despair, and they accordingly surrendered.
After taking the proper measures for securing the town,
Antigonus proceeded to extend his expedition. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Skirmish with Cleomenes.</note> He now

secured by the voluntary surrender of their inhabitants, as the winter was by this time approaching, he went again to Aegium to attend the meeting of

at home, while he himself remained to confer with the
Achaeans on the existing state of affairs.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c55" type="chapter" n="55">
<head>Capture of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName></head>
<p>But Cleomenes was on the alert. He saw that the
Macedonians in the army of Antigonus had been sent home;
and that the king and his mercenaries in Aegium were three
days' march from <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>; and this latter town he well
knew to be difficult to guard, owing to its great extent, and the
sparseness of its inhabitants; and, moreover, that it was just
then being kept with even greater carelessness than usual, owing
to Antigonus being in the country; and what was more important than anything else, he knew that the larger number of
its men of military age had fallen at the battles of Lycaeum
<pb n="150"/>
and Ladoceia. There happened to be residing in <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>
some Messenian exiles; by whose help he managed, under
cover of night, to get within the walls without being detected.
When day broke he had a narrow escape from being ejected, if
not from absolute destruction, through the valour of the citizens.
This had been his fortune three months before, when he had
made his way into the city by the region which is called the
C&omacr;laeum: but on this occasion, by the superiority of his
force, and the seizure in advance of the strongest positions in
the town, he succeeded in effecting his purpose. He eventually ejected the inhabitants, and took entire possession of
the city; which, once in his power, he dismantled in so savage
and ruthless a manner as to preclude the least hope that it
might ever be restored. The reason of his acting in this
manner was, I believe, that <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> and Stymphalus
were the only towns in which, during the vicissitudes of
that period, he never succeeded in obtaining a single partisan, or inducing a single citizen to turn traitor. For the
passion for liberty and the loyalty of the Clitorians had been
stained by the baseness of one man, Thearces; whom the
Clitorians, with some reason, denied to be a native of their
city, asserting that he had been foisted in from <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>,
and was the offspring of one of the foreign garrison there.</p></div2>

<head>The Credibility of Phylarchus</head>
<p>For the history of the same period, with which we are
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Digression (to <ref target="b2c63" targOrder="U">ch. 63</ref>) on the misstatements of Phylarchus.</note>

<date value="-272">272</date>) to the death of Cleomenes. He was a fervent admirer of Cleomenes,
and therefore probably wrote in a partisan spirit; yet in the matter of the
outrage upon <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, Polybius himself is not free from the same charge.
See Mueller's <title>Histor. Graec.</title> fr. lxxvii.-lxxxi. Plutarch, though admitting
Phylarchus's tendency to exaggeration (<bibl n="Plut. Arat. 38"><title>Arat.</title> 38</bibl>), yet uses his authority both
in his life of Aratus and of Cleomenes; and in the case of Aristomachus says
that he was both racked and drowned (<bibl n="Plut. Arat. 44"><title>Arat.</title> 44</bibl>).</note> whose opinions are opposed in
many points and their statements contradictory.
I think, therefore, it will be advantageous, or
rather necessary, since I follow Aratus in my account of
the Cleomenic war, to go into the question; and not by
any neglect on my part to suffer mis-statements in historical
<pb n="151"/>
writings to enjoy an authority equal to that of truth. The fact is
that the latter of these two writers has, throughout the whole of his
history, made statements at random and without discrimination.
It is not, however, necessary for me to criticise him on other
points on the present occasion, or to call him to strict account
concerning them; but such of his statements as relate to the
period which I have now in hand, that is the Cleomenic war, these
I must thoroughly sift. They will be quite sufficient to enable
us to form a judgment on the general spirit and ability with
which he approaches historical writing. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>.</note> It was his object to
bring into prominence the cruelty of Antigonus and the Macedonians, as well as that of Aratus and the
Achaeans; and he accordingly asserts that, when
<placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> fell into their hands, it was cruelly treated; and
that the most ancient and important of all the Arcadian
towns was involved in calamities so terrible as to move all
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> to horror and tears. And being eager to stir the
hearts of his readers to pity, and to enlist their sympathies
by his story, he talks of women embracing, tearing their hair,
and exposing their breasts; and again of the tears and
lamentations of men and women, led off into captivity along
with their children and aged parents. And this he does again
and again throughout his whole history, by way of bringing the
terrible scene vividly before his readers. I say nothing of the
unworthiness and unmanliness of the course he has adopted:
let us only inquire what is essential and to the purpose in
history. Surely an historian's object should not be to amaze
his readers by a series of thrilling anecdotes; nor should he
aim at producing speeches which <emph>might</emph> have been delivered,
nor study dramatic propriety in details like a writer of tragedy:
but his function is above all to record with fidelity what was
actually said or done, however commonplace it may be. For
the purposes of history and of the drama are not the same, but
widely opposed to each other. In the former the object is to
strike and delight by words as true to nature as possible; in
the latter to instruct and convince by genuine words and
deeds; in the former the effect is meant to be temporary, in
the latter permanent.<note anchored="yes" resp="fww">lines 34 and 36: "former" and "latter" should be reversed in these two sentences.</note>
 In the former, again, the power of
carrying an audience is the chief excellence. because the object
<pb n="152"/>
is to create illusion; but in the latter the thing of primary
importance is truth, because the object is to benefit the
learner. And apart from these considerations, Phylarchus, in
most of the catastrophes which he relates, omits to suggest the
causes which gave rise to them, or the course of events which
led up to them: and without knowing these, it is impossible to
feel the due indignation or pity at anything which occurs. For
instance, everybody looks upon it as an outrage that the free
should be struck: still, if a man provokes it by an act of violence,
he is considered to have got no more than he deserved; and,
where it is done for correction and discipline, those who strike
free men are deemed worthy of honour and gratitude. Again,
the killing of a fellow-citizen is regarded as a heinous crime,
deserving the severest penalties: and yet it is notorious that the
man who kills a thief, or his wife's paramour, is held guiltless;
while he who kills a traitor or tyrant in every country receives
honours and pre-eminence. And so in everything our final judgment does not depend upon the mere things done, but upon their
causes and the views of the actors, according as these differ.</p></div2>

abandoned the league, and voluntarily submitted, first to

Being therefore, in accordance with this
policy, members of the Lacedaemonian community, in the
fourth year before the coming of Antigonus, their city was
forcibly taken possession of by the Achaeans owing to the
skilful plotting of Aratus. But on that occasion, so far from
being subjected to any severity for their act of treason, it
became a matter of general remark how promptly the feelings of the conquerors and the conquered underwent a
revolution. As soon as he had got possession of the town,
Aratus issued orders to his own men that no one was to lay a
finger on anything that did not belong to him; and then,
having summoned the Mantineans to a meeting, he bade them
be of good cheer, and stay in their own houses; for that, as
long as they remained members of the league, their safety was
secured. On their part, the Mantineans, surprised at this
unlooked - for prospect of safety, immediately experienced a
universal revulsion of feeling. The very men against whom
<pb n="153"/>
they had a little while before been engaged in a war, in which
they had seen many of their kinsfolk killed, and no small
number grievously wounded, they now received into their
houses, and entertained as their guests, interchanging every
imaginable kindness with them. And naturally so. For I
believe that there never were men who met with more kindly
foes, or came out of a struggle with what seemed the most dreadful disasters more scatheless, than did the Mantineans, owing
to the humanity of Aratus and the Achaeans towards them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c58" type="chapter" n="58">
<head>The Mantineans Turn Over their City to the Lacedaemonians</head>
<p>But they still saw certain dangers ahead from intestine
disorders, and the hostile designs of the Aetolians and
Lacedaemonians; they subsequently, therefore, sent envoys
to the league asking for a guard for their town. The request
was granted: and three hundred of the league army were
selected by lot to form it. These men on whom the lot fell
started for <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>; and, abandoning their native cities and
their callings in life, remained there to protect the lives and
liberties of the citizens. Besides them, the league despatched
two hundred mercenaries, who joined the Achaean guard in
protecting the established constitution. But this state of
things did not last long: an insurrection broke out in the town,
and the Mantineans called in the aid of the Lacedaemonians;
delivered the city into their hands; and put to death the
garrison sent by the league. It would not be easy to
mention a grosser or blacker act of treachery. Even if they
resolved to utterly set at nought the gratitude they owed to,
and the friendship they had formed with, the league; they
ought at least to have spared these men, and to have let every
one of them depart under some terms or another: for this
much it is the custom by the law of nations to grant even to
foreign enemies. But in order to satisfy Cleomenes and the
Lacedaemonians of their fidelity in the policy of the hour, they
deliberately, and in violation of international law, consummated
a crime of the most impious description. To slaughter and
wreak vengeance on the men who had just before taken
their city, and refrained from doing them the least
harm, and who were at that very moment engaged in protecting
their lives and liberties,&mdash;can anything be imagined more
detestable? What punishment can be conceived to correspond
<pb n="154"/>
with its enormity? If one suggests that they would be rightly
served by being sold into slavery, with their wives and children,
as soon as they were beaten in war; it may be answered that
this much is only what, by the laws of warfare, awaits even
those who have been guilty of no special act of impiety. They
deserved therefore to meet with a punishment even more
complete and heavy than they did; so that, even if what
Phylarchus mentions did happen to them, there was no reason
for the pity of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> being bestowed on them: praise and
approval rather were due to those who exacted vengeance for
their impious crime. But since, as a matter of fact, nothing
worse befell the Mantineans than the plunder of their property
and the selling of their free citizens into slavery, this historian,
for the mere sake of a sensational story, has not only told a pure
lie, but an improbable lie. His wilful ignorance also was so supreme, that he was unable to compare with this alleged cruelty
of the Achaeans the conduct of the same people in the case of
<placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>, which they took by force at the same period, and yet did
no injury to its inhabitants. And yet, if the natural cruelty of
the perpetrators was the sole cause of the severity to <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>,
it is to be presumed that <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> would have been treated in the
same way. But if their treatment of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> was an exception
to that of every other town, the necessary inference is that the
cause for their anger was exceptional also.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c59" type="chapter" n="59">
<head>Execution of Aristomachus</head>
<p>Again Phylarchus says that Aristomachus the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aristomachus.</note>
a man of a most distinguished family, who
had been despot of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, as his fathers had
been before him, upon falling into the hands of Antigonus
and the league "was hurried off to Cenchreae and there
racked to death,&mdash;an unparalleled instance of injustice and
cruelty." But in this matter also our author preserves his
peculiar method. He makes up a story about certain
cries of this man, when he was on the rack, being heard
through the night by the neighbours: "some of whom," he
says, "rushed to the house in their horror, or incredulity,
or indignation at the outrage." As for the sensational story,
let it pass; I have said enough on that point. But I must
express my opinion that, even if Aristomachus had committed
no crime against the Achaeans besides, yet his whole life and
<pb n="155"/>
his treason to his own country deserved the heaviest possible
punishment. And in order, forsooth, to enhance this man's
reputation, and move his reader's sympathies for his sufferings,
our historian remarks that he had not only been a tyrant
himself, but that his fathers had been so before him. It would
not be easy to bring a graver or more bitter charge against a
man than this: for the mere word "tyrant" involves the idea
of everything that is wickedest, and includes every injustice
and crime possible to mankind. And if Aristomachus endured
the most terrible tortures, as Phylarchus says, he yet would
not have been sufficiently punished for the crime of one day,
in which, when Aratus had effected an entrance into <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>
with the Achaean soldiers,&mdash;and after supporting the most
severe struggles and dangers for the freedom of its citizens, had
eventually been driven out, because the party within who were
in league with him had not ventured to stir, for fear of the
tyrant,&mdash;Aristomachus availed himself of the pretext of their
complicity with the irruption of the Achaeans to put to the rack
and execute eighty of the leading citizens, who were perfectly
innocent, in the presence of their relations. I pass by the
history of his whole life and the crimes of his ancestors; for
that would be too long a story.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c60" type="chapter" n="60">
<head>Crimes of Aristomachus</head>
<p>But this shows that we ought not to be indignant if
a man reaps as he has sown; but rather if he is allowed to
end his days in peace, without experiencing such retribution
at all. Nor ought we to accuse Antigonus or Aratus of crime,
for having racked and put to death a tyrant whom they had
captured in war: to have killed and wreaked vengeance on
whom, even in time of peace, would have brought praise and
honour to the doers from all right-minded persons.</p>
<p>But when, in addition to these crimes, he was guilty also of
treachery to the league, what shall we say that he deserved?
The facts of the case are these. He abdicated his sovereignty
of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> shortly before, finding himself in difficulties, owing to
the state of affairs brought on by the death of Demetrius. He
was, however, protected by the clemency and generosity of the
league; and, much to his own surprise, was left unmolested.
For the Achaean government not only secured him an
indemnity for all crimes committed by him while despot, but
<pb n="156"/>
admitted him as a member of the league, and invested him
with the highest office in it,&mdash;that, namely, of Commander-in-Chief and
Strategus.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">h(gemo/na kai\ strathgo\n.</foreign> It is not quite clear whether this is merely a
description of the ordinary office of Strategus, or whether any special office is
meant, such as that conferred on Antigonus. In <ref target="b4c11" targOrder="U">4, 11</ref> <foreign lang="greek">h(gemo/nes</foreign> includes the
Strategus and other officers. See Freeman, <title>Federal Government,</title> p. 299.</note> All these favours he immediately forgot,
as soon as his hopes were a little raised by the Cleomenic war;
and at a crisis of the utmost importance he withdrew his
native city, as well as his own personal adhesion, from the
league, and attached them to its enemies. For such an act
of treason what he deserved was not to be racked under cover
of night at Cenchreae, and then put to death, as Phylarchus
says: he ought to have been taken from city to city in the
<placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, and to have ended his life only after exemplary
torture in each of them. And yet the only severity that this
guilty wretch had to endure was to be drowned in the sea by
order of the officers at Cenchreae.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c61" type="chapter" n="61">
<head>The Loyalty of the Megalopolitans</head>
<p>There is another illustration of this writer's manner
<note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName></note>
to be found in his treatment of the cases of
<placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>. The misfortunes
of the former he has depicted with his usual exaggeration and
picturesqueness: apparently from the notion, that it is the
peculiar function of an historian to select for special mention only such actions as are conspicuously bad. But about
the noble conduct of the Megalopolitans at that same period
he has not said a word: as though it were the province of history to deal with crimes rather than with instances of just and
noble conduct; or as though his readers would be less improved
by the record of what is great and worthy of imitation, than by
that of such deeds as are base and fit only to be avoided. For
instance, he has told us clearly enough how Cleomenes took
the town, preserved it from damage, and forthwith sent couriers
to the Megalopolitans in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> with a despatch, offering
them the safe enjoyment of their country if they would throw
in their lot with him;&mdash;and his object in telling all this is
to enhance the magnanimity and moderation of Cleomenes
towards his enemies. Nay, he has gone farther, and told us
how the people of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> would not allow the letter to
<pb n="157"/>
be read to the end, and were not far from stoning the bearers
of it. Thus much he does tell us. But the sequel to this, so
appropriate to an historian,&mdash;the commendation, I mean, and
honourable mention of their noble conduct,&mdash;this he has altogether left out. And yet he had an opportunity ready to his
hand. For if we view with approval the conduct of a people
who merely by their declarations and votes support a war in
behalf of friends and allies; while to those who go so far as to
endure the devastation of their territory, and a siege of their
town, we give not only praise but active gratitude: what
must be our estimate of the people of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>?
Must it not be of the most exalted character? First of all,
they allowed their territory to be at the mercy of Cleomenes,
and then consented to be entirely deprived of their city, rather
than be false to the league: and, finally, in spite of an unexpected chance of recovering it, they deliberately preferred the
loss of their territory, the tombs of their ancestors, their temples,
their homes and property, of everything in fact which men
value most, to forfeiting their faith to their allies. No nobler
action has ever been, or ever will be performed; none to which
an historian could better draw his reader's attention. For
what could be a higher incentive to good faith, or the maintenance of frank and permanent relations between states?
But of all this Phylarchus says not a word, being, as it
seems to me, entirely blind as to all that is noblest and best
suited to be the theme of an historian.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c62" type="chapter" n="62">
<head>The Wealth of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName></head>
<p>He does, however, state in the course of his narrative
that, from the spoils of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, six thousand talents fell to the Lacedaemonians, of
which two thousand, according to custom, were given to
Cleomenes. This shows, to begin with, an astounding ignorance of the ordinary facts as to the resources of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>:
a knowledge which above all others should be possessed
by historians. I am not of course now speaking of the
period in which the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> had been ruined by the
Macedonian kings, and still more completely by a long continuance of intestine struggles; but of our own times, in
which it is believed, by the establishment of its unity, to be
enjoying the highest prosperity of which it is capable. Still
<pb n="158"/>
even at this period, if you could collect all the movable property of the whole <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> (leaving out the value of slaves),
it would be impossible to get so large a sum of money together.
That I speak on good grounds and not at random will appear
from the following fact. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-378">378</date>.</note> Every one has read that when the
Athenians, in conjunction with the Thebans,
entered upon the war with the Lacedaemonians,
and despatched an army of twenty thousand men, and manned
a hundred triremes, they resolved to supply the expenses of
the war by the assessment of a property tax; and accordingly had a valuation taken, not only of the whole land of
<placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> and the houses in it, but of all other property: but yet
the value returned fell short of six thousand talents by two
hundred and fifty; which will show that what I have just said
about the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> is not far wide of the mark. But at
this period the most exaggerated estimate could scarcely give
more than three hundred talents, as coming from <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>
itself; for it is acknowledged that most of the inhabitants, free
and slaves, escaped to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>. But the strongest confirmation
of my words is the case of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, which, as he himself
observes, was second to no Arcadian city in wealth and numbers. Though it was surrendered after a siege, so that no one
could escape, and no property could without great difficulty be
concealed; yet the value of the whole spoil of the town, including the price of the captives sold, amounted at this same
period to only three hundred talents.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c63" type="chapter" n="63">
<head>Cleomenes Invades Argolis</head>
<p>But a more astonishing mis-statement remains to be remarked. In the course of his history of this
war, Phylarchus asserts "that about ten days
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ptolemy Euergetes and Cleomenes.</note>
before the battle an ambassador came from
Ptolemy announcing to Cleomenes, that the king declined to
continue to support him with supplies, and advised him to make
terms with Antigonus. And that when this message had been
delivered to Cleomenes, he made up his mind that he had
better put his fortune to the supreme test as soon as possible, before his forces learnt about this message, because he
could not hope to provide the soldiers' pay from his own resources." But if he had at that very time become the master
of six thousand talents, he would have been better supplied
<pb n="159"/>
than Ptolemy himself. And as for war with Antigonus, if he
had become master of only three hundred talents, he would
have been able to continue it without any difficulty. But the
writer states two inconsistent propositions&mdash;that Cleomenes
depended wholly on Ptolemy for money: and that he at the
same time had become master of that enormous sum. Is this
not irrational, and grossly careless besides? I might mention
many instances of a similar kind, not only in his account of
this period, but throughout his whole work; but I think for
my present purpose enough has been said.</p></div2>

Cleomenes collected his army, addressed a
suitable exhortation to them, and led them into
the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> territory. Most people thought this a hazardous
and foolhardy step, because the places at which the frontier
was crossed were strongly fortified; but those who were
capable of judging regarded the measure as at once safe and
prudent. For seeing that Antigonus had dismissed his forces,
he reckoned on two things,&mdash;there would be no one to resist
him, and therefore he would run no risk; and when the
Argives found that their territory was being laid waste up to
their walls, they would be certain to be roused to anger and to
lay the blame upon Antigonus: therefore, if on the one hand
Antigonus, unable to bear the complaints of the populace, were
to sally forth and give him battle with his present forces, Cleomenes felt sure of an easy victory; but if on the other hand
Antigonus refused to alter his plans, and kept persistently aloof,
he believed that he would be able to effect a safe retreat
home, after succeeding by this expedition in terrifying his
enemies and inspiring his own forces with courage. And this
was the actual result. For as the devastation of the country
went on, crowds began to collect and abuse Antigonus: but
like a wise general and king, he refused to allow any consideration
to outweigh that of sound strategy, and persisted in remaining inactive. Accordingly Cleomenes, in pursuance of his
plan, having terrified his enemies and inspired courage in his
own army for the coming struggle, returned home unmolested.</p></div2>

of ten thousand Macedonians for the phalanx,

thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry; and a thousand
Megalopolitans armed in the Macedonian manner, under the
command of Cercidas of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>. Of the allies there were

the command of Demetrius of Pharos. The whole amounted
to twenty-eight thousand infantry and twelve hundred cavalry.</p>
<p>Cleomenes had expected the attack, and had secured the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The position of Cleomenes at <placeName key="perseus,Sellasia">Sellasia</placeName>.</note>
passes into the country by posting garrisons,
digging trenches, and felling trees; while he
took up position at a place called <placeName key="perseus,Sellasia">Sellasia</placeName>, with
an army amounting to twenty thousand, having calculated that
the invading forces would take that direction: which turned out
to be the case. This pass lies between two hills, called
respectively Evas and <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and the road to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> follows
the course of the river Oenus. Cleomenes strengthened both
these hills by lines of fortification, consisting of trench and
palisade. On Evas he posted the perioeci and allies, under
the command of his brother Eucleides; while he himself held
<placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> with the Lacedaemonians and mercenaries. On
the level ground along the river he stationed his cavalry, with
a division of his mercenaries, on both sides of the road.
When Antigonus arrived, he saw at once the strength of the
position, and the skill with which Cleomenes had selected the
different branches of his army to occupy the points of vantage,
so that the whole aspect of the position was like that of
skilled soldiers drawn up ready for a charge. For no preparation for attack or defence had been omitted; but everything
was in order, either for offering battle with effect, or for
holding an almost unassailable position.
<pb n="161"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c66" type="chapter" n="66">
<head>The Two Armies Line Up</head>
<p>The sight of these preparations decided Antigonus not
to make an immediate attack upon the position, or rashly hazard
an engagement. He pitched his camp a short distance from it,
covering his front by the stream called Gorgylus, and there remained for some days; informing himself by reconnaisances of
the peculiarities of the ground and the character of the troops,
and at the same time endeavouring by feigned movements to
elicit the intentions of the enemy. But he could never find an
unguarded point, or one where the troops were not entirely on
the alert, for Cleomenes was always ready at a moment's notice
to be at any point that was attacked. He therefore gave up
all thoughts of attacking the position; and finally an understanding was come to between him and Cleomenes to bring
the matter to the decision of battle. And, indeed, Fortune
had there brought into competition two commanders equally
endowed by nature with military skill. To face the division
of the enemy on Evas Antigonus stationed his Macedonian
hoplites with brazen shields, and the Illyrians, drawn up in
alternate lines, under the command of Alexander, son of
Acmetus, and Demetrius of Pharos, respectively. Behind
them he placed the Acarnanians and Cretans, and behind
them again were two thousand Achaeans to act as a reserve.
His cavalry, on the banks of the river Oenous, were posted
opposite the enemy's cavalry, under the command of Alexander, and flanked by a thousand Achaean infantry and the
same number of Megalopolitans. Antigonus himself determined to lead his mercenaries and Macedonian troops in
person against the division on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> commanded by Cleomenes. Owing to the narrowness of the ground,
the Macedonians were arranged in a double phalanx, one close behind the
other, while the mercenaries were placed in front of them. It
was arranged that the Illyrians, who had bivouacked in full
order during the previous night along the river Gorgylus, close
to the foot of Evas, were to begin their assault on the hill when
they saw a flag of linen raised from the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>;
and that the Megalopolitans and cavalry should do the same
when the king raised a scarlet flag.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c67" type="chapter" n="67">
<head>Battle Begins</head>
<p>The moment for beginning the battle had come: the
signal was given to the Illyrians, and the word passed by the
<pb n="162"/>
officers to their men to do their duty, and in a moment they
started into view of the enemy and began assaulting the hill. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Battle of <placeName key="perseus,Sellasia">Sellasia</placeName>.</note> But the light-armed troops who were
stationed with Cleomenes's cavalry, observing
that the Achaean lines were not covered by any other troops
behind them, charged them on the rear; and thus reduced the
division while endeavouring to carry the hill of Evas to a state of
great peril,&mdash;being met as they were on their front by Eucleidas
from the top of the hill, and being charged
and vigorously attacked by the light-armed
mercenaries on their rear. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philopoemen's presence of mind.</note> It was at this point
that Philopoemen of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, with a clear understanding
of the situation and a foresight of what would happen,
vainly endeavoured to point out the certain result to his
superior officers. They disregarded him for his want of
experience in command and his extreme youth; and, accordingly he acted for himself, and cheering on the men of his
own city, made a vigorous charge on the enemy. This effected
a diversion; for the light-armed mercenaries, who were engaged
in harassing the rear of the party ascending Evas, hearing the
shouting and seeing the cavalry engaged, abandoned their
attack upon this party and hurried back to their original position to render assistance to the cavalry. The result was that
the division of Illyrians, Macedonians, and the rest who were
advancing with them, no longer had their attention diverted by
an attack upon their rear, and so continued their advance
upon the enemy with high spirits and renewed confidence. And
this afterwards caused it to be acknowledged that to Philopoemen was due the honour of the success against Eucleidas.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c68" type="chapter" n="68">
<head>Skill and Gallantry of Philopoemen</head>
<p>It is clear that Antigonus at any rate entertained that
opinion, for after the battle he asked Alexander, the commander of the cavalry, with the view of convicting him of his
shortcoming, "Why he had engaged before the signal was
given?" And upon Alexander answering that "He had not
done so, but that a young officer from <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> had presumed
to anticipate the signal, contrary to his wish:" Antigonus
replied, "That young man acted like a good general in grasping the situation; you, general, were the youngster."</p>
<p>What Eucleidas ought to have done, when he saw the enemy's
<pb n="163"/>
lines advancing, was to have rushed down at once upon them;
thrown their ranks into disorder; and then retired himself, step
by step, to continually higher ground into a safe position: for
by thus breaking them up and depriving them, to begin with,
of the advantages of their peculiar armour and disposition, he
would have secured the victory by the superiority of his position.
But he did the very opposite of all this, and thereby forfeited
the advantages of the ground. As though victory were
assured, he kept his original position on the summit of the
hill, with the view of catching the enemy at as great an elevation as possible, that their flight might be all the longer over
steep and precipitous ground. The result, as might have been
anticipated, was exactly the reverse. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Defeat of Eucleidas.</note> For he left himself no
place of retreat, and by allowing the enemy to
reach his position, unharmed and in unbroken
order, he was placed at the disadvantage of having
to give them battle on the very summit of the hill; and so,
as soon as he was forced by the weight of their heavy armour
and their close order to give any ground, it was immediately
occupied by the Illyrians; while his own men were obliged to
take lower ground, because they had no space for man&oelig;uvring
on the top. The result was not long in arriving: they suffered a
repulse, which the difficult and precipitous nature of the ground
over which they had to retire turned into a disastrous flight.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b2c69" type="chapter" n="69">
<head>Defeat of Cleomenes</head>
<p>Simultaneously with these events the cavalry engagement was also being brought to a decision; in which all the
Achaean cavalry, and especially Philopoemen, fought with
conspicuous gallantry, for to them it was a contest for freedom.
Philopoemen himself had his horse killed under him, and while
fighting accordingly on foot received a severe wound through
both his thighs. Meanwhile the two kings
on the other hill <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> began by bringing
their light-armed troops and mercenaries into
action, of which each of them had five thousand. Both the
kings and their entire armies had a full view of this action,
which was fought with great gallantry on both sides: the
charges taking place sometimes in detachments, and at other
times along the whole line, and an eager emulation being
displayed between the several ranks, and even between individuals.
<pb n="164"/>  But when Cleomenes saw that his brother's division
was retreating, and that the cavalry in the low ground were
on the point of doing the same, alarmed at the prospect of
an attack at all points at once, he was compelled to demolish
the palisade in his front, and to lead out his whole force in
line by one side of his position. A recall was sounded on
the bugle for the light-armed troops of both sides, who were
on the ground between the two armies: and the phalanxes
shouting their war cries, and with spears couched, charged
each other. Then a fierce struggle arose: the Macedonians
sometimes slowly giving ground and yielding to the superior
courage of the soldiers of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and at another time the
Lacedaemonians being forced to give way before the overpowering weight of the Macedonian phalanx. At length
Antigonus ordered a charge in close order and in double
phalanx; the enormous weight of this peculiar formation proved
sufficient to finally dislodge the Lacedaemonians from their

they went. Cleomenes himself, with a guard of cavalry,
effected his retreat to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>: but the same night he went
down to <placeName key="tgn,7012041">Gythium</placeName>, where all preparations for crossing the

<head>End of the Introductory Period</head>
<p>Having surprised and taken <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, Antigonus treated
the citizens with magnanimity and humanity; and after reestablishing their ancient constitution, he left the town in
a few days, on receiving intelligence that the Illyrians had
invaded <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and were laying waste the country.
This was a instance of the fantastic way in which Fortune
decides the most important matters. For if Cleomenes had
only put off the battle for a few days, or if when he returned
to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> he had only held out for a brief space of time, he
would have saved his crown.</p>
<p>As it was, Antigonus after going to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> and restoring<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of Antigonus Doson, B. C. <date value="-220">220</date>.</note>
its constitution, arrived on the second day at
<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, at the very time of the Nemean games.
Having at this assembly received every mark of
immortal honour and glory at the hands of the Achaean
community, as well as of the several states, he made all

haste to reach <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. He found the Illyrians still in
the country, and forced them to give him battle, in which,
though he proved entirely successful, he exerted himself to
such a pitch in shouting encouragement to his men, that he
ruptured a bloodvessel, and fell into an illness which terminated shortly in his death. He was a great loss to the Greeks,
whom he had inspired with good hopes, not only by his support in the field, but still more by his character and good
principles. He left the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> to Philip, son
of Demetrius.</p></div2>

<head>Conclusion of Book 2</head>
<p>My reason for writing about this war at such length,
was the advisability, or rather necessity, in view of the general
purpose of my history, of making clear the relations existing
between <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> at a time which coincides
with the period of which I am about to treat.</p>
<p>Just about the same time, by the death of Euergetes,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-284" to="-280">284</dateRange>-280. B. C. <dateRange from="-224" to="-220">224</dateRange>-<date value="-220">220</date>.</note>
Ptolemy Philopator succeeded to the throne of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. At the
same period died Seleucus, son of that Seleucus who had the
double surnames of <placeName key="tgn,7016565">Callinicus</placeName> and Pogon: he was succeeded
on the throne of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> by his brother Antiochus. The deaths of
these three sovereigns&mdash;Antigonus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus&mdash;fell
in the same Olympiad, as was the case with the
three immediate successors to Alexander the
Great,&mdash;Seleucus, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus,&mdash;
for the latter all died in the 124th Olympiad, and the former
in the 139th.</p>
<p>I may now fitly close this book. I have completed the
introduction and laid the foundation on which my history
must rest. I have shown when, how, and why the Romans,
after becoming supreme in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, began to aim at dominion
outside of it, and to dispute with the Carthaginians the dominion
of the sea. I have at the same time explained the state of
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> at this epoch. I have now
arrived at the period which I originally marked out,&mdash;that
namely in which the Greeks were on the point of beginning
the Social, the Romans the Hannibalic war, and the kings in
<placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> the war for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>. The termination therefore of the wars just described, and the death of the
princes engaged in them, forms a natural period to this book.

<head>Summary of the Work</head>
<p>I STATED in my first book that my work was to start from
the Social war, the Hannibalian war, and the war for the
possession of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>. In the same book I stated my
reasons for devoting my first two books to a sketch of the
period preceding those events. I will now, after a few
prefatory remarks as to the scope of my own work, address
myself to giving a complete account of these wars, the causes
which led to them, and which account for the proportions to
which they attained.</p>
<p>The one aim and object, then, of all that I have undertaken<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A summary of the work from B. C. 220 to B. C. <date value="-168">168</date>.</note>
to write is to show how, when, and why all the
known parts of the world fell under the
dominion of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Now as this great event
admits of being exactly dated as to its beginning, duration, and final accomplishment, I think it will
be advantageous to give, by way of preface, a summary statement of the most important phases in it between the beginning
and the end. For I think I shall thus best secure to the
student an adequate idea of my whole plan; for as the comprehension of the whole is a help to the understanding of
details, and the knowledge of details of great service to the
clear conception of the whole; believing that the best and
clearest knowledge is that which is obtained from a combination of these, I will preface my whole history by a brief
summary of its contents.</p>
<p>I have already described its scope and limits. As to its
several parts, the first consists of the above mentioned wars,
while the conclusion or closing scene is the fall of the
Macedonian monarchy. The time included between these
limits is fifty-three years; and never has an equal space embraced
<pb n="167"/>  events of such magnitude and importance. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-220" to="-216">220</dateRange>-<date value="-216">216</date>.</note> In describing
them I shall start from the 140th Olympiad and
shall arrange my exposition in the following order:</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Plan:  Causes of Wars</head>
<p>First I shall indicate the causes of the Punic or
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">1. The cause and course of the Hannibalian war.</note>
Hannibalian war: and shall have to describe
how the Carthaginians entered <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; broke up
the Roman power there; made the Romans
tremble for their safety and the very soil of their country;
and contrary to all calculation acquired a good prospect of
surprising <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself.</p>
<p>I shall next try to make it clear how in the same period<note anchored="yes" place="marg">2. Macedonian treaty with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, B. C. 216.</note>
Philip of <placeName key="tgn,7002715">Macedon</placeName>, after finishing his war with
the Aetolians, and subsequently settling the
affairs of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, entered upon a design of
forming an offensive and defensive alliance with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.</p>
<p>Then I shall tell how Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator<note anchored="yes" place="marg">3. Syrian war, B. C. <date value="-218">218</date>.</note>
first quarrelled and finally went to war with
each other for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>.</p>
<p>Next how the Rhodians and Prusias went to war with the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">4. Byzantine war. B. C. <date value="-220">220</date>.</note>
Byzantines, and compelled them to desist from
exacting dues from ships sailing into the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>.</p>
<p>At this point I shall pause in my narrative to introduce a<note anchored="yes" place="marg">First digression on the Roman Constitution.</note>
disquisition upon the Roman Constitution, in
which I shall show that its peculiar character
contributed largely to their success, not only in
reducing all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> to their authority, and in acquiring a
supremacy over the Iberians and Gauls besides, but also at
last, after their conquest of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, to their conceiving the
idea of universal dominion.</p>
<p>Along with this I shall introduce another<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Second on Hiero of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.</note>
digression on the fall of Hiero of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>.</p>
<p>After these digressions will come the disturbances in<note anchored="yes" place="marg">5. The attempted partition of the dominions of Ptolemy Epiphanes, B. C. <date value="-204">204</date>.</note>
<placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; how, after the death of King Ptolemy,
Antiochus and Philip entered into a compact
for the partition of the dominions of that
monarch's infant son. I shall describe their
treacherous dealings, Philip laying hands upon
the islands of the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002358">Caria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, Antiochus
upon <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>.

<div2 id="b3c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Plan:  Events in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></head>
<p>Next, after a summary recapitulation of the proceedings of

the Carthaginians and Romans in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>,
and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, I shall, following the changes of
events, shift the scene of my story entirely to
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. Here I shall first describe the naval battles of Attalus
and the Rhodians against Philip; and the war between Philip
and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the persons engaged, its circumstances, and result.</p>
<p>Next to this I shall have to record the wrath of the Aetolians,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">7. Asiatic war, B. C. <dateRange from="-192" to="-191">192</dateRange>-191.</note>
in consequence of which they invited the aid of
Antiochus, and thereby gave rise to what is
called the Asiatic war against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and the
Achaean league. Having stated the causes of this war, and
described the crossing of Antiochus into <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, I shall have
to show first in what manner he was driven from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>;
secondly, how, being defeated in the war, he was forced to
cede all his territory west of Taurus; and thirdly, how the
Romans, after crushing the insolence of the Gauls, secured
undisputed possession of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and freed all the nations on
the west of Taurus from the fear of barbarian inroads and
the lawless violence of the Gauls.</p>
<p>Next, after reviewing the disasters of the Aetolians and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">8. Gallic wars of Eumenes and Prusias.</note>
Cephallenians, I shall pass to the wars waged
by Eumenes against Prusias and the Gauls; as
well as that carried on in alliance with Ariarathes
against Pharnaces.</p>
<p>Finally, after speaking of the unity and settlement of the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">9. Union of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>.

<placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, and of the growth of the commonwealth of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, I shall add a summary of
my whole work, concluding by an account
of the expedition of Antiochus Epiphanes
against <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; of the war against Perseus;
and the destruction of the Macedonian
monarchy. Throughout the whole narrative it
will be shown how the policy adopted by the Romans in one
after another of these cases, as they arose, led to their eventual
conquest of the whole world.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Extension of the First Plan of the Work</head>
<p>And if our judgment of individuals and constitutions,
for praise or blame, could be adequately formed from a simple
consideration of their successes or defeats, I must necessarily
<pb n="169"/>
have stopped at this point, and have concluded my history as
soon as I reached these last events in accordance with my
original plan. For at this point the fifty-three years were
coming to an end, and the progress of the Roman power had
arrived at its consummation. And, besides, by this time
the acknowledgment had been extorted from all that the
supremacy of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> must be accepted, and her commands
obeyed. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The plan extended to embrace the period from B. C. 168-146.</note> But in truth, judgments of either side
founded on the bare facts of success or failure
in the field are by no means final. It has
often happened that what seemed the most
signal successes have, from ill management, brought the
most crushing disasters in their train; while not unfrequently the most terrible calamities, sustained with spirit,
have been turned to actual advantage. I am bound, therefore, to add to my statement of facts a discussion on the
subsequent policy of the conquerors, and their administration of their universal dominion: and again on the
various feelings and opinions entertained by other nations
towards their rulers. And I must also describe the tastes
and aims of the several nations, whether in their private
lives or public policy. The present generation will learn
from this whether they should shun or seek the rule
of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and future generations will be taught whether to
praise and imitate, or to decry it. The usefulness of my
history, whether for the present or the future, will mainly lie
in this. For the end of a policy should not be, in the eyes
either of the actors or their historians, simply to conquer others
and bring all into subjection. Nor does any man of sense
go to war with his neighbours for the mere purpose of
mastering his opponents; nor go to sea for the mere sake of
the voyage; nor engage in professions and trades for the sole
purpose of learning them. In all these cases the objects are
invariably the pleasure, honour, or profit which are the results
of the several employments. Accordingly the object of this
work shall be to ascertain exactly what the position of the several
states was, after the universal conquest by which they fell under
the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, until the commotions and disturbances
which broke out at a later period. These I designed to
<pb n="170"/>
make the starting-point of what may almost be called a new
work, partly because of the greatness and surprising nature of
the events themselves, but chiefly because, in the case of most
of them, I was not only an eye-witness, but in some cases one
of the actors, and in others the chief director.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>The True Theory of Historical Causes</head>

Celtiberians and Vaccaei; those of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>
against Massinissa, king of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>; and those
of Attalus and Prusias in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Then also
Ariarathes, King of <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, having been
ejected from his throne by Orophernes through
the agency of King Demetrius, recovered his
ancestral power by the help of Attalus; while
Demetrius, son of Seleucus, after twelve years'
possession of the throne of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, was deprived
of it, and of his life at the same time, by a combination of the other kings against him. Then
it was, too, that the Romans restored to their
country those Greeks who had been charged
with guilt in the matter of the war with Perseus, after formally
acquitting them of the crimes alleged against them. Not
long afterwards the same people turned their hands against
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>: at first with the intention of forcing its removal to
some other spot, but finally, for reasons to be afterwards
stated, with the resolution of utterly destroying it. Contemporaneous with this came the renunciation by the Macedonians of their friendship to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and by the Lacedaemonians of their membership of the Achaean league, to
which the disaster that befell all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> alike owed its beginning and end.</p>
<p>This is my purpose: but its fulfilment must depend upon
whether Fortune protracts my life to the necessary length. I am
persuaded, however, that, even if the common human destiny
does overtake me, this theme will not be allowed to lie idle
for want of competent men to handle it; for there are many
besides myself who will readily undertake its completion.
But having given the heads of the most remarkable events,
with the object of enabling the reader to grasp the general
scope of my history as well as the arrangement of its several
<pb n="171"/>
parts, I must now, remembering my original plan, go back to
the point at which my history starts.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Causes of the Second Punic War</head>
<p>Some historians of the Hannibalian war, when they wish
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The origin of the 2d Punic war;</note>
to point out to us the causes of this contest
between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, allege first the
siege of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> by the Carthaginians, and,
secondly, their breach of treaty by crossing the river called by
the natives the Iber. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-334">334</date>.</note> But though I should call these the
first actions in the war, I cannot admit them
to be its causes. One might just as well say
that the crossing of Alexander the Great into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> was the
<emph>cause</emph> of the Persian war, and the descent of
Antiochus upon <placeName key="perseus,Demetrias">Demetrias</placeName> the <emph>cause</emph> of his war
with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-192">192</date>,</note> In neither would it be a probable or ture statement. In the first case, this action of Alexander's could not be
called the cause of a war, for which both he and his father
Philip in his lifetime had made elaborate preparations: and in
the second case, we know that the Aetolian league had done
the same, with a view to a war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, before Antiochus
came upon the scene. Such definitions are only worthy of men
who cannot distinguish between a first overt act and a cause or
pretext; and who do not perceive that a <emph>cause</emph> is the first in
a series of events of which such an overt act is the last. I
shall therefore regard the first attempt to put into execution
what had already been determined as a "beginning," but I
shall look for "causes" in the motives which suggested such
action and the policy which dictated it; for it is by these, and
the calculations to which they give rise, that men are led to
decide upon a particular line of conduct. The Soundness of
this method will be proved by the following considerations.
The true causes and origin of the invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> by Alexander are patent
to everybody. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-401" to="-400">401</dateRange>-400,</note><note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-396" to="-394">396</dateRange>-394</note> They were,
first, the return march of the Greeks under
Xenophon through the country from the upper Satrapies;
in the course of which, though throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> all the populations were hostile, not a single barbarian ventured to face
them: secondly, the invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> by the
Spartan king Agesilaus, in which, though he was
obliged by troubles in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> to return in the middle of his
<pb n="172"/>
expedition without effecting his object, he yet found no resistance of any
importance or adequacy. It was these circumstances which convinced Philip of the cowardice and inefficiency
of the Persians; and comparing them with his own high state
of efficiency for war, and that of his Macedonian subjects, and
placing before his eyes the splendour of the rewards to be
gained by such a war, and the popularity which it would bring
him in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, he seized on the pretext of avenging the injuries done by <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and determined with great
eagerness to undertake this war; and was in fact at the time
of his death engaged in making every kind of preparation for it.</p>
<p>Here we have the <emph>cause</emph> and the <emph>pretext</emph> of the Persian war.
Alexander's expedition into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> was the <emph>first action</emph> in it.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Fabius Pictor on the Cause of the Punic War</head>
<p>So too of the war of Antiochus with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The <emph>cause</emph>
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">and of the war with Antiochus.</note>
was evidently the exasperation of the Aetolians,
who, thinking that they had been slighted in
a number of instances at the end of the war
with Philip, not only called in the aid of Antiochus, but resolved to go to every extremity in satisfying the anger which
the events of that time had aroused in them. This was the
<emph>cause.</emph> As for the <emph>pretext,</emph> it was the liberation of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,
which they went from city to city with Antiochus proclaiming,
without regard to reason or truth; while the <emph>first act</emph> in the
war was the descent of Antiochus upon <placeName key="perseus,Demetrias">Demetrias</placeName>.</p>
<p>My object in enlarging upon this distinction is not to attack
the historians in question, but to rectify the ideas of the
studious. A physician can do no good to the sick who does
not know the causes of their ailments; nor can a statesman
do any good who is unable to conceive the manner, cause, and
source of the events with which he has from time to time to deal.
Surely the former could not be expected to institute a suitable
system of treatment for the body; nor the latter to grapple with
the exigencies of the situation, without possessing this knowledge of its elements. There is nothing, therefore, which we
ought to be more alive to, and to seek for, than the causes of
every event which occurs. For the most important results
are often produced by trifles; and it is invariably easier to
apply remedial measures at the beginning, before things have
got beyond the stage of conception and intention.

<div2 id="b3c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>The Credibility of Fabius Pictor</head>
<p>Now the Roman annalist Fabius asserts that the cause
of the Hannibalian war, besides the injury inflicted upon <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, was the encroaching and
ambitious spirit of Hasdrubal. "Having secured
great power in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, he returned to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> with the design
of destroying the constitution and reducing <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to a
despotism. But the leading statesmen, getting timely warning
of his intention, banded themselves together and successfully
opposed him. Suspecting this Hasdrubal retired from <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>,
and thenceforth governed <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> entirely at his own will without taking any account whatever of the Carthaginian Senate.
This policy had had in Hannibal from his earliest youth a
zealous supporter and imitator; and when he succeeded to
the command in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> he continued it: and accordingly, even
in the case of this war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, was acting on his own
authority and contrary to the wish of the Carthaginians; for
none of the men of note in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> approved of his attack
upon <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>." This is the statement of Fabius, who goes
on to say, that "after the capture of that city an embassy
arrived in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> demanding that Hannibal
should be given up on pain of a declaration of war."</p>
<p>Now what answer could Fabius have given if we had put
the following question to him? "What better chance or
opportunity could the Carthaginians have had of combining
justice and interest? According to your own account they
disliked the proceeding of Hannibal: why did they not submit
to the demands of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> by surrendering the author of the
injury; and thus get rid of the common enemy of the state
without the odium of doing it themselves, and secure the
safety of their territory by ridding themselves of the threatened
war&mdash;all of which they could have effected by merely passing
a decree?" If this question were put, I say, it would admit
of no answer. The fact is that, so far from doing anything of
the sort, they maintained the war in accordance with Hannibal's policy for seventeen years; and refused to make terms
until, at the end of a most determined struggle, they found
their own city and persons in imminent danger of destruction.</p></div2>

account than what he says. They look to the fact that
Fabius was a contemporary and a member of the Senate, and
assume without more ado that everything he says may be
trusted. My view, however, is that we ought not to hold the
authority of this writer lightly: yet at the same time that we
should not regard it as all-sufficient; but in reading his writings
should test them by a reference to the facts themselves.</p>
<p>This is a digression from my immediate subject, which is<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Hannibalian or Second Punic war. First cause.</note>
the war between <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The
cause of this war we must reckon to be the
exasperation of Hamilcar, surnamed Barcas, the
father of Hannibal. The result of the war in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> had not
broken the spirit of that commander. He regarded himself as
unconquered; for the troops at <placeName key="perseus,Eryx">Eryx</placeName> which he commanded
were still sound and undismayed: and though he yielded so
far as to make a treaty, it was a concession to the exigencies
of the times brought on by the defeat of the Carthaginians at
sea. But he never relaxed in his determined purpose of revenge; and, had it not been for the mutiny of the mercenaries at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, he would at once have sought and made
another occasion for bringing about a war, as far as he was
able to do so: as it was, he was preoccupied by the domestic
war, and had to give his attention entirely to that.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c10" type="chapter" n="10">
<head>Second Cause of the War</head>
<p>When the Romans, at the conclusion of this mercenary

war, proclaimed war with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, the latter at
first was inclined to resist at all hazards, because the goodness of her cause gave her hopes
of victory,&mdash;as I have shown in my former book, without which
it would be impossible to understand adequately either this or
what is to follow. The Romans, however, would not listen to
anything: and the Carthaginians therefore yielded to the force
of circumstances; and though feeling bitterly aggrieved, yet being
quite unable to do anything, evacuated <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and consented
<pb n="175"/>
to pay a sum of twelve hundred talents, in addition to the
former indemnity paid them, on condition of avoiding the
war at that time. This is the second and the most important
cause of the subsequent war. For Hamilcar, having this public
grievance in addition to his private feelings of anger, as soon as
he had secured his country's safety by reducing the rebellious
mercenaries, set at once about securing the Carthaginian
power in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> with the intention of using it as a base of
operations against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Third cause.</note> So that I record as a
third cause of the war the Carthaginian success
in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>: for it was the confidence inspired by their forces there
which encouraged them to embark upon it. It would be easy
to adduce other facts to show that Hamilcar, though he had
been dead ten years at its commencement, largely contributed
to bring about the second Punic war, but what I am about to
say will be sufficient to establish the fact.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Hannibal's Oath</head>
<p>When, after his final defeat by the Romans, Hannibal
had at last quitted his country and was staying
at the court of Antiochus, the warlike attitude
of the Aetolian league induced the Romans to send ambassadors to Antiochus, that they might be informed of the king's
intentions. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-195">195</date></note>These ambassadors found that Antiochus was inclined to the Aetolian alliance, and was eager for war with
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; they accordingly paid great court to
Hannibal with a view of bringing him into
suspicion with the king. And in this they entirely succeeded.
As time went on the king became ever more and more suspicious of Hannibal, until at length an opportunity occurred
for an explanation of the alienation that had been thus secretly
growing up between them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-238">238</date>.</note> Hannibal then defended himself
at great length, but without success, until at last he made the
following statement: "When my father was
about to go on his Iberian expedition I was
nine years old: and as he was offering the sacrifice to Zeus I
stood near the altar. The sacrifice successfully performed,
my father poured the libation and went through the
usual ritual. He then bade all the other worshippers stand a
little back, and calling me to him asked me affectionately
whether I wished to go with him on his expedition. Upon
<pb n="176"/>
my eagerly assenting, and begging with boyish enthusiasm to
be allowed to go, he took me by the right hand and led me up
to the altar, and bade me lay my hand upon the victim and
swear that I would never be friends with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. So long,
then, Antiochus, as your policy is one of hostility to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
you may feel quite secure of having in me a most thoroughgoing supporter. But if ever you make terms or friendship
with her, then you need not wait for any slander to make you
distrust me and be on your guard against me; for there is
nothing in my power that I would not do against her."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Statesmen Must Pay Attention to Motives</head>
<p>Antiochus listened to this story, and being convinced
that it was told with genuine feeling and sincerity, gave up all
his suspicions, And we, too, must regard this as an unquestionable proof of the animosity of Hamilcar and of the aim of
his general policy; which, indeed, is also proved by facts.
For he inspired his son-in-law Hasdrubal and his son Hannibal with a bitterness of resentment against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> which
nothing could surpass. Hasdrubal, indeed, was prevented by
death from showing the full extent of his purpose; but time
gave Hannibal abundant opportunity to manifest the hatred of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> which he had inherited from his father.</p>
<p>The most important thing, then, for statesmen to observe is
the motives of those who lay aside old enmities or form new
friendships; and to ascertain when their consent to treaties is
a mere concession to the necessities of the hour, and when it
is the indication of a real consciousness of defeat. In the former
case they must be on their guard against such people lying in
wait for an opportunity; while in the latter they may unhesitatingly impose whatever injunctions are necessary, in full
reliance on the genuineness of their feelings whether as subjects or friends. So much for the causes of the war. I will
now relate the first actions in it.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c13" type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Hannibal Succeeds to Command in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName></head>
<p>The Carthaginians were highly incensed by their loss
of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, but their resentment was heightened still more, as I
have said, by the transaction as to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and by the addition recently made to their tribute. Accordingly, when the
greater part of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> had fallen into their power, they were on
the alert to seize any opportunity that presented itself of retaliating upon <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. At the death of Hasdrubal, to whom
<pb n="177"/>
they had committed the command in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> after the death of
Hamilcar, they waited at first to ascertain the
feelings of the army; but when news came from
thence that the troops had elected Hannibal as
commander in-chief, a popular assembly was at once held, and
the choice of the army confirmed by a unanimous vote. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of Hamilcar, B. C. <date value="-229">229</date>.</note> As
soon as he had taken over the command, Hannibal set out to subdue the tribe of the Olcades;
and, having arrived before their most formidable city Althaea, he pitched his camp under its walls;
and by a series of energetic and formidable assaults succeeded
before long in taking it: by which the rest of the tribe were
overawed into submission to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of Hasdrubal, B. C. <date value="-221">221</date>.</note>Having imposed a

There, by a liberal treatment of the forces under his command,
giving them an instalment of their pay at once and promising
the rest, he established an excellent feeling towards himself in
the army, as well as great hopes for the future.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Hannibal Attacks the Vaccaei</head>
<p>Next summer he set out on another expedition against the Vaccaei, in which he took <placeName key="tgn,7008561">Salmantica</placeName> by

assault, but only succeeded in storming Arbucala, owing to the size of the town and the number
and valour of its inhabitants, after a laborious siege. After this
he suddenly found himself in a position of very great danger
on his return march: being set upon by the Carpesii, the
strongest tribe in those parts, who were joined also by neighbouring tribes, incited principally by refugees of the Olcades,
but roused also to great wrath by those who escaped from
<placeName key="tgn,7008561">Salmantica</placeName>. If the Carthaginians had been compelled to give
these people regular battle, there can be no doubt that they
would have been defeated: but as it was, Hannibal, with
admirable skill and caution, slowly retreated until he had put the
<placeName key="tgn,7016546">Tagus</placeName> between himself and the enemy; and thus giving battle
at the crossing of the stream, supported by it and the elephants,
of which he had about forty, he gained, to every one's surprise,
a complete success. For when the barbarians attempted to
force a crossing at several points of the river at once, the
greater number of them were killed as they left the water by
<pb n="178"/>
the elephants, who marched up and down along the brink of
the river and caught them as they were coming out. Many of
them also were killed in the river itself by the cavalry, because
the horses were better able than the men to stand against the
stream, and also because the cavalry were fighting on higher
ground than the infantry which they were attacking. At
length Hannibal turned the tables on the enemy, and, recrossing the river, attacked and put to flight their whole army, to
the number of more than a hundred thousand men. After
the defeat of this host, no one south of the Iber rashly ventured
to face him except the people of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>. From that town
Hannibal tried his best to keep aloof; because, acting on the
suggestions and advice of his father Hamilcar, he did not wish
to give the Romans an avowed pretext for war until he had
thoroughly secured the rest of the country.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c15" type="chapter" n="15">

to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, partly because they foresaw what was
coming, and trembled for their own existence,
and partly that the Romans might be kept fully
aware of the growing power of the Carthaginians in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>. For a long time the Romans disregarded
their words: but now they sent out some commissioners to see
what was going on. Just at that time Hannibal had finished
the conquests which he intended for that season, and was
going into winter quarters at the <placeName key="tgn,7013527">New Town</placeName> again, which was in
a way the chief glory and capital town of the Carthaginians in
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>. He found there the embassy from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, granted them
an interview, and listened to the message with which they were
charged. It was a strong injunction to him to leave <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>
alone, as being under the protection of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and not to cross
the Iber, in accordance with the agreement come to in the
time of Hasdrubal. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's defiance.</note> To this Hannibal answered with all the
heat of youth, inflamed by martial ardour,
recent success, and his long-standing hatred of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. He charged the Romans with having a short time before,
when on some political disturbances arising in the town they
had been chosen to act as arbitrators, seized the opportunity to
put some of the leading citizens to death; and he declared
that the Carthaginians would not allow the Saguntines to be
<pb n="179"/>
thus treacherously dealt with, for it was the traditional policy
of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to protect all persons so wronged. At the same
time he sent home for instructions as to what he was to do
"in view of the fact that the Saguntines were injuring certain
of their subject allies." And altogether he was in a state of
unreasoning anger and violent exasperation, which prevented
him from availing himself of the real causes for war, and made
him take refuge in pretexts which would not admit of justification, after the manner of men whose passions master all
considerations of equity. How much better it would have
been to demand of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the restoration of <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and the
remission of the tribute, which she had taken an unfair
opportunity to impose on pain of a declaration of war. As
it was, he said not a word of the real cause, but alleged the
fictitious one of the matter of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>; and so got the credit
of beginning the war, not only in defiance of reason, but still
more in defiance of justice. The Roman ambassadors, finding
that there must undoubtedly be a war, sailed to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to
enter the same protest before the people there. They expected, however, that they would have to fight not in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,
but in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, and that they would have <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> as a base of
operations.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>War in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName></head>
<p>Wherefore the Senate, by way of preparing to undertake this business, and foreseeing that the war

would be severe and protracted, and at a long
distance from the mother country, determined
to make <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName> safe. For it happened that, just at this time,
Demetrius of Pharos was sacking and subduing to his authority
the cities of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName> which were subject to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and had
sailed beyond <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>, in violation of the treaty, with fifty
galleys, and had ravaged many of the <placeName key="tgn,7011270">Cyclades</placeName>. For he
had quite forgotten the former kindnesses done him by
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and had conceived a contempt for its power, when
he saw it threatened first by the Gauls and then by <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>;
and he now rested all his hopes on the royal family of
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, because he had fought on the side of Antigonus, and shared with him the dangers of the war against
Cleomenes. These transactions attracted the observation of
the Romans; who, seeing that the royal house of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>
<pb n="180"/>
was in a flourishing condition, were very anxious to secure the
country east of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; feeling convinced that they would have
ample time to correct the rash folly of the Illyrians, and rebuke
and chastise the ingratitude and temerity of Demetrius. But
they were deceived in their calculations. For Hannibal anticipated their measures by the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>: the result
of which was that the war took place not in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, but close

<head>Hannibal Takes <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName></head>
<p>But Hannibal had started from New Carthage and was
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal besieges <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>.</note>
leading his army straight against Saguntum.
This city is situated on the sea-ward foot of
the mountain chain on which the frontiers of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> and
Celtiberia converge, and is about seven stades from the sea.
The district cultivated by its inhabitants is exceedingly
productive, and has a soil superior to any in all <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>.
Under the walls of this town Hannibal pitched his camp
and set energetically to work on the siege, foreseeing many
advantages that would accrue if he could take it. Of these
the first was that he would thereby disappoint the Romans
in their expectation of making <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> the seat of war: a
second was that he would thereby strike a general terror,
which would render the already obedient tribes more submissive, and the still independent ones more cautious of
offending him: but the greatest advantage of all was that
thereby he would be able to push on his advance, without
leaving an enemy on his rear. Besides these advantages, he
calculated that the possession of this city would secure him
abundant supplies for his expedition, and create an enthusiasm
in the troops excited by individual acquisitions of booty;
while he would conciliate the goodwill of those who remained
at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> by the spoils which would be sent home. With
these ideas he pressed on the siege with energy: sometimes
setting an example to his soldiers by personally sharing in the
fatigues of throwing up the siege works; and sometimes cheering on his men and recklessly exposing himself to danger.
<pb n="181"/>
After a siege extending to the eighth month, in the course of
which he endured every kind of suffering and
anxiety, he finally succeeded in taking the town.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fall of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>.</note>
An immense booty in money, slaves, and property fell into

design. The money he reserved for the needs of his projected expedition; the slaves were distributed according to
merit among his men; while the property was at once sent
entire to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. The result answered his expectations: the
army was rendered more eager for action; the home populace
more ready to grant whatever he asked; and he himself was

out many measures that were of service to his expedition.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c18" type="chapter" n="18">
<head>Demetrius Fortifies Dimale</head>
<p>While this was taking place, Demetrius, discovering
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Illyrian war, B. C. 219.</note>
the intentions of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, threw a sufficient garrison into Dimale and victualled it in proportion.
In the other towns he put those who were opposed to him
to death, and placed the chief power in the hands of his own
partisans; and selecting six thousand of the bravest of his
subjects, quartered them in Pharos. When the Consul
arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName> with his army, he found the enemies of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> confident in the strength of Dimale and the elaborate
preparations in it, and encouraged to resistance by their belief in
its impregnability; he determined, therefore, to attack that town
first, in order to strike terror into the enemy. Accordingly,
after addressing an exhortation to the several officers of the
legions, and throwing up siege works at several points, he began
the siege in form. In seven days he took the town by assault,
which so dismayed the enemy, that envoys immediately
appeared from all the towns, surrendering themselves unconditionally to the protection of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. The Consul accepted their submission: and after imposing such conditions
as appeared suitable to the several cases, he sailed to Pharos
to attack Demetrius himself. Being informed that the city
there was strongly fortified, thronged with excellent soldiers,
and well-furnished with provisions and all other munitions of
war, he began to entertain misgivings that the siege would be
long and difficult; and therefore, with a view to these difficulties,
he adopted on the spur of the moment the following
<pb n="182"/>
strategem. He crossed to the island by night with his whole
army. The greater part of it he disembarked at a spot where
the ground was well-wooded and low; while with only twenty
ships he sailed at daybreak to the harbour nearest the town.
The smallness of the number of the ships moved only the
contempt of Demetrius when he saw them, and he immediately
marched out of the town down to the harbour to oppose the
landing of the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c19" type="chapter" n="19">
<head>Illyrian War Successfully Finished</head>
<p>A violent struggle at once began: and, as it went on,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Capture of Pharos.</note>
division after division of the troops in the city
came down to support him, until at length the
whole force had poured out to take part in the engagement. The
Romans who had landed in the night arrived at the critical
moment, after a march by an obscure route; and seizing
a strong position on some rising ground between the city and
the harbour, efficiently cut off from the city the troops that had
sallied out. When Demetrius became aware of what had
taken place, he desisted from opposing the disembarkation;
and having rallied his men and addressed the ranks, he put
them in motion, with the resolution of fighting a pitched
battle with the troops on the hill. When the Romans
saw the Illyrian advance being made in good order and with
great spirit, they formed their ranks and charged furiously.
At the same moment the Roman troops which had just
effected their landing, seeing what was going on, charged
the enemy on the rear, who being thus attacked on both
sides, were thrown into great disorder and confusion. The
result was that, finding both his van and his rear in difficulties,
Demetrius fled. Some of his men retreated towards the city;
but most of them escaped by bye-paths into various parts of the
island. Demetrius himself made his way to some galleys which
he kept at anchor at a solitary point on the coast, with a view
to every contingency; and going on board, he sailed away
at nightfall, and arrived unexpectedly at the court of King
Philip, where he passed the remainder of his life:&mdash;a man
whose undoubted boldness and courage were unsupported by
either prudence or judgment. His end was of a piece with the
whole tenor of his life; for while endeavouring at the instigation of Philip to seize <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, he exposed himself during
<pb n="183"/>
the battle with a careless rashness which cost him his life; of
which I shall speak in detail when I come to that period.</p>
<p>The Consul Aemilius having thus taken Pharos at a blow,

the speeches delivered on either side. But
nothing could be more ridiculous. For is it conceivable
that the Romans should have a year before proclaimed

the territory of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, and yet, when the city itself

fathers introduced their sons above twelve years old into the
Senate House, who, being admitted to the debate, refrained
from divulging any of its secrets even to their nearest relations.
All this is as improbable as it is untrue; unless we are to
believe that Fortune, among its other bounties, granted the
Romans the privilege of being men of being men of the world from their
cradles. I need not waste any more words upon such compositions as those of
Chaereas and Sosilus;<note anchored="yes">Of Chaereas nothing seems known; a few fragments of an historian of his

judgment, are more like the gossip of the barber's shop and the pavement than history.</p>

they despatched in all haste to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> with
the offer of two alternatives, one of which appeared to the Carthaginians to involve disgrace
as well as injury if they accepted it, while the other was the
<pb n="184"/>
beginning of a great struggle and of great dangers. For one
of these alternatives was the surrender of Hannibal and
his staff to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the other was war. When the Roman
envoys arrived and declared their message to the Senate, the
choice proposed to them between these alternatives was
listened to by the Carthaginians with indignation. Still they
selected the most capable of their number to state their case,
which was grounded on the following pleas.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c21" type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Romans Demand Surrender of Hannibal</head>
<p>Passing over the treaty made with Hasdrubal, as not
having ever been made, and, if it had, as not being binding on
them because made without their consent (and on this point
they quoted the precedent of the Romans themselves, who
in the Sicilian war repudiated the terms agreed upon and
accepted by Lutatius, as having been made without their
consent)&mdash;passing over this, they pressed with all the
vehemence they could, throughout the discussion, the last
treaty made in the Sicilian war; in which they affirmed that
there was no clause relating to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, but one expressly providing security for the allies of both parties to the treaty. Now,
they pointed out that the Saguntines at that time were not allies
of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and therefore were not protected by the clause. To
prove their point, they read the treaty more than once aloud.
On this occasion the Roman envoys contented themselves
with the reply that, while <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> was intact, the matter in
dispute admitted of pleadings and of a discussion on its merits;
but that, that city having been treacherously seized, they had
only two alternatives,&mdash;either to deliver the persons guilty of
the act, and thereby make it clear that they had no share in
their crime, and that it was done without their consent; or, if
they were not willing to do that, and avowed their complicity
in it, to take the consequences.</p>
<p>The question of treaties between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> was
referred to in general terms in the course of this debate: but I
think a more particular examination of it will be useful both to
practical statesmen, who require to know the exact truth of the
matter, in order to avoid mistakes in any critical deliberation;
and to historical students, that they may not be led astray by
<pb n="185"/>
the ignorance or partisan bias of historians; but may have
before them a conspectus, acknowledged to be accurate, of the

<head>Treaties between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName></head>
<p>The first treaty between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> was made
in the year of Lucius Junius Brutus and Marcus
Horatius, the first Consuls appointed after the
expulsion of the kings, by which men also
the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated. This was
twenty-eight years before the invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>
by Xerxes. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The first treaty, B. C. <dateRange from="-509" to="-508">509</dateRange>-508.</note> Of this treaty I append a translation, as accurate as I could make it,&mdash;for the
fact is that the ancient language differs so much from that at
present in use, that the best scholars among the Romans themselves have great difficulty in interpreting some points in it,
even after much study. The treaty is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There shall be friendship between the Romans and their
allies, and the Carthaginians and their allies, on these conditions:</p>
<p>"Neither the Romans nor their allies are to sail beyond
the Fair Promontory, unless driven by stress of weather or the
fear of enemies. If any one of them be driven ashore he
shall not buy or take aught for himself save what is needful
for the repair of his ship and the service of the gods, and he
shall depart within five days.</p>
<p>"Men landing for traffic shall strike no bargain save in the
presence of a herald or town-clerk. Whatever is sold in the
presence of these, let the price be secured to the seller on the
credit of the state&mdash;that is to say, if such sale be in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> or
<placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>.</p>
<p>"If any Roman comes to the Carthaginian province in
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> he shall enjoy all rights enjoyed by others. The Carthaginians shall do no injury to the people of <placeName key="perseus,Ardea">Ardea</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>,
Laurentium, <placeName key="tgn,7009536">Circeii</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>, nor any other people of the
Latins that are subject to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>
<p>"From those townships even which are not subject to

<pb n="186"/>
in <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>; and if they enter the district in arms, they shall not
stay a night therein."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Division of Territory</head>
<p>The "Fair Promontory" here referred to is that which
lies immediately to the north of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>; south of which the
Carthaginians stipulated that the Romans should not sail with
ships of war, because, as I imagine, they did not wish them to
be acquainted with the coast near Byzacium, or the lesser
Syrtis, which places they call Emporia, owing to the productiveness of the district. The treaty then goes on to say
that, if any one of them is driven thither by stress of weather
or fear of an enemy, and stands in need of anything for the
worship of the gods and the repair of his vessel, this and no
more he may take; and all those who have come to anchor
there must necessarily depart within five days. To <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>,
and all the country on the Carthaginian side of the Fair Promontory in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and the Carthaginian province of
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, the treaty allows the Romans to sail for mercantile
purposes; and the Carthaginians engage their public credit
that such persons shall enjoy absolute security.</p>
<p>It is clear from this treaty that the Carthaginians speak of
<placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> as belonging to them entirely; but, on the
other hand, make a distinction in the case of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and only
stipulate for that part of it which is subject to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.
Similarly, the Romans also only stipulate concerning <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>;
the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> they do not mention, as not being under their
authority.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c24" type="chapter" n="24">
<head>Treaties Between Rome and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName></head>
<p>After this treaty there was a second, in which we find
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Second treaty. B. C. <date value="-306">306</date> (?).</note>
that the Carthaginians have included the
Tyrians and the township of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> in addition
to their former territory; and to the Fair
Promontory Mastia and Tarseium are added, as the points
east of which the Romans are not to make marauding expeditions or found a city. The treaty is as follows: "There
shall be friendship between the Romans and their allies,
and the Carthaginians, Tyrians, and township of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, on
these terms: The Romans shall not maraud, nor traffic,
nor found a city east of the Fair Promontory, Mastia,
Tarseium. If the Carthaginians take any city in <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> which
is not subject to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, they may keep the prisoners and the
<pb n="187"/>
goods, but shall deliver up the town. If the Carthaginians
take any folk, between whom and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> a peace has been
made in writing, though they be not subject to them, they
shall not bring them into any harbours of the Romans; if such
an one be so brought ashore, and any Roman lay claim to
him,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)pila/bhtai</foreign> <foreign lang="la">injecerit manum,</foreign> the legal form of claiming a slave.</note> he shall be released. In like manner shall the Romans
be bound towards the Carthaginians.</p>
<p>"If a Roman take water or provisions from any district
within the jurisdiction of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, he shall not injure, while
so doing, any between whom and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> there is peace
and friendship. Neither shall a Carthaginian in like case. If
any one shall do so, he shall not be punished by private
vengeance, but such action shall be a public misdemeanour.</p>
<p>"In Sardinia and <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> no Roman shall traffic nor found
a city; he shall do no more than take in provisions and refit
his ship. If a storm drive him upon-those coasts, he shall
depart within five days.</p>
<p>"In the Carthaginian province of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>
he may transact business and sell whatsoever it is lawful
for a citizen to do. In like manner also may a Carthaginian
at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>."</p>
<p>Once more in this treaty we may notice that the Carthaginians
emphasise the fact of their entire possession of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and prohibit any attempt of the Romans to land in
them at all; and on the other hand, in the case of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, they
clearly distinguish their own province in it. So, too, the
Romans, in regard to <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, stipulate that the Carthaginians
shall do no wrong to <placeName key="perseus,Ardea">Ardea</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Antium">Antium</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7009536">Circeii</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Tarracina">Tarracina</placeName>, all of
which are on the seaboard of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName>, to which alone the
treaty refers.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c25" type="chapter" n="25">
<head>The Third Treaty</head>
<p>A third treaty again was made by <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> at the time of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Third treaty, B.C. <date value="-279">279</date>.</note>
the invasion of Pyrrhus into <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; before the
Carthaginians undertook the war for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. This treaty contains the same
provisions as the two earlier treaties with these additional
clauses:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If they make a treaty of alliance with Pyrrhus, the
Romans or Carthaginians shall make it on such terms as
<pb n="188"/>
not to preclude the one giving aid to the other, if that one's
territory is attacked.</p>
<p>"If one or the other stand in need of help, the Carthaginians shall supply the ships, whether for transport or war;
but each people shall supply the pay for its own men employed
on them.</p>
<p>The Carthaginians shall also give aid by sea to the
Romans if need be; but no one shall compel the crews to
disembark against their will."</p>
<p>Provision was also made for swearing to these treaties. In
the case of the first, the Carthaginians were to swear by the
gods of their ancestors, the Romans by Jupiter Lapis, in
accordance with an ancient custom; in the case of the last
treaty, by Mars and Quirinus.</p>
<p>The form of swearing by Jupiter Lapis was this. The
commissioner for swearing to the treaty took a stone in his
hand, and, having taken the oath in the name of his country,
added these words, "If I abide by this oath may he bless me;
but if I do otherwise in thought or act, may all others be kept
safe each in his own country, under his own laws, in enjoyment
of his own goods, household gods, and tombs,&mdash;may I alone
be cast out, even as this stone is now." And having uttered
these words he throws the stone from his hand.</p></div2>

<head>Treaties Between Rome and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName></head>
<p>Seeing that such treaties exist and are preserved to
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Misstatement of Philinus.</note>
this day, engraved on brass in the treasury of
the Aediles in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,
the historian Philinus certainly does give us some reason
to be surprised at him. Not at his ignorance of their
existence: for even in our own day those Romans and
Carthaginians, whose age placed them nearest to the times,
and who had the reputation of taking the greatest interest
in public affairs, were unaware of it. But what is surprising
is, that he should have ventured on a statement exactly opposite:
"That there was a treaty between <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, in
virtue of which the Romans were bound to keep away from the
whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, the Carthaginians from the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; and
that the Romans broke the treaty and their oath when they
first crossed over to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>." Whereas there does not exist,
nor ever has existed, any such written compact at all. Yet
<pb n="189"/>
this assertion he makes in so many words in his second book.
I referred to this in the preface of my work, but reserved a
more detailed discussion of it to this place; which was
necessary, because the assertion of Philinus has misled a
considerable number of people on this point. I have nothing
to say if a man chooses to attack the Romans for crossing into
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, on the grounds of their having taken the Mamertines
into alliance at all; or in having thus acted in answer to their
request, after these men's treachery to <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName> as well as
<placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>: but if any one supposes that in so crossing they
broke oaths or treaties, he is manifestly ignorant of the truth.</p></div2>

<head>The Fourth Treaty</head>
<p>At the end of the first Punic war another treaty was
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fourth treaty, B. C. <date value="-241">241</date>.</note>
made, of which the chief provisions were these:
"The Carthaginians shall evacuate <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and
all islands lying between <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</p>
<p>"The allies of neither of the parties to the treaty shall be
attacked by the other.</p>
<p>"Neither party shall impose any contribution, nor erect any
public building, nor enlist soldiers in the dominions of the
other, nor make any compact of friendship with the allies of
the other.</p>
<p>"The Carthaginians shall within ten years pay to the
Romans two-thousand two-hundred talents, and a thousand
on the spot; and shall restore all prisoners, without ransom,
to the Romans."</p>

Romans went so far as to pass a decree for war

the following effect: "The Carthaginians shall
evacuate <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and pay an additional twelve hundred

<p>Finally, in addition to these treaties, came that negotiated<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Sixth treaty, B. C. <date value="-228">228</date>.</note>
with Hasdrubal in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, in which it was

<p>Such were the mutual obligations established between

<head>No Reasonable Pretext for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to Claim Sardinia</head>
<p>As we find then that the Roman invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> was
<pb n="190"/>
not in contravention of their oaths, so we must acknowledge
in the case of the second proclamation of

the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> was made, that
it is impossible to find any reasonable pretext or ground

had during the Mercenary war been guilty of acts of hostility
to ships sailing from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,&mdash;that was barred by their own act
in restoring, without ransom, the Carthaginian prisoners, in

Romans who had landed on their shores; a transaction which
I have spoken of at length in my previous book.<note anchored="yes">1, 83.</note></p>
<p>These facts established, it remains to decide by a thorough
investigation to which of the two nations the origin of the
Hannibalian war is to be imputed.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c29" type="chapter" n="29">
<head>The Roman Case For War</head>
<p>I have explained the pleas advanced by the Carthaginians; I must now state what is alleged on the contrary by
the Romans, For though it is true that in this particular interview, owing to their anger at the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, they did
not use these arguments, yet they were appealed to on many
occasions, and by many of their citizens. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman case.</note>First,
they argued that the treaty of Hasdrubal could
not be ignored, as the Carthaginians had the assurance to do:
for it did not contain the clause, which that of Lutatius did,
making its validity conditional on its ratification by the people
of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; but Hasdrubal made the agreement absolutely and
authoritatively that "the Carthaginians should not cross the
Iber in arms."</p>
<p>Next they alleged that the clause in the treaty respecting
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, which by their own admission stipulated that "the allies
of neither party should be attacked by the other," did not refer
to then existing allies only, as the Carthaginians interpreted it;
for in that case a clause would have been added, disabling either
from making new alliances in addition to those already existing,
or excluding allies, taken subsequently to the making of the
<pb n="191"/>
treaty, from its benefits. But since neither of these provisions
was made, it was plain that both the then existing allies, and
all those taken subsequently on either side, were entitled to
reciprocal security. And this was only reasonable. For it
was not likely that they would have made a treaty depriving them of the power, when opportunity offered, of taking
on such friends or allies as seemed to their interest; nor,
again, if they had taken any such under their protection,
was it to be supposed that they would allow them to be
injured by any persons whatever. But, in fact, the main thing
present in the minds of both parties to the treaty was, that
they should mutually agree to abstain from attacking each
other's allies, and on no account admit into alliance with
themselves the allies of the other: and it was to subsequent
allies that this particular clause applied, "Neither shall enlist
soldiers, or impose contributions on the provinces or allies of
the other; and all shall be alike secure of attack from the
other side."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>Both Sides Are in the Wrong</head>
<p>These things being so, they argued that it was beyond
controversy that <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> had accepted the protection of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, several years before the time of Hannibal. The
strongest proof of this, and one which would not be contested
by the Carthaginians themselves, was that, when political disturbances broke out at <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, the people chose the
Romans, and not the Carthaginians, as arbitrators to settle the
dispute and restore their constitution, although the latter were
close at hand and were already established in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>.</p>
<p>I conclude, then, that if the destruction of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> is to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Mutual provocation.</note>
be regarded as the cause of this war, the Carthaginians must be acknowledged to be in
the wrong, both in view of the treaty of Lutatius, which
secured immunity from attack for the allies of both parties,
and in view of the treaty of Hasdrubal, which disabled
the Carthaginians from passing the Iber with arms.<note anchored="yes"><placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> of course is south of the Iber, but the attack on it by Hannibal
was a breach of the former of the two treaties. Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 21.1">21, 2</bibl>) seems to assert
that it was specially exempted from attack in the treaty with Hasdrubal.</note> If
on the other hand the taking <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> from them, and imposing the heavy money fine which accompanied it, are to
<pb n="192"/>
be regarded as the causes, we must certainly acknowledge
that the Carthaginians had good reason for undertaking
the Hannibalian war: for as they had only yielded to the
pressure of circumstances, so they seized a favourable turn in
those circumstances to revenge themselves on their injurers.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c31" type="chapter" n="31">
<head>The Value of Such Discussions</head>
<p>Some uncritical readers may perhaps say that such
minute discussion on points of this kind is unnecessary. And
if any man were entirely self-sufficing in every event, I might
allow that the accurate knowledge of the past, though a graceful accomplishment, was perhaps not essential: but as long as
it is not in mere mortals to say this, either in public or private
affairs,&mdash;seeing that no man of sense, even if he is prosperous
for the moment, will ever reckon with certainty on the future,
&mdash;then I say that such knowledge is essential, and not merely
graceful. For take the three commonest cases. Suppose,
first, a statesman to be attacked either in his own person or in
that of his country: or, secondly, suppose him to be anxious
for a forward policy and to anticipate the attack of an enemy:
or, lastly, suppose him to desire to maintain the <foreign lang="la">status quo.</foreign>
In all these cases it is history alone that can supply him with
precedents, and teach him how, in the first case, to find supporters and allies; in the second, to incite co-operation; and
in the third, to give vigour to the conservative forces which
tend to maintain, as he desires, the existing state of things.
In the case of contemporaries, it is difficult to obtain an insight
into their purposes; because, as their words and actions are
dictated by a desire of accommodating themselves to the
necessity of the hour, and of keeping up appearances, the truth
is too often obscured. Whereas the transactions of the past
admit of being tested by naked fact; and accordingly display
without disguise the motives and purposes of the several persons engaged; and teach us from what sort of people to expect
favour, active kindness, and assistance, or the reverse. They
give us also many opportunities of distinguishing who would
be likely to pity us, feel indignation at our wrongs, and defend
our cause,&mdash;a power that contributes very greatly to national
as well as individual security. Neither the writer nor the
reader of history, therefore, should confine his attention to a
bare statement of facts: he must take into account all that
<pb n="193"/>
preceded, accompanied, or followed them. For if you take
from history all explanation of cause, principle, and motive,
and of the adaptation of the means to the end, what is left
is a mere panorama without being instructive; and, though
it may please for the moment, has no abiding value.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c32" type="chapter" n="32">
<head>This History is Not Difficult to Understand</head>
<p>Another mistake is to look upon my history as difficult
to obtain or master, because of the number and size of the
books. Compare it in these particulars with the various
writings of the episodical historians. Is it not much easier to
purchase and read my forty books, which are as it were all in
one piece, and so to follow with a comprehensive glance the
events in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> from the time of Pyrrhus to
the fall of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, and those in the rest of the world from
the flight of Cleomenes of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, continuously, to the battle
between the Achaeans and Romans at the Isthmus? To say
nothing of the fact that the compositions of these historians
are many times as numerous as mine, it is impossible for their
readers to get any certain information from them: first,
because most of them differ in their account of the same
transactions; and secondly, because they omit contemporary
history,&mdash;the comparative review of which would put a very
different complexion upon events to that derived from isolated
treatment,&mdash;and are unable to touch upon the most decisive
events at all. For, indeed, the most important parts of history
are those which treat the events which follow or accompany a certain course of conduct, and pre-eminently so those
which treat of causes. For instance, we see that the war with
Antiochus took its rise from that with Philip; that with Philip
from the Hannibalian; and the Hannibalian from the Sicilian
war: and though between these wars there were numerous
events of various character, they all converged upon the same
consummation. Such a comprehensive view may be obtained
from universal history, but not from the histories of particular

to their various cities, with the view of their being
prepared and vigorous for the next campaign.
Secondly, he instructed his brother Hasdrubal
in the management of his government in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>,
and of the preparations to be made against
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in case he himself should be separated from him.
Thirdly, he took precautions for the security of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, by
selecting with prudent skill certain soldiers from the home
army to come over to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, and certain from the Iberian
army to go to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>; by which interchange he secured cordial
feeling of confidence between the two armies. The Iberians
sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> were the Thersitae, the Mastiani, as well as
the Oretes and Olcades, mustering together twelve hundred
cavalry and thirteen thousand eight hundred and fifty foot.
Besides these there were eight hundred and seventy slingers
from the Balearic Isles, whose name, as that of the islands
they inhabit, is derived from the word <foreign lang="xgreek">ballein</foreign>, "to throw,"
because of their peculiar skill with the sling. Most of these
troops he ordered to be stationed at Metagonia in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, and
the rest in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> itself. And from the cities in the district
<pb n="195"/>
of Metagonia he sent four thousand foot also into <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, to
serve at once as hostages for the fidelity of their country, and as
an additional guard for the city. With his brother Hasdrubal
in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> he left fifty quinqueremes, two quadriremes, and five
triremes, thirty-two of the quinqueremes being furnished with
crews, and all five of the triremes; also cavalry consisting of
four hundred and fifty Libyophenicians and Libyans, three
hundred Lergetae, eighteen hundred Numidians of the Massolian, Massaesylian, Maccoeian, and Maurian tribes, who dwell
by the ocean; with eleven thousand eight hundred and fifty
Libyans, three hundred Ligures, five hundred of the Balearic
Islanders, and twenty-one elephants.</p>
<p>The accuracy of this enumeration of Hannibal's Iberian<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The inscription recording these facts.</note>
establishment need excite no surprise, though
it is such as a commander himself would have
some difficulty in displaying; nor ought I to
be condemned at once of imitating the specious falsehoods

<p>Though Hannibal had taken every precaution for the
security of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, he yet waited for the messengers
whom he expected to arrive from the Celts. He had thoroughly
acquainted himself with the fertility and populousness of the
districts at the foot of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> and in the valley of the
<placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, as well as with the warlike courage of the men;
but most important of all, with their hostile feelings to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
derived from the previous war, which I described in my last
book, with the express purpose of enabling my readers to
follow my narrative. He therefore reckoned very much on
the chance of their co-operation; and was careful to send
messages to the chiefs of the Celts, whether dwelling actually
on the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> or on the Italian side of them, with unlimited
promises; because he believed that he would be able to confine the war against <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, if he could make his way
through the intervening difficulties to these parts, and avail
<pb n="196"/>
himself of the active alliance of the Celts. When his messengers returned with a report that the Celts were ready to help
him and all eagerness for his approach; and that the passage
of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, though laborious and difficult, was not, however,
impossible, he collected his forces from their winter quarters
at the approach of spring. Just before receiving this report
he had learnt the circumstances attending the Roman embassy
at <placeName key="tgn,7016143">Carthage</placeName>. Encouraged by the assurance thus given him,
that he would be supported by the' popular sentiment at home,
he no longer disguised from his army that the object of the
forthcoming campaign was <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and tried to inspire them
with courage for the undertaking. He explained to them how
the Romans had demanded the surrender of himself and all
the officers of the army: and pointed out the fertility of the
country to which they were going, and the good-will and
active alliance which the Celts were prepared to offer them.
When the crowd of soldiers showed an enthusiastic readiness to accompany him, he dismissed the assembly, after
thanking them, and naming the day on which he intended
to march.</p></div2>

the appointed day arrived, Hannibal got his army
in motion, which consisted of ninety thousand
infantry and about twelve thousand cavalry.

the Ilurgetes and Bargusii, as well as the Aerenosii and Andosini, as far as the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName>. When he had reduced all this
country under his power, and taken certain towns by storm,
which he did with unexpected rapidity, though not without
severe fighting and serious loss; he left Hanno in chief command of all the district north of the Iber, and with absolute
authority over the Burgusii, who were the people that gave
him most uneasiness on account of their friendly feeling towards <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. He then detached from his army ten thousand
foot and a thousand horse for the service of Hanno,&mdash;to whom
also he entrusted the heavy baggage of the troops that were to
accompany himself,&mdash;and the same number to go to their own

land. The object of this last measure was twofold: he thereby
left a certain number of well-affected persons behind him; and
also held out to the others a hope of returning home, both to
those Iberians who were to accompany him on his march, and
to those also who for the present were to remain at home, so
that there might be a general alacrity to join him if he were
ever in want of a reinforcement. He then set his remaining
troops in motion unencumbered by heavy baggage, fifty thousand
infantry and nine thousand cavalry, and led them through
the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName> to the passage of the river <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>. The army
was not so much numerous, as highly efficient, and in an extraordinary state of physical training from their continuous
battles with the Iberians.</p></div2>

<head>Geography of Hannibal's March</head>
<p>But as a knowledge of topography is necessary for the
right understanding of my narrative, I must state
the places from which Hannibal started, through
which he marched, and into which he descended when he
arrived in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Nor must I, like some historians, content
myself with mentioning the mere names of places and rivers,
under the idea that that is quite sufficient to give a clear knowledge. My opinion is that, in the case of well-known places,
the mention of names is of great assistance; but that, in the
case of unknown countries, names are no better than unintelligible and unmeaning sounds: for the understanding
having nothing to go upon, and being unable by referring to
something known to translate the words into thought, the narrative becomes confused and vague, and conveys no clear idea.
A plan therefore must be discovered, whereby it shall be
possible, while speaking of unknown countries, to convey real
and intelligible notions.</p>
<p>The first, most important, and most general conception is
that of the division of the heaven into four quarters, which all
of us that are capable of a general idea at all know as east,
west, south, and north. The next is to arrange the several
parts of the globe according to these points, and always
to refer in thought any place mentioned to one or other
of them. We shall thus get an intelligible and familiar
conception of places which we do not know or have never
seen.

<head>Three Geographic Divisions of the World</head>
<p>This principle established as universally applicable to

the world, the next point will be to make the

And note on <ref target="b12c25" targOrder="U">12, 25</ref>.</note> The boundaries are
respectively the Don, the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>, and the Straits of the Pillars of
Hercules. <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> lies between the Don and the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>, and lies
under that portion of the heaven which is between the northeast and the south. <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> lies between the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> and the Pillars
of Hercules, and falls beneath the south portion of the heaven,
extending to the south-west without a break, till it reaches the
point of the equinoctial sunset, which corresponds with the
Pillars of Hercules. These two divisions of the earth, therefore, regarded in a general point of view, occupy all that part
which is south of the Mediterranean from east to west.
<placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> with respect to both of these lies to the north facing
them, and extending continuously from east to west. Its most
important and extensive part lies under the northern sky
between the river Don and the <placeName key="tgn,7008368">Narbo</placeName>, which is only a short
distance west of <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> and the mouths by which the <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>
discharges itself into the Sardinian Sea. From Narbo is the
district occupied by the Celts as far as the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName>, stretching
continuously from the Mediterranean to the Mare Externum.
The rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> south of the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName>, to the point where
it approaches the Pillars of Hercules, is bounded on one side
by the Mediterranean, on the other by the Mare Externum:
and that part of it which is washed by the Mediterranean as
far as the Pillars of Hercules is called <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, while the part
which lies along the Outer or Great Sea has no general name,
because it has but recently been discovered, and is inhabited
entirely by barbarous tribes, who are very numerous, and of
whom I will speak in more detail hereafter.</p></div2>

<p>My object in these observations was to prevent my narrative being entirely vague to those who were unacquainted
with the localities. I hoped that, by keeping these broad
distinctions in mind, they would have some definite standard
to which to refer every mention of a place, starting from the
primary one of the division of the sky into four quarters. For,
as in the case of physical sight, we instinctively turn our faces to
any object pointed at; so in the case of the mind, our thoughts
ought to turn naturally to localities as they are mentioned

of his neighbour, and to have the means of crossing in his own
hands. But now a large multitude of barbarians collected on
the other side of the stream to hinder the passage of the Carthaginians. When Hannibal saw them, he came to the conclusion
<pb n="203"/>  that it would be impossible either to force a passage in
the face of so large a body of the enemy, or to remain where
he was, for fear of being attacked on all sides at once: and
he accordingly, on the third night, sent forward a detachment
of his army with native guides, under the command of Hanno,
the son of the Suffete<note anchored="yes">See on <ref target="b3c33" targOrder="U">ch. 33</ref>, note 2.</note> Bomilcar.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A detachment crosses higher up the river.</note> This force
marched up stream along the bank for two
hundred stades, until they arrived at a certain spot where the stream is divided by an eyot, and there
halted. They found enough wood close at hand to enable
them, by nailing or tying it together, to construct within a
short time a large number of rafts good enough for temporary
use; and on these they crossed in safety, without any one trying
to stop them. Then, seizing upon a strong position, they kept
quiet for the rest of the day: partly to refresh themselves after
their fatigues, and at the same time to complete their preparations for the service awaiting them, as they had been ordered
to do. Hannibal was preparing to proceed much in the
same way with the forces left behind with himself; but his
chief difficulty was in getting the elephants across, of which he
had thirty-seven.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c43" type="chapter" n="43">
<head>Hannibal's Troops Begin to Cross</head>
<p>When the fifth night came, however, the division
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The crossing begun.</note>
which had crossed first started before daybreak to march down the opposite bank of
the river and attack the barbarians; while
Hannibal, having his men in readiness, began to attempt the
passage of the river. He had filled the wherries with the heavy-armed cavalry, and the canoes with the most active of his foot;
and he now arranged that the wherries should cross higher up
the stream, and the canoes below them, that the violence of
the current might be broken by the former, and the canoes
cross more safely. The plan for the horses was that they
should swim at the stern of the wherries, one man on each
side of the stern guiding three or four with leading reins: so
that a considerable number of horses were brought over at
once with the first detachment. When they saw what the
enemy meant to do, the barbarians, without forming their
ranks, poured out of their entrenchments in scattered groups,
<pb n="204"/>
feeling no doubt of being able to stop the crossing of the
Carthaginians with ease. As soon as Hannibal saw by the
smoke, which was the signal agreed upon, that the advanced
detachment on the other side was approaching, he ordered
all to go on board, and the men in charge of the transports to
push out against the stream. This was promptly done: and
then began a most anxious and exciting scene. Cheer after
cheer rose from the men who were working the boats, as they
struggled to outstrip each other, and exerted themselves to the
utmost to overcome the force of the current. On the edge of
either bank stood the two armies: the one sharing in the struggles
of their comrades by sympathy, and shouting encouragement
to them as they went; while the barbarians in front of them
yelled their war-cries and challenged them to battle. While
this was going on the barbarians had abandoned their tents,
which the Carthaginians on that side of the river suddenly
and unexpectedly seized. Some of them proceeded to set fire
to the camp, while the greater number went to attack the men
who were standing ready to resist the passage. Surprised by
this unlooked for event, some of the barbarians rushed off to
save their tents, while others prepared to resist the attack of
the enemy, and were now actually engaged. Seeing that
everything was going as he had intended, Hannibal at once
formed the first division as it disembarked: and after addressing
some encouraging words to it, closed with the barbarians, who,
having no time to form their ranks, and being taken by surprise, were quickly repulsed and put to flight.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c44" type="chapter" n="44">
<head>Hannibal Addresses His Men</head>
<p>Being thus master of the passage of the river, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The crossing completed.</note>
victorious over those who opposed him, the
first care of the Carthaginian leader was
to bring his whole army across. This being expeditiously
accomplished, he pitched his camp for that night by the
river-side, and on the morrow, when he was told that the
Roman fleet was anchored off the mouths of the river,
he detached five hundred Numidian horsemen to reconnoitre
the enemy and find out their position, their numbers, and what
they were going to do; and at the same time selected suitable
men to manage the passage of the elephants. These arrangements made, he summoned a meeting of his army and introduced
<pb n="205"/>  Magilus and the other chiefs who had come to him
from the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, and caused them to
declare to the whole army, by means of an interpreter, the resolutions passed by their tribes. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Message from friendly Gauls.</note>
The points which were the strongest encouragement to the army
were, first, the actual appearance of envoys inviting them to come,
and promising to take part in the war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; secondly,
the confidence inspired by their promise of guiding them by a
route where they would be abundantly supplied with necessaries,
and which would lead them with speed and safety into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>;
and lastly, the fertility and vast extent of the country to which
they were going, and the friendly feelings of the men with whose
assistance they were about to fight the armies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>
<p>Such was the substance of the speeches of the Celts.
When they had withdrawn, Hannibal himself rose, and after
reminding the soldiers of what they had already achieved,
and pointing out that, though they had under his counsel and
advice engaged in many perilous and dangerous enterprises,
they had never failed in one, he bade them "not lose
courage now that the most serious part of their undertaking
was accomplished. The <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName> was crossed: they had seen
with their own eyes the display of goodwill and zeal of their
allies. Let this convince them that they should leave the rest
to him with confidence; and while obeying his orders show
themselves men of courage and worthy of their former deeds."
These words being received with shouts of approval, and other
manifestations of great enthusiasm, on the part of the soldiers,
Hannibal dismissed the assembly with words of praise to the
men and a prayer to the gods on their behalf; after giving
out an order that they should refresh themselves, and make
all their preparations with despatch, as the advance must
begin on the morrow.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c45" type="chapter" n="45">
<head>Skirmish between Reconnoitring Parties</head>
<p>When the assembly had been dismissed, the reconnoitring party of Numidians
returned in headlong flight, after losing more than half their
numbers. Not far from the camp they had
fallen in with a party of Roman horse, who had been
sent out by Publius on the same errand; and an engagement
took place with such fury on either side, that the Romans and
<pb n="206"/>
Celts lost a hundred and forty men, and the Numidians more
than two hundred. After this skirmish, the Romans pursued
them up to the Carthaginian entrenchments: and having surveyed it, they hastened back to announce to the Consul the
presence of the enemy. As soon as they arrived at the Roman
camp with this intelligence, Publius put his baggage on board
ship, and marched his men up the bank of the river, with the
earnest desire of forcing the enemy to give him battle.</p>
<p>But at sunrise on the day after the assembly, Hannibal
having stationed his whole cavalry on the rear, in the direction
of the sea, so as to cover the advance, ordered his infantry to
leave the entrenchment and begin their march; while he himself waited behind for the elephants, and the men who had not
yet crossed the river.</p></div2>

<head><placeName key="tgn,7013429">The Crossing</placeName> of the Elephants</head>
<p>The mode of getting the elephants across was as
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The passage of the elephants.</note>
follows. They made a number of rafts
strongly compacted, which they lashed firmly
two and two together, so as to form combined
a breadth of about fifty feet, and brought them close under
the bank at the place of crossing. To the outer edge of
these they lashed some others and made them join exactly;
so that the whole raft thus constructed stretched out some
way into the channel, while the edges towards the stream were
made fast to the land with ropes tied to trees which grew along
the brink, to secure the raft keeping its place and not drifting down the river. These combined rafts stretching about
two hundred feet across the stream, they joined two other very
large ones to the outer edges, fastened very firmly together, but
connected with the others by ropes which admitted of being
easily cut. To these they fastened several towing lines, that
the wherries might prevent the rafts drifting down stream, and
might drag them forcibly against the current and so get the
elephants across on them. Then they threw a great deal of
earth upon all the rafts, until they had raised the surface to the
level of the bank, and made it look like the path on the land
leading down to the passage. The elephants were accustomed
to obey their Indian riders until they came to water, but could
never be induced to step into water: they therefore led them
upon this earth, putting two females in front whom the others
<pb n="207"/>
obediently followed. When they had set foot on the rafts
that were farthest out in the stream, the ropes were cut which
fastened these to the other rafts, the towing lines were pulled
taut by the wherries, and the elephants, with the rafts on
which they stood, were quickly towed away from the mound of
earth. When this happened, the animals were terror-stricken;
and at first turned round and round, and rushed first to one
part of the raft and then to another, but finding themselves
completely surrounded by the water, they were too frightened
to do anything, and were obliged to stay where they were.
And it was by repeating this contrivance of joining a pair of
rafts to the others, that eventually the greater part of the
elephants were got across. Some of them, however, in the
middle of the crossing, threw themselves in their terror into
the river: but though their Indian riders were drowned, the
animals themselves got safe to land, saved by the strength and
great length of their probosces; for by raising these above the
water, they were enabled to breathe through them, and blow out
any water that got into them, while for the most part they got
through the river on their feet.</p></div2>

<p>The elephants having been thus got across, Hannibal

<p>The <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName> rises to the north-west of the Adriatic Gulf on

It indicates indeed a strangely defective conception of distance; as his idea, of

eventually discharges itself into the Sardinian Sea. It flows for the
most part through a deep valley, to the north of which lives the
Celtic tribe of the Ardyes; while its southern side is entirely
walled in by the northern slopes of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, the ridges of

the Adriatic, separate it from the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,2122081">Padus</placeName>, of which
I have already had occasion to speak at length. It was these
mountains that Hannibal now crossed from the Rhone valley
into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.</p>
<p>Some historians of this passage of the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName>, in their desire
<pb n="208"/>
to produce a striking effect by their descriptions of the wonders
of this country, have fallen into two errors which are more
alien than anything else to the spirit of history,&mdash;perversion of
fact and inconsistency. Introducing Hannibal as a prodigy of
strategic skill and boldness, they yet represent him as acting
with the most conspicuous indiscretion; and then, finding
themselves involved in an inextricable maze of falsehood, they
try to cut the knot by the introduction of gods and heroes
into what is meant to be genuine history. They begin by
saying that the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName> are so precipitous and inaccessible that, so
far from horses and troops, accompanied too by elephants,
being able to cross them, it would be very difficult for even
active men on foot to do so: and similarly they tell us that
the desolation of this district is so complete, that, had not some
god or hero met Hannibal's forces and showed them the way,
they would have been hopelessly lost and perished to a man.</p>
<p>Such stories involve both the errors I have mentioned,&mdash;
they are both false and inconsistent.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c48" type="chapter" n="48">
<head>Absurd Premises of Other Historians</head>
<p>For could a more irrational proceeding on the part of a
general be imagined than that of Hannibal, if, when in command of so numerous an army, on whom the success of his
expedition entirely depended, he allowed himself to remain in
ignorance of the roads, the lie of the country, the route to be
taken, and the people to which it led, and above all as to the
practicability of what he was undertaking to do? They, in
fact, represent Hannibal, when at the height of his expectation
of success, doing what those would hardly do who have utterly
failed and have been reduced to despair,&mdash;that is, to entrust
themselves and their forces to an unknown country. And so,
too, what they say about the desolation of the district, and its
precipitous and inaccessible character, only serves to bring their
untrustworthiness into clearer light. For first, they pass over
the fact that the Celts of the Rhone valley had on several
occasions before Hannibal came, and that in very recent times,
crossed the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName> with large forces, and fought battles with the
Romans in alliance with the Celts of the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,2122081">Padus</placeName>, as
I have already stated. And secondly, they are unaware of the
fact that a very numerous tribe of people inhabit the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName>.
Accordingly in their ignorance of these facts they take refuge
<pb n="209"/>
in the assertion that a hero showed Hannibal the way. They
are, in fact, in the same case as tragedians, who, beginning
with an improbable and impossible plot, are obliged to bring
in a <foreign lang="la">deus ex machina</foreign> to solve the difficulty and end the play.
The absurd premises of these historians naturally require some
such supernatural agency to help them out of the difficulty:
an absurd beginning could only have an absurd ending. For
of course Hannibal did not act as these writers say he did;
but, on the contrary, conducted his plans with the utmost prudence. He had thoroughly informed himself of the fertility of
the country into which he designed to descend, and of the
hostile feelings of its inhabitants towards <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>; and for his
journey through the difficult district which intervened he
employed native guides and pioneers, whose interests were
bound up with his own. I speak with confidence on these
points, because I have questioned persons actually engaged on
the facts; and have inspected the country, and gone over the
Alpine pass myself, in order to inform myself of the truth and
see with my own eyes.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c49" type="chapter" n="49">
<head>Scipio Is Too Late To Stop Hannibal</head>
<p>Three days after Hannibal had resumed his march, the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio finds that Hannibal has escaped him.</note>
Consul Publius arrived at the passage of the
river. He was in the highest degree astonished
to find the enemy gone: for he had persuaded
himself that they would never venture to take this route into
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, on account of the numbers and fickleness of the barbarians who inhabited the country. But seeing that they had
done so, he hurried back to his ships and at once embarked
his forces. He then despatched his brother Gnaeus to conduct
the campaign in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, while he himself turned back again
to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by sea, being anxious to anticipate the enemy by
marching through Etruria to the foot of the pass of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after four days' march from the passage of the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's march to the foot of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>.</note>
<placeName key="tgn,2616224">Rhone</placeName>, Hannibal arrived at the place called
the Island, a district thickly inhabited and
exceedingly productive of corn. Its name is
derived from its natural features: for the <placeName key="tgn,2616224">Rhone</placeName> and Isara
flowing on either side of it make the apex of a triangle where
they meet, very nearly of the same size and shape as the delta
of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>, except that the base of the latter is formed by the
<pb n="210"/>
sea into which its various streams are discharged, while in the
case of the former this base is formed by mountains difficult
to approach or climb, and, so to speak, almost inaccessible.
When Hannibal arrived in this district he found two brothers
engaged in a dispute for the royal power, and confronting each
other with their armies. The elder sought his alliance and
invited his assistance in gaining the crown: and the advantage which such a circumstance might prove to him at that
juncture of his affairs being manifest, he consented; and
having joined him in his attack upon his brother, and aided in
expelling him, he obtained valuable support from the victorious
chieftain. For this prince not only liberally supplied his army
with provisions, but exchanged all their old and damaged
weapons for new ones, and thus at a very opportune time
thoroughly restored the efficiency of the troops: he also gave
most of the men new clothes and boots, which proved of great
advantage during their passage of the mountains. But his
most essential service was that, the Carthaginians being greatly
alarmed at the prospect of marching through the territory of
the Allobroges, he acted with his army as their rearguard, and
secured them a safe passage as far as the foot of the pass.</p></div2>

<head>Hannibal Harassed By the Natives</head>
<p>Having in ten days' march accomplished a distance

which Hannibal crossed the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName>. The reader will find an admirably clear

in favour of each, in the notes to Mr. W. T. Arnold's edition of Dr. Arnold's
<title>History of the Second Punic War,</title> pp. 362-373.</note> and
immediately found himself involved in the most serious
dangers. For as long as the Carthaginians were on the
plains, the various chiefs of the Allobroges refrained from
attacking them from fear of their cavalry, as well as of the
Gauls who were escorting them. But when these last departed
back again to their own lands, and Hannibal began to enter the
mountainous region, the chiefs of the Allobroges collected
large numbers of their tribe and occupied the points of vantage
in advance, on the route by which Hannibal's troops were
constrained to make their ascent. If they had only kept their
design secret, the Carthaginian army would have been entirely
<pb n="211"/>
destroyed: as it was, their plans became known, and though
they did much damage to Hannibal's army, they suffered as
much themselves. For when that general learnt that the
natives were occupying the points of vantage, he halted and
pitched his camp at the foot of the pass, and sent forward
some of his Gallic guides to reconnoitre the enemy and discover their plan of operations. The order was obeyed: and
he ascertained that it was the enemy's practice to keep under
arms, and guard these posts carefully, during the day, but at
night to retire to some town in the neighbourhood. Hannibal
accordingly adapted his measures to this strategy of the enemy.
He marched forward in broad daylight, and as soon as he
came to the mountainous part of the road, pitched his camp
only a little way from the enemy. At nightfall he gave orders
for the watch-fires to be lit; and leaving the main body of his
troops in the camp, and selecting the most suitable of his men,
he had them armed lightly, and led them through the narrow
parts of the road during the night, and seized on the spots
which had been previously occupied by the enemy: they having,
according to their regular custom, abandoned them for the
nearest town.</p></div2>

<head>The Gauls Attack the Baggage Train</head>
<p>When day broke the natives saw what had taken place,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Gauls harass the army.</note>
and at first desisted from their attempts;
but presently the sight of the immense string
of beasts of burden, and of the cavalry, slowly
and painfully making the ascent, tempted them to attack
the advancing line. Accordingly they fell upon it at many
points at once; and the Carthaginians sustained severe
losses, not so much at the hands of the enemy, as from the
dangerous nature of the ground, which proved especially fatal
to the horses and beasts of burden. For as the ascent was
not only narrow and rough, but flanked also with precipices,
at every movement which tended to throw the line into disorder, large numbers of the beasts of burden were hurled down
the precipices with their loads on their backs. And what
added more than anything else to this sort of confusion were
the wounded horses; for, maddened by their wounds, they
either turned round and ran into the advancing beasts of
burden, or, rushing furiously forward, dashed aside everything
<pb n="212"/>
that came in their way on the narrow path, and so threw the
whole line into disorder. Hannibal saw what was taking
place, and knowing that, even if they escaped this attack, they
could never survive the loss of all their baggage, he took with
him the men who had seized the strongholds during the night
and went to the relief of the advancing line. Having the
advantage of charging the enemy from the higher ground he
inflicted a severe loss upon them, but suffered also as severe
a one in his own army; for the commotion in the line now
grew worse, and in both directions at once&mdash;thanks to the
shouting and struggling of these combatants: and it was not
until he had killed the greater number of the Allobroges, and
forced the rest to fly to their own land, that the remainder of
the beasts of burden and the horses got slowly, and with difficulty, over the dangerous ground. Hannibal himself rallied
as many as he could after the fight, and assaulted the town
from which the enemy had sallied; and finding it almost
deserted, because its inhabitants had been all tempted out
by the hope of booty, he got possession of it: from which he
obtained many advantages for the future as well as for the
present. The immediate gain consisted of a large number of
horses and beasts of burden, and men taken with them; and
for future use he got a supply of corn and cattle sufficient for
two or three days: but the most important result of all was the
terror inspired in the next tribes, which prevented any one of
those who lived near the ascent from lightly venturing to meddle
with him again.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c52" type="chapter" n="52">
<head>Treachery of the Gauls</head>
<p>Here he pitched a camp and remained a day, and
started again. For the next three days
he accomplished a certain amount of his
journey without accident. But on the fourth
he again found himself in serious danger. For the dwellers
along his route, having concerted a plan of treachery, met
him with branches and garlands, which among nearly all
the natives are signs of friendship, as the herald's staff is
among the Greeks. Hannibal was cautious about accepting
such assurances, and took great pains to discover what their
real intention and purpose were. The Gauls however professed
to be fully aware of the capture of the town, and the destruction
<pb n="213"/>
of those who had attempted to do him wrong; and explained
that those events had induced them to come, because they
wished neither to inflict nor receive any damage; and finally
promised to give him hostages. For a long while Hannibal
hesitated and refused to trust their speeches. But at length
coming to the conclusion that, if he accepted what was offered,
he would perhaps render the men before him less mischievous
and implacable; but that, if he rejected them, he must expect
undisguised hostility from them, he acceded to their request,
and feigned to accept their offer of friendship. The barbarians handed over the hostages, supplied him liberally with
cattle, and in fact put themselves unreservedly into his hands;
so that for a time Hannibal's suspicions were allayed, and he
employed them as guides for the next difficulty that had to be
passed. They guided the army for two days: and then these
tribes collected their numbers, and keeping close up with the
a certain difficult and precipitous gorge.</p></div2>

<head>The White Rock</head>
<p>Hannibal's army would now have certainly been utterly
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Severe losses.</note>
destroyed, had it not been for the fact that his
fears were still on the alert, and that, having a
prescience of what was to come, he had placed his baggage and
cavalry in the van and his hoplites in the rear. These latter
covered his line, and were able to stem the attack of the enemy,
and accordingly the disaster was less than it would otherwise
have been. As it was, however, a large number of beasts of
burden and horses perished; for the advantage of the higher
ground being with the enemy, the Gauls moved along the
slopes parallel with the army below, and by rolling down
boulders, or throwing stones, reduced the troops to a state of
the utmost confusion and danger; so that Hannibal with half
his force was obliged to pass the night near a certain white
rock,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">peri/ ti leuko/petron,</foreign> which, however, perhaps only means "bare rock,"

which afforded them protection, separated from his horses and
baggage which he was covering; until after a whole night's
struggle they slowly and with difficulty emerged from the gorge.</p>
<p>Next morning the enemy had disappeared: and Hannibal,
having effected a junction with his cavalry and baggage, led
<pb n="214"/>
his men towards the head of the pass, without falling in
again with any important muster of the natives,
though he was harassed by some of them
from time to time; who seized favourable
opportunities, now on his van and now on his rear, of
carrying off some of his baggage. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Arrives at the summit.</note> His best protection
was his elephants; on whatever parts of the line they
were placed the enemy never ventured to approach, being
terrified at the unwonted appearance of the animals. The
ninth day's march brought him to the head of the pass:
and there he encamped for two days, partly to rest his men
and partly to allow stragglers to come up. Whilst they were
there, many of the horses who had taken fright and run away,
and many of the beasts of burden that had got rid of their
loads, unexpectedly appeared: they had followed the tracks of

<p>But by this time, it being nearly the period of the

to be thick on the heights; and seeing his men
in low spirits, owing both to the fatigue they had gone through,
and that which still lay before them, Hannibal called them
together and tried to cheer them by dwelling on the one possible
topic of consolation in his power, namely the view of Italy:
which lay stretched out in both directions below those mountains, giving the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName> the appearance of a citadel to the whole

met with any enemies, except some few secret
pillagers; but from the dangerous ground and
the snow he lost almost as many men as on the
ascent. For the path down was narrow and precipitous, and the snow made it impossible for the men to
see where they were treading, while to step aside from the
path, or to stumble, meant being hurled down the precipices.
The troops however bore up against the fatigue, having now
<pb n="215"/>
grown accustomed to such hardships; but when they came to
a place where the path was too narrow for the elephants or
beasts of burden to pass,&mdash;and which, narrowed before by
landslips extending about a stade and a half, had recently
been made more so by another landslip,&mdash;then once more
despondency and consternation fell upon the troops. Hannibal's first idea was to avoid this <foreign lang="fr">mauvais pas</foreign> by a detour, but
this route too being made impossible by a snow-storm, he
abandoned the idea.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c55" type="chapter" n="55">
<head>Snow</head>
<p>The effect of the storm was peculiar and extraordinary. For the present fall of snow coming
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A break in the road.</note>
upon the top of that which was there before,
and had remained from the last winter, it was
found that the former, being fresh, was soft and offered no
resistance to the foot; but when the feet reached the lower
frozen snow, they could no longer make any impression upon
it, but the men found both their feet slipping from under
them, as though they were on hard ground with a layer
of mud on the top. And a still more serious difficulty
followed: for not being able to get a foothold on the lower
snow, when they fell and tried to get themselves up by their
hands and knees, the men found themselves plunging downwards quicker and quicker, along with everything they laid hold
of, the ground being a very steep decline. The beasts, however, when they fell did break through this lower snow as they
struggled to rise, and having done so were obliged to remain
there with their loads, as though they were frozen to it, both
from the weight of these loads and the hardness of the old snow.
Giving up, therefore, all hope of making this detour, he encamped upon the ridge after clearing away the snow upon it.
He then set large parties of his men to work, and, with infinite
toil, began constructing a road on the face of the precipice.
One day's work sufficed to make a path practicable for beasts
of burden and horses; and he accordingly took them across
at once, and having pitched his camp at a spot below the snow
line, he let them go in search of pasture; while he told off the
Numidians in detachments to proceed with the making of the
road; and after three days' difficult and painful labour he got
his elephants across, though in a miserable condition from
<pb n="216"/>
hunger. For the tops of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, and the parts immediately
below them, are completely treeless and bare of vegetation,
because the snow lies there summer and winter; but about
half-way down the slopes on both sides they produce trees and
shrubs, and are, in fact, fit for human habitation.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c56" type="chapter" n="56">
<head>Hannibal Reaches the Plains</head>
<p>So Hannibal mustered his forces and continued the
descent; and on the third day after passing
the precipitous path just described he reached
the plains. From the beginning of his march
he had lost many men by the hands of the enemy, and
in crossing rivers, and many more on the precipices and
dangerous passes of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>; and not only men in this
last way, but horses and beasts of burden in still greater
numbers. The whole march from <placeName key="tgn,7014631">New Carthage</placeName> had occupied
five months, the actual passage of the <placeName key="tgn,2110311">Alps</placeName> fifteen days; and he
now boldly entered the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,2122081">Padus</placeName>, and the territory of
the Insubres, with such of his army as survived, consisting of
twelve thousand Libyans and eight thousand Iberians, and
not more than six thousand cavalry in all, as he himself
distinctly states on the column erected on the promontory of
Lacinium to record the numbers.</p>
<p>At the same time, as I have before stated, Publius having left
his legions under the command of his brother Gnaeus, with
orders to prosecute the Iberian campaign and offer an energetic
resistance to Hasdrubal, landed at <placeName key="tgn,7006082">Pisae</placeName> with a small body of
men. Thence he marched through Etruria, and taking over
the army of the Praetors which was guarding the country against
the Boii, he arrived in the valley of the Padus; and, pitching
his camp there, waited for the enemy with an eager desire to
give him battle.</p></div2>

<head>The Limits of History</head>
<p>Having thus brought the generals of the two nations
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Digression on the limits of history.</note>
and the war itself into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, before beginning
the campaign, I wish to say a few words about
what I conceive to be germane or not to
my history.</p>
<p>I can conceive some readers complaining that, while
devoting a great deal of space to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, I have said
little or nothing about the strait of the Pillars of Hercules, the
Mare Externum, or the <placeName key="tgn,1009896">British Isles</placeName>, and the manufacture of
<pb n="217"/>
tin in them, or even of the silver and gold mines in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> itself,
of which historians give long and contradictory accounts. It was
not, let me say, because I thought these subjects out of place in
history that I passed them over; but because, in the first place,
I did not wish to be diffuse, or distract the attention of students
from the main current of my narrative; and, in the next place,
because I was determined not to treat of them in scattered
notices or casual allusions, but to assign them a distinct time
and place, and at these, to the best of my ability, to give a trustworthy account of them. On the same principle I must
deprecate any feeling of surprise if, in the succeeding portions
of my history, I pass over other similar topics, which might
seem naturally in place, for the same reasons. Those who ask
for dissertations in history on every possible subject, are somewhat like greedy guests at a banquet, who, by tasting every
dish on the table, fail to really enjoy any one of them at the
time, or to digest and feel any benefit from them afterwards.
Such omnivorous readers get no real pleasure in the present,
and no adequate instruction for the future.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c58" type="chapter" n="58">
<head>Necessity of Refuting Past Errors</head>
<p>There can be no clearer proof, than is afforded by these
particular instances, that this department of historical writing
stands above all others in need of study and correction. For
as all, or at least the greater number of writers, have endeavoured
to describe the peculiar features and positions of the countries
on the confines of the known world, and in doing so have,
in most cases, made egregious mistakes, it is impossible to
pass over their errors without some attempt at refutation; and
that not in scattered observations or casual remarks, but
deliberately and formally. But such confutation should not
take the form of accusation or invective. While correcting
their mistakes we should praise the writers, feeling sure that,
had they lived to the present age, they would have altered and
corrected many of their statements. The fact is that, in past
ages, we know of very few Greeks who undertook to investigate
these remote regions, owing to the insuperable difficulties of the
attempt. The dangers at sea were then more than can easily be
calculated, and those on land more numerous still. And even
if one did reach these countries on the confines of the world,
whether compulsorily or voluntarily, the difficulties in the way
<pb n="218"/>
of a personal inspection were only begun: for some of the
regions were utterly barbarous, others uninhabited; and a still
greater obstacle in way of gaining information as to what he
saw was his ignorance of the language of the country. And
even if he learnt this, a still greater difficulty was to preserve
a strict moderation in his account of what he had seen, and
despising all attempts to glorify himself by traveller's tales of
wonder, to report for our benefit the truth and nothing but the
truth.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c59" type="chapter" n="59">
<head>Recent Advances in Geography</head>
<p>All these impediments made a true account of these
regions in past times difficult, if not impossible. Nor ought we
to criticise severely the omissions or mistakes of these writers:
rather they deserve our praise and admiration for having in
such an age gained information as to these places, which
distinctly advanced knowledge. In our own age, however,
the Asiatic districts have been opened up both by sea and
land owing to the empire of Alexander, and the other places
owing to the supremacy of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Men too of practical
experience in affairs, being released from the cares of martial or
political ambition, have thereby had excellent opportunities for
research and inquiry into these localities; and therefore it will
be but right for us to have a better and truer knowledge of
what was formerly unknown. And this I shall endeavour to
establish, when I find a fitting opportunity in the course of my
history. I shall be especially anxious to give the curious a
full knowledge on these points, because it was with that express
object that I confronted the dangers and fatigues of my travels
in <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, as well as of the sea which washes
the western coasts of these countries; that I might correct the
imperfect knowledge of former writers, and make the Greeks

<p>After arriving in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with the number of troops
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Rest and recovery.</note>
which I have already stated, Hannibal pitched
his camp at the very foot of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, and
was occupied, to begin with, in refreshing his men. For
not only had his whole army suffered terribly from the
difficulties of transit in the ascent, and still more in the
<pb n="219"/>
descent of the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, but it was also in evil case from the
shortness of provisions, and the inevitable neglect of all
proper attention to physical necessities. Many had quite
abandoned all care for their health under the influence of
starvation and continuous fatigue; for it had proved impossible
to carry a full supply of food for so many thousands over such
mountains, and what they did bring was in great part lost along
with the beasts that carried it. So that whereas, when
Hannibal crossed the Rhone, he had thirty-eight thousand
infantry, and more than eight thousand cavalry, he lost nearly
half in the pass, as I have shown above; while the survivors
had by these long continued sufferings become almost savage
in look and general appearance. Hannibal therefore bent his
whole energies to the restoration of the spirits and bodies of
his men, and of their horses also.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Taking of <placeName key="tgn,7005688">Turin</placeName>.</note> When his army had thus
sufficiently recovered, finding the Taurini, who

the Insubres and inclined to be suspicious of the Carthaginians, Hannibal first invited them to terms of friendship
and alliance; and, on their refusal, invested their chief city
and carried it after a three days' siege. Having put to the
sword all who had opposed him, he struck such terror into the
minds of the neighbouring tribes, that they all gave in their
submission out of hand. The other Celts inhabiting these
plains were also eager to join the Carthaginians, according to
their original purpose; but the Roman legions had by this time
advanced too far, and had intercepted the greater part of them:
they were therefore unable to stir, and in some cases were even
obliged to serve in the Roman ranks. This determined
Hannibal not to delay his advance any longer, but to strike
some blow which might encourage those natives who were
desirous of sharing his enterprise.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c61" type="chapter" n="61">
<head>Approach of Scipio</head>
<p>When he heard, while engaged on this design, that Publius
had already crossed the Padus with his army,
and was at no great distance, he was at first inclined to disbelieve the fact, reflecting that it was
not many days since he had left him near the passage of the
<placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>, and that the voyage from <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> to Etruria was a
long and difficult one. He was told, moreover, that from the
<pb n="220"/>
<placeName key="tgn,1112319">Tyrrhenian Sea</placeName> to the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> through Italian soil was a long
march, without good military roads. But when messenger after
messenger confirmed the intelligence with increased positiveness, he was filled with amazement and admiration at the
Consul's plan of campaign, and promptness in carrying it out.
The feelings of Publius were much the same: for he had not
expected that Hannibal would even attempt the passage of the
<placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> with forces of different races, or, if he did attempt it,
that he could escape utter destruction. Entertaining such ideas
he was immensely astonished at his courage and adventurous
daring, when he heard that he had not only got safe across,
but was actually besieging certain towns in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Similar
feelings were entertained at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> when the news arrived
there. For scarcely had the last rumour about the taking of
<placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> by the Carthaginians ceased to attract attention, and
scarcely had the measures adopted in view of that event been
taken,&mdash;namely the despatch of one Consul to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> to besiege
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, and of the other to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> to meet Hannibal there,&mdash;
than news came that Hannibal had arrived in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with his
army, and was already besieging certain towns in it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Tiberius Sempronius recalled.</note> Thrown

<div2 id="b3c62" type="chapter" n="62">
<head>Gallic Prisoners</head>
<p>The two armies being now within a short distance of
each other, Hannibal and Publius both thought
it necessary to address their men in terms
suitable to the occasion.
<pb n="221"/></p>
<p>The manner in which Hannibal tried to encourage his army
was this. He mustered the men, and caused some youthful prisoners whom he had caught when they were attempting to hinder his march on the Alpine passes, to be brought
forward. They had been subjected to great severities
with this very object, loaded with heavy chains, half-starved,
and their bodies a mass of bruises from scourging. Hannibal caused these men to be placed in the middle of the
army, and some suits of Gallic armour, such as are worn by
their kings when they fight in single combat, to be exhibited;
in addition to these he placed there some horses, and brought
in some valuable military cloaks. He then asked these young
prisoners, which of them were willing to fight with each other
on condition of the conqueror taking these prizes, and the
vanquished escaping all his present miseries by death. Upon
their all answering with a loud shout that they were desirous
of fighting in these single combats, he bade them draw lots;
and the pair, on whom the first lot fell, to put on the armour
and fight with each other. As soon as the young men heard
these orders, they lifted up their hands, and each prayed the
gods that he might be one of those to draw the lot. And
when the lots were drawn, those on whom they fell were overjoyed, and the others in despair. When the fight was finished,
too, the surviving captives congratulated the one who had
fallen no less than the victor, as having been freed from many
terrible sufferings, while they themselves still remained to endure them. And in this feeling the Carthaginian soldiers were
much disposed to join, all pitying the survivors and congratulating the fallen champion.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c63" type="chapter" n="63">
<head>Harangues of Hannibal and Scipio</head>
<p>Having by this example made the impression he desired upon the minds of his troops, Hannibal
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's speech.</note>
then came forward himself and said, "that he
had exhibited these captives in order that they
might see in the person of others a vivid representation of
what they had to expect themselves, and might so lay their plans
all the better in view of the actual state of affairs. Fortune
had summoned them to a life and death contest very like that
of the two captives, and in which the prize of victory was the
same. For they must either conquer, or die, or fall alive into
<pb n="222"/>
the hands of their enemies; and the prize of victory would not
be mere horses and military cloaks, but the most enviable position in the world if they became masters of the wealth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>:
or if they fell in battle their reward would be to end their
life fighting to their last breath for the noblest object, in the
heat of the struggle, and with no sense of pain; while if they
were beaten, or from desire of life were base enough to fly, or
tried to prolong that life by any means except victory, every
sort of misery and misfortune would be their lot: for it was
impossible that any one of them could be so irrational or
senseless, when he remembered the length of the journey he
had performed from his native land, and the number of
enemies that lay between him and it, and the size of the
rivers he had crossed, as to cherish the hope of being able
to reach his home by flight. They should therefore cast away
such vain hopes, and regard their position as being exactly
that of the combatants whom they had but now been watching.
For, as in their case, all congratulated the dead as much as the
victor, and commiserated the survivors; so they should think
of the alternatives before themselves, and should, one and all,
come upon the field of battle resolved, if possible, to conquer,
and, if not, to die. Life with defeat was a hope that must
by no means whatever be entertained. If they reasoned
and resolved thus, victory and safety would certainly attend
them: for it never happened that men who came to such
a resolution, whether of deliberate purpose or from being
driven to bay, were disappointed in their hope of beating their
opponents in the field. And when it chanced, as was the
case with the Romans, that the enemy had in most cases a
hope of quite an opposite character, from the near neighbourhood of their native country making flight an obvious means
of safety, then it was clear that the courage which came of
despair would carry the day."</p>
<p>When he saw that the example and the words he had
spoken had gone home to the minds of the rank and file, and
that the spirit and enthusiasm which he aimed at inspiring
were created, he dismissed them for the present with commendations, and gave orders for an advance at daybreak on
the next morning.

<head>Scipio Crosses the <placeName key="tgn,7004723">Ticinus</placeName></head>
<p>About the same day Publius Scipio, having now
crossed the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>, and being resolved to make
a farther advance across the <placeName key="tgn,7004723">Ticinus</placeName>, ordered
those who were skilled in such works to construct a bridge across this latter river; and then summoned
a meeting of the remainder of his army and addressed them:
dwelling principally on the reputation of their country and of
the ancestors' achievements. But he referred particularly to
their present position, saying, "that they ought to entertain no
doubt of victory, though they had never as yet had any experience of the enemy; and should regard it as a piece of
extravagant presumption of the Carthaginians to venture to face
Romans, by whom they had been so often beaten, and to
whom they had for so many years paid tribute and been all
but slaves. And when in addition to this they at present
knew thus much of their mettle,&mdash;that they dared not face
them, what was the fair inference to be drawn for the future?
Their cavalry, in a chance encounter on the <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName> with those
of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, had, so far from coming off well, lost a large number
of men, and had fled with disgrace to their own camp; and the
general and his army, as soon as they knew of the approach
of his legions, had beat a retreat, which was exceedingly like a
flight, and, contrary to their original purpose, had in their
terror taken the road over the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>. And it was evident that
Hannibal had destroyed the greater part of his army; and that
what he had left was feeble and unfit for service, from the
hardships they had undergone: in the same way he had
lost the majority of his horses, and made the rest useless from
the length and difficult nature of the journey. They had, therefore, only to show themselves to the enemy." But, above all,
he pointed out that "his own presence at their head ought to
be special encouragement to them: for that he would not have
left his fleet and Spanish campaign, on which he had been sent,
and have come to them in such haste, if he had not seen on
consideration that his doing so was necessary for his country's
safety, and that a certain victory was secured to him by it."</p>
<p>The weight and influence of the speaker, as well as their
belief in his words, roused great enthusiasm among the men;
which Scipio acknowledged, and then dismissed them with the
<pb n="224"/>
additional injunction that they should hold themselves in readiness to obey any order sent round to them.</p></div2>

having the stream on their left, the Carthaginians on their right; and having ascertained on
the second day, by means of scouts, that they
were near each other, they both halted and remained encamped
for that day: but on the next, both taking their cavalry, and
Publius his sharp-shooters also, they hurried across the plain
to reconnoitre each other's forces. As soon as they came
within distance, and saw the dust rising from the side of their
opponents, they drew up their lines for battle at once. Publius
put his sharp-shooters and Gallic horsemen in front, and
bringing the others into line, advanced at a slow pace.
Hannibal placed his cavalry that rode with bridles, and was
most to be depended on, in his front, and led them straight
against the enemy; having put the Numidian cavalry on either
wing to take the enemy on the flanks. The two generals and
the cavalry were in such hot haste to engage, that they closed
with each other before the sharp-shooters had an opportunity
of discharging their javelins at all. Before they could do so,
they left their ground, and retreated to the rear of their own
cavalry, making their way between the squadrons, terrified at
the approaching charge, and afraid of being trampled to death
by the horses which were galloping down upon them. The
cavalry charged each other front to front, and for a long time
maintained an equal contest; and a great many men dismounting on the actual field, there was a mixed fight of horse and
foot. The Numidian horse, however, having outflanked the
Romans, charged them on the rear: and so the sharp-shooters,
who had fled from the cavalry charge at the beginning,
were now trampled to death by the numbers and furious
onslaught of the Numidians; while the front ranks originally engaged with the Carthaginians, after losing many of
their men and inflicting a still greater loss on the enemy,
finding themselves charged on the rear by the Numidians,
broke into flight: most of them scattering in every direction,
while some of them kept closely massed round the Consul.

that Hannibal's prospects looked the brighter of
the two, concerted their plans for a fixed time,
and waited in their several tents for the moment
of carrying them out. When the men within the
rampart of the camp had taken their supper and were gone to
bed, the Celts let more than half the night pass, and just about
the time of the morning watch armed themselves and fell upon
the Romans who were quartered nearest to them; killed a
considerable number, and wounded not a few; and, finally,
cutting off the heads of the slain, departed with them to join
the Carthaginians, to the number of two thousand infantry and
nearly two hundred cavalry. They were received with great satisfaction by Hannibal; who, after addressing them encouragingly,
and promising them all suitable rewards, sent them to their
several cities, to declare to their compatriots what they had done,
and to urge them to make alliance with him: for he knew that
they would now all feel compelled to take part with him, when
they learnt the treachery of which their fellow-countrymen had
been guilty to the Romans. Just at the same time the Boii
came in, and handed over to him the three Agrarian Commissioners, sent from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to divide the lands; whom, as I have
already related, they had seized by a sudden act of treachery
at the beginning of the war. Hannibal gratefully acknowledged
their good intention, and made a formal alliance with those
who came: but he handed them back their prisoners, bidding
them keep them safe, in order to get back their own hostages
from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, as they intended at first.</p>
<p>Publius regarded this treachery as of most serious importance; and feeling sure that the
Celts in the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio changes his position at <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName> to one on the Trebia.</note>
neighbourhood had long been ill-disposed, and would, after this event, all incline to the Carthaginians,
he made up his mind that some precaution for the future was necessary. The next night, therefore,
<pb n="227"/>
just before the morning watch, he broke up his camp and
marched for the river Trebia, and the high ground near it,
feeling confidence in the protection which the strength of the
position and the neighbourhood of his allies would give him.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c68" type="chapter" n="68">
<head>Tiberius Sempronius Joins Scipio</head>
<p>When Hannibal was informed of Scipio's change of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal follows him.</note>
quarters, he sent the Numidian horse in pursuit
at once, and the rest soon afterwards, following
close behind with his main army. The Numidians, finding the Roman camp empty, stopped to set fire to it:
which proved of great service to the Romans; for if they had
pushed on and caught up the Roman baggage, a large number
of the rear-guard would have certainly been killed by the
cavalry in the open plains. But as it was, the greater part of
them got across the River Trebia in time; while those who
were after all too far in the rear to escape, were either killed or
made prisoners by the Carthaginians.</p>
<p>Scipio, however, having crossed the Trebia occupied the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's position on the slopes of <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName>, near the source of the Trebia.</note>
first high ground; and having strengthened his
camp with trench and palisade, waited the
arrival of his colleague, Tiberius Sempronius,
and his army; and was taking the greatest pains
to cure his wound, because he was exceedingly
anxious to take part in the coming engagement. Hannibal
pitched his camp about forty stades from him. While the
numerous Celts inhabiting the plains, excited by the good
prospects of the Carthaginians, supplied his army with provisions
in great abundance, and were eager to take their share with
Hannibal in every military operation or battle.</p>
<p>When news of the cavalry engagement reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the
disappointment of their confident expectations caused a feeling
of consternation in the minds of the people. Not but that
plenty of pretexts were found to prove to their own satisfaction
that the affair was not a defeat. Some laid the blame on the
Consul's rashness, and others on the treacherous lukewarmness
of the Celts, which they concluded from their recent revolt
must have been shown by them on the field. But. after all,
as the infantry was still unimpaired, they made up their minds
that the general result was still as hopeful as ever. Accordingly, when Tiberius and his legions arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and
<pb n="228"/>
marched through the city, they believed that his mere appearance at the seat of war would settle the matter.</p>
<p>His men met Tiberius at <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName>, according to their<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Tiberius Sempronius joins Scipio.</note>
oath, and he at once led them forward in all
haste to join Publius Scipio. The junction
effected, and a camp pitched by the side of his
colleague, he was naturally obliged to refresh his men after
their forty days' continuous march between <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>: but he went on with all preparations for a battle;
and was continually in conference with Scipio, asking questions
as to what had happened in the past, and discussing with him
the measures to be taken in the present.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c69" type="chapter" n="69">

the treachery of a certain Brundisian, to whom
it had been entrusted by the Romans. Having
become master of the garrison and the stores of
corn, he used the latter for his present needs;
but took the men whom he had captured with him, without
doing them any harm, being desirous of showing by an example
the policy he meant to pursue; that those whose present
position towards <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was merely the result of circumstances
should not be terrified, and give up hope of being spared by
him. The man who betrayed Clastidium to him he treated
with extraordinary honour, by way of tempting all men in
similar situations of authority to share the prospects of the
Carthaginians. But afterwards, finding that certain Celts who
lived in the fork of the <placeName key="tgn,2122081">Padus</placeName> and the Trebia, while pretending
to have made terms with him, were sending messages to the
Romans at the same time, believing that they would thus
secure themselves from being harmed by either side, he sent
two thousand infantry with some Celtic and Numidian cavalry
with orders to devastate their territory. This order being
executed, and a great booty obtained, the Celts appeared at the
Roman camp beseeching their aid. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A skirmish favourable to the Romans.</note> <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> had been all
along looking out for an opportunity of striking a blow: and
at once seized on this pretext for sending out
a party, consisting of the greater part of his
cavalry, and a thousand sharp-shooters of his
infantry along with them; who having speedily come up
<pb n="229"/>
with the enemy on the other side of the Trebia, and engaged
them in a sharp struggle for the possession of the booty,
forced the Celts and Numidians to beat a retreat to their own
camp. Those who were on duty in front of the Carthaginian
camp quickly perceived what was going on, and brought some
reserves to support the retreating cavalry; then the Romans
in their turn were routed, and had to retreat to their camp.
At this <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> sent out all his cavalry and sharp-shooters;
whereupon the Celts again gave way, and sought the protection
of their own camp. The Carthaginian general being unprepared for a general engagement, and thinking it a sound
rule not to enter upon one on every casual opportunity, or
except in accordance with a settled design, acted, it must be
confessed, on this occasion with admirable generalship. He
checked their flight when his men were near the camp, and
forced them to halt and face about; but he sent out his
aides and buglers to recall the rest, and prevented them from
pursuing and engaging the enemy any more. So the Romans
after a short halt went back, having killed a large number of
the enemy, and lost very few themselves.</p></div2>

<head><placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> Sempronius Plans to Attack</head>
<p>Excited and overjoyed at this success <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> was
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Sempronius resolves to give battle.</note>
all eagerness for a general engagement. Now, it was in his
power to administer the war for the present as he chose,
owing to the ill-health of Publius Scipio;
yet wishing to have his colleague's opinion
in support of his own, he consulted him on
this subject. Publius however took quite an opposite view
of the situation. He thought his legions would be all the
better for a winter under arms; and that the fidelity of the
fickle Celts would never stand the test of want of success
and enforced inactivity on the part of the Carthaginians: they
would be certain, he thought, to turn against them once more.
Besides, when he had recovered from his wound, he hoped to
be able to do good service to his country himself. With these
arguments he tried to dissuade <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> from his design. The
latter felt that every one of these arguments were true and
sound; but, urged on by ambition and a blind confidence in
his fortune, he was eager to have the credit of the decisive
action to himself, before Scipio should be able to be present
<pb n="230"/>
at the battle, or the next Consuls arrive to take over the
command; for the time for that to take place was now
approaching. As therefore he selected the time for the engagement from personal considerations, rather than with a view
to the actual circumstances of the case, he was bound to make
a signal failure.</p>
<p>Hannibal took much the same view of the case as Scipio,
and was therefore, unlike him, eager for a battle; because, in
the first place, he wished to avail himself of the enthusiasm of
the Celts before it had at all gone off: in the second place, he
wished to engage the Roman legions while the soldiers in
them were raw recruits without practice in war: and, in
the third place, because he wished to fight the battle while
Scipio was still unfit for service: but most of all because he
wanted to be doing something and not to let the time slip by
fruitlessly; for when a general leads his troops into a foreign
country, and attempts what looks like a desperate undertaking,
the one chance for him is to keep the hopes of his allies alive
by continually striking some fresh blow.</p>
<p>Such were Hannibal's feelings when he knew of the
intended attack of <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c71" type="chapter" n="71">
<head>Hannibal Prepares An Ambush</head>
<p>Now he had some time before remarked a certain
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal prepares an ambuscade.</note>
piece of ground which was flat and treeless,
and yet well suited for an ambush, because
there was a stream in it with a high overhanging bank thickly covered with thorns and brambles.
Here he determined to entrap the enemy. The place was
admirably adapted for putting them off their guard; because
the Romans were always suspicious of woods, from the fact
of the Celts invariably choosing such places for their ambuscades,
but felt no fear at all of places that were level and without
trees: not knowing that for the concealment and safety of an
ambush such places are much better than woods; because
the men can command from them a distant view of all that
is going on: while nearly all places have sufficient cover to
make concealment possible,&mdash;a stream with an overhanging
bank, reeds, or ferns, or some sort of bramble-bushes,&mdash;which
are good enough to hide not infantry only, but sometimes even
cavalry, if the simple precaution is taken of laying conspicuous
<pb n="231"/>
arms flat upon the ground and hiding helmets under shields.
Hannibal had confided his idea to his brother Mago and to his
council, who had all approved of the plan. Accordingly, when
the army had supped, he summoned this young man to his
tent, who was full of youthful enthusiasm, and had been
trained from boyhood in the art of war, and put under his
command a hundred cavalry and the same number of infantry.
These men he had himself earlier in the day selected as the
most powerful of the whole army, and had ordered to come to
his tent after supper. Having addressed and inspired them
with the spirit suitable to the occasion, he bade each of them
select ten of the bravest men of their own company, and to
come with them to a particular spot in the camp. The order
having been obeyed, he despatched the whole party, numbering
a thousand cavalry and as many infantry, with guides, to the
place selected for the ambuscade; and gave his brother
directions as to the time at which he was to make the attempt.
At daybreak he himself mustered the Numidian cavalry, who
were conspicuous for their powers of endurance; and after
addressing them, and promising them rewards if they behaved
with gallantry, he ordered them to ride up to the enemy's lines,
and then quickly cross the river, and by throwing showers of
darts at them tempt them to come out: his object being to
get at the enemy before they had had their breakfast, or made
any preparations for the day. The other officers of the army
also he summoned, and gave them similar instructions for the
battle, ordering all their men to get breakfast and to see to
their arms and horses.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c72" type="chapter" n="72">
<head>Preparations for Battle</head>
<p>As soon as <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> saw the Numidian horse approaching, he immediately sent out his cavalry by itself
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Battle of the Trebia, December B.C. <date value="-218">218</date>.</note>
with orders to engage the enemy, and keep them
in play, while he despatched after them six
thousand foot armed with javelins, and got the
rest of the army in motion, with the idea that their appearance
would decide the affair: for his superiority in numbers, and
his success in the cavalry skirmish of the day before, had filled
him with confidence. But it was now mid-winter and the day
was snowy and excessively cold, and men and horses were
marching out almost entirely without having tasted food; and
<pb n="232"/>
accordingly, though the troops were at first in high spirits, yet
when they had crossed the Trebia, swollen by the floods which
the rain of the previous night had brought down from the high
ground above the camp, wading breast deep through the
stream, they were in a wretched state from the cold and want
of food as the day wore on.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's forces.</note> While the Carthaginians on the contrary had eaten and
drunk in their tents, and got their horses ready, and were all
anointing and arming themselves round the fires. Hannibal
waited for the right moment to strike, and as soon as he saw
that the Romans had crossed the Trebia, throwing out eight
thousand spearmen and slingers to cover his advance, he led out
his whole army. When he had advanced about eight stades from
the camp, he drew up his infantry, consisting of about twenty
thousand Iberians, Celts, and Libyans, in one long line, while
he divided his cavalry and placed half on each wing, amounting
in all to more than ten thousand, counting the Celtic allies;
his elephants also he divided between the two wings, where they
occupied the front rank.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman forces.</note> Meanwhile Tiberius
had recalled his cavalry because he saw that they
could do nothing with the enemy. For the
Numidians when attacked retreated without difficulty, scattering in every direction, and then faced about again and charged,
which is the peculiar feature of their mode of warfare. But
he drew up his infantry in the regular Roman order, consisting
of sixteen thousand citizens and twenty thousand allies; for
that is the complete number of a Roman army in an important campaign, when the two Consuls are compelled by
circumstances to combine forces.<note anchored="yes">That is, four legions and their regular contingent of socii. See <ref target="b6c19" targOrder="U">6, 19</ref> sqq.</note>
He then placed the cavalry on either wing, numbering four thousand, and advanced against
the enemy in gallant style, in regular order, and at a deliberate pace.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c73" type="chapter" n="73">
<head>The Battle of the Trebia</head>
<p>When the two forces came within distance, the lightarmed troops in front of the two armies
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman cavalry retreat.</note>
closed with each other. In this part of the
battle the Romans were in many respects
at a disadvantage, while the Carthaginians had everything in
their favour. For the Roman spearmen had been on hard
<pb n="233"/>
service ever since daybreak, and had expended most of their
weapons in the engagement with the Numidians, while those
weapons which were left had become useless from being long
wet. Nor were the cavalry, or indeed the whole army, any
better off in these respects. The case of the Carthaginians
was exactly the reverse: they had come on the field perfectly
sound and fresh, and were ready and eager for every service
required of them. As soon, therefore, as their advanced guard
had retired again within their lines, and the heavy-armed soldiers
were engaged, the cavalry on the two wings of the Carthaginian
army at once charged the enemy with all the effect of
superiority in numbers, and in the condition both of men
and horses secured by their freshness when they started. The
Roman cavalry on the contrary retreated: and the flanks of
the line being thus left unprotected, the Carthaginian spearmen and the main body of the Numidians, passing their own
advanced guard, charged the Roman flanks: and, by the
damage which they did them, prevented them from keeping
up the fight with the troops on their front. The heavy-armed
soldiers, however, who were in the front rank of both armies,
and in the centre of that, maintained an obstinate and equal
fight for a considerable time.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c74" type="chapter" n="74">
<head>The Romans Retreat to <placeName key="tgn,2013377">Placentia</placeName></head>
<p>Just then the Numidians, who had been lying in
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Both Roman wings defeated.</note>
ambush, left their hiding-place, and by a
sudden charge on the centre of the Roman
rear produced great confusion and alarm
throughout the army. Finally both the Roman wings, being
hard pressed in front by the elephants, and on both flanks by
the light-armed troops of the enemy, gave way, and in their
flight were forced upon the river behind them. After this,
while the centre of the Roman rear was losing heavily, and
suffering severely from the attack of the Numidian ambuscade,
their front, thus driven to bay, defeated the Celts and a division
of Africans, and, after killing a large number of them, succeeded
in cutting their way through the Carthaginian line. Then
seeing that their wings had been forced off their ground, they
gave up all hope of relieving them or getting back to their
camp, partly because of the number of the enemy's cavalry,
and partly because they were hindered by the river and the
<pb n="234"/>
pelting storm of rain which was pouring down upon their
heads.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">fights its way to <placeName key="tgn,2013377">Placentia</placeName>.</note> They therefore closed their ranks,
and made their way safely to <placeName key="tgn,2013377">Placentia</placeName>,
to the number of ten thousand. Of the
rest of the army the greater number were killed by the
elephants and cavalry on the bank of the Trebia; while those
of the infantry who escaped, and the greater part of the cavalry,
managed to rejoin the ten thousand mentioned above, and
arrived with them at <placeName key="tgn,2013377">Placentia</placeName>. Meanwhile the Carthaginian
army pursued the enemy as far as the Trebia; but being prevented by the storm from going farther, returned to their camp.
They regarded the result of the battle with great exultation, as
a complete success; for the loss of the Iberians and Africans
had been light, the heaviest having fallen on the Celts. But
from the rain and the snow which followed it, they suffered
so severely, that all the elephants except one died, and a large
number of men and horses perished from the cold.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c75" type="chapter" n="75">
<head>Better Success in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName></head>
<p>Fully aware of the nature of his disaster, but wishing
to conceal its extent as well as he could from the people at
home, <placeName key="tgn,2720789">Tiberius</placeName> sent messengers to announce that a battle had

but when soon afterwards it became known that the Carthaginians were in possession of the Roman camp, and that all the

garrisons to <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, and other places of strategical importance; and, moreover, fitted out
a fleet of sixty quinqueremes. The Consuls designate, Gnaeus Servilius and
Gaius Flaminius, were collecting the allies and enrolling the
<pb n="235"/>
citizen legions, and sending supplies to <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName> and Etruria,
with a view of going to the seat of war by those two routes.
They sent also to king Hiero asking for reinforcements, who
sent them five hundred Cretan archers and a thousand
peltasts. In fact they pushed on their preparations in every
direction with energy. For the Roman people are most
formidable, collectively and individually, when they have real
reason for alarm.</p></div2>

<head>Gnaeus Scipio in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName></head>
<p>While these events were happening in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, Gnaeus
Cornelius Scipio, who had been left by his
brother Publius in command of the fleet, setting
sail from the mouth of the Rhone, came to
land with his whole squadron at a place in <placeName key="tgn,7006653">Iberia</placeName> called
Emporium. Starting from this town, he made descents
upon the coast, landing and besieging those who refused to submit to him along the seaboard as far as the
Iber; and treating with every mark of kindness those who
acceded to his demands, and taking all the precautions
he could for their safety. When he had garrisoned those
towns on the coast that submitted, he led his whole army
inland, having by this time a not inconsiderable contingent of
Iberian allies; and took possession of the towns on his line of
march, some by negotation and some by force of arms. The
Carthaginian troops which Hannibal had left in that district
under the command of Hanno, lay entrenched to resist him
under the walls of a town called Cissa.</p>
<p>Defeating this army in a pitched battle, Gnaeus not only
got possession of a rich booty, for the whole baggage of the
army invading <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> had been left under its charge, but secured
the friendly alliance of all the Iberian tribes north of the Iber,
and took both Hanno, the general of the Carthaginians, and
Andobales, the general of the Iberians, prisoners. The latter
was despot of central <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, and had always been especially
inclined to the side of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.</p>
<p>Immediately he learnt what had happened, Hasdrubal
crossed the Iber to bring aid. There he ascertained that the
Roman troops left in charge of the fleet had abandoned all
precautions, and were trading on the success of the land forces
to pass their time in ease. He therefore took with him eight
<pb n="236"/>
thousand infantry and one thousand cavalry of his own army,
and finding the men of the fleet scattered about the country,
he killed a great many of them and forced the rest to fly for
refuge to their ships. He then retired across the Iber again,
and employed himself in fortifying and garrisoning the posts
south of the river, taking up his winter quarters at New
Carthage. When Gnaeus rejoined his fleet, he punished the
authors of the disaster according to the Roman custom; and
then collected his land and sea forces together in <placeName key="tgn,7008715">Tarraco</placeName>, and
there took up his winter quarters; and by dividing the booty
equally between his soldiers, inspired them at once with
affection towards himself and eagerness for future service.

supplying them very sparingly with food;
while he treated their allies with great

addressed them, alleging, "that he had not come to fight

<div2 id="b3c78" type="chapter" n="78">
<head>Hannibal Marches Southward</head>
<p>While he was in these winter quarters also he practised
a ruse truly Punic. Being apprehensive that from the fickleness of their character, and the newness of the tie between
himself and them, the Celts might lay plots against his life, he
caused a number of wigs to be made for him, suited in
<pb n="237"/>
appearance to men of various ages; and these he constantly
varied, changing at the same time his clothes also to
harmonise with the particular wig which he wore. He thus
made it hard to recognise him, not only for those who
met him suddenly, but even for his intimates. But seeing that
the Celts were discontented at the lengthened continuance of
the war within their borders, and were in a state of restless hurry
to invade the enemy's territory,&mdash;on the pretence of hatred for
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but in reality from love of booty,&mdash;he determined to
break up his camp as soon as possible, and satisfy the desires
of his army. Accordingly as soon as the change of season set
in, by questioning those who were reputed to know the
country best, he ascertained that the other roads leading into
Etruria were long and well known to the enemy, but that the one
which led through the marshes was short, and would bring
them upon Flaminius as a surprise.<note anchored="yes">"He crossed the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName>, not by the ordinary road to <placeName key="tgn,7006076">Lucca</placeName>, descending

peculiar genius, and he therefore decided to take this route.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal starts for Etruria. Spring of B. C. <date value="-217">217</date>.</note>
was firm or boggy, Hannibal broke up his camp
and marched out. He placed the Libyans and
Iberians and all his best soldiers in the van,
and the baggage within their lines, that there
might be plenty of provisions for their immediate needs.
Provisions for the future he entirely neglected. Because
he calculated that on reaching the enemy's territory, if he were
beaten he should not require them, and if he were victorious he
would find abundance in the open country. Behind this
vanguard he placed the Celts, and in the rear of all the
cavalry. He entrusted the command of the rear-guard to his
brother Mago, that he might see to the security of all, and
especially to guard against the cowardice and impatience of
hard labour which characterised the Celts; in order that, if the
<pb n="238"/>
difficulty of the route should induce them to turn back, he
might intercept them by means of the cavalry and force them
to proceed. In point of fact, the Iberians and Libyans,
having great powers of endurance and being habituated to such
fatigues, and also because when they marched through them
the marshes<note anchored="yes">The marshes between the <placeName key="tgn,1121388">Arno</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName> south of <placeName key="tgn,7000457">Florence</placeName>.</note> were fresh and untrodden, accomplished their
march with a moderate amount of distress: but the Celts
advanced with great difficulty, because the marshes were now
disturbed and trodden into a deep morass: and being quite
unaccustomed to such painful labours, they bore the fatigue
with anger and impatience; but were hindered from turning
back by the cavalry in their rear. All however suffered
grievously, especially from the impossibility of getting
sleep on a continuous march of four days and three nights
through a route which was under water: but none suffered
so much, or lost so many men, as the Celts. Most of his
beasts of burden also slipping in the mud fell and perished,
and could then only do the men one service: they sat upon
their dead bodies, and piling up baggage upon them so as to
stand out above the water, they managed to get a snatch of
sleep<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)pekoimw=nto</foreign> Schw. translates simply <foreign lang="la">dormiebant.</foreign> But the compound
means more than that; it conveys the idea of an interval of sleep snatched
from other employments. See <bibl n="Hdt. 8.76">Herod. 8, 76</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristoph. Wasps 211">Aristoph. <title>Vesp.</title> 211</bibl>.</note>
for a short portion of the night. Another misfortune
was that a considerable number of the horses lost their hoofs
by the prolonged march through bog. Hannibal himself was
with difficulty and much suffering got across riding on the only
elephant left alive, enduring great agony from a severe attack
of ophthalmia, by which he eventually lost the sight of one
eye, because the time and the difficulties of the situation did
not admit of his waiting or applying any treatment to it.</p></div2>

<head>Flaminius in Hannibal's Way</head>
<p>Having crossed the marshes in this unexpected
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal in the valley of the <placeName key="tgn,1121388">Arno</placeName>.</note>
manner, Hannibal found Flaminius in Etruria
encamped under the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Arretium">Arretium</placeName>. For the
present he pitched his camp close to the marshes,
to refresh his army, and to investigate the plans of his enemies
and the lie of the country in his front. And being informed that
the country before him abounded in wealth, and that Flaminius
<pb n="239"/>
was a mere mob-orator and demagogue, with no ability for
the actual conduct of military affairs, and was moreover
unreasonably confident in his resources; he calculated that, if
he passed his camp and made a descent into the district
beyond, partly for fear of popular reproach and partly from a
personal feeling of irritation, Flaminius would be unable to
endure to watch passively the devastation of the country, and
would spontaneously follow him wherever he went; and being
eager to secure the credit of a victory for himself, without
waiting for the arrival of his colleague, would give him many
opportunities for an attack.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c81" type="chapter" n="81">
<head>A General Must Know his Enemy's Character</head>
<p>And in making these calculations Hannibal showed his
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal correctly judges the character of Flaminius.</note>
consummate prudence and strategical ability.
For it is mere blind ignorance to believe that
there can be anything of more vital importance
to a general than the knowledge of his
opponent's character and disposition. As in combats between
individuals or ranks, he who would conquer must observe
carefully how it is possible to attain his object, and what part
of his enemy appears unguarded or insufficiently armed,&mdash;
so must a commander of an army look out for the weak place,
not in the body, but in the mind of the leader of the hostile
force. For it has often happened before now that, from mere
idleness and lack of energy, men have let not only the welfare
of the state, but even their private fortunes fall to ruin: some
are so addicted to wine that they cannot sleep without
bemusing their intellects with drink; and others so infatuated in
their pursuit of sensual pleasures, that they have not only been
the ruin of their cities and fortunes, but have forfeited life itself
with disgrace. In the case of individuals, however, cowardice
and sloth bring shame only on themselves; but when it is
a commander-in-chief that is concerned, the disaster affects all
alike and is of the most fatal consequence. It not only
infects the men under him with an inactivity like his own; but
it often brings absolute dangers of the most serious description
upon those who trust such a general. For rashness, temerity,
and uncalculating impetuosity, as well as foolish ambition and
vanity, give an easy victory to the enemy. And are the source
of numerous dangers to one's friends: for a man who is the
<pb n="240"/>
prey of such weaknesses falls the easiest victim to every
stratagem, ambush or ruse. The general then who can gain
a clear idea of his opponent's weaknesses, and direct his attack
on the point where he is most open to it, will very soon be
the victor in the campaign. For as a ship, if you deprive it
of its steerer, falls with all its crew into the hands of the
enemy; so, in the case of an army in war, if you outwit or
out-man&oelig;uvre its general, the whole will often fall into your
hands.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c82" type="chapter" n="82">
<head>Flaminius Enticed Out</head>
<p>Nor was Hannibal mistaken in his calculations in
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Flaminius is drawn out of camp.</note>
regard to Flaminius. For no sooner had he
left the neighbourhood of <placeName key="perseus,Faesulae">Faesulae</placeName>, and,
advancing a short way beyond the Roman
camp, made a raid upon the neighbouring country, than
Flaminius became excited, and enraged at the idea that he was
despised by the enemy: and as the devastation of the country
went on, and he saw from the smoke that rose in every
direction that the work of destruction was proceeding, he could
not patiently endure the sight. Some of his officers advised
that they should not follow the enemy at once nor engage
him, but should act on the defensive, in view of his great
superiority in cavalry; and especially that they should wait for
the other Consul, and not give battle until the two armies were
combined. But Flaminius, far from listening to their advice,
was indignant at those who offered it; and bade them consider
what the people at home would say at the country being laid
waste almost up to the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself, while they
remained encamped in Etruria on the enemy's rear. Finally,
with these words, he set his army in motion, without any settled
plan of time or place; but bent only on falling in with the
enemy, as though certain victory awaited him. For he had
managed to inspire the people with such confident expectations,
that the unarmed citizens who followed his camp in hope of
booty, bringing chains and fetters and all such gear, were more
numerous than the soldiers themselves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hannibal was advancing on his way to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
through Etruria, keeping the city of <placeName key="perseus,Cortona">Cortona</placeName> and its hills on
his left, and the Thrasymene lake on his right; and as he
marched, he burned and wasted the country with a view of
<pb n="241"/>
rousing the wrath of the enemy and tempting him to come out.
And when he saw Flaminius get well within distance, and
observed that the ground he then occupied was suited to his
purpose, he bent his whole energies on preparing for a general
engagement.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c83" type="chapter" n="83">
<head>Hannibal Takes a Position in the Valley</head>
<p>The route which he was following led through a low
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The ambuscade at Lake Thrasymene.</note>
valley enclosed on both sides by long lines of
lofty hills. Of its two ends, that in front was
blocked by an abrupt and inaccessible hill, and
that on the rear by the lake, between which and the foot of
the cliff there is only a very narrow defile leading into this
valley. Making his way to the end of the valley along the
bank of the lake, Hannibal posted himself with the Spanish
and Libyan troops on the hill immediately in front of him as
he marched, and pitched a camp on it; but sent his Balearic
slingers and light-armed troops by a d&eacute;tour, and stationed
them in extended order under the cover of the hills to the
right of the valley; and by a similar d&eacute;tour placed the Gauls
and cavalry under the cover of hills to the left, causing them
also to extend their line so far as to cover the entrance of the
defile running between the cliff and lake into the valley.<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Liv. 22.4">Livy, 22, 4-6</bibl>. For
a discussion of the modern views as to the scene of
the battle, see W. T. Arnold's edition of Dr. Arnold's <title>History of the Second
Punic War,</title> pp. 384-393. The radical difference between the account of
Livy and that of Polybius seems to be that the former conceives the fighting
to have been on the north shore of the lake between Tucro and <placeName key="tgn,5002811">Passignano</placeName>;
Polybius conceives the rear to have been caught in the defile of <placeName key="tgn,5002811">Passignano</placeName>,
the main fighting to have been more to the east, where the road turns up at
right angles to the lake by La Torricella. Mr. Capes, however, in his note on
the passage of Livy, seems to think that both accounts agree in representing
the fighting on the vanguard as being opposite Tucro.</note></p>
<p>Having made these preparations during the night, and
having thus enclosed the valley with ambuscades, Hannibal
remained quiet. In pursuit of him came Flaminius, in hot
haste to close with the enemy. It was late in the evening before
he pitched his camp on the border of the lake; and at daybreak
next morning, just before the morning watch, he led his front
maniples forward along the borders of the lake into the valley
with a view of engaging the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c84" type="chapter" n="84">
<head>The Disaster At the Thrasymene Lake</head>
<p>The day was exceedingly misty: and as soon as the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle, 22d June.</note>
greater part of the Roman line was in the valley,
and the leading maniples were getting close to
him, Hannibal gave the signal for attack; and at the same time
<pb n="242"/>
sent orders to the troops lying in ambush on the hills to do
the same, and thus delivered an assault upon the enemy at
every point at once. Flaminius was taken completely by
surprise: the mist was so thick, and the enemy were charging
down from the upper ground at so many points at once, that
not only were the Centurions and Tribunes unable to relieve
any part of the line that was in difficulties, but were not even
able to get any clear idea of what was going on: for they were
attacked simultaneously on front, rear, and both flanks. The
result was that most of them were cut down in the order of
march, without being able to defend themselves: exactly as
though they had been actually given up to slaughter by
the folly of their leader. Flaminius himself, in a state
of the utmost distress and despair, was attacked and killed
by a company of Celts. As many as fifteen thousand
Romans fell in the valley, who could neither yield nor defend
themselves, being habituated to regard it as their supreme
duty not to fly or quit their ranks. But those who were
caught in the defile between the lake and the cliff perished in
a shameful, or rather a most miserable, manner: for being
thrust into the lake, some in their frantic terror endeavoured
to swim with their armour on, and presently sank and were
drowned; while the greater number, wading as far as they could
into the lake, remained there with their heads above water;
and when the cavalry rode in after them, and certain death
stared them in the face, they raised their hands and begged
for quarter, offering to surrender, and using every imaginary
appeal for mercy; but were finally despatched by the
enemy, or, in some cases, begged the favour of the fatal
blow from their friends, or inflicted it on themselves. A
number of men, however, amounting perhaps to six thousand,
who were in the valley, defeated the enemy immediately in
front of them; but though they might have done much to
retrieve the fortune of the day, they were unable to go to the
relief of their comrades, or get to the rear of their opponents,
because they could not see what was going on. They accordingly
<pb n="243"/>  pushed on continually to the front, always expecting to
find themselves engaged with some of the enemy: until they
discovered that, without noticing it, they were issuing upon
the higher ground. But when they were on the crest of
the hills, the mist broke and they saw clearly the disaster
which had befallen them; and being no longer able to do any
good, since the enemy was victorious all along the line, and in
complete possession of the ground, they closed their ranks and
made for a certain Etrurian village. After the battle Maharbal
was sent by Hannibal with the Iberians and light-armed troops
to besiege the village; and seeing themselves surrounded by a
complication of dangers, they laid down their arms and surrendered on condition of their lives being spared. Such was
the end of the final engagement between the Romans and
Carthaginians in Etruria.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c85" type="chapter" n="85">
<head>Roman Reaction</head>
<p>When the prisoners who had surrendered on terms
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's treatment of prisoners.</note>
were with the other prisoners brought to
Hannibal, he had them all collected together
to the number of more than fifteen thousand,
and began by saying that Maharbal had no authority
to grant them their lives without consulting him. He then
launched out into an invective against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>: and when he had
finished that, he distributed all the prisoners who were Romans
among the companies of his army to be held in safe keeping;
but allowed all the allies to depart without ransom to their own
country, with the same remark as he had made before, that
"he was not come to fight against Italians, but in behalf of
Italians against <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>." He then gave his army time to refresh
themselves after their fatigue, and buried those of highest rank
who had fallen in his army, amounting to about thirty; the
total number of his loss being fifteen hundred, most of whom
were Celts. He then began considering, in conjunction with
his brother and friends, where and how he should continue his
attack, for he now felt confident of ultimate success.</p>
<p>When the news of this disaster reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the chief<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dismay at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note>
men of the state could not, in view of the
gravity of the blow, conceal its extent or
soften it down, but were forced to assemble the people
and tell them the truth. When the Praetor, therefore,
<pb n="244"/>
from the Rostra said, "We have been beaten in a great
battle," there was such a consternation, that those who had
been present at the battle as well as at this meeting, felt the
disaster to be graver than when they were on the field of
battle itself. And this feeling of the people was not to be
wondered at. For many years they had been unaccustomed
to the word or the fact of defeat, and they could not now
endure reverse with patience or dignity. The Senate, however,
rose to the occasion, and held protracted debates and consultations as to the future, anxiously considering what it was
the duty of all classes to do, and how they were to do it.</p></div2>

<head>A Second Disaster in Etruria</head>
<p>About the same time as the battle of Thrasymene,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Servilius's advanced guard cut to pieces.</note>
the Consul Gnaeus Servilius, who had been
stationed on duty at <placeName key="perseus,Ariminum">Ariminum</placeName>,&mdash;which
is on the coast of the Adriatic, where the
plains of Cis-Alpine <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> join the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, not far from
the mouths of the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>,&mdash;having heard that Hannibal had
entered Etruria and was encamped near Flaminius, designed
to join the latter with his whole army. But finding himself
hampered by the difficulty of transporting so heavy a force, he
sent Gaius Centenius forward in haste with four thousand
horse, intending that he should be there before himself in case
of need. But Hannibal, getting early intelligence after the
battle of Thrasymene of this reinforcement of the enemy, sent
Maharbal with his light-armed troops, and a detachment of
cavalry, who falling in with Gaius, killed nearly half his men
at the first encounter; and having pursued the remainder to a
certain hill, on the very next day took them all prisoners.
The news of the battle of Thrasymene was three days' old at
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and the sorrow caused by it was, so to speak, at its
hottest, when this further disaster was announced. The consternation caused by it was no longer confined to the people.
The Senate now fully shared in it; and it was resolved that the
usual annual arrangements for the election of magistrates
should be suspended, and a more radical remedy be sought
for the present dangers; for they came to the conclusion that
their affairs were in such a state, as to require a commander
with absolute powers.</p>
<p>Feeling now entirely confident of success, Hannibal rejected
<pb n="245"/>
the idea of approaching <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> for the present; but traversed
the country plundering it without resistance, and
directing his march towards the coast of the
Adriatic. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's advance after the battle. </note> Having passed through <placeName key="tgn,7003125">Umbria</placeName> and

drive nor carry all the wealth which they had taken, and
after killing a large number of people on his road. For
the order was given, usual in the storming of cities, to kill

<div2 id="b3c87" type="chapter" n="87">
<head>Quintus Fabius Maximus</head>
<p>Pitching his camp on the shore of the Adriatic, in a
district extraordinarily rich in every kind of produce, he took
great pains to refresh his men and restore their health, and no
less so that of the horses. For the cold and squalor of a
winter spent in Gallia Cis-Alpina without the protection of a
roof, and then the painful march through the marshes, had
brought upon most of the horses, and the men as well, an
attack of scurvy and all its consequences. Having therefore
now got possession of a rich country, he got his horses into
condition again, and restored the bodies and spirits of his
soldiers; and made the Libyans change their own for Roman
arms selected for the purpose, which he could easily do from
being possessed of so many sets stripped from the bodies of the
enemy. He now sent messengers, too, to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> by sea, to
report what had taken place, for this was the first time he had
reached the sea since he entered <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. The Carthaginians

<head>Hannibal Marches Through Iapygia</head>
<p>Though Hannibal shifted his quarters from time to
time for short distances in one direction or another, he remained
in the neighbourhood of the Adriatic; and by bathing his
horses with old wine, of which he had a great store, cured
them of the scab and got them into condition again. By a
similar treatment he cured his men of their wounds, and got
the others into a sound state of health and spirits for the
service before them. After traversing with fire and sword
the territories of Praetutia,<note anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="la">ager Praetutianus</foreign> was the southern district of Picenum (<bibl n="Liv. 22.9">Livy, 22,

Iapygia. This district is divided
among three peoples, each with a district name, Daunii [Peucetii], and Messapii. Hannibal first invaded the territory of the
Daunii, beginning from Luceria, a Roman colony, and laid the
country waste. He next encamped near Vibo, and overran the
territory of <placeName key="tgn,6000413">Arpi</placeName>, and plundered all Daunia without resistance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Fabius, after offering the usual sacrifice to the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fabius takes the command.</note>

had been enrolled for the purpose; and
having effected a junction near Daunia with the troops that

<head>Fabius Defers Battle</head>
<p>When Hannibal learnt that Fabius had arrived, he
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cunctator.</note>
determined to terrify the enemy by promptly attacking. He
therefore led out his army, approached the
Roman camp, and there drew up his men
in order of battle; but when he had waited some time,
and nobody came out to attack him, he drew off and
retired to his own camp. For Fabius, having made up
his mind to incur no danger and not to risk a battle, but to
make the safety of his men his first and greatest object, kept
resolutely to this purpose. At first he was despised for it, and
gave rise to scandalous insinuations that he was an utter
coward and dared not face an engagement: but in course of
time he compelled everybody to confess and allow that it was
impossible for any one to have acted, in the existing circumstances, with greater discretion and prudence. And it was not
long before facts testified to the wisdom of his policy. Nor
was it wonderful that it was so. For the forces of his
opponents had been trained from their earliest youth without
intermission in war; had a general who had grown up with
them and from childhood had been instructed in the arts of
the camp; had won many battles in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, and twice running
had beaten the Romans and their allies: and, what was more
than all, had thoroughly made up their minds that their one
hope of safety was in victory. In every respect the circumstances of the Roman army were the exact opposite of these;
and therefore, their manifest inferiority making it impossible
for Fabius to offer the enemy battle, he fell back upon those
resources in which the Romans had the advantage of the
enemy; clung to them; and conducted the war by their means:
and they were&mdash;an inexhaustible supply of provisions and of
men.
<pb n="248"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c90" type="chapter" n="90">
<head>Hannibal Enters Campania</head>
<p>He, then, during the following months, kept his army
continually hovering in the neighbourhood of the enemy, his
superior knowledge of the country enabling him to occupy
beforehand all the posts of vantage; and having supplies in
abundance on his rear, he never allowed his soldiers to go on
foraging expeditions, or get separated, on any pretence, from the
camp; but keeping them continually massed together and in
close union, he watched for favourable opportunities of time
and place; and by this method of proceeding captured and
killed a large number of the enemy, who in their contempt of
him straggled from their camp in search of plunder. His
object in these man&oelig;uvres was twofold,&mdash;to gradually diminish
the limited numbers of the enemy: and to strengthen and renew by such successes in detail the spirits of his own men,
which had been depressed, to begin with, by the general defeat
of their armies. But nothing would induce him to agree to
give his enemy a set battle. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Minucius discontented.</note> This policy however was by no means approved of by his master

colony; and took the town of <placeName key="perseus,Venusia">Venusia</placeName>, which was unwalled
and richly furnished with every kind of property. All
this time the Romans were following on his rear, keeping
one or two days' march behind him, but never venturing to
approach or engage the enemy. Accordingly, when Hannibal
saw that Fabius plainly meant to decline a battle, but yet would
not abandon the country altogether, he formed the bold resolution of penetrating to the plains round <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>; and actually
did so as far as Falernum, convinced that thereby he should
do one of two things,&mdash;force the enemy to give him battle, or
<pb n="249"/>
make it evident to all that the victory was his, and that the
Romans had abandoned the country to him. This he hoped
would strike terror into the various cities, and cause them to
be eager to revolt from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. For up to that time, though
the Romans had been beaten in two battles, not a single city
in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> had revolted to the Carthaginians; but all maintained
their fidelity, although some of them were suffering severely;
&mdash;a fact which may show us the awe and respect which the
Republic had inspired in its allies.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c91" type="chapter" n="91">
<head>Fertility and Beauty of the Plains Near <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName></head>
<p>Hannibal, however, had not adopted this plan without
good reason. For the plains about Capua are the best in
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> for fertility and beauty and proximity to the sea, and for
the commercial harbours, into which merchants run who are
sailing to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> from nearly all parts of the world. They contain, moreover, the most famous and beautiful cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.
On its seaboard are <placeName key="tgn,7009927">Sinuessa</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Cumae">Cumae</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName>, and
Nuceria; and inland to the north there are <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName> and Teanum,
to the east and south [Caudium<note anchored="yes">Holsten for the <foreign lang="greek">*dau/nioi</foreign> of the old text; others
suggest <foreign lang="it">Calatia.</foreign></note>] and <placeName key="perseus,Nola">Nola</placeName>. In the centre
of these plains lies the richest of all the cities, that of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>.
No tale in all mythology wears a greater appearance of probability than that which is told of these, which, like others
remarkable for their beauty, are called the Phlegraean plains;
for surely none are more likely for beauty and fertility to have
been contended for by gods. In addition to these advantages,
they are strongly protected by nature and difficult of approach;
for one side is protected by the sea, and the rest by a long
and high chain of mountains, through which there are but
three passes from the interior, narrow and difficult, one from
Samnium [a second from <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName><note anchored="yes">Added by conjecture of Schw. One MS. has <foreign lang="greek">deute/ra h( a)po\ tou= *)eribanou=.</foreign></note>]
and a third from Hirpini.  So that if the Carthaginians succeeded in fixing their quarters
in these plains, they would have the advantage of a kind
of theatre, in which to display the terrors of their power before
the gaze of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; and would make a spectacle also of the
cowardice of their enemies in shrinking from giving them
battle, while they themselves would be proved beyond dispute
to be masters of the country.

<head>Hannibal Selects Winter Quarters</head>
<p>With this view Hannibal crossed from Samnium by

the pass of the hill called Eribianus,<note anchored="yes">Near <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName>.</note> and
encamped on the bank of the river Vulturnus,
which almost divides these plains in half.
His camp was on the side of the river towards <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, but
he overran the whole plain with foraging parties. Though
utterly aghast at the audacity of the enemy's proceedings,
Fabius stuck all the more firmly to the policy upon which he
had determined. But his colleague Minucius, and all the
centurions and tribunes of the army, thinking that they had
caught the enemy in an excellent trap, were of opinion that
they should make all haste into the plains, and not allow the
most splendid part of the country to be devastated. Until
they reached the spot, Fabius hurried on, and feigned to share
their eager and adventurous spirit; and, when he was near the
ager Falernus, he showed himself on the mountain skirts and
kept in a line with the enemy, that he might not be thought by
the allies to abandon the country: but he would not let his army
descend into the plain, being still unwilling to risk a general
engagement, partly for the same reasons as before, and partly
because the enemy were conspicuously superior in cavalry.</p>
<p>After trying to provoke his enemies, and collecting an<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fabius lies in wait.</note>
unlimited amount of booty by laying waste
the whole plain, Hannibal began taking
measures for removing: wishing not to waste his booty,
but to stow it in some safe place, which he might
also make his winter quarters; that the army might not
only be well off for the present, but might have abundant
supplies all through the winter. Fabius, learning that he
meditated returning the same way as he came, and seeing that
the pass was a narrow one, and extremely well suited for an
attack by ambush, placed about four thousand men at the exact
spot that he would have to pass; while he, with the main body
of his troops, encamped on a hill which commanded the
entrance of the pass.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c93" type="chapter" n="93">
<head>The Cattle With the Burning Fagots</head>
<p>Fabius hoped when the Carthaginians came thither,
and encamped on the plain immediately under the foot
of the hill, that he would be able to snatch away their
<pb n="251"/>
plunder without any risk to himself; and, most of all, might
even put an end to the whole war by means of
the excellent situation for an attack in which
he now was. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal eludes him.</note> He was accordingly wholly intent
on forming plans for this purpose, anxiously considering in
what direction and in what manner he should avail himself
of the advantages of the ground, and which of his men were
to be the first to attack the enemy. Whilst his enemies were
making these preparations for the next day, Hannibal, guessing
the truth, took care to give them no time or leisure for executing their design; but summoning Hasdrubal, the captain
of his pioneers, ordered him, with all speed, to make as
many fagots of dry wood of all sorts as possible, and selecting
two thousand of the strongest of the working oxen from the
booty, to collect them outside the camp. When this was done,
he summoned the pioneers, and pointed out to them a certain
ridge lying between the camp and the gorge by which he meant
to march. To this ridge they were to drive the oxen, when
the order was given, as actively and energetically as they could,
until they came to the top. Having given these instructions,
he bade them take their supper and go to rest betimes. Towards
the end of the third watch of the night he led the pioneers out of
the camp, and ordered them to tie the fagots to the horns of the
oxen. The men being numerous, this did not take long to do;
and he then ordered them to set the fagots all alight, and to
drive the oxen off and force them to mount the ridge; and
placing his light-armed troops behind them he ordered them
to assist the drivers up to a certain distance: but, as soon as
the beasts had got well started, to take open order and pass
them at the double, and, with as much noise as possible, make
for the top of the ridge; that, if they found any of the enemy
there, they might close with and attack them at once. At the
same time he himself led the main army towards the narrow
gorge of the pass,&mdash;his heavy-armed men in front, next to them
the cavalry, then the booty, and the Iberians and Celts bringing up the rear.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c94" type="chapter" n="94">
<head>Fabius Returns to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></head>
<p>The Romans who were guarding the gorge, no sooner
saw these fiery fagots advancing to the heights, than, quitting the
narrow part of the pass, they made for the ridge to meet the
<pb n="252"/>
enemy. But when they got near the oxen, they were puzzled by
the lights, imagining them to be something more dangerous than
they really were; and when the Carthaginian light-armed troops
came on to the ground, after some slight skirmishing between
the two parties, upon the oxen rushing in among them, they
separated and took up their positions on different heights and
waited for daybreak, not being able to comprehend what was
taking place.</p>
<p>Partly because he was at a loss to understand what<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal gets through the pass. Autumn, B. C. <date value="-217">217</date>.</note>
was happening, and, in the words of the
poet, "some deep design suspecting;"<note anchored="yes">Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.230"><title>Odyss.</title> 10, 230</bibl>.</note> and
partly that, in accordance with his original
plan, he was determined not to risk a general engagement,
Fabius remained quietly within his camp: while Hannibal,
finding everything going as he designed, led his army and
booty in safety through the gorge, the men who had been set
to guard the narrow road having abandoned their post. At
daybreak, seeing the two troops fronting each other on the
heights, he sent some Iberian companies to the light-armed
troops, who engaged the Romans, and, killing a thousand of
them, easily relieved his own light-armed troops and brought
them down to the main body.</p>
<p>Having thus effected his departure from the Falernian plain,
Hannibal thenceforth busied himself in looking out for a place in
which to winter, and in making the necessary preparations, after
having inspired the utmost alarm and uncertainty in the cities
and inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fabius goes to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, leaving the command to M. Minucius.</note> Though

his policy; and being shortly afterwards obliged to go to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
to perform certain sacrifices, he handed over the command of
his legions to his master of the horse, with many parting
injunctions, not to be so anxious to inflict a blow upon the
enemy, as to avoid receiving one himself. Marcus, however,
paid no heed to the advice, and, even while Fabius was speaking, had wholly resolved to risk a general engagement.</p></div2>

hearing of the number of their troops, and the great scale on
which their preparations had been made, he gave up the idea
of meeting them by land; and manning thirty-five ships, and
taking on board the best men he could get from his land
forces to serve as marines, he put to sea, and arrived on the
second day near the mouth of the Iber. Here he came to
anchor, at a distance of about ten miles from the enemy, and
sent two swift-sailing Massilian vessels to reconnoitre. For the

<head>Naval Success of the Romans In Spain</head>
<p>But being informed in good time by his look-out

men that the enemy were bearing down upon
him, Hasdrubal drew up his troops on the
beach, and ordered his crews to go on
board; and, when the Romans hove in sight, gave the signal
for the attack, determined to fight the enemy at sea. But,
after engaging, the Carthaginians made but a short struggle for
victory, and very soon gave way. For the support of the
troops on the beach did less service in encouraging them to
attack, than harm in offering them a safe place of retreat.
Accordingly, after losing two ships with their crews, and the
oars and marines of four others, they gave way and made for
the land; and when the Romans pressed on with spirit in pursuit,
<pb n="254"/>  they ran their ships ashore, and leaping from the vessels
fled for refuge to the troops. The Romans came boldly close
to land, towed off such of the vessels as could be got afloat,
and sailed away in great exultation at having beaten the enemy
at the first blow, secured the mastery of the sea, and taken
twenty-five of the enemy's ships.</p>
<p>In <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> therefore, after this victory, the Roman prospects
had begun to brighten. But when news of this reverse arrived
at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, the Carthaginians at once despatched a fleet of
seventy ships, judging it to be essential to their whole design
that they should command the sea. These ships touched
first at <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> and then at <placeName key="perseus,Pisae">Pisae</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, the commanders
believing that they should find Hannibal there. But the
Romans at once put to sea to attack them from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself,
with a fleet of a hundred and twenty quinqueremes; and
hearing of this expedition against them, the Carthaginians
sailed back to <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, and thence returned to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.
Gnaeus Servilius, who was in command of this Roman fleet,
followed the Carthaginians for a certain distance, believing
that he should fall in with them; but, finding that he was far
behind, he gave up the attempt. He first put in at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>,
and afterwards sailed to the Libyan island of <placeName key="tgn,7006523">Cercina</placeName>; and after
receiving a sum of money from the inhabitants on condition of
not laying waste the country, he departed. On his return voyage
he took the island of Cossyrus, and having put a garrison into its

to press on the war there against <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> with
redoubled vigour, they prepared a fleet of twenty
ships, and put them under the command of
Publius Scipio; and in accordance with arrangements already made, despatched him with all
speed to join his brother Gnaeus, and carry on
the Iberian campaign in conjunction with him.
Their great anxiety was lest the Carthaginians
should get the upper hand in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, and thus possessing
<pb n="255"/>
themselves of abundant supplies and recruits, should get a
more complete mastery of the sea, and assist the invasion of
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, by sending troops and money to Hannibal. Regarding
therefore the Iberian war as of the utmost importance, they
sent these ships and Publius Scipio to that country; who,
when he arrived in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, effected a junction with his brother
and did most substantial service to the State. For up to that
time the Romans had not ventured to cross the Iber; but had
thought themselves fortunate if they could secure the friendship and allies of the tribes
up to that river. They now however did cross it, and for the first time had the courage to
attempt a movement on the other side: their designs being
greatly favoured also by an accidental circumstance.</p>
<p>When the two brothers, after overawing the Iberian tribes
that lived near the passage of the Iber, had arrived before the
city of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, they pitched their camp about forty stades

means of getting supplies by sea: for their fleet was coasting
down parallel with them.</p></div2>

<head>Treason of Abilyx</head>
<p>Here an event occurred which produced a decisive
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Treason of Abilyx.</note>
change in their favour. When Hannibal was about to start
for <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, from the Iberian towns whose loyalty
he suspected he took the sons of their leading
men as hostages, and placed them all in
<placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName>, because of the strength of that town and his confidence in the fidelity of those who were left in charge
of it. Now there was a certain Iberian there named Abilyx,
who enjoyed the highest character and reputation with his
countrymen, and was believed to be especially well disposed and
loyal to the Carthaginians. Seeing how affairs were going, and
believing that the fortune of the Romans was in the ascendant,
he formed in his own mind a scheme, worthy of an Iberian
and barbarian, for giving up the hostages. Convinced that
he might obtain a high place in the favour of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, if he
gave a proof of his fidelity at a critical moment, he made up
his mind to turn traitor to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and put the hostages in
the hands of the Romans. He began his machinations by
addressing himself to Bostar, the Carthaginian general who had
<pb n="256"/>
been despatched by Hasdrubal to prevent the Romans from
crossing the river, but, not venturing to do this, had retreated,
and was now encamped in the region of <placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> next the sea.
To this man, who was of a guileless and gentle character, and
quite disposed to trust him, Abilyx now introduced the subject
of the hostages. He argued that "the Romans having now
crossed the Iber, the Carthaginians could no longer hold <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>
by terror, but stood now in need of the good feeling of their
subjects: seeing then that the Romans had actually approached
<placeName key="tgn,7008559">Saguntum</placeName> and were besieging it, and that the city was in
danger,&mdash;if he were to take the hostages and restore them to
their parents and cities, he would not only frustrate the
ambitious scheme of the Romans, who wished above all
things by getting possession of the hostages to have the credit
of doing this; but would also rouse a feeling of goodwill
towards <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> in all the cities, for having taken thought for
the future and provided for the safety of the hostages. He
would, too, much enhance the favour by personally managing
this business: for if he restored these boys to their homes, he
would provoke the gratitude, not only of their parents, but of
the people at large also, by giving a striking instance of the
magnanimous policy of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> towards her allies. He
might even expect large rewards for himself from the families
that recovered their children; for all those, who thus unexpectedly got into their hands the dearest objects of their
affection, would vie with each other in heaping favours on the
author of such a service." By these and similar arguments
he persuaded Bostar to fall in with his proposals.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c99" type="chapter" n="99">
<head>The Boys are Restored to Their Native Cities</head>
<p>Abilyx then went away, after arranging a fixed day on
which he would appear with everything necessary for conveying
the boys. At night he made his way to the Roman lines, and,
having fallen in with some Iberians serving in the Roman
army, was by them conducted to the generals; to whom he
discoursed at great length on the revulsion of feeling of
the Iberians in their favour, which would be caused if they
got possession of the hostages: and finally offered to put the
boys in their hands. Publius Scipio received the proposal
with extreme eagerness: and, promising him large rewards, he
agreed with him on a day, hour, and place at which a party
<pb n="257"/>
were to be waiting to receive him. After returning home, Abilyx
next went with a band of chosen friends to Bostar; and, after
receiving the boys, left the camp at night, as though he wished
not to be seen by the Roman camp as he passed it, and came
at the appointed time to the place arranged, and there handed
over all the boys to the Roman officers. Publius treated
Abilyx with special honour, and employed him in restoring the
boys to their native cities, along with certain of his own
friends. He accordingly went from city to city, giving
them a visible proof by the restoration of the boys of the
Roman mildness and magnanimity, in contrast to the Carthaginian suspiciousness and harshness; and bidding them
also observe that he had found it necessary to change sides,
he induced many Iberians to join the Roman alliance. Bostar
was thought, in thus surrendering the hostages to the enemy, to
have behaved more like a child than became a man of his age,
and was in serious danger of his life. For the present, however, as it was getting late in the season, both sides began
dispersing into winter quarters; the Romans having made an
important step towards success in the matter of the boys.</p></div2>

Hearing from his scouts that there was abundance of corn in the district round Luceria and Geronium,
and that Geronium was an excellent place to store it in, he
determined to make his winter quarters there; and accordingly
marched thither byway of Mount Liburnum. And having come
to Geronium, which is about two hundred stades from Luceria,
he first endeavoured to win over the inhabitants by promises,
offering them pledges of his good faith; but when no one
would listen to him, he determined to lay siege to the town.
Having taken it without much delay, he put the inhabitants
to the sword; but preserved most of the houses and walls,
because he wished to use them as granaries for his winter
camp: and having encamped his army in front of it, he fortified
his position with trench and palisade. Having finished these
labours, he sent out two-thirds of the army to collect corn, with
orders to bring home every day, each division for the use of its
<pb n="258"/>
own men, as much as the regular heads of this department
would usually supply: while with the remaining third of his
army he kept watch over his camp, and occupied certain places
with a view of protecting the foraging parties in case they were
attacked. The district being mostly very accessible and flat,
and the harvesting party being almost innumerable, and the
season moreover being at the very best stage for such operations, the amount of corn collected every day was very great.</p></div2>

<head>Successes of Minucius</head>
<p>When Minucius took over the command from

Fabius, he at first kept along the line of
hills, feeling certain that he would sooner or
later fall in with the Carthaginians; but when
he heard that Hannibal had already taken Geronium,
and was collecting the corn of the country, and had pitched
his camp in front of the town, he changed the direction of his
march, and descended from the top of the hills by way of a
ridge leading down into the plains. Arriving at the height
which lies in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Larinum">Larinum</placeName>, and is called Calena, he
encamped round its foot, being eager on any terms whatever to
engage the enemy. When Hannibal saw the enemy approaching, he sent a third of his army foraging for corn, but took the
other two-thirds with him, and, advancing sixteen stades from
Geronium towards the enemy, pitched a camp upon a piece of
rising ground, with a view at once of overawing his opponents,
and affording safety to his foraging parties: and there being
another elevation between him and the two armies, which was
near, and conveniently placed for an attack upon the enemy's
lines, he sent out about two thousand light-armed troops in
the night and seized it. At daybreak when Minucius saw
these men, he took his own light-armed troops and assaulted
the hill. After a gallant skirmish the Romans prevailed; and
subsequently their whole camp was transferred to this place.
For a certain time Hannibal kept his men for the most part
within their lines, because the camps were so close to each
other; but, after the lapse of some days, he was obliged to
divide them into two parties, one for pasturing the animals, and
one for gathering corn: being very anxious to carry out his
design of avoiding the destruction of his booty, and of collecting
as much corn as possible, that his men might have abundant
<pb n="259"/>
food during the winter, and his horses and beasts of burden as
much so; for the chief hope of his army rested on his
cavalry.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c102" type="chapter" n="102">
<head>The Romans Capture the Carthaginian Foragers</head>
<p>It was then that Minucius, seeing the great part of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Carthaginian foragers cut off.</note>
the enemy scattered about the country on
these services, selected the exact hour of
the day when they would be away to lead
out his army. Having come close to the Carthaginian
lines he drew out his heavy-armed troops there; and then,
dividing his cavalry and light-armed into detachments, sent
them in search of the foragers, ordering them to give no
quarter. This put Hannibal into a great difficulty: for he
was not strong enough to accept battle with the enemy drawn
up outside his lines, or to relieve those of his men who were
scattered about the country. The Romans meanwhile who
had been sent to take the foragers found a great number of
them scattered about, and killed them; while the troops drawn
up in front of the camp grew so contemptuous of the enemy,
that they even began to pull down their palisade, and all but
assaulted the Carthaginians. Hannibal was in a very dangerous
position: but in spite of the storm that had suddenly fallen
on him, he held his ground, repulsing the enemy when they
approached and defending, though with difficulty, the rampart;
until Hasdrubal came to his relief with about four thousand of
the foraging parties, who had fled for refuge from the country
and collected within the lines near Geronium. This encouraged Hannibal to make a sally: and having got into order
of battle a short distance from the camp, he just managed with
difficulty to avert the threatened danger. After killing large
numbers of the enemy in the struggle at the camp, and still
more in the open country, Minucius for the present retired,
but with great hopes for the future; and on the morrow, the
Carthaginians having abandoned their lines on the hill, he
went up and occupied their position. For Hannibal being
alarmed lest the Romans should go by night and find the
camp at Geronium undefended, and become masters of his
baggage and stores, determined to retire thither himself and
again fix his quarters there. After this the Carthaginians were
more timid and cautious in their manner of foraging; while the
<pb n="260"/>
Romans on the other hand acted with greater boldness and
recklessness.</p></div2>

<head>Minucius Made Co-Dictator</head>
<p>An exaggerated account of this success reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Minucius invested with co-equal powers with Fabius.</note>
and caused excessive exultation: first, because
in their gloomy prospects some sort of change
for the better had at last shown itself; and,
secondly, because the people could now believe
that the ill success and want of nerve, which had hitherto
attended the legions, had not arisen from the cowardice of the
men, but the timidity of their leader. Wherefore everybody
began finding fault with and depreciating Fabius, as failing to
seize his opportunities with spirit; while they extolled Minucius
to such a degree for what had happened, that a thing was done
for which there was no precedent. They gave him absolute
power as well as Fabius, believing that he would quickly put an
end to the campaign; and so there were two Dictators made for
carrying on the same war, which had never happened at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
before. When Minucius was informed of his popularity with the
people, and of the office bestowed upon him by the citizens, he
felt doubly incited to run all risks and act with daring boldness
against the enemy. Fabius rejoined the army with sentiments
not in the least changed by what had happened, but rather fixed
still more immovably on his original policy. Seeing, however,
that Minucius was puffed up with pride, and inclined to offer
him a jealous opposition at every turn, and was wholly bent
on risking an engagement, he offered him the choice of two
alternatives: either to command the whole army on alternate
days with him; or that they should separate their two armies,
and each command their respective part in their own way.
Minucius joyfully accepting the second alternative, they divided
the men and encamped separately about twelve stades apart.</p></div2>

<head>Minucius In Difficulties</head>
<p>Partly from observing what was taking place, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal draws on Minucius.</note>
partly from the information of prisoners, Hannibal knew of the mutual jealousy of the two
generals, and the impetuosity and ambition of
Minucius. Looking upon what was happening in the
enemy's camp as rather in his favour than otherwise, he
set himself to deal with Minucius; being anxious to put an
end to his bold methods and check in time his adventurous
<pb n="261"/>
spirit. There being then an elevation between his camp and
that of Minucius, which might prove dangerous to either, he
resolved to occupy it; and, knowing full well that, elated by his
previous success, Minucius would be certain to move out at once
to oppose his design, he concerted the following plan. The
country round the hill being bare of trees, but having much
broken ground and hollows of every description, he despatched
some men during the night, in bodies of two and three hundred, to occupy the most favourable positions, numbering in all
five hundred horse and five thousand light-armed and other
infantry: and in order that they might not be observed in the
morning by the enemy's foraging parties, he seized the hill at
daybreak with his light-armed troops. When Marcus saw what
was taking place, he looked upon it as an excellent opportunity; and immediately despatched his light-armed troops, with
orders to engage the enemy and contest the possession of the
position; after these he sent his cavalry, and close behind
them he led his heavy-armed troops in person, as on the former
occasion, intending to repeat exactly the same man&oelig;uvres.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c105" type="chapter" n="105">
<head>Cautious Fabius Saves the Day</head>
<p>As the day broke, and the thoughts and eyes of all
were engrossed in observing the combatants on the hill, the
Romans had no suspicion of the troops lying in ambush. But
as Hannibal kept pouring in reinforcements for his men on the
hill, and followed close behind them himself with his cavalry
and main body, it was not long before the cavalry also of both
sides were engaged. The result was that the Roman lightarmed troops, finding themselves hard pressed by the numbers
of the cavalry, caused great confusion among the heavy-armed
troops by retreating into their lines; and the signal being
given at the same time to those who were in ambush, these
latter suddenly showed themselves and charged: whereby not
only the Roman light-armed troops, but their whole army, were
in the greatest danger. At that moment Fabius, seeing what
was taking place, and being alarmed lest
they should sustain a complete defeat, led
out his forces with all speed and came to
the relief of his imperilled comrades.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fabius comes to the rescue.</note> At his approach the
Romans quickly recovered their courage; and though their
lines were entirely broken up, they rallied again round their
<pb n="262"/>
standards, and retired under cover of the army of Fabius, with
a severe loss in the light-armed division, and a still heavier
one in the ranks of the legions, and that too of the bravest
men. Alarmed at the freshness and perfect order of the relieving army, Hannibal retired from the pursuit and ceased
fighting. To those who were actually engaged it was quite
clear that an utter defeat had been brought about by the
rashness of Minucius, and that their safety on this and previous occasions had been secured by the caution of Fabius;
while those at home had a clear and indisputable demonstration of the difference between the rashness and bravado of a
soldier, and the farseeing prudence and cool calculation of a
general. Taught by experience the Romans joined camps
once more, and for the future listened to Fabius and obeyed
his orders: while the Carthaginians dug a trench across the
space between the knoll and their own lines, and threw up
a palisade round the crest of the captured hill; and, having
placed a guard upon it, proceeded thenceforth with their preparations for the winter unmolested.</p></div2>

<head>New Consuls Elected</head>
<p>The Consular elections being now come, the Romans
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-216">216</date>. Coss. C. Terentius Varro and L. Aemilius Paulus.</note>
elected Lucius Aemilius and Gaius Terentius.
On their appointment the Dictators laid down
their offices, and the Consuls of the previous
year, Gnaeus Servilius and Marcus Regulus&mdash;
who had been appointed after the death of
Flaminius,&mdash;were invested with pro-consular authority by
Aemilius; and, taking the command at the seat of war, administered the affairs of the army independently. Meanwhile
Aemilius, in consultation with the Senate, set at once to work
to levy new soldiers, to fill up the numbers of the legions
required for the campaign, and despatched them to headquarters; enjoining at the same time upon Servilius that he
should by no means hazard a general engagement, but contrive detailed skirmishes, as sharp and as frequent as he could,
for the sake of practising the raw recruits, and giving them
courage for a pitched battle: for they held the opinion that
their former defeats were owing, as much as anything else, to
the fact that they were employing troops newly levied and
entirely untrained. The Senate also sent the Praetor Lucius
<pb n="263"/>
Postumius into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, to affect a diversion there, and induce the
Celts who were with Hannibal to return home. They also took
measures for recalling the fleet that had wintered at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>,
and for sending to the commanders in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> such supplies as
were necessary for the service. Thus the Consul and Senate
were busied with these and other preparations for the campaign;
and Servilius, having received his instructions from the Consuls, carried them out in every particular. The details of this
part of the campaign, therefore, I shall omit to record; for
nothing of importance or worth remembering occurred, partly
in consequence of these instructions, and partly from circumstances; but there were a considerable number of skirmishes
and petty engagements, in which the Roman commanders
gained a high reputation for courage and prudence.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c107" type="chapter" n="107">
<head>Hannibal Occupies <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName></head>
<p>Thus through all that winter and spring the two
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Autumn, B. C. <date value="-216">216</date>.</note>
armies remained encamped facing each other.
But when the season for the new harvest
was come, Hannibal began to move from the
camp at Geronium; and making up his mind that it would
be to his advantage to force the enemy by any possible
means to give him battle, he occupied the citadel of a town
called Cannae, into which the corn and other supplies from
the district round <placeName key="perseus,Canusium">Canusium</placeName> were collected by the Romans,
and conveyed thence to the camp as occasion required.
The town itself, indeed, had been reduced to ruins the year
before: but the capture of its citadel and the material of war
contained in it, caused great commotion in the Roman army;
for it was not only the loss of the place and the stores in it
that distressed them, but the fact also that it commanded the
surrounding district. They therefore sent frequent messages
to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> asking for instructions: for if they approached the
enemy they would not be able to avoid an engagement, in view
of the fact that the country was being plundered, and the allies all
in a state of excitement.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Senate order a battle.</note> The Senate passed
a resolution that they should give the enemy
battle: they, however, bade Gnaeus Servilius
wait, and despatched the Consuls to the seat of war. It was
to Aemilius that all eyes turned, and on him the most confident hopes were fixed; for his life had been a noble one, and
<pb n="264"/>
he was thought to have managed the recent Illyrian war with
advantage to the State. The Senate determined to bring eight
legions into the field, which had never been done at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
before, each legion consisting of five thousand men besides allies.
For the Romans, as I have stated before,<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b1c16" targOrder="U">1. 16</ref>.</note> habitually enrol
four legions each year, each consisting of about four thousand
foot and two hundred horse; and when any unusual necessity
arises, they raise the number of foot to five thousand and of
the horse to three hundred. Of allies, the number in each
legion is the same as that of the citizens, but of the horse three
times as great. Of the four legions thus composed, they
assign two to each of the Consuls for whatever service is going
on. Most of their wars are decided by one Consul and two
legions, with their quota of allies; and they rarely employ all
four at one time and on service. But on this occasion, so
great was the alarm and terror of what would happen, they
resolved to bring not only four but eight legions into the field.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c108" type="chapter" n="108">

<p>With earnest words of exhortation, therefore, to

Aemilius, putting before him the gravity in
every point of view of the result of the battle,
they despatched him with instructions to seek
a favourable opportunity to fight a decisive
battle with a courage worthy of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Having
arrived at the camp and united their forces, they made known
the will of the Senate to the soldiers, and Aemilius exhorted
them to do their duty in terms which evidently came from his
heart. He addressed himself especially to explain and excuse
the reverses which they had lately experienced; for it was on
this point particularly that the soldiers were depressed and stood
in need of encouragement. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Aemilius.</note> "The causes," he argued, "of
their defeats in former battles were many, and
could not be reduced to one or two. But those
causes were at an end; and no excuse existed
now, if they only showed themselves to be men of courage, for
not conquering their enemies. Up to that time both Consuls had
never been engaged together, or employed thoroughly trained
soldiers: the combatants on the contrary had been raw levies,
entirely unexperienced in danger; and what was most important
<pb n="265"/>
of all, they had been so entirely ignorant of their opponents,
that they had been brought into the field, and engaged in a
pitched battle with an enemy that they had never once set eyes
on. Those who had been defeated on the Trebia were drawn
up on the field at daybreak, on the very next morning after
their arrival from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; while those who had fought in Etruria,
not only had never seen the enemy before, but did not do so
even during the very battle itself, owing to the unfortunate
state of the atmosphere.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c109" type="chapter" n="109">
<head>Paulus's Speech Continued</head>
<p>But now the conditions were quite different. For in
the first place both Consuls were with the army: and were not
only prepared to share the danger themselves, but had also
induced the Consuls of the previous year to remain and take
part in the struggle. While the men had not only seen the arms,
order, and numbers of the enemy, but had been engaged in
almost daily fights with them for the last two years. The conditions therefore under which the two former battles were fought
being quite different, it was but natural that the result of the
coming struggle should be different too. For it would be strange
or rather impossible that those who in various skirmishes, where
the numbers of either side were equal, had for the most part
come off victorious, should, when drawn up all together, and
nearly double of the enemy in number, be defeated."</p>
<p>"Wherefore, men of the army," he continued, "seeing that
we have every advantage on our side for securing a victory,
there is only one thing necessary,&mdash;your determination, your
zeal! And I do not think I need say more to you on that
point. To men serving others for pay, or to those who fight as
allies on behalf of others, who have no greater danger to expect
than meets them on the field, and for whom the issues at stake
are of little importance,&mdash;such men may need words of exhortation. But men who, like you, are fighting not for others, but
themselves,&mdash;for country, wives, and children; and for whom
the issue is of far more momentous consequence than the mere
danger of the hour, need only to be reminded: require no
exhortation. For who is there among you who would not wish
if possible to be victorious; and next, if that may not be, to
die with arms in his hands, rather than to live and see the outrage and death of those dear objects which I have named?
<pb n="266"/>
Wherefore, men of the army, apart from any words of mine,
place before your eyes the momentous difference to you
between victory and defeat, and all their consequences. Enter
upon this battle with the full conviction, that in it your country
is not risking a certain number of legions, but her bare existence. For she has nothing to add to such an army as this,
to give her victory, if the day now goes against us. All she
has of confidence and strength rests on you; all her hopes of
safety are in your hands. Do not frustrate those hopes:
but pay back to your country the gratitude you owe her; and
make it clear to all the world that the former reverses occurred,
not because the Romans are worse men than the Carthaginians,
but from the lack of experience on the part of those who were
then fighting, and through a combination of adverse circumstances." With such words Aemilius dismissed the troops.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c110" type="chapter" n="110">
<head>Skirmishes Before <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName></head>
<p>Next morning the two Consuls broke up their camp,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman army approaches Cannae.</note>
and advanced to where they heard that the enemy
were entrenched. On the second day they
arrived within sight of them, and pitched their
camp at about fifty stades' distance. But when Aemilius observed that the ground was flat and bare for some distance
round, he said that they must not engage there with an enemy
superior to them in cavalry; but that they must rather try to
draw him off, and lead him to ground on which the battle would
be more in the hands of the infantry. But Gaius Terentius being,
from inexperience, of a contrary opinion, there was a dispute
and misunderstanding between the leaders, which of all things
is the most dangerous. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Terentius Varro orders an advance.</note> It is the custom, when the two Consuls
are present, that they should take the chief command on alternate days; and the next day
happening to be the turn of Terentius, he
ordered an advance with a view of approaching the enemy,
in spite of the protests and active opposition of his colleague.
Hannibal set his light-armed troops and cavalry in motion to meet
him, and charging the Romans while they were
still marching, took them by surprise and caused
a great confusion in their ranks.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans are successful.</note> The Romans
repulsed the first charge by putting some of their heavy-armed
in front; and then sending forward their light-armed and
<pb n="267"/>
cavalry, began to get the best of the fight all along the
line: the Carthaginians having no reserves of any importance,
while certain companies of the legionaries were mixed with the
Roman light-armed, and helped to sustain the battle. Nightfall for the present put an end to a struggle which had not
at all answered to the hopes of the Carthaginians. But next
day Aemilius, not thinking it right to engage, and yet being
unable any longer to lead off his army, encamped with twothirds of it on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1128017">Aufidus</placeName>, the only river which
flows right through the <placeName key="tgn,7008531">Apennines</placeName>,&mdash;that chain of mountains
which forms the watershed of all the Italian rivers, which flow
either west to the Tuscan sea, or east to the Hadriatic. This
chain is, I say, pierced by the <placeName key="tgn,1128017">Aufidus</placeName>, which rises on the side
of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> nearest the Tuscan Sea, and is discharged into the
Hadriatic. For the other third of his army he caused a camp
to be made across the river, to the east of the ford, about
ten stades from his own lines, and a little more from those of
the enemy; that these men, being on the other side of the river,
might protect his own foraging parties, and threaten those of
the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c111" type="chapter" n="111">
<head>Hannibal Encourages his Troops</head>
<p>Then Hannibal, seeing that his circumstances called

for a battle with the enemy, being anxious
lest his troops should be depressed by
their previous reverse, and believing that
it was an occasion which required some encouraging
words, summoned a general meeting of his soldiers. When
they were assembled, he bid them all look round upon the
country, and asked them, "What better fortune they could
have asked from the gods, if they had had the choice, than to
fight in such ground as they saw there, with the vast superiority
of cavalry on their side?" And when all signified their
acquiescence in such an evident truth, he added: "First, then,
give thanks to the gods: for they have brought the enemy into
this country, because they designed the victory for us. And,
next to me, for having compelled the enemy to fight,&mdash;for
they cannot avoid it any longer,&mdash;and to fight in a place so
full of advantages for us. But I do not think it becoming in
me now to use many words in exhorting you to be brave and
forward in this battle. When you had had no experience of
<pb n="268"/>
fighting the Romans this was necessary, and I did then suggest
many arguments and examples to you. But now seeing that
you have undeniably beaten the Romans in three successive
battles of such magnitude, what arguments could have greater
influence with you in confirming your courage than the actual
facts? Now, by your previous battles you have got possession of the country and all its wealth, in accordance with my
promises: for I have been absolutely true in everything I have
ever said to you. But the present contest is for the cities and
the wealth in them: and if you win it, all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> will at once be
in your power; and freed from your present hard toils, and
masters of the wealth of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, you will by this battle become
the leaders and lords of the world. This, then, is a time for
deeds, not words: for by God's blessing I am persuaded that I
shall carry out my promises to you forthwith." His words were
received with approving shouts, which he acknowledged with
gratitude for their zeal; and having dismissed the assembly,
he at once formed a camp on the same bank of the river as
that on which was the larger camp of the Romans.</p></div2>

state of body. On the day after that he drew out his men
along the bank of the river, and showed that he was eager to
give the enemy battle. But Aemilius, dissatisfied with his
position, and seeing that the Carthaginians
would soon be obliged to shift their quarters
for the sake of supplies, kept quiet in his
camps, strengthening both with extra guards. After waiting
a considerable time, when no one came out to attack him,
Hannibal put the rest of the army into camp again, but
sent out his Numidian horse to attack the enemy's water
parties from the lesser camp. These horsemen riding right
up to the lines and preventing the watering, Gaius Terentius
became more than ever inflamed with the desire of fighting,
and the soldiers were eager for a battle, and chafed at the
delay. For there is nothing more intolerable to mankind than
suspense; when a thing is once decided, men can but endure
whatever out of the catalogue of evils it is their misfortune to
undergo.

daily taking place, the city was in a state of
high excitement and uneasiness; the people dreading the
result, owing to the disasters which had now befallen
them on more than one occasion; and foreseeing and anticipating in their imaginations what would happen if they were
utterly defeated. All the oracles preserved at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> were in
everybody's mouth; and every temple and house was full of
prodigies and miracles: in consequence of which the city
was one scene of vows, sacrifices, supplicatory processions,

ceremony of that kind in such times as unbecoming or

<head>The Order of Battle</head>
<p>When he took over the command on the following
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dispositions for the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName>.</note>
day, as soon as the sun was above the horizon,
Gaius Terentius got the army in motion from
both the camps. Those from the larger camp
he drew up in order of battle, as soon as he had got
them across the river, and bringing up those of the smaller
camp he placed them all in the same line, selecting the south
as the aspect of the whole. The Roman horse he stationed
on the right wing along the river, and their foot next them in
the same line, placing the maniples, however, closer together
than usual, and making the depth of each maniple several
times greater than its front. The cavalry of the allies
he stationed on the left wing, and the light-armed troops he
placed slightly in advance of the whole army, which amounted
with its allies to eighty thousand infantry and a little more
than six thousand horse. At the same time Hannibal brought
his Balearic slingers and spearmen across the river, and
stationed them in advance of his main body; which he led
out of their camp, and, getting them across the river at two
spots, drew them up opposite the enemy. On his left wing,
close to the river, he stationed the Iberian and Celtic horse
opposite the Roman cavalry; and next to them half the Libyan
heavy-armed foot; and next to them the Iberian and Celtic
<pb n="270"/>
foot; next, the other half of the Libyans, and, on the right
wing, the Numidian horse. Having now got them all into
line he advanced with the central companies of the Iberians
and Celts; and so arranged the other companies next these in
regular gradations, that the whole line became crescent-shaped,
diminishing in depth towards its extremities: his object being
to have his Libyans as a reserve in the battle, and to commence
the action with his Iberians and Celts.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b3c114" type="chapter" n="114">
<head>Arms of the Libyans, Iberians, and Celts</head>
<p>The armour of the Libyans was Roman, for Hannibal
had armed them with a selection of the spoils taken in previous
battles. The shield of the Iberians and Celts was about the
same size, but their swords were quite different. For that of the
Roman can thrust with as deadly effects as it can cut, while
the Gallic sword can only cut, and that requires some room.
And the companies coming alternately,&mdash;the naked Celts, and
the Iberians with their short linen tunics bordered with purple
stripes, the whole appearance of the line was strange and terrifying. The whole strength of the Carthaginian cavalry was
ten thousand, but that of their foot was not more than forty
thousand, including the Celts. Aemilius commanded on the
Roman right, Gaius Terentius on the left, Marcus Atilius and
Gnaeus Servilius, the Consuls of the previous year, on the
centre. The left of the Carthaginians was commanded by
Hasdrubal, the right by Hanno, the centre by Hannibal in
person, attended by his brother Mago. And as the Roman
line faced the south, as I said before, and the Carthaginian
the north, the rays of the rising sun did not inconvenience
either of them.</p></div2>

<head>The Battle of <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName></head>
<p>The battle was begun by an engagement between
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle, 2d August, B. C. <date value="-216">216</date>.</note>
the advanced guard of the two armies; and
at first the affair between these light-armed
troops was indecisive. But as soon as the
Iberian and Celtic cavalry got at the Romans, the battle
began in earnest, and in the true barbaric fashion: for there
was none of the usual formal advance and retreat; but when
they once got to close quarters, they grappled man to man,
and, dismounting from their horses, fought on foot. But
when the Carthaginians had got the upper hand in this encounter and killed most of their opponents on the ground,&mdash;
<pb n="271"/>
because the Romans all maintained the fight with spirit and
determination,&mdash;and began chasing the remainder along the
river, slaying as they went and giving no quarter; then the
legionaries took the place of the light-armed and closed
with the enemy. For a short time the Iberian and Celtic
lines stood their ground and fought gallantly; but; presently
overpowered by the weight of the heavy-armed lines, they
gave way and retired to the rear, thus breaking up the
crescent. The Roman maniples followed with spirit, and
easily cut their way through the enemy's line; since the Celts
had been drawn up in a thin line, while the Romans had
closed up from the wings towards the centre and the point
of danger. For the two wings did not come into action at
the same time as the centre: but the centre was first engaged, because the Gauls, having been stationed on the arc
of the crescent, had come into contact with the enemy long
before the wings, the convex of the crescent being towards the
enemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans outflanked by the cavalry.</note> The Romans, however, going in
pursuit of these troops, and hastily closing
in towards the centre and the part of the
enemy which was giving ground, advanced so far, that the
Libyan heavy-armed troops on either wing got on their flanks.
Those on the right, facing to the left, charged from the right
upon the Roman flank; while those who were on the left wing
faced to the right, and, dressing by the left, charged their
right flank,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)c a)spi/dos e)piparene/ballon.</foreign> The ordinary word for "forming line" or

what they ought to do. Thus it came about, as Hannibal
had planned, that the Romans were caught between two
hostile lines of Libyans&mdash;thanks to their impetuous pursuit of
the Celts. Still they fought, though no longer in line, yet

<head>The Slaughter At Cannae</head>
<p>Though he had been from the first on the right wing,
and had taken part in the cavalry engagement, Lucius Aemilius
<pb n="272"/>  still survived. Determined to act up to his own exhortatory speech, and seeing that the decision of the battle rested
mainly on the legionaries, riding up to the centre of the line
he led the charge himself, and personally grappled with the
enemy, at the same time cheering on and exhorting his soldiers
to the charge. Hannibal, on the other side, did the same, for
he too had taken his place on the centre from the commencement. The Numidian horse on the Carthaginian right were
meanwhile charging the cavalry on the Roman left; and though,
from the peculiar nature of their mode of fighting, they neither
inflicted nor received much harm, they yet rendered the
enemy's horse useless by keeping them occupied, and charging
them first on one side and then on another. But when
Hasdrubal, after all but annihilating the cavalry by the river,
came from the left to the support of the Numidians, the Roman
allied cavalry, seeing his charge approaching, broke and fled.
At that point Hasdrubal appears to have acted with great skill
and discretion. Seeing the Numidians to be strong in numbers,
and more effective and formidable to troops that had once
been forced from their ground, he left the pursuit to them;
while he himself hastened to the part of the field where the
infantry were engaged, and brought his men up to support the
Libyans. Then, by charging the Roman legions on the rear,
and harassing them by hurling squadron after squadron upon
them at many points at once, he raised the spirits of the
Libyans, and dismayed and depressed those of the Romans.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fall of Aemilius Paulus.</note>
It was at this point that Lucius Aemilius fell,
in the thick of the fight, covered with wounds:

years, if any man ever did.<note anchored="yes">There is nothing here absolutely to contradict the picturesque story of the

keep an unbroken front, to turn first in one direction and then
in another to meet the assaults of the enemy, they held out;
but the outer files of the circle continually falling, and the
circle becoming more and more contracted, they at last were
all killed on the field; and among them Marcus Atilius and

Gnaeus Servilius, the Consuls of the previous year, who had
shown themselves brave men and worthy of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in the battle.

or hurled from their horses; but some few escaped into <placeName key="perseus,Venusia">Venusia</placeName>,

<head>Superiority in Cavalry Wins Battles</head>
<p>Such was the end of the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName>, in which
both sides fought with the most conspicuous gallantry, the
conquered no less than the conquerors. This is proved by the
fact that, out of six thousand horse, only seventy escaped with
Gaius Terentius to <placeName key="perseus,Venusia">Venusia</placeName>, and about three hundred of the
allied cavalry to various towns in the neighbourhood. Of
the infantry ten thousand were taken prisoners in fair fight, but
were not actually engaged in the battle: of those who were
actually engaged only about three thousand perhaps escaped
to the towns of the surrounding district; all the rest died
nobly, to the number of seventy thousand, the Carthaginians
being on this occasion, as on previous ones, mainly indebted
for their victory to their superiority in cavalry: a lesson to
posterity that in actual war it is better to have half the
number of infantry, and the superiority in cavalry, than to
engage your enemy with an equality in both. On the side of
Hannibal there fell four thousand Celts, fifteen hundred
Iberians and Libyans, and about two hundred horse.</p>
<p>The ten thousand Romans who were captured had not,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Losses of the Romans.</note>
as I said, been engaged in the actual battle;
and the reason was this. Lucius Aemilius
left ten thousand infantry in his camp that,
in case Hannibal should disregard the safety of his own
camp, and take his whole army on to the field, they might
seize the opportunity, while the battle was going on, of
forcing their way in and capturing the enemy's baggage; or if,
on the other hand, Hannibal should, in view of this contingency, leave a guard in his camp, the number of the enemy in
the field might thereby be diminished. These men were
captured in the following circumstances. Hannibal, as a
matter of fact, did leave a sufficient guard in his camp; and
<pb n="274"/>
as soon as the battle began, the Romans, according to their
instructions, assaulted and tried to take those thus left by
Hannibal. At first they held their own: but just as they were
beginning to waver, Hannibal, who was by this time gaining
a victory all along the line, came to their relief, and routing the
Romans, shut them up in their own camp; killed two thousand
of them; and took all the rest prisoners. In like manner the
Numidian horse brought in all those who had taken refuge in
the various strongholds about the district, amounting to two
thousand of the routed cavalry.</p></div2>

<p>On their side the Romans, after this disaster, despaired of retaining their supremacy over the Italians, and were in the
greatest alarm, believing their own lives and the existence of
their city to be in danger, and every moment expecting that
Hannibal would be upon them.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fall of Lucius Postumius in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. See <foreign lang="la">supra,</foreign>

In spite of all, however, the Senate left no means untried to

strengthened the city with guards, and deliberated on the
crisis in a brave and manly spirit. And subsequent events
made this manifest. For though the Romans were on that
occasion indisputably beaten in the field, and had lost reputation for military prowess; by the peculiar excellence of their
political constitution, and the prudence of their counsels, they
<pb n="275"/>
not only recovered their supremacy over <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, by eventually

on the subject of the Greeks, and especially of the Achaeans;
for the league of the latter has made extraordinary progress up
to our own age and the generation immediately preceding.</p>

<div2 id="b4c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Why Begin With This Period of History</head>
<p>I thought this was the best point; first, because it is there
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Reasons for starting from this point. (1.) The fact that the history of
Aratus ends at that point. (2.) The possibility of getting good evidence. (3.) The changes

that Aratus leaves off, and I meant my work, as
far as it was Greek history, to be a continuation
of his; and, secondly, because the period thus
embraced in my history would fall partly in the
life of my father, and partly in my own; and
thus I should be able to speak as eye-witness
of some of the events, and from the information
of eye-witnesses of others. To go further back
and write the report of a report, traditions at
second or third hand, seemed to me unsatisfactory either with a view to giving clear impressions
or making sound statements.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip, son of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>;</note>But, above
all, I began at this period because it was then that the history
of the whole world entered on a new phase.
Demetrius, had just become the boy king
Achaeus, prince of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> on this side of Taurus, had converted
his show of power into a reality; Antiochus the Great had, a
short time before, by the death of his brother Seleucus,
succeeded while quite a young man to the throne of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>;
Ariarathes to that of <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>; and Ptolemy Philopator to
that of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. Not long afterwards Lycurgus became King of
<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and the Carthaginians had recently elected Hannibal
general to carry on the war lately described. Every government therefore being changed about this time, there seemed
every likelihood of a new departure in policy: which is but
natural and usual, and in fact did at this time occur. For
the Romans and Carthaginians entered upon the war I have
described; Antiochus and Ptolemy on one for the possession
of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>; and the Achaeans and Philip one against the
Aetolians and Lacedaemonians. The causes of this last war
must now be stated.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Dorimachus In the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName></head>
<p>The Aetolians had long been discontented with a state of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Aetolians.</note>
peace and tired at living at their own charges;
they were accustomed to live on their neighbours, and their natural ostentation required abundant means
to support it. Enslaved by this passion they live a life as
predatory as that of wild beasts, respecting no tie of friendship
and regarding every one as an enemy to be plundered.
<pb n="278"/>
Hitherto, however, as long as Antigonus Doson was alive, their
fear of the Macedonians had kept them quiet.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-222">222</date>.</note> But when he
was succeeded at his death by the boy Philip,
they conceived a contempt for the royal power,
and at once began to look out for a pretext and opportunity
for interfering in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>: induced partly by an old
habit of getting plunder from that country, and partly by
the belief that, now the Achaeans were unsupported by
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, they would be a match for them. While their
thoughts were fixed on this, chance to a certain extent contributed to give them the opportunity which they desired.</p>
<p>There was a certain man of Trichonium<note anchored="yes">A town on the lake of <placeName key="tgn,7010878">Trichonis</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, but its exact situation

treacherous attack on the Pan-Boeotian congress.<note anchored="yes">Cf. <ref target="b9c34" targOrder="U">9, 34</ref>. We know nothing of this incident.</note> This
Dorimachus, being young and inspired with the true spirit of Aetolian violence and aggressiveness,
was sent by the state to Phigalea in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, which,
being on the borders of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, happened at
that time to be in political union with the Aetolian league.
His mission was nominally to guard the city and territory of
Phigalea, but in fact to act as a spy on the politics of the
<placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. A crowd of pirates flocked to him at Phigalea;
and being unable to get them any booty by fair means, because
the peace between all Greeks which Antigonus had concluded
was still in force, he was finally reduced to allowing the pirates
to drive off the cattle of the Messenians, though they were friends
and allies of the Aetolians. These injurious acts were at first
confined to the sheep on the border lands; but becoming more
and more reckless and audacious, they even ventured to break
into the farm-houses by sudden attacks at night. The
Messenians were naturally indignant, and sent embassies to
Dorimachus; which he at first disregarded, because he wanted
not only to benefit the men under him, but himself also, by
getting a share in their spoils. But when the arrival of such embassies became more and more frequent, owing to the perpetual
<pb n="279"/>
recurrence of these acts of depredation, he said at last that he
would come in person to <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, and decide on the claims
they had to make against the Aetolians. When he came,
however, and the sufferers appeared, he laughed at some,
threatened to strike others, and drove others away with abusive
language.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Dorimachus Leaves <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName></head>
<p>Even while he was actually in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, the pirates
came close to the city walls in the night, and by means of
scaling-ladders broke into a country-house called Chiron's
villa; killed all the slaves who resisted them; and having
bound the others, took them and the cattle away
with them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dorimachus leaves <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>.</note> The Messenian Ephors had long
been much annoyed by what was going on, and
by the presence of Dorimachus in their town; but this they
thought was too insolent: and they accordingly summoned
him to appear before the assembled magistrates. There
Sciron, who happened to be an Ephor at the time, and enjoyed
a high reputation for integrity among his fellow-citizens,
advised that they should not allow Dorimachus to leave the
city, until he had made good all the losses sustained by the
Messenians, and had given up the guilty persons to be
punished for the murders committed. This suggestion being
received with unanimous approval, as but just, Dorimachus
passionately exclaimed that "they were fools if they imagined
that they were now insulting only Dorimachus, and not the
Aetolian league." In fact he expressed the greatest indignation
at the whole affair, and said that "they would meet with
a public punishment, which would serve them well right."
Now there was at that time in Messene a man of disgraceful
and effeminate character named Babyrtas, who was so exactly
like Dorimachus in voice and person, that, when he was dressed
in Dorimachus's sun-hat and cloak, it was impossible to tell
them apart; and of this Dorimachus was perfectly aware. When
therefore he was speaking in these threatening and insolent
tones to the Messenian magistrates, Sciron lost his temper and
said: "Do you think we care for you or your threats,
<emph>Babyrtas?</emph>" After this Dorimachus was compelled for the
present to yield to circumstances, and to give satisfaction for
the injuries inflicted upon the Messenians: but when he
<pb n="280"/>
returned to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, he nursed such a bitter and furious feeling
of anger at this taunt, that, without any other reasonable pretext, but for this cause and this alone, he got up a war against
the Messenians.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>The Revenge of Dorimachus</head>
<p>The Strategus of the Aetolians at that time was Ariston;

but being from physical infirmities unable to
serve in the field, and being a kinsman of
Dorimachus and Scopas, he had somehow or
another surrendered his whole authority to the
former. In his public capacity Dorimachus could not venture
to urge the Aetolians to undertake the Messenian war, because
he had no reasonable pretext for so doing: the origin of his wish
being, as everybody well knew, the wrongs committed by himself and the bitter gibe which they had brought upon him. He
therefore gave up the idea of publicly advocating the war, but
tried privately to induce Scopas to join in the
intrigue against the Messenians.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">He induces Scopas to go to war with <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</note> He pointed
out that there was now no danger from the side
of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> owing to the youth of the king
(Philip being then only seventeen years old);
that the Lacedaemonians were alienated from
the Messenians; and that they possessed the affection and
alliance of the Eleans; and these circumstances taken together
would make an invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> perfectly safe. But the
argument most truly Aetolian which he used was to put before
him that a great booty was to be got from <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, because it
was entirely unguarded, and had alone, of all the Peloponnesian
districts, remained unravaged throughout the Cleomenic war.
And, to sum up all, he argued that such a move would secure
them great popularity with the Aetolians generally. And if
the Achaeans were to try to hinder their march through the
country, they would not be able to complain if they retaliated:
and if, on the other hand, they did not stir, would be no
hindrance to their enterprise. Besides, he affirmed that they
would have plenty of pretext against the Messenians; for they
had long been in the position of aggressors by promising the
Achaeans and Macedonians to join their alliance.</p>
<p>By these, and similar arguments to the same effect, he
roused such a strong feeling in the minds of Scopas and his
<pb n="281"/>
friends, that, without waiting for a meeting of the Aetolian
federal assembly, and without communicating with the Apocleti, or taking any of the proper constitutional steps, of their
own mere impulse and opinion they committed acts of hostility simultaneously against <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</p></div2>

<p>By sea they immediately sent out privateers, who, falling in with a royal vessel of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> near
<placeName key="tgn,7010869">Cythera</placeName>, brought it with all its crew to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>,
and sold ship-owners, sailors, and marines, and
finally the ship itself. Then they began sacking the seaboard
of <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, employing the aid of some Cephallenian ships for carrying out this act of violence.
They tried also to capture Thyrium in <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>. At the same time they secretly-sent some men to
seize a strong place called <placeName key="tgn,1044210">Clarium</placeName>, in the centre of the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>; which they used thenceforth as a place of

with the assistance of Taurion, who had been left by Antigonus in charge of the Macedonian
interests in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, took the place after a siege of a very few days. For
Antigonus retained <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, in accordance with his convention

and had never restored <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> to the Achaeans after he
had taken it by force, but claimed and retained it in his own

their inveterate passion for plunder, could not be restrained
from robbing the country; and consequently they committed
outrages and acts of violence all along their line of march, till
they arrived at Phigalea. Thence, by a bold and sudden
movement, they entered <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>; and without any regard
for their ancient friendship and alliance with the Messenians, or
for the principles of international justice common to all mankind, subordinating every consideration to their selfish greed,
they set about plundering the country without resistance, the
Messenians being absolutely afraid to come out to attack them.</p></div2>

<p>This being the time, according to their laws, for the

met, the deputies from <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> and Pharae made

statements were heard, great indignation was felt at the wrongs of
<placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> and Pharae, and great sympathy for the misfortunes of
the Messenians. But it was regarded as especially outrageous
that the Aetolians should have ventured to enter <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> with
an army, contrary to treaty, without obtaining or even asking
for permission from any one to pass through the country.
Roused to indignation by all these considerations, the assembly voted to give assistance to the Messenians: that the
Strategus should summon a general levy of the Achaean
arms: and that whatever was decided by this levy, when it met,
should be done. Now Timoxenus, the existing Strategus, was
just on the point of quitting office, and felt besides small confidence in the Achaeans, because martial exercise had been
<pb n="283"/>
allowed to fall into neglect among them; he therefore shrank
from undertaking the expedition, or from even summoning
the popular levy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-222" to="-221">222</dateRange>-221.</note> The fact was that, after the expulsion
of Cleomenes, King of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, the Peloponnesians, weary of the wars that had taken
place, and trusting to the peaceful arrangement that had

however, indignant and incensed at the audacity of the
Aetolians, was not inclined to take things so calmly,
for he had in fact a grudge of long standing against these
people. Wherefore he was for instantly summoning the
Achaeans to an armed levy, and was all eagerness to attack
the Aetolians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aratus becomes Strategus of the Achaean league, B. C. <date value="-220">220</date> (May-June).</note> Eventually he took over from

But the peculiar character of this man, I think, makes it
proper for me to give a brief preliminary sketch of him.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Character of Aratus</head>
<p>Aratus had many of the qualities of a great ruler. He
could speak, and contrive, and conceal his purpose: no one surpassed him in the moderation
which he showed in political contests, or in his
power of attaching friends and gaining allies: in intrigue,
stratagem, and laying plots against a foe, and in bringing
them to a successful termination by personal endurance and
courage, he was pre-eminent. Many clear instances of these
qualities may be found; but none more convincing than the
episodes of the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, of the expulsion
of the Aetolians from <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName>, and especially of the surprise of
the Acrocorinthus.<note anchored="yes">The capture of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName> and expulsion of the tyrant Nicocles was the earliest
exploit of Aratus, B. C. <date value="-251">251</date>. <bibl n="Plut. Arat. 4">Plutarch, <title>Arat.</title> 4-9</bibl>. The taking
of the Acrocorinthus from the Macedonian garrison was in B. C. <date value="-23">23</date>, <bibl n="Plut. Arat. 19"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> ch. 19-24</bibl>. For
the affair at <placeName key="perseus,Pellene">Pellene</placeName> see <bibl n="Plut. Arat. 31"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> 31</bibl>. The capture of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> was immediately
after a defeat by Cleomenes. See <bibl n="Plut. Cleom. 5">Plutarch, <title>Cleom</title> 5</bibl>.</note> On the other hand whenever he attempted
a campaign in the field, he was slow in conception and timid
in execution, and without personal gallantry in the presence of
danger. The result was that the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> was full of
<pb n="284"/>
trophies which marked reverses sustained by him; and that in
this particular department he was always easily defeated. So
true is it that men's minds, no less than their bodies, have
many aspects. Not only is it the case that the same man has
an aptitude for one class of activities and not for another; it
often happens that in things closely analogous, the same man
will be exceedingly acute and exceedingly dull, exceedingly
courageous and exceedingly timid. Nor is this a paradox: it
is a very ordinary fact, well known to all attentive observers.
For instance you may find men who in hunting show the
greatest daring in grappling with wild beasts, and yet are utter
cowards in the presence of an armed enemy. Or again, in
actual war some are active and skilful in single combats, who
are yet quite ineffective in the ranks. For example, the
Thessalian cavalry in squadron and column are irresistible, but
when their order is once broken up, they have not the skill
in skirmishing by which each man does whatever the time and
place suggests: while, on the other hand, exactly the reverse of
this is the case with the Aetolians. The Cretans, again, either
by land or sea, in ambushes and piratical excursions, in deceiving the enemy, in making night attacks, and in fact in
every service which involves craft and separate action, are
irresistible; but for a regular front to front charge in line
they have neither the courage nor firmness; and the reverse
again is the case with the Achaeans and Macedonians.</p>
<p>I have said thus much, that my readers may not refuse me
credit if I have at times to make contradictory statements
about the same men and in regard to analogous employments.
To return to my narrative.</p></div2>

the league, and their anxiety to be enrolled among its members.
The Achaean magistrates declined the offered alliance, on the
ground that it was impossible to admit a new member without the
concurrence of Philip and the other allies,&mdash;for the sworn alliance

rather as reserves and spectators than as active allies. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dorimachus ordered to quit <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> without passing through <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>.</note> Having

<head>Aratus Dismisses the Achaean Troops</head>
<p>Aratus waited two days: and then, foolishly &mdash; believing
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aratus dismisses the Achaean levy, with the exception of 3000 foot and 300 horse.</note>
that the Aetolians would return by the route
they had indicated, he dismissed all the Achaeans
and Lacedaemonians to their homes, except
three thousand foot and three hundred horse
and the division under Taurion, which he led to
<placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName>, with the view of keeping on the flank of the Aetolians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dorimachus turns upon Aratus.</note>
But when Dorimachus learnt that Aratus was
thus watching his march, and was still under
<pb n="286"/>
arms; partly from fear of being attacked when his forces
were engaged on the embarkation, and partly with a view
to confuse the enemy, he sent his booty on to the
transports with a sufficient number of men to secure their
passage, under orders to meet him at Rhium where he intended to embark; while he himself, after remaining for a time
to superintend and protect the shipment of the booty, changed
the direction of his march and advanced towards <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>.
But hearing that Taurion, with the rest of the army, was near
Cleitoria; and feeling sure that in these circumstances he would
not be able to effect the crossing from Rhium without danger
and a struggle with the enemy; he made up his mind that it
would be best for his interests to bring on an engagement with
the army of Aratus as soon as possible, since it was weak in
numbers and wholly unprepared for the attack. He calculated
that if he could defeat this force, he could then plunder the
country, and effect his crossing from Rhium in safety, while
Aratus was waiting and deliberating about again convoking
the Achaean levy; but if on the other hand Aratus were
terrified and declined the engagement, he would then effect his
departure unmolested, whenever he thought it advisable. With
these views, therefore, he advanced, and pitched his camp at
<placeName key="perseus,Methydrium">Methydrium</placeName> in the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>.</p></div2>

<p>But the leaders of the Achaeans, on learning the

arrival of the Aetolians, adopted a course of proceeding quite unsurpassable for folly. They
left the territory of Cleitor and encamped at
Caphyae; but the Aetolians marching from <placeName key="perseus,Methydrium">Methydrium</placeName> past
the city of <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName>, they led the Achaean troops into the

river which flows through that plain protecting their front.

dyke, from the inner side of which ran the River Tragus (<term><placeName key="tgn,1130626">Tara</placeName></term>). <bibl n="Paus. 8.23.2">Pausan.
8, 23, 2</bibl>.</note> and the show of readiness on the part of the Achaeans
<pb n="287"/>
for the engagement, caused the Aetolians to shrink from
attacking according to their original purpose; but they retreated in good order to the high ground of Oligyrtus, content
if only they were not attacked and forced to give battle. But
Aratus, when the van of the Aetolians was already making
the ascent, while the cavalry were bringing up the rear along
the plain, and were approaching a place called Propus at the
foot of the hills, sent out his cavalry and light-armed troops,
under the command of Epistratus of <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, with orders to
attack and harass the enemy's rear. Now if an engagement
was necessary at all, they ought not to have attempted it with
the enemy's rear, when they had already accomplished the
march through the plain, but with his van directly it had
debouched upon the plain: for in this way the battle would
have been wholly confined to the plain and level ground,
where the peculiar nature of the Aetolian arms and general
tactics would have been least effective; while the Achaeans,
from precisely opposite reasons, would have been most effective
and able to act. As it was, they surrendered the advantages
of time and place which were in their favour, and deliberately
accepted the conditions which were in favour of the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>The Achaeans Defeated</head>
<p>Naturally the result of the engagement was in harmony
with such a beginning. For when the lightarmed troops approached, the Aetolian cavalry
retired in good order up the hill, being anxious
to effect a junction with their own infantry. But Aratus,
having an imperfect view of what was going on, and making
a bad conjecture of what would happen next, no sooner saw
the cavalry retiring, than, hoping that they were in absolute
flight, he sent forward the heavy-armed troops of his two wings,
with orders to join and support the advanced guard of their
light-armed troops; while he himself, with his remaining forces,
executed a flank movement, and led his men on at the double.
But the Aetolian cavalry had now cleared the plain, and, having
effected the junction with their infantry, drew up under cover
of the hill; massed the infantry on their flanks; and called to
them to stand by them: the infantry themselves showing great
promptness in answering to their shouts, and in coming to
their relief, as the several companies arrived. Thinking themselves
<pb n="288"/>  now sufficiently strong in numbers, they closed their
ranks, and charged the advanced guard of Achaean cavalry
and light-armed troops; and being superior in number, and
having the advantage of charging from higher ground, after a
long struggle, they finally turned their opponents to flight:
whose flight involved that of the heavy-armed troops also which
were coming to their relief. For the latter were advancing in
separate detachments in loose order, and, either in dismay at
what was happening, or upon meeting their flying comrades on
their retreat, were compelled to follow their example: the result
being that, whereas the number of those actually defeated on
the field was less than five hundred, the number that fled was
more than two thousand. Taught by experience what to do,
the Aetolians followed behind them with round after round of
loud and boisterous shouts. The Achaeans at first retreated
in good order and without danger, because they were retiring
upon their heavy-armed troops, whom they imagined to be in
a place of safety on their original ground; but when they saw
that these too had abandoned their position of safety, and were
marching in a long straggling line, some of them immediately
broke off from the main body and sought refuge in various
towns in the neighbourhood; while others, meeting the phalanx
as it was coming up to their relief, proved to be quite sufficient,
without the presence of an enemy, to strike fear into it and
force it into headlong flight. They directed their flight, as I
said, to the towns of the neighbourhood. <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orchomenus</placeName> and
Caphyae, which were close by, saved large numbers of them:
and if this had not been the case, they would in all probability have been annihilated by this unlooked-for catastrophe.
Such was the result of the engagement at Caphyae.</p></div2>

<p>When the people of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> learnt that the Aetolians were at <placeName key="perseus,Methydrium">Methydrium</placeName>, they came to the rescue <foreign lang="fr">en masse,</foreign> at

therefore dug a trench in the territory of Caphyae, and
collected the corpses, they performed the funeral rites of these
unhappy men with all imaginable honour. But the Aetolians,
<pb n="289"/>
after this unlooked-for success gained by the cavalry and lightarmed troops, traversed the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> from that time in
complete security. In the course of their march they made

<p>A few days after the events just narrated the ordinary

meeting of the Achaean federal assembly
took place, and Aratus was bitterly denounced,
publicly as well as privately, as indisputably
responsible for this disaster; and the anger of the general
public was still further roused and embittered by the
invectives of his political opponents. It was shown to
every one's satisfaction that Aratus had been guilty of
four flagrant errors. His first was that, having taken office
before his predecessor's time was legally at an end, he had
availed himself of a time properly belonging to another to
engage in the sort of enterprise in which he
was conscious of having often failed. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Attacked at the Achaean Congress, Aratus successfully defends himself.</note> His
second and graver error was the disbanding the
Achaeans, while the Aetolians were still in the
middle of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>; especially as he had been well
aware beforehand that Scopas and Dorimachus were anxious
to disturb the existing settlement, and to stir up war. His
third error was to engage the enemy, as he did, with such a
small force, without any strong necessity; when he might have
retired to the neighbouring towns and have summoned a levy
of the Achaeans, and then have engaged, if he had thought
that measure absolutely necessary. But his last and gravest
error was that, having determined to fight, he did so in such
an ill-considered manner, and managed the business with so
little circumspection, as to deprive himself of the advantages
of the plain and the support of his heavy-armed troops, and
allow the battle to be settled by light-armed troops, and to take
<pb n="290"/>
place on the slopes, than which nothing could have been more
advantageous or convenient to the Aetolians. Such were the
allegations against Aratus. He, however, came forward and
reminded the assembly of his former political services and
achievements; and urged in his defence that, in the matters
alleged, his was not the blame for what had occurred. He
begged their indulgence if he had been guilty of any oversight
in the battle, and claimed that they should at any rate look at
the facts without prejudice or passion. These words created
such a rapid and generous change in the popular feeling, that
great indignation was roused against the political opponents
who attacked him; and the resolutions as to the measures to
be taken in the future were passed wholly in accordance with
the views of Aratus.</p></div2>

<placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, and Philip, to declare how the Aetolians, in defiance
of treaty, had twice entered <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> with arms,
and to call upon them for assistance in virtue of
their agreement, and for their consent to the
admission of the Messenians into the alliance.
Next, that the Strategus of the Achaeans should
enrol five thousand foot and five hundred horse,
and support the Messenians in case the Aetolians were to invade their territory; and to arrange with the Lacedaemonians
and Messenians how many horse and foot were to be supplied
by them severally for the service of the league. These decrees
showed a noble spirit on the part of the Achaeans in the
presence of defeat, which prevented them from abandoning
either the cause of the Messenians or their own purpose.
Those who were appointed to serve on these embassies to the
allies proceeded to carry them out; while the Strategus at once,
in accordance with the decree, set about enrolling the troops
<pb n="291"/>
from <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, and arranged with the Lacedaemonians and
Messenians to supply each two thousand five hundred infantry
and two hundred and fifty cavalry, so that the whole army for
the coming campaign should amount to ten thousand foot and
a thousand horse.</p>
<p>On the day of their regular assembly the Aetolians also
met and decided to maintain peace with the Spartans and
Messenians; hoping by that crafty measure to tamper with the
loyalty of the Achaean allies and sow disunion among them.
With the Achaeans themselves they voted to maintain peace,
on condition that they withdrew from alliance with <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>,
and to proclaim war if they refused,&mdash;than which nothing
could have been more unreasonable. For being themselves in
alliance, both with Achaeans and Messenians, they proclaimed
war against the former, unless the two ceased to be in
alliance and friendly relationship with each other; while if
the Achaeans chose to be at enmity with the Messenians,
they offered them a separate peace. Their proposition was
too iniquitous and unreasonable to admit of being even
considered.</p></div2>

<head>The Aetolians and Illyrians Invade Achaia</head>
<p>The Epirotes and King Philip on hearing the ambassadors consented to admit the Messenians to alliance; but though
the conduct of the Aetolians caused them momentary indignation, they were not excessively moved by it, because it was no
more than what the Aetolians habitually did. Their anger,
therefore, was short-lived, and they presently voted against
going to war with them. So true is it that an habitual course
of wrong-doing finds readier pardon than when it is spasmodic
or isolated. The former, at any rate, was the case with the
Aetolians: they perpetually plundered <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and levied unprovoked war upon many of its people: they did not deign either

city-guard and commandant from <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>. This was the state
of affairs when, shortly before the Aetolian invasion, the exiled
<pb n="293"/>
party sent to the party in possession intreating that they would
be reconciled and allow them to return to their own city;
whereupon the latter were persuaded, and sent an embassy to
the Achaeans with the view of obtaining their consent to the
pacification. The Achaeans readily consented, in the belief
that both parties would regard them with goodwill: since the
party in possession had all their hopes centred in the Achaeans,
while those who were about to be restored would owe that
restoration to the consent of the same people. Accordingly
the Cynaethans dismissed the city-guard and commandant, and
restored the exiles, to the number of nearly three hundred,
after taking such pledges from them as are reckoned the most
inviolable among all mankind. But no sooner had they
secured their return, than, without any cause or pretext arising
which might give a colour to the renewal of the quarrel, but
on the contrary, at the very first moment of their restoration,
they began plotting against their country, and against those who
had been their preservers. I even believe that at the very
sacrifices, which consecrated the oaths and pledges which they
gave each other, they were already, even at such a solemn
moment, revolving in their minds this offence against religion
and those who had trusted them. For, as soon as they were
restored to their civil rights they called in the Aetolians, and
betrayed the city into their hands, eager to effect the utter ruin
both of the people who had preserved, and the city which had
nourished, them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c18" type="chapter" n="18">
<head>Treason of the Cynaethans</head>
<p>The bold stroke by which they actually consummated
this treason was as follows. Of the restored exiles certain
officers had been appointed called Polemarchs, whose duty it
was to lock the city-gates, and keep the keys while they
remained closed, and also to be on guard during the day at
the gate-houses. The Aetolians accordingly waited for this
period of closing the gates, ready to make the attempt, and
provided with ladders; while the Polemarchs of the exiles,
having assassinated their colleagues on guard at the gate-house,
opened the gate. Some of the Aetolians, therefore, got into
the town by it, while others applied their ladders to the walls,
and mounting by their means, took forcible possession of them.
The inhabitants of the town, panic-stricken at the occurrence,
<pb n="294"/>
could not tell which way to turn. They could not give their
undivided energies to opposing the party which was forcing
its way through the gate, because of those who were attacking
them at the walls; nor could they defend the walls owing to the
enemies that were pouring through the gate. The Aetolians
having thus become rapidly masters of the town, in spite of the
injustice of the whole proceeding, did one act of supreme
justice. For the very men who had invited them, and betrayed
the town to them, they massacred before any one else, and
plundered their property. They then treated all the others of
the party in the same way; and, finally, taking up their
quarters in the houses, they systematically robbed them of all
valuables, and in many cases put Cynaethans to the rack, if
they suspected them of having anything concealed, whether
money, or furniture, or anything else of unusual value.</p>
<p>After inflicting this ruin on the Cynaethans they departed,
leaving a garrison to guard the walls, and marched towards <placeName key="perseus,Lusi">Lusi</placeName>.
Arrived at the temple of Artemis, which lies between Cleitor
and Cynaetha, and is regarded as inviolable by the Greeks,
they threatened to plunder the cattle of the goddess and the
other property round the temple. But the people of <placeName key="perseus,Lusi">Lusi</placeName>
acted with great prudence: they gave the Aetolians some of
the sacred furniture, and appealed to them not to commit
the impiety of inflicting any outrage. The gift was accepted,
and the Aetolians at once removed to Cleitor and pitched
their camp under its walls.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c19" type="chapter" n="19">

<p>Meanwhile Aratus, the Achaean Strategus, had despatched an appeal for help to Philip; was

escalade. But meeting with a bold and determined resistance
from the inhabitants, they desisted from the attempt; and

and saw that Demetrius of Pharos had sailed
into Cenchreae from his island expedition, he urged the latter
to assist the Achaeans, and dragging his galleys across the
Isthmus to attack the Aetolians as they crossed the gulf.
Now though Demetrius had enriched himself by his island
expedition, he had had to beat an ignominious retreat, owing to
the Rhodians putting out to sea to attack him: he was therefore
glad to accede to the request of Taurion, as the latter undertook the expense of having his galleys dragged across the

<head>Music in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName></head>
<p>Now, seeing that the Arcadians as a whole have a
<note anchored="yes" place="marg"> The reasons of the barbarity of the Cynaethans. Their neglect of the refining influences of
music, which is carefully encouraged in the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>.</note>
reputation for virtue throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, not
only in respect of their hospitality and humanity,
but especially for their scrupulous piety, it
seems worth while to investigate briefly the
barbarous character of the Cynaethans: and
inquire how it came about that, though indisputably Arcadians in race, they at that time so
far surpassed the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in cruelty and
contempt of law.</p>
<p>They seem then to me to be the first, and indeed the
only, Arcadians who have abandoned institutions nobly conceived by their ancestors and admirably adapted to the
character of all the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>. For music, and I
mean by that <emph>true</emph> music, which it is advantageous to every one
to practice, is obligatory with the Arcadians. For we must
not think, as Ephorus in a hasty sentence of his preface, wholly
unworthy of him, says, that music was introduced among mankind for the purpose of deception and jugglery; nor must the
ancient Cretans and Spartans be supposed to have introduced
the pipe and rhythmic movement in war, instead of the
trumpet, without some reason; nor the early Arcadians to have
given music such a high place in their constitution, that not
only boys, but young men up to the age of thirty, are compelled
to practise it, though in other respects most simple and
primitive in their manner of life. Every one is familiarly
acquainted with the fact that the Arcadians are the only
people among whom boys are by the laws trained from infancy
to sing hymns and paeans, in which they celebrate in the
traditional fashion the heroes and gods of their particular
towns. They next learn the airs of Philoxenus and Timotheus,
and dance with great spirit to the pipers at the yearly Dionysia
in the theatres, the boys at the boys' festival, and the young men
at what is called the men's festival. Similarly it is their universal custom, at all festal gatherings and banquets, not to have
strangers to make the music, but to produce it themselves, calling
<pb n="297"/>  on each other in turn for a song. They do not look upon it
as a disgrace to disclaim the possession of any other accomplishment: but no one can disclaim the knowledge of how to
sing, because all are forced to learn; nor can they confess the
knowledge, and yet excuse themselves from practising it, because
that too among them is looked upon as disgraceful. Their
young men again practise a military step to the music of the
pipe and in regular order of battle, producing elaborate
dances, which they display to their fellow-citizens every year in
the theatres, at the public charge and expense.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c21" type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Why the Ancient Arcadians Turned to Music</head>
<p>Now the object of the ancient Arcadians in introducing
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The object of the musical training of the Arcadians.</note>
these customs was not, as I think, the gratification of luxury and extravagance. They
saw that <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> was a nation of workers;
that the life of the people was laborious and hard; and
that, as a natural consequence of the coldness and gloom
which were the prevailing features of a great part of the
country, the general character of the people was austere. For
we mortals have an irresistible tendency to yield to climatic
influences: and to this cause, and no other, may be traced
the great distinctions which prevail amongst us in character, physical formation, and complexion, as well as in
most of our habits, varying with nationality or wide local
separation. And it was with a view of softening and tempering
this natural ruggedness and rusticity, that they not only introduced the things which I have mentioned, but also the custom
of holding assemblies and frequently offering sacrifices, in both
of which women took part equally with men; and having mixed
dances of girls and boys: and in fact did everything they
could to humanise their souls by the civilising and softening
influence of such culture. The people of Cynaetha entirely
neglected these things, although they needed them more than
any one else, because their climate and country is by far the
most unfavourable in all <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>; and on the contrary gave
their whole minds to mutual animosities and contentions. They
in consequence became finally so brutalised, that no Greek city
has ever witnessed a longer series of the most atrocious crimes.
I will give one instance of the ill fortune of Cynaetha in this
respect, and of the disapproval of such proceedings on the
<pb n="298"/>
part of the Arcadians at large. When the Cynaethans, after
their great massacre, sent an embassy to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, every city
which the ambassadors entered on their road at once ordered
them by a herald to depart; while the Mantineans not only
did that, but after their departure regularly purified their city
and territory from the taint of blood, by carrying victims
round them both.</p>
<p>I have had three objects in saying thus much on this subject. First, that the character of the Arcadians should not
suffer from the crimes of one city: secondly, that other
nations should not neglect music, from an idea that certain
Arcadians give an excessive and extravagant attention to it:
and, lastly, I speak for the sake of the Cynaethans themselves,
that, if ever God gives them better fortune, they may humanise
themselves by turning their attention to education, and especially to music.</p></div2>

king over them, and to be entirely submissive
to their rulers, their sudden enfranchisement by means of
Antigonus, and the absence of a king, produced a state
of civil war; because they all imagined themselves to be
on a footing of complete political equality. At first two of
the five Ephors kept their views to themselves; while the other
three threw in their lot with the Aetolians, because they were
convinced that the youth of Philip would prevent him as yet
from having a decisive influence in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. But when,

the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, and Philip arrived still more quickly from
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, the three Ephors became distrustful of Adeimantus,
<pb n="299"/>
one of the other two, because he was privy to and disapproved
of their plans; and were in a great state of anxiety lest he
should tell Philip everything as soon as that monarch approached. After some consultation therefore with certain
young men, they published a proclamation ordering all citizens
of military age to assemble in arms in the
sacred enclosure of Athene of the Brazenhouse, on the pretext that the Macedonians
were advancing against the town. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Adeimantus assassinated.</note> This startling announcement
caused a rapid muster: when Adeimantus, who disapproved of the measure, came forward and endeavoured to
show that "the proclamation and summons to assemble in arms
should have been made some time before, when they were
told that their enemies the Aetolians were approaching the
frontier: not then, when they learnt that their benefactors and
preservers the Macedonians were coming with their king." In
the middle of this dissuasive speech the young men whose
co-operation had been secured struck him dead, and with him
Sthenelaus, Alcamenes, Thyestes, Bionidas, and several other
citizens; whereupon Polyphontes and certain of his party,
seeing clearly what was going to happen, went off to join
Philip.</p></div2>

<head>Differences of Opinion Among the Lacedaemonians</head>
<p>Immediately after the commission of this crime, the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip summons Spartan deputies to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>.</note>
Ephors who were then in power sent men
to Philip, to accuse the victims of this
massacre; and to beg him to delay his
approach, until the affairs of the city had returned to their
normal state after this commotion; and to be assured meanwhile that it was their purpose to be loyal and friendly to the
Macedonians in every respect. These ambassadors found
Philip near Mount Parthenius,<note anchored="yes">A mountain on the frontier, on the pass over which the roads to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>
and <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> converge.</note> and communicated to him
their commission. Having listened, he bade the ambassadors
make all haste home, and inform the Ephors that he was going
to continue his march to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>, and expected that they would
as quickly as possible send him men of credit to consult with
him on the present position of affairs. After hearing this
message from the king, the Lacedaemonian officers despatched
<pb n="300"/>
ten commissioners headed by Omias to meet Philip; who,
on arriving at <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>, and entering the king's council chamber,
accused Adeimantus of being the cause of the late commotion; and promised that they would perform all their
obligations as allies to Philip, and show that they were second
to none of those whom he looked upon as his most loyal
friends, in their affection for his person. With these and
similar asseverations the Lacedaemonian commissioners left
the council chamber. The members of the council were
divided in opinion: one party knowing the secret treachery of
the Spartan magistrates, and feeling certain that Adeimantus
had lost his life from his loyalty to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, while the Lacedaemonians had really determined upon an alliance with the
Aetolians, advised Philip to make an example of the Lacedaemonians, by treating them precisely as Alexander had treated
the Thebans, immediately after his assumption of his sovereignty. But another party, consisting of the older counsellors,
sought to show that such severity was too great for the occasion, and that all that ought to be done was to rebuke the
offenders, depose them, and put the management of the state
and the chief offices in the hands of his own friends.</p></div2>

<p>The king gave the final decision, if that decision may
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The king decides not to chastise Sparta.</note>
be called the king's: for it is not reasonable to suppose that a mere boy should be
able to come to a decision on matters of such
moment. Historians, however, must attribute to the highest
official present the final decisions arrived at: it being
thoroughly understood among their readers that propositions
and opinions, such as these, in all probability proceed from the
members of the council, and particularly from those highest
in his confidence. In this case the decision of the king ought
most probably to be attributed to Aratus. It was to this
effect: the king said that "in the case of injuries inflicted by
the allies upon each other separately, his intervention ought
to be confined to a remonstrance by word of mouth or
letter; but that it was only injuries affecting the whole
body of the allies which demanded joint intervention and
redress: and seeing that the Lacedaemonians had plainly
committed no such injury against the whole body of allies,
<pb n="301"/>
but professed their readiness to satisfy every claim that could
with justice be made upon them, he held that he ought not
to decree any measure of excessive severity against them.
For it would be very inconsistent for him to take severe
measures against them for so insignificant a cause; while his
father inflicted no punishment at all upon them, though when
he conquered them they were not allies but professed enemies."
It having, therefore, been formally decided to overlook the
incident, the king immediately sent Petraeus, one of his most
trusted friends, with Omias, to exhort the people to remain
faithful to their friendship with him and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and to
interchange oaths of alliance; while he himself started once

the phocians of having attacked and attempted to seize the
cities of Ambrysus and Daulium: the Epirotes of having committed depredations in their territory. The Acarnanians
showed how they had contrived a plot for the betrayal of
Thyrium into their hands, and had gone so far as to actually
assault it under cover of night. The Achaeans made a statement showing that they had seized <placeName key="tgn,1044210">Clarium</placeName> in the territory of
<placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>; traversed the territories of <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> and Pharae,

land, doing all they could by aid of the Illyrians to lay waste
the latter after its recent restoration. After listening to these
depositions, the congress of allies unanimously decided to go
to war with the Aetolians. A decree was, therefore, formulated
in which the aforesaid causes for war were stated as a preamble,
<pb n="302"/>
and a declaration subjoined of their intention of restoring to
the several allies any portion of their territory seized by the
Aetolians since the death of Demetrius, father of Philip; and
similarly of restoring to their ancestral forms of government
all states that had been compelled against their will to join the
Aetolian league; with full possession of their own territory and
cities; subject to no foreign garrison or tribute; in complete
independence; and in enjoyment of their own constitutions and
laws. Finally a clause in the decree declared their intention
of assisting the Amphictyonic council to restore the laws, and
to recover its control of the Delphic temple, wrested from it
by the Aetolians, who were determined to keep in their own
hands all that belonged to that temple.</p></div2>

140th Olympiad, and with it began the so-called Social war, the commencement of
which was thoroughly justifiable and a natural consequence
of the injurious acts of the Aetolians. The first step of the
congress was to send commissioners at once to the several
allies, that the decree having been confirmed by as many as
possible, all might join in this national war. Philip also sent
a declaratory letter to the Aetolians, in order that, if they had
any justification to put forward on the points alleged against
them, they might even at that late hour meet and settle the
controversy by conference: "but if they supposed that they
were, with no public declaration of war, to sack and plunder,
without the injured parties retaliating, on pain of being considered, if they did so, to have commenced hostilities, they
were the most simple people in the world." On the receipt
of this letter the Aetolian magistrates, thinking that Philip
would never come, named a day on which they would meet
him at Rhium. When they were informed, however, that he
had actually arrived there, they sent a despatch informing him
that they were not competent, before the meeting of the
Aetolian assembly, to settle any public matter on their own
authority. But when the Achaeans met at the usual federal
assembly, they ratified the decree, and published a proclamation
authorising reprisals upon the Aetolians. And when King
Philip appeared before the council at Aegium, and informed
<pb n="303"/>
them at length of all that had taken place, they received
his speech with warmth, and formally renewed
with him personally the friendship which had

knave, if he imagines that, because he shuts his own eyes,
his neighbours cannot see. Their fondness for such tortuous policy proved however, both to the Lacedaemonians and
Aetolians, the source of the greatest disasters; and it is not
one which should commend itself to the imitation either of
individuals or states, if they are well advised.

with each other, I decided that my history of them must also
be distinct, until I came to the point at which they became
inseparably interlaced, and began to tend towards a common
conclusion. Thus both will be made clear,&mdash;the account of their
several commencements: and the time, manner, and causes
which led to the complication and amalgamation, of which I
spoke in my introduction. This point having been reached,
I must thenceforth embrace them all in one uninterrupted
narrative. This amalgamation began towards the end of the
war, in the third year of the 140th Olympiad. From that year,
therefore, my history will, with a due regard to
dates, become a general one. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-118">118</date>.</note> Before that

him in securing his power in <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName>, and partly by bringing against the Aetolians the charges to which they were only

proposals. The fact is that public crimes do not differ from
private, except in quantity and extent; and just as in the case
of petty thieves, what brings them to ruin more than anything else is that they cheat and are unfaithful to each other, so
was it in the case of the Aetolians. They had agreed with
Scerdilaidas to give him half the booty, if he would join them
in their attack upon <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName>; but when, on his consenting to do
so, and actually carrying out his engagement, they had sacked
Cynaetha and carried off a large booty in slaves and cattle,
they gave him no share in the spoil at all. He was therefore
already enraged with them; and required very little persuasion on Philip's part to induce him to accept the proposal,
and agree to join the alliance, on condition of receiving a
yearly subsidy of twenty talents; and, in return, putting to
sea with thirty galleys and carrying on a naval war with the
Aetolians.</p></div2>

<p>While Philip was thus engaged, the commissioners sent

The first place they came to was <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>;
and the Acarnanians, with a noble promptitude,
confirmed the decree and undertook to join the war against
the Aetolians with their full forces. And yet they, if any
one, might have been excused if they had put the matter
off, and hesitated, and shown fear of entering upon a
war with their neighbours; both because they lived upon the
frontiers of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, and still more because they were peculiarly open to attack, and, most of all, because they had a short
time before experienced the most dreadful disasters from the
enmity of the Aetolians. But I imagine that men of noble
nature, whether in private or public affairs, look upon duty as
the highest consideration; and in adherence to this principle
no people in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> have been more frequently conspicuous
than the Acarnanians, although the forces at their command
were but slender. With them, above all others in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, an

with ignoble duplicity they told the Aetolian envoys that they

much against the will of the people at large, by the Ephors

<head>The Messenians Too Much Inclined to Peace</head>
<p>The Messenian leaders, then, being of oligarchical
tendencies, and aiming at their own immediate advantage, were
always too much inclined to peace. On many critical occasions
indeed they managed to elude fear and danger: but all the while
this policy of theirs was accumulating a heavy retribution for
themselves; and they finally involved their country in the
gravest misfortunes. And the reason in my opinion was this,
that being neighbours to two of the most powerful nations in
the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, or I might almost say in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, I mean the
Arcadians and Lacedaemonians,&mdash;one of which had been
irreconcilably hostile to them from the moment they occupied
the country, and the other disposed to be friendly and protect
them,&mdash;they never frankly accepted hostility to the Spartans, or
friendship with the Arcadians. Accordingly when the attention
of the former was distracted by domestic or foreign war, the
Messenians were secure; for they always enjoyed peace and
tranquillity from the fact of their country lying out of the road:
but when the Lacedaemonians, having nothing else on hand
to distract their attention, took to inflicting injuries on them,
they were unable to withstand the superior strength of the
Lacedaemonians by their own power; and, having failed to
secure the support of their true friends, who were ready to do
anything for their protection, they were reduced to the alternatives of becoming the slaves of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and enduring her
heavy exactions; or of leaving their homes to escape from this
servitude, abandoning their country with wives and children.
And this has repeatedly happened to them within comparatively
recent times.</p>
<p>That the present settlement of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> may prove a
lasting one, so that no measure such as I am about to describe
may be ever necessary, is indeed my earnest wish: but if anything does happen to disturb it, and threaten revolutionary
changes, the only hope for the Messenians and Megalopolitans
of continuing to occupy their present territory, that I can see,
<pb n="308"/>
is a recurrence to the policy of Epaminondas. They must
resolve, that is to say, upon a cordial and sincere partnership with each other in every danger and labour.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>Troubles In <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName></head>
<p>And perhaps my observation may receive some
support from ancient history. For, among many other indications, it is a fact that the Messenians did set up a pillar
close to the altar of Zeus Lycaeus in the time of Aristomenes,<note anchored="yes">The hero of the second Messenian war, B. C. <dateRange from="-685" to="-668">685</dateRange>-668 (<bibl n="Paus. 4.14">Pausan. 4, 14-24</bibl>).
The story told by Pausanias, who also quotes these verses, is that Aristocrates,
king of the Arcadians, twice played the traitor to Aristomenes, the Messenian
champion: once at the battle of the Great Trench, and again when Aristomenes renewed the war after his escape from the Pits at Sparta; and that on
the second occasion his own people stoned him to death, and set up this pillar
in the sacred enclosure of Zeus on Mount Lycaeus.</note>
according to the evidence of Callisthenes, in which they inscribed the following verses:
<quote><l>A faithless king will perish soon or late!</l>
<l><placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> tracked him down right easily,</l>
<l>The traitor:&mdash;perjury must meet its fate;</l>
<l>Glory to Zeus, and life to Arcady!</l></quote>
The point of this is, that, having lost their own country, they
pray the gods to save <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> as their second country.<note anchored="yes">But Pausanias represents the pillar as put up by the Arcadians, not the
Messenians (<bibl n="Paus. 4.22.7">4, 22, 7</bibl>).</note> And
it was very natural that they should do so; for not only did
the Arcadians receive them when driven from their own land,
at the time of the Aristomenic war, and make them welcome
to their homes and free of their civic rights; but they also
passed a vote bestowing their daughters in marriage upon those
of the Messenians who were of proper age; and besides all
this, investigated the treason of their king Aristocrates in the
battle of the Trench; and, finding him guilty, put him to death
and utterly destroyed his whole family. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"> B. C. <date value="-362">362</date>. </note> But setting aside
these ancient events, what has happened recently after the
restoration of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> will be sufficient to
support what I have said. For when, upon
the death of Epaminondas leaving the result
of the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> doubtful, the Lacedaemonians
endeavoured to prevent the Messenians from being included.
<pb n="309"/>
in the truce, hoping even then to get <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> into their
own hands, the Megalopolitans, and all the other Arcadians
who were allied with the Messenians, made such a point of
their being admitted to the benefits of the new confederacy,
that they were accepted by the allies and allowed to take the
oaths and share in the provisions of the peace; while the
Lacedaemonians were the only Greeks excluded from the
treaty. With such facts before him, could any one doubt the
soundness of the suggestion I lately made?</p>
<p>I have said thus much for the sake of the Arcadians and
Messenians themselves; that, remembering all the misfortunes
which have befallen their countries at the hands of the
Lacedaemonians, they may cling close to the policy of mutual
affection and fidelity; and let no fear of war, or desire of peace,
induce them to abandon each other in what affects the highest
interests of both.</p></div2>

<head>Machatas Addresses the Spartan Public</head>
<p>In the matter of the commissioners from the allies, to

go back to my story, the behaviour of the
Lacedaemonians was very characteristic. For
their own ill-considered and tortuous policy
had placed them in such a difficulty, that they finally dismissed them without an answer: thus illustrating, as it
seems to me, the truth of the saying, that, "boldness pushed
to extremes amounts to want of sense, and comes to nothing."
Subsequently, however, on the appointment of new Ephors, the
party who had originally promoted the outbreak, and had been
the causes of the massacre, sent to the Aetolians to induce them
to despatch an ambassador to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. The Aetolians gladly
consented, and in a short time Machatas arrived there in that
capacity. Pressure was at once put upon the Ephors to
allow Machatas to address the people,<note anchored="yes">The text is uncertain here.</note> and to re-establish
royalty in accordance with the ancient constitution, and not to
allow the Heraclid dynasty to be any longer suppressed, contrary
to the laws. The Ephors were annoyed at the proposal, but
were unable to withstand the pressure, and afraid of a rising
of the younger men: they therefore answered that the question
of restoring the kings must be reserved for future consideration;
but they consented to grant Machatas an opportunity of addressing
<pb n="310"/> a public assembly. When the people accordingly were met,
Machatas came forward, and in a long speech urged them to
embrace the alliance with <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>; inveighing in reckless and
audacious terms against the Macedonians, while he went
beyond all reason and truth in his commendations of the
Aetolians. Upon his retirement, there was a long and animated
debate between those who supported the Aetolians and
advised the adoption of their alliance, and those who took the
opposite side. When, however, some of the elders reminded
the people of the good services rendered them by Antigonus
and the Macedonians, and the injuries inflicted on them by
Charixenus and Timaeus,&mdash;when the Aetolians invaded them
with their full force and ravaged their territory, enslaved the
neighbouring villages, and laid a plot for attacking <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>
itself by a fraudulent and forcible restoration of exiles,&mdash;these
words produced a great revulsion of feeling, and the people
finally decided to maintain the alliance with Philip and the
Macedonians. Machatas accordingly had to go home without
attaining the object of his mission.</p></div2>

<p>The party, however, at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> who were the original
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Murder of the Ephors, B. C. <date value="-220">220</date>.</note>
instigators of the outbreak could not make up
their minds to give way. They once more therefore determined to commit a crime of the most
impious description, having first corrupted some of the
younger men. It was an ancestral custom that, at a certain
sacrifice, all citizens of military age should join fully armed in
a procession to the temple of Athene of the Brazen-house,
while the Ephors remained in the sacred precinct and completed the sacrifice. As the young men therefore were
conducting the procession, some of them suddenly fell upon
the Ephors, while they were engaged with the sacrifice, and
slew them. The enormity of this crime will be made apparent
by remembering that the sanctity of this temple was such, that
it gave a safe asylum even to criminals condemned to death;
whereas its privileges were now by the cruelty of these
audacious men treated with such contempt, that the whole of
the Ephors were butchered round the altar and the table of the
goddess. In pursuance of their purpose they next killed one
of the elders, Gyridas, and drove into exile those who had
<pb n="311"/>
spoken against the Aetolians. They then chose some of
their own body as Ephors, and made an alliance with the
Aetolians. Their motives for doing all this, for incurring the
enmity of the Achaeans, for their ingratitude to the Macedonians,
and generally for their unjustifiable conduct towards all, was
before everything else their devotion to Cleomenes, and the
hopes and expectations they continued to cherish that he
would return to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> in safety. So true it is that men who
have the tact to ingratiate themselves with those who
surround them can, even when far removed, leave in their
hearts very effective materials for kindling the flame of a
renewed popularity. This people for instance, to say nothing
of other examples, after nearly three years of constitutional
government, following the banishment of Cleomenes, without
once thinking of appointing kings at Sparta, no sooner heard
of the death of Cleomenes than they were eager&mdash;populace
and Ephors alike&mdash;to restore kingly rule. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Agesipolis appointed king. </note>
Accordingly the Ephors who were in sympathy with the conspirators, and who had
made the alliance with <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> which I just now mentioned, did
so. One of these kings so restored they appointed in accordance with the regular and legal succession, namely Agesipolis.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg"> B. C. <date value="-242">242</date>. </note> He was a child at the time, a son of Agesipolis, and grandson of
that Cleombrotus who had become king, as the
next of kin to this family, when Leonidas was
driven from office. As guardian of the young king they elected
Cleomenes, son of Cleombrotus and brother of Agesipolis.</p>
<p>Of the other royal house there were surviving two sons of<note anchored="yes" place="marg">and Lycurgas.</note>
Archidamus, son of Eudamidas, by the daughter
of Hippodemon; as well as Hippodemon himself, the son of Agesilaus, and several other members of
the same branch, though somewhat less closely connected
than those I have mentioned. But these were all passed
over, and Lycurgus was appointed king, none of whose
ancestors had ever enjoyed that title. A present of a
talent to each of the Ephors made him "descendant of
Hercules" and king of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. So true is it all the world
over that such nobility<note anchored="yes">Rending with Hultsch, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ kala\.</foreign></note> is a mere question of a little money.

their hopes rested, was still busy with his preparations; the

can sail in or out against its will. The <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> therefore
being rich in what the rest of the world requires for the
support of life, the Byzantines are absolute masters of all such
things. For those commodities which are the first necessaries
of existence, cattle and slaves, are confessedly supplied by the
districts round the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> in greater profusion, and of better
quality, than by any others: and for luxuries, they supply us with
honey, wax, and salt-fish in great abundance; while they take
our superfluous stock of olive oil and every kind of wine. In the
matter of corn there is a mutual interchange, they supplying or
taking it as it happens to be convenient. Now the Greeks
would necessarily have been excluded entirely from traffic in
these articles, or at least would have had to carry it on at a
loss, if the Byzantines had adopted a hostile attitude, and made
<pb n="314"/>
common cause formerly with the Gauls, or still more at this
time with the Thracians, or had abandoned the place altogether:
for owing to the narrowness of the strait, and the number of
the barbarians along its shores, it would have become entirely
impassable to our ships. The Byzantines themselves probably
feel the advantages of the situation, in the supplies of the
necessaries of life, more than any one else; for their superfluity
finds a ready means of export, and what they lack is readily
imported, with profit to themselves, and without difficulty or
danger: but other people too, as I have said, get a great
many commodities by their means. As common benefactors

Between Calchedon and <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> the channel is fourteen
stades broad, and this is the entrance at the end nearest the
<pb n="315"/>
Propontis. Coming from the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, it begins at a place
called Hieron, at which they say that Jason on his return
voyage from <placeName key="tgn,7016642">Colchis</placeName> first sacrificed to the twelve gods. This
place is on the Asiatic side, and its distance from the European
coast is twelve stades, measuring to Sarapieium, which lies
exactly opposite in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>. There are two causes which account
for the fact that the waters, both of the Maeotic lake and the
<placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, continually flow outwards. One is patent at once to
every observer, namely, that by the continual discharge of
many streams into basins which are of definite circumference and
content, the water necessarily is continually increasing in bulk,
and, had there been no outlet, would inevitably have encroached
more and more, and occupied an ever enlarging area in the
depression: but as outlets do exist, the surplus water is carried
off by a natural process, and runs perpetually through the
channels that are there to receive it. The second cause is the
alluvial soil brought down, in immense quantities of every
description, by the rivers swollen from heavy rains, which
forms shelving banks and continually forces the water to take
a higher level, which is thus also carried through these outlets.
Now as this process of alluvial deposit and influx of water is
unceasing and continuous, so also the discharge through the
channels is necessarily unceasing and continuous.</p>
<p>These are the true causes of the outflow of the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>,
which do not depend for their credit on the stories of
merchants, but upon the actual observation of nature, which is
the most accurate method discoverable.</p></div2>

<head>The Black Sea Being Silted Up</head>
<p>As I have started this topic I must not, as most
historians do, leave any point undiscussed, or only barely
stated. My object is rather to give information, and to clear
up doubtful points for my readers. This is the peculiarity of
the present day, in which every sea and land has been thrown
open to travellers; and in which, therefore, one can no longer
employ the evidence of poets and fabulists, as my predecessors
have done on very many points, "offering," as Heraclitus says,
"tainted witnesses to disputed facts,"&mdash;but I must try to
make my narrative in itself carry conviction to my readers.</p>
<p>I say then the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> has long been in process of being
filled up with mud, and that this process is actually going on
<pb n="316"/>
now: and further, that in process of time both it and the
Propontis, assuming the same local conditions to be maintained, and the causes of the alluvial deposit to continue
active, will be entirely filled up. For time being infinite, and
the depressions most undoubtedly finite, it is plain that, even
though the amount of deposit be small, they must in course of
time be filled. For a finite process, whether of accretion or
decrease, must, if we presuppose infinite time, be eventually
completed, however infinitesimal its progressive stages may be.
In the present instance the amount of soil deposited being not
small, but exceedingly large, it is plain that the result I
mentioned will not be remote but rapid. And, in fact, it is
evident that it is already taking place. The Maeotic lake is
already so much choked up, that the greater part of it is only
from seven to five fathoms deep, and accordingly cannot any
longer be passed by large ships without a pilot. And having
moreover been originally a sea precisely on a level with the
<placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, it is now a freshwater lake: the sea-water has been
expelled by the silting up of the bottom, and the discharge of
the rivers has entirely overpowered it. The same will happen
to the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, and indeed is taking place at this moment; and
though it is not evident to ordinary observers, owing to the
vastness of its basin, yet a moderately attentive study will
discover even now what is going on.</p></div2>

<head>Flow of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName> into the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName></head>
<p>For the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName> discharging itself into the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> by
several mouths, we find opposite it a bank formed by the mud
discharged from these mouths extending for nearly a thousand
stades, at a distance of a day's sail from the shore as it now exists;
upon which ships sailing to the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> run, while apparently still
in deep water, and find themselves unexpectedly stranded on
the sandbanks which the sailors call the Breasts. That this
deposit is not close to the shore, but projected to some distance,
must be accounted for thus: exactly as far as the currents of
the rivers retain their force from the strength of the descending
stream, and overpower that of the sea, it must of course follow
that to that distance the earth, and whatever else is carried
down by the rivers, would be projected, and neither settle nor
become fixed until it is reached. But when the force of the
currents has become quite spent by the depth and bulk of the
<pb n="317"/>
sea, it is but natural that the soil held in solution should settle
down and assume a fixed position. This is the explanation of
the fact, that, in the case of large and rapid rivers, such embankments are at considerable distances, and the sea close in shore
deep; while in the case of smaller and more sluggish streams, these
sandbanks are at their mouths. The strongest proof of this is
furnished by the case of heavy rains; for when they occur,
rivers of inferior size, overpowering the waves at their mouths,
project the alluvial deposit out to sea, to a distance exactly in
proportion to the force of the streams thus discharging themselves. It would be mere foolish scepticism to disbelieve in
the enormous size of this sandbank, and in the mass of stones,
timber, and earth carried down by the rivers; when we often see
with our own eyes an insignificant stream suddenly swell into
a torrent, and force its way over lofty rocks, sweeping along
with it every kind of timber, soil, and stones, and making such
huge moraines, that at times the appearance of a locality
becomes in a brief period difficult to recognise.<note anchored="yes">However cogent may be the reasons for his prophecy
adduced by Polybius, there are no signs of its being fulfilled. Indeed, the bank at the mouth
of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913">Danube</placeName>, which he mentions, has long disappeared. The fact seems to
be that he failed to take into calculation the constant rush of water out of the
Euxine, which is sufficient to carry off any amount of alluvial deposit.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c42" type="chapter" n="42">
<head>Concentration of Salt</head>
<p>This should prevent any surprise that rivers of such
magnitude and rapidity, flowing perpetually instead of intermittently, should produce these effects and end by filling up
the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>. For it is not a mere probability, but a logical
certainty, that this must happen. And a proof of what is going
to take place is this, that in the same proportion as the
Maeotic lake is less salt than the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> is less
so than the Mediterranean. From which it is manifest that,
when the time which it has taken for the Maeotic lake to fill
up shall have been extended in proportion to the excess of the
Pontic over the Maeotic basin, then the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> will also
become like a marsh and lake, and filled with fresh water like
the Maeotic lake: nay, we must suppose that the process will
be somewhat more rapid, insomuch as the rivers falling into
it are more numerous and more rapid. I have said thus much
in answer to the incredulity of those who cannot believe that
<pb n="318"/>
the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> is actually being silted up, and will some day be
filled; and that so vast a sea will ever become a lake or marsh.
But I have another and higher object also in thus speaking:
which is to prevent our ignorance from forcing us to give a
childish credence to every traveller's tale and marvel related
by voyagers; and that, by possessing certain indications of the
truth, we may be enabled by them to test the truth or falsehood
of anything alleged by this or that person.</p></div2>

of the site of <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>. The length of the

&mdash;half-way between these, on the European side, stands Hermaeum, on a headland jutting out into the channel, about
five stades from the Asiatic coast, just at the narrowest point
of the whole channel; where Darius is said to
have made his bridge of ships across the strait,
when he crossed to invade <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-512">512</date>.</note> In the rest of the channel
the running of the current from the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> is much the same,
owing to the similarity of the coast formation on either side
of it; but when it reaches Hermaeum on the European side,
which I said was the narrowest point, the stream flowing from
the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, and being thus confined, strikes the European coast
with great violence, and then, as though by a rebound from a
blow, dashes against the opposite Asiatic coast, and thence again
sweeps back and strikes the European shore near some headlands called the Hearths: thence it runs rapidly once more to
the spot on the Asiatic side called the Cow, the place on
which the myth declares Io to have first stood after swimming
the channel. Finally the current runs from the Cow right up
to <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, and dividing into two streams on either side of the
city, the lesser part of it forms the gulf called the Horn, while
the greater part swerves once more across. But it has no longer
sufficient way on it to reach the opposite shore on which Calchedon stands: for after its several counter-blows the current, finding
at this point a wider channel, slackens; and no longer makes
short rebounds at right angles from one shore to the other, but
<pb n="319"/>
more and more at an obtuse angle, and accordingly, falling
short of Calchedon, runs down the middle of the channel.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c44" type="chapter" n="44">

<p>What then makes <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> a most excellent site, and
Calchedon the reverse, is just this: and although at first sight
both positions seem equally convenient, the practical fact is
that it is difficult to sail up to the latter, even if you wish to do
so; while the current carries you to the former, whether you
will or no, as I have just now shown. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-410">410</date>.</note> And a proof of my
assertion is this: those who want to cross from Calchedon to
<placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> cannot sail straight across the channel, but coast up
to the Cow and Chrysopolis,&mdash;which the Athenians formerly
seized, by the advice of Alcibiades, when
they for the first time levied customs on

the current, which carries them as a matter of course to
<placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>. And the same is the case with a voyage on
either side of <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>. For if a man is running before a
south wind from the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, or to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> from the
<placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> before the Etesian winds, if he keeps to the European

again to <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>: but if he goes from Calchedon along the

the coast is broken up by deep bays, and that the territory of
<placeName key="perseus,Cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> projects to a considerable distance. Nor can a man
coming from the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> to Calchedon obviate this by
keeping to the European coast as far as <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, and then
striking across to Calchedon; for the current and other circumstances which I have mentioned make it difficult. Similarly,
for one sailing out from Calchedon it is absolutely impossible to make straight for <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>,
owing to the intervening current, and to the fact that both winds are unfavourable
to both voyages; for as the south wind blows into the
<placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, and the north wind from it, the one or the other of
these must be encountered in both these voyages. These,
then, are the advantages enjoyed by <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName> in regard to

<div2 id="b4c45" type="chapter" n="45">
<head>Disadvantages of Byzantium On Land</head>
<p>They consist in the fact that its territory is so completely
<pb n="320"/>  hemmed in by <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> from shore to shore, that the
Byzantines have a perpetual and dangerous

For they are unable once for all to arm and
repel them by a single decisive battle, owing to the number
of their people and chiefs,
three others still more formidable invade their territory. Nor
again do they gain anything by consenting to pay tribute
and make terms; for a concession of any sort to one brings at
once five times as many enemies upon them. Therefore, as I
say, they are burdened by a perpetual and dangerous war: for
what can be more hazardous or more formidable than a war
with barbarians living on your borders? Nay, it is not only
this perpetual struggle with danger on land, but, apart from the
evils that always accompany war, they have to endure a misery
like that ascribed by the poets to Tantalus: for being in
possession of an extremely fertile district, no sooner have
they expended their labour upon it and been rewarded by
crops of the finest quality, than the barbarians sweep down,
and either destroy them, or collect and carry them off; and
then, to say nothing of the loss of their labour and expense,
the very excellence of the crops enhances the misery and
distress of seeing them destroyed before their eyes. Still,
habit making them able to endure the war with the Thracians,
they maintained their original connexions with the other
Greeks; but when to their other misfortunes was added the
attack of the Gauls under Comontorius, they were reduced to
a sad state of distress indeed.</p></div2>

their territory: and at last were compelled to agree to pay
them a yearly tribute of eighty talents, until the time of Cavarus,
in whose reign their kingdom came to an end; and their whole
tribe, being in their turn conquered by the Thracians, were
entirely annihilated. It was in these times, then, that being
hard pressed by the payment of these exactions, the Byzantines
first sent embassies to the Greek states with a prayer for aid
and support in their dangerous situation: but being disregarded by the greater number, they, under pressure of
necessity, attempted to levy dues upon ships sailing into the

arguments advanced by their chief magistrates, Hecatorus and
Olympidorus, in their interview with the ambassadors. The
Rhodian envoys accordingly departed without effecting their

<p>The Byzantines took steps of a similar nature, by

For his part Attalus was ready enough to give it: but his

who exercised dominion throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> on this side Taurus,

was treacherously assassinated by Apaturius the <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and
Nicanor. Achaeus, in right of his relationship, promptly
revenged his murder by killing Nicanor and Apaturius; and
taking supreme command of the army and administration,
conducted it with wisdom and integrity. For the opportunity
was a convenient one, and the feeling of the common soldiers
was all in favour of his assuming the crown; yet he refused to
do so, and preserving the royal title for Antiochus the younger,

the recovery of the whole of the territory this side Taurus.

this time the most powerful and formidable of all the kings

assistance of Achaeus; and of being able
to cause Prusias as much alarm and danger
by fetching Tiboetes from <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> as he had done
to them. For Prusias, entering upon the war with all the
animosity which I have described, had seized the place called
Hieron at the entrance of the channel, which the Byzantines
not long before had purchased for a considerable sum of
money, because of its convenient situation; and because they
did not wish to leave in any one else's hands a point of vantage
to be used against merchants sailing into the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, or one

Rhodians adopted an exceedingly able plan to
obtain their object. They perceived that the
resolution of the Byzantines in venturing on
the war rested mainly on their hopes of the
support of Achaeus. Now they knew that the father of
Achaeus was detained at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, and that Achaeus was
exceedingly anxious for his father's safety: they therefore hit
upon the idea of sending an embassy to Ptolemy, and asking
him to deliver this Andromachus to them. This request,

stress upon it: now, however, they were genuinely anxious for
it; that, by doing this favour to Achaeus, they might lay him
under such an obligation to them, that he would be unable to
refuse any request they might make to him. When the
ambassadors arrived, Ptolemy at first deliberated as to detaining Andromachus; because there still remained some points of
dispute between himself and Antiochus unsettled; and Achaeus,
who had recently declared himself king, could exercise a
decisive influence in several important particulars. For
Andromachus was not only father of Achaeus, but brother also
of Laodice, the wife of Seleucus.<note anchored="yes">Of Seleucus Callinicus.</note> However, on a review of
the whole situation, Ptolemy inclined to the Rhodians; and
being anxious to show them every favour, he yielded to their

his son. Having accordingly done this, and having conferred
some additional marks of honour on Achaeus, they deprived the
<pb n="325"/>
Byzantines of their most important hope. And this was not
the only disappointment which the Byzantines had to
encounter; for as Tiboetes was being escorted from
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, he entirely defeated their plans by dying. This
misfortune damped the ardour of the Byzantines, while it
encouraged Prusias to push on the war. On the Asiatic side
he carried it on in person, and with great energy; while on the
European side he hired Thracians who prevented the Byzantines from leaving their gates. For their party being thus
baulked of their hopes, and surrounded on every side by
enemies, the Byzantines began to look about then for some
decent pretext for withdrawing from the war.</p></div2>

with an irretrievable disaster. At that time
the political state of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> as a whole was this.
The Cnossians, in league with the people of
<placeName key="perseus,Gortyn">Gortyn</placeName>, had a short time previously reduced the whole island
under their power, with the exception of the city of <placeName key="perseus,Lyttos">Lyttos</placeName>;

resolved to go to war with it, being bent upon removing
its inhabitants from their homes, as an example and terror to
the rest of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. Accordingly at first the whole of the other
Cretan cities were united in war against <placeName key="perseus,Lyttos">Lyttos</placeName>: but presently
when some jealousy arose from certain trifling causes, as is the

cause with the Lyttians. Among the people of <placeName key="perseus,Gortyn">Gortyn</placeName>,
again, the elder men espoused the side of <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>, the younger
that of <placeName key="perseus,Lyttos">Lyttos</placeName>, and so were in opposition to each other. Taken
by surprise by this disintegration of their allies, the Cnossians
fetched over a thousand men from <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> in virtue of their
alliance: upon which the party of the elders in <placeName key="perseus,Gortyn">Gortyn</placeName>
immediately seized the citadel; introduced the Cnossians
and Aetolians; and either expelled or put to death the young
men, and delivered the city into the hands of the Cnossians.
And at the same time, the Lyttians having gone out with their
full forces on an expedition into the enemy's territory, the
Cnossians got information of the fact, and seized <placeName key="perseus,Lyttos">Lyttos</placeName> while
thus denuded of its defenders. The children and women they
sent to <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>; and having set fire to the town, thrown down
its buildings, and damaged it in every possible way, returned.
When the Lyttians reached home from their expedition, and
saw what had happened, they were struck with such violent
grief that not a man of the whole host had the heart to enter
his native city; but one and all having marched round its
walls, with frequent cries and lamentations over their misfortune
and that of their country, turned back again towards the city
of <placeName key="perseus,Lappa">Lappa</placeName>. The people of <placeName key="perseus,Lappa">Lappa</placeName> gave them a kind and entirely
cordial reception; and having thus in one day become cityless

Cnossians. Thus at one fell swoop was <placeName key="perseus,Lyttos">Lyttos</placeName>, a colony of

Aetolians were at war with King Philip and
the Achaeans, sent ambassadors to the two latter asking

Both requests were granted: they were admitted into the roll

Aetolians a short time before; both of which contingents took
part in the existing war on their respective sides. Nay more,

decided to elect three men, and to grant them a hundred and

of Sinope, being in great anxiety lest Mithridates should
attempt to besiege them both by land and sea, were making
all manner of preparations with this view. Sinope lies on the

it up from sea to sea; the rest of the peninsula stretches out
into the open sea,&mdash;a piece of flat land from which the town
is easily accessible, but surrounded by a steep coast offering
very bad harbourage, and having exceedingly few spots admitting of disembarkation. The Sinopeans then were dreadfully
alarmed lest Mithridates should blockade them, by throwing
up works against their town on the side towards <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and by
making a descent on the opposite side upon the low ground
in front of the town: and they accordingly determined to
strengthen the line of the peninsula, where it was washed by
the sea, by putting up wooden defences and erecting palisades
round the places accessible from the sea; and at the same
time by storing weapons and stationing guards at all points
open to attack: for the whole area is not large, but is capable

at the same time Alexander and Dorimachus,
having succeeded in establishing an intrigue
for the betrayal of <placeName key="perseus,Aegira">Aegira</placeName>, had collected about
twelve hundred Aetolians into Oeanthe, which
is in <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, exactly opposite the above-named
town; and, having prepared vessels to convey
them across the gulf, were waiting for favourable weather for
making the voyage in fulfilment of their design. For a
deserter from Aetolia, who had spent a long time at <placeName key="perseus,Aegira">Aegira</placeName>,
and had had full opportunity of observing that the guards of
the gate towards Aegium were in the habit of getting drunk, and
keeping their watch with great slackness, had again and again
crossed over to Dorimachus; and, laying this fact before him,
had invited him to make the attempt, well knowing that he
was thoroughly accustomed to such practices. The city of
<placeName key="perseus,Aegira">Aegira</placeName> lies on the Peloponnesian coast of the Corinthian gulf,
between the cities of Aegium and <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>, upon some strong
and inaccessible heights, facing towards <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> and that
district of the opposite coast, and standing about seven stades
<pb n="330"/>
back from the sea. At the mouth of the river which flows
past this town Dorimachus dropped anchor under cover of
night, having at length obtained favourable weather for
crossing. He and Alexander, accompanied by Archidamus the
son of Pantaleon and the main body of the Aetolians, then
advanced towards the city along the road leading from Aegium.
But the deserter, with twenty of the most active men, having
made his way by a shorter cut than the others over the cliffs
where there was no road, owing to his knowledge of the
locality, got into the city through a certain water-course and
found the guards of the gate still asleep. Having killed them
while actually in their beds, and cut the bolts of the gates with
their axes, they opened them to the Aetolians. Having thus
surprised the town, they behaved with a conspicuous want of
caution, which eventually saved the people of <placeName key="perseus,Aegira">Aegira</placeName>, and
proved the destruction of the Aetolians themselves. They
seemed to imagine that to get within the gates was all there
was to do in occupying an enemy's town; and accordingly
acted as I shall now describe.</p></div2>

<head>The Aetolians Repulsed At Aegira</head>

near the market-place, and then scattering
in every direction, in their passion for plunder,
rushed into the houses and began carrying off the wealth
they contained. But it was now broad daylight: and the
attack being wholly unexpected and sudden, those of
the Aegiratans whose houses were actually entered by the
enemy, in the utmost terror and alarm, all took to flight and
made their way out of the town, believing it to be completely in
the power of the enemy; but those of them whose houses were
untouched, and who, hearing the shouting, sallied out to the
rescue, all rushed with one accord to the citadel. These last
continually increased in number and confidence; while the
Aetolians on the contrary kept continually becoming less
closely united, and less subject to discipline, from the causes
above mentioned. But Dorimachus, becoming conscious of
his danger, rallied his men and charged the citizens who were
occupying the citadel: imagining that, by acting with decision
and boldness, he would terrify and turn to flight those who
had rallied to defend the town. But the Aegiratans, cheering
<pb n="331"/>
each other on, offered a strenuous resistance, and grappled
gallantly with the Aetolians. The citadel being unwalled, and
the struggle being at close quarters and man to man, the battle
was at first as desperate as might be expected between two
sides, of which one was fighting for country and children, the
other for bare life. Finally the invading Aetolians were repulsed: and the Aegiratans, taking advantage of their higher
position, made a fierce and vigorous charge down the slope
upon the enemy; which struck such terror in them, that in the
confusion that followed the fugitives trampled each other to
death at the gates. Alexander himself fell fighting in the
actual battle; but Archidamus was killed in the struggle and
crush at the gates. Of the main body of Aetolians, some
were trampled to death; others flying over the pathless hills
fell over precipices and broke their necks; while such as
escaped in safety to the ships managed, after shamefully
throwing away their arms, to sail away and escape from what
seemed a desperate danger. Thus it came about that the
Aegiratans having lost their city by their carelessness, unexpectedly regained it by their valour and gallantry.</p></div2>

an ambush and lost a large number of his men: for forty of
his infantry were killed and about two hundred taken prisoners.
Elated by this success, Euripidas a few days afterwards made
another expedition, and seized a fort belonging to the Dymaeans

despairing of assistance from the Strategus, came to a mutual
agreement to cease paying the common contribution to the
Achaean league, and to collect a mercenary army on their own
account, three hundred infantry and fifty horse; and to secure
the country by their means. In this action they were considered to have shown a prudent regard for their own interests,
but not for those of the community at large; for they were
thought to have set an evil example, and supplied a precedent
to those whose wish it was to break up the league. But in
fact the chief blame for their proceeding must rightfully be assigned to the Strategus, who pursued such a dilatory policy, and
slighted or wholly rejected the prayers for help which reached
him from time to time. For as long as he has any hope, from
relations and allies, any man who is in danger will cling to
them; but when in his distress he has to give up that hope, he
is forced to help himself the best way he can. Wherefore we
must not find fault with the people of Tritaea, Pharae, and
<placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName> for having mercenaries on their own account, when the
chief magistrate of the league hesitated to act: but some blame
does attach to them for renouncing the joint contribution.
They certainly were not bound to neglect to secure their own
safety by every opportunity and means in their power; but
they were bound at the same time to keep up their just dues
to the league: especially as the recovery of such payment was

all because they had been the originators of the Achaean

thus turned his arms against the gods as well as men, was not
treated on his return to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> as guilty of impiety, but was
honoured and looked up to. For he had indeed filled the
Aetolians with empty hopes and irrational conceit. From
this time they indulged the idea that no one would venture to
set foot in <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>; while they would be able without resistance
not only to plunder the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, which they were quite

<p>When he heard what had happened in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ambracus taken.</note>
had thus paid on the spot for the selfishness

besiege Ambracus. By an energetic use of
earthworks, and other siege operations, he quickly terrified the
people into submission, and the place surrendered after a delay
of forty days in all. He let the garrison, consisting of five
hundred Aetolians, depart on fixed conditions, and gratified the
cupidity of the Epirotes by handing over Ambracus to them;
while he himself set his army in motion, and marched by way
of <placeName key="perseus,Charadra">Charadra</placeName>, being anxious to cross the Ambracian gulf
where it is narrowest, that is to say, near the Acarnanian
temple called <placeName key="tgn,7010713">Actium</placeName>. For this gulf is a branch of the
Sicilian sea between <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, with a very narrow
opening of less than five stades, but expanding as it extends
inland to a breadth of a hundred stades; while the length of
the whole arm from the open sea is about three hundred
stades. It forms the boundary between <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> on the north
and <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName> on the south. Philip, therefore, having got his

<pb n="335"/>
<placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, came to the city of Phoeteiae, which belonged to

dismissed on parole. Next night, however, five hundred other
Aetolians, believing the town still untaken, came to its relief;
whose arrival being ascertained beforehand by the king, he
stationed some men in ambush at certain convenient spots,
and slew most of the new-comers and captured all but a very
few of the rest. After these events, he distributed a month's
rations of corn among his men from what had been captured,
for a large store was found collected at Phoeteiae, and then
continued his advance into the territory of Stratus. At
about ten stades from that town he pitched his camp on the
banks of the river Achelous; and from that began laying waste
the country without resistance, none of the enemy venturing
out to attack him.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c64" type="chapter" n="64">
<head>Philip Marches Toward Metropolis</head>
<p>Meanwhile the Achaeans, being hard pressed by the

war, and ascertaining that the king was not
far off, sent ambassadors to him begging
for help. They found Philip still in his camp
near Stratus, and there delivered their commission: and
besides the message with which they were charged, they
pointed out to him the richness of the booty which his army
would get from the enemy's country, and tried to persuade him
to cross to Rhium and invade <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. The king listened to
what they had to say, and kept the ambassadors with him,
alleging that he must consider of their request; and meanwhile broke up his camp, and marched in the direction of
Metropolis and Conope. The Aetolians kept possession of the
citadel of Metropolis but abandoned the town: whereupon
Philip set fire to Metropolis, and continued his advance against
Conope. But when the Aetolian horse rallied and ventured
to meet him at the ford of the Achelous, which is about twenty
stades before you reach the town, believing that they would
<pb n="336"/>
either stop his advance altogether, or inflict much damage on
the Macedonians while crossing the river;
the king, fully understanding their tactics,
ordered his light-armed troops to enter the
river first and to cross it in close order, keeping to their
regular companies, and with shields interlocked. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Skirmish on the Achelous.</note> His orders
were obeyed: and as soon as the first company had effected

second and a third company as they crossed. Therefore they
wheeled off discomfited and retired to the city. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ithoria.</note> From this

was fain to confine itself to the protection of

his army, and after wasting this district also without resistance, arrived at Ithoria. This is a position completely
commanding the road, and of extraordinary strength, natural
as well as artificial. On his approach, however, the garrison
occupying the place abandoned it in a panic; and the king,
taking possession, levelled it to the ground: and gave orders
to his skirmishing parties to treat all forts in the district in
the same way.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c65" type="chapter" n="65">
<head>Philip Takes Paeanium</head>
<p>Having thus passed the narrow part of the road, he
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Paeanium.</note>
proceeded at a slow and deliberate pace, giving his army time
to collect booty from the country; and by the time he reached
Oeniadae his army was richly provided with every kind of
goods. But he resolved first to take Paeanium:
and having pitched his camp under its walls,
by a series of assaults carried the place by force,&mdash;
a town not large in circumference, for that was less
than seven stades, but second to none in the construction
of its houses, walls, and towers. The wall of this town
he levelled with its foundation, and, breaking down its
houses, he packed their timbers and tiles with great care upon
rafts, and sent them down the river to Oeniadae. At first the
Aetolians resolved to hold the citadel in Oeniadae, which they
had strengthened with walls and other fortifications; but upon
Philip's approach they evacuated it in a panic. The king
<pb n="337"/>
therefore having taken this city also, advanced from it and
encamped on a certain secure position in Calydonia, called
Elaeus, which had been rendered extraordinarily strong with
walls and other fortifications by Attalus, who undertook the
work for the Aetolians. Having carried this also by assault,
and plundered the whole of Calydonia, the Macedonians returned to Oeniadae. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fortifies Oeniadae.</note> And observing the convenient position
of this place for all purposes, and especially
as providing a place of embarkation for the

For Oeniadae lies on the sea-coast, at the juncture of the
Acarnanian and Aetolian frontiers, just at the entrance of the
Corinthian gulf; and the town faces the sea-coast of <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName> in
the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, and is the nearest point to the promontory
of Araxus in it; for the intervening sea is not more than a hundred stades across. Looking to these facts he fortified the citadel
by itself; and, building a wall round the harbour and dockyards,
was intending to connect them with the citadel, employing
for the construction the materials brought from Paeanium.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c66" type="chapter" n="66">
<head>Philip Recalled To <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName></head>
<p>But whilst he was still engaged on this work, news was
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip recalled to Macedonia by a threatened invasion of Dardani.</note>
brought to the king that the Dardani, suspecting
his intention of invading the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, were
collecting forces and making great preparations
with the determination of invading <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.
When he heard this, Philip made up his mind
that he was bound to go with all speed to the protection of
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>: and accordingly he dismissed the Achaean envoys
with the answer, which he now gave them, that when he had
taken effectual measures with regard to the circumstances that

some Cretans of Philip's army who had left their ranks, and
were prowling about on the track of prey, fell into the hands
of Euripidas, and being questioned by him informed him of
the arrival of the Macedonians. Without saying a word of his
discovery to any one, he at once caused his army to face

nothing at all about the proceedings of the enemy, at daybreak

original plan, determining to march by way of Stymphalus itself
to Caphyae: for it was at that town that he had written to the

deserted by their leader, and panic-struck at what had
happened, remained stationary on the road, not knowing what
to do, or which way to turn. For at first their officers
imagined that the troops they saw were some Achaeans come
out to resist them. What favoured this mistake more than
anything else were the brass shields of the hoplites: for they
imagined that they were Megalopolitans, because the soldiers
of that town had borne shields of that sort at the battle of
<placeName key="perseus,Sellasia">Sellasia</placeName> against Cleomenes, King Antigonus having furnished
them for the occasion. Under this idea, they retired in good
order to some rising ground, by no means despairing of getting
off safely: but as soon as the Macedonians had advanced close
up to them, grasping the true state of the case, they threw
down their shields and fled. About twelve hundred of them
were taken prisoners; but the rest perished utterly, some at
the hands of the Macedonians, and others by falling down
precipices: and finally not more than a hundred altogether
escaped. Having despatched the spoils and the prisoners to

scaling ladders from the towns through which he passed.
<placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName> is a place of acknowledged antiquity,
and a colony of the Arcadian town of Azanis. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A description of <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>.</note>
Taking the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> as a whole, it occupies
a central position in the country; but in regard to <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> it
is on its western frontier, and is close also to the western
border-land of <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>: its position also commands the territory
of the Eleans, with whom at that time it was politically united.
Philip reached this town on the third day after leaving Caphyae,
and pitched his camp on some rising ground overhanging the
city, from which he could in perfect security command a view
both of the whole town and the country round it. But when the
king saw the great strength of the place, he was at a loss what
to do. Along the left side of it rushes a violent winter torrent,
which for the greater part of the winter is impassable, and in
any case renders the city secure and difficult of approach, owing
to the size of the bed which its waters have worn out for themselves by slow degrees, in the course of ages, as it comes rushing
down from the higher ground. On the east again there is a
broad and rapid river, the Erymanthus, about which so many
tales are told. This river is joined by the winter torrent at a
point south of the town, which is thus defended on three sides
by these streams; while the fourth, or northern, side is commanded by a hill, which has been fortified, and serves as a
convenient and efficient citadel. The town has walls also of
unusual size and construction; and besides all this, a reinforcement of Eleans happened to have just come in, and Euripidas
himself was in the town after his escape from Stymphalus.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c71" type="chapter" n="71">
<head>Philip Captures <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName><?head?></head>
<p>The sight of these things caused Philip much anxious
thought. Sometimes he was for giving up his plan of
attacking and besieging the place: at others the excellence of
its situation made him eager to accomplish this. For just as
<pb n="342"/>
it was then a source of danger to the Achaeans and Arcadians,
and a safe place of arms for the Eleans; so
would it on the other hand, if captured,
become a source of safety to the Arcadians,
and a most convenient base of operations for the allies
against the Eleans. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Capture of <placeName key="perseus,Psophis">Psophis</placeName>.</note> These considerations finally decided
him to make the attempt: and he therefore issued orders to
the Macedonians to get their breakfasts at daybreak, and be
ready for service with all preparations completed. Everything
being done as he ordered, the king led his army over the bridge
across the Erymanthus; and no one having offered him resistance,
owing to the unexpectedness of the movement, he arrived
under the walls of the town in gallant style and with formidable
show. Euripidas and the garrison were overpowered with
astonishment; because they had felt certain that the enemy
would not venture on an assault, or try to carry a town of such
strength; and that a siege could not last long either, owing to
the severity of the season. This calculation of chances made
them begin to entertain suspicions of each other, from a misgiving that Philip must have established a secret intrigue with
some persons in the town against it. But finding that nothing
of the sort existed among themselves, the greater number
hurried to the walls to defend them, while the mercenary
Elean soldiers sallied out of a gate in the upper part of the
town to attack the enemy. The king stationed his men who
had ladders at three different spots, and divided the other
Macedonians among these three parties; this being arranged,
he gave the signal by the sound of trumpet, and began the
assault on the walls at once. At first the garrison offered a
spirited resistance and hurled many of the enemy from their
ladders; but when the supply of weapons inside the town, as
well as other necessary materials, began to run short,&mdash;as was to
be expected from the hasty nature of the preparations for
defence,&mdash;and the Macedonians showed no sign of terror, the
next man filling up the place of each who was hurled from the
scaling-ladder, the garrison at length turned to flight, and made
their escape one and all into the citadel. In the king's army
the Macedonians then made good their footing on the wall,
while the Cretans went against the party of mercenaries who
<pb n="343"/>
had sallied from the upper gate, and forced them to throw away
their shields and fly in disorder. Following the fugitives with
slaughter, they forced their way along with them through the
gate: so that the town was captured at all points at once.
The Psophidians with their wives and children retreated into
the citadel, and Euripidas with them, as well as all the soldiers
who had escaped destruction.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c72" type="chapter" n="72">
<head>The People of Psophis Surrender</head>
<p>Having thus carried the place, the Macedonians at once
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Surrender of the citadel of Psophis.</note>
plundered all the furniture of the houses; and then, setting up
their quarters in the houses, took regular possession of the
town. But the people who had taken refuge in a body in the
citadel, having no provisions with them, and
well foreseeing what must happen, made up
their minds to give themselves up to Philip.
They accordingly sent a herald to the king; and having
received a safe-conduct for an embassy, they despatched their
magistrates and Euripidas with them on this mission, who
made terms with the king by which the lives and liberties
of all who were on the citadel, whether citizens or foreigners,
were secured. The ambassadors then returned whence they
came, carrying an order to the people to remain where they
were until the army had marched out, for fear any of the
soldiers should disobey orders and plunder them. A fall of snow
however compelled the king to remain where he was for some
days; in the course of which he summoned a meeting of such
Achaeans as were in the army, and after pointing out to them
the strength and excellent position of the town for the purposes
of the present war, he spoke also of his own friendly disposition towards their nation: and ended by saying, "We hereby
yield up and present this town to the Achaeans; for it is our
purpose to show them all the favour in our power, and to
omit nothing that may testify to our zeal." After receiving
the thanks of Aratus and the meeting, Philip dismissed the
assembly, and getting his army in motion, marched towards
Lasion. The Psophidians descending from the citadel received
back the possession of the town, each man recovering his own
house; while Euripidas departed to <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and thence to

And this result is brought about by the great care and attention
bestowed upon the agricultural class by the government, to
see that their law-suits should be settled on the spot, and every
necessary of life abundantly supplied them. To me it seems
that they owed these laws and customs originally to the wide
extent of their arable land, and still more to the fact that their
lives were under the protection of religion; for, owing to the
Olympic assembly, their territory was especially exempted by
the Greeks from pillage; and they had accordingly been free
from all injury and hostile invasion.

forced to defend their territory and change their
habits of life, they no longer troubled themselves in the least about recovering from the
Greeks their ancient and ancestral immunity from pillage,
but were content to remain exactly as they were. This in my
opinion was a short-sighted policy. For peace is a thing we
all desire, and are willing to submit to anything to obtain: it is
the only one of our so-called blessings that no one questions. If
then there are people who, having the opportunity of obtaining
it, with justice and honour, from the Greeks, without question
and for perpetuity, neglect to do so, or regard other objects as
of superior importance to it, must we not look upon them as
undoubtedly blind to their true interests? But if it be objected
that, by adopting such a mode of life, they would become easily
open to attack and exposed to treachery: I answer that such
an event would be rare, and if it did happen, would be a claim
on the aid of united <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>; but that for minor injuries, having
all the wealth which unbroken peace would be sure to bring
them, they would never have been at a loss for foreign soldiers
or mercenaries to protect them at certain places and times. As
it is, from dread of what is occasional and unlikely, they involve
their country and property in perpetual wars and losses.</p>
<p>My object in thus speaking is to admonish the Eleans: for
they have never had a more favourable time than the present
to get back their ancient privilege of exemption from pillage,
which is universally acknowledged to belong to them. Even
now, some sparks, so to speak, of their old habit remaining,

<head>Capture of <placeName key="perseus,Thalamae">Thalamae</placeName></head>
<p>And therefore during Philip's occupation of the country
the number of prisoners taken was immense;
and the number of those who escaped by
flight still greater. An enormous amount of
movable property, and an enormous crowd of slaves and
cattle, were collected at a place called <placeName key="perseus,Thalamae">Thalamae</placeName>; which was
selected for the purpose, because the approach to it was
narrow and difficult, and the place itself was retired and not
easy to enter. But when the king was informed of the number
<pb n="346"/>  of those who had taken refuge in this place, resolved to
leave nothing unattempted or incomplete, he occupied certain
spots which commanded the approach to it, with his mercenaries: while leaving his baggage and main army in his
entrenched camp, he himself led his peltasts and light-armed
troops through the gorge, and, without meeting with any resistance, came directly under the fortress. The fugitives were
panic-stricken at his approach: for they were utterly inexperienced in war and unprovided with means of defence,&mdash;a
mere rabble hurriedly collected together; they therefore at
once surrendered, and among them two hundred mercenary
soldiers, of various nationalities, who had been brought there by
Amphidamas the Elean Strategus. Having thus become
master of an immense booty in goods, and of more than five
thousand slaves, and having in addition to these driven off an
incalculable number of cattle, Philip now returned to his

<head>Popularity of Philip In the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName></head>
<p>But now a difficulty arose which was created by
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Oppressive conduct of Apelles the Achaeans.</note>
Apelles. Apelles was one of those who had
been left by Antigonus as guardians of his son,
and had, as it happened, more influence than
any one else with the king. He conceived the wish to bring
the Achaeans into the same position as the Thessalians; and
adopted for that purpose a very offensive line of conduct.
The Thessalians were supposed to enjoy their own constitution,
and to have quite a different status to the Macedonians; but
in fact they had exactly the same, and obeyed every order of
the royal ministers. It was with the purpose of bringing about
the same state of things, that this officer now set himself to test
the subservience of the Achaean contingent. At first he confined himself to giving the Macedonian soldiers leave to
eject Achaeans from their quarters, who on any occasion had
taken possession of them first, as well as to wrest from them
any booty they might have taken; but he afterwards treated
them with actual violence, through the agency of his subordinates,
on any trifling pretext; while such as complained of this treatment,
<pb n="347"/>  or took the part of those who were being beaten, he
personally arrested and put into confinement: being convinced
that by this method he would gradually and imperceptibly
bring them into the habit of submitting, without remonstrance,
to any thing which the king might choose to inflict. And this
opinion he deduced from his previous experience in the army of
Antigonus, when he had seen the Achaeans willing to endure
any hardship, on the one condition of escaping from the yoke
of Cleomenes. However, certain young Achaeans held a
meeting, and going to Aratus explained to him the policy
which was being pursued by Apelles: whereupon Aratus at
once went to Philip, feeling that a stand must be made on
this point at once and without delay. He made his statement to the king; who, being informed of the facts, first of
all encouraged the young men by a promise that nothing of
the sort should happen to them again; and then commanded
Apelles not to impose any orders upon the Achaeans without
consulting their own Strategus.</p></div2>

of men with scaling ladders at several points,
and supported each of them with bodies of
mercenaries, and detachments of Macedonian hoplites, on
the rear of these several parties. His orders being fulfilled with enthusiasm and a formidable display of power,
the garrison of <placeName key="perseus,Alipheira">Alipheira</placeName> were kept continually rushing and
rallying to the particular spots to which they saw the Macedonians approaching: and while this was going on, the king
himself took some picked men, and mounted unobserved
over some steep hills up to the suburb of the citadel; and
then, at a given signal, all at once put the scaling ladders to
the walls and began attempting the town. The king was the
first to take the suburb of the acropolis, which had been
abandoned by the garrison; and when this was set on fire,
those who were defending the town walls, foreseeing what must
happen, and afraid that by the fall of the citadel they would
be deprived of their last hope, abandoned the town walls, and
fled into it: whereupon the Macedonians at once took the
walls and the town. Subsequently the garrison on the citadel
sent an embassy to Philip, who granted them their lives, and
received possession of it also by formal surrender.</p></div2>

<head>The People of Lepreum Evict the Garrisons</head>
<p>While these things were going on, the people of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Lepreum.</note>
Lepreum, having seized a certain quarter of
their town, demanded that the Elean, Aetolian,
and Lacedaemonian garrisons (for a reinforcement had come
from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> also) should all alike evacuate the citadel and city.
At first Phillidas refused, and stayed on, hoping to overawe
the citizens; but when the king, despatching Taurion with
a guard of soldiers to <placeName key="tgn,5004240">Phigalia</placeName>, advanced in person towards
Lepreum, and was now close to the town, Phillidas lowered
his tone, and the Lepreates were encouraged in their determination. It was indeed a glorious act of gallantry on their part.
Though there was a garrison within their walls of a thousand
Eleans, a thousand Aetolians with the pirates, five hundred
mercenaries, and two hundred Lacedaemonians, and though
too their citadel was in the occupation of these troops, yet
they ventured to make a stand for the freedom of their
native city, and would not give up hope of deliverance.
Phillidas therefore, seeing that the Lepreates were prepared to
offer a stout resistance, and that the Macedonians were
approaching, evacuated the town with the Eleans and Lacedaemonians. The Cretans, who had been sent by the Spartans,
made their way home through <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>; but Phillidas departed for Samicum. The people of Lepreum, having thus got
control of their own town, sent ambassadors to place it in the
power of Philip. Hearing the news, Philip sent all his army,
except the peltasts and light-armed troops, to Lepreum; and
taking the latter with him, he made all the haste he could to
catch Phillidas. He succeeded so far as to capture all his
<pb n="351"/>
baggage; but Phillidas himself managed to outstrip him and
throw himself into Samicum. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Samicum,</note> The king therefore sat down before this place: and having
sent for the rest of his army from Lepreum, made the garrison believe that he meant to besiege the town. But the
Aetolians and Eleans within it, having nothing ready for
sustaining a siege beyond their bare hands, alarmed at their
situation, held a parley with Philip to secure their lives;
and having obtained leave from him to march out with their
arms, they departed into <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. Thus the king became master
of Samicum on the spot: and this was followed by deputations

the Lacedaemonian, holding that the kingship
belonged to him in virtue of birth, and annoyed at the neglect of his claims by the Ephors

the same course as Cleomenes had done, and gave the common people hopes of land
allotments and redivision of property, the masses would quickly
follow him, he addressed himself to carrying out this policy.
Having therefore agreed with his friends on this subject, and
got as many as two hundred people to join his conspiracy,
he entered upon the execution of his project. But perceiving
that the chief obstacles in the way of the accomplishment
of his design were Lycurgus, and those Ephors who had invested
him with the crown, he directed his first efforts against them.

violent hands upon those opposed to him; tried to rouse his
relations and friends; and declared to the rest of the people
there what hopes of success he had. But when nobody seemed
inclined to join him, but on the contrary a mob began to
collect with threatening looks, he saw how it was, and found a
secret way of leaving the town; and, making his way across

<p>The fact is that the Lacedaemonians enjoyed a most<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Decline of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</note>

resolved little by little to bring the Achaeans under the

scheme were the elder and younger Aratus; and that Philip
was inclined to listen to them, and especially to the elder,
both on account of his former intimacy with Antigonus,
and his pre-eminent influence in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, and, most of all,
because of his readiness of resource and practical ability: he
therefore determined to devote his attention to them, and
enter upon the intrigue against them which I shall proceed to
describe. He sought out in the several cities all such as were
opposed to Aratus, and invited them to visit him: and having
got them into his hands he tried all he could to win their
affections, encouraged them to look upon him as a friend,
and introduced them to Philip. To the king he was always
pointing out that, if he listened to Aratus, he would have to
treat the Achaeans according to the letter of the treaty of
alliance; but that, if he would listen to him, and take men like
those which he had introduced to him into favour, he would
have the whole of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> at his own unfettered disposal.
But what he was most anxious about was the election; being

<p>Meanwhile Apelles, thinking that, by the election
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The intrigue of Apelles.</note>
of the Achaean Strategus through his influence,
he had partly succeeded in his policy, began
once more attacking Aratus, with the view of
entirely detaching Philip from his friendship: and he accordingly determined to make up an accusation against him
grounded on the following circumstance: When Amphidamus,
the Elean Strategus, had been, with the other refugees, made
prisoner at <placeName key="perseus,Thalamae">Thalamae</placeName>, and had been brought among other
captives to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>, he made earnest efforts by the agency
of certain individuals to be allowed an interview with the
king. This favour having been accorded him, he made a
statement to the effect that it was in his power to bring over
the Eleans to the king's side, and induce them to enter into
alliance with him. Philip believed him; and accordingly dismissed
<pb n="355"/>  Amphidamus without ransom, with instructions to
promise the Eleans, that, if they would join the king, he would
restore their captive citizens without ransom, and would himself secure their territory safely from all outside attacks: and
besides this would maintain them in freedom, without impost
or foreign garrison, and in enjoyment of their several constitutions.</p>
<p>But the Eleans refused to listen to the proposal, although
the offer was thought attractive and substantial. Apelles
therefore used this circumstance to found the false accusation
which he now brought before Philip, alleging that Aratus was
not a loyal friend to the Macedonians, nor sincere in his
feelings towards them: "He was responsible for this alienation
of the Eleans; for when the king despatched Amphidamus
from <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> into <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, Aratus took him aside and talked to
him, asserting that it was by no means to the interest of the
Peloponnesians that Philip should become supreme in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>:
and this was the reason of the Eleans despising the king's offers,
and clinging to the friendship of the Aetolians, and persisting
in war against the Macedonians."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c85" type="chapter" n="85">
<head>Apelles Repeats his Accusation to Aratus Before Philip</head>
<p>Regarding the matter as important, the first step the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The king investigates the charge against Aratus.</note>
king took was to summon the elder and
younger Aratus, and order Apelles to repeat
these assertions in their presence: which he
thereupon did in a bold and threatening tone. And upon
the king still not saying a word, he added: "Since his
Majesty finds you, Aratus, so ungrateful and so exceedingly
adverse to his interests, he is determined to summon a meeting
of the Achaeans, and, after making a statement of his reasons,
forthwith to return to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>." Aratus the elder answered
him with a general exhortation to Philip, never to give a hasty or
inconsiderate credit to any thing which might be alleged before
him against his friends and allies: but when any such allegation
were made, to test its truth before accepting it; for that was
the conduct which became a king, and was in every way to his
interest. Wherefore he said, "I claim that you should, in the
present instance of these accusations of Apelles, summon those
who heard my words; and openly produce the man that
informed Apelles of them, and omit no means of ascertaining
<pb n="356"/>
the real truth, before making any statement in regard to these
matters to the Achaeans."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c86" type="chapter" n="86">
<head>Aratus is Cleared</head>
<p>The king approved of this speech, and said that he
would not neglect the matter, but would thoroughly investigate
it. And so for the present the audience was dissolved. But
during the following days, while Apelles failed to bring any
proof of his allegations, Aratus was favoured
by the following combination of circumstances.
While Philip was laying waste their territory,
the Eleans, suspecting Amphidamus of treachery, determined
to arrest him and send him in chains to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>. But getting intelligence of their purpose, he escaped first to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>;
and there, hearing that Philip was at <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName> engaged in the
division of his spoils, he followed him to that town in great
haste. When Aratus heard that Amphidamus had been driven
from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> and was come to <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName>, he was delighted, because
his conscience was quite clear in the matter; and going to the
king demanded that he should summon Amphidamus to his
presence; on the ground that the man to whom the words
were alleged to have been spoken would best know about
the accusations, and would declare the truth; for he had become an exile from his home from Philip's sake, and had now
no hope of safety except in him. These arguments satisfied
the king, who thereupon sent for Amphidamus and ascertained
that the accusation was false. The result was that from that day
forward his liking and respect for Aratus continually increased,
while he began to regard Apelles with suspicion; though being
still under the influence of his old ascendency, he was compelled to connive at many of his actions.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b4c87" type="chapter" n="87">
<head>Further Intrigues of Apelles</head>
<p>Apelles however by no means abandoned his policy. He
began undermining the position of Taurion also, who had been
placed in command of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName> by Antigonus, not indeed openly attacking him, but rather praising his character,
and asserting that he was a proper person to be with the king on
a campaign; his object being to get some one else appointed
to conduct the government of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. This was
indeed a novel method of defamation,&mdash;to damage one's neighbours, not by attacking, but by praising their characters; and
this method of wreaking one's malice, envy, and treachery may
<pb n="357"/>
be regarded as primarily and specially the invention of the
jealousy and selfish ambition of courtiers. In the same spirit
he began making covert attacks upon Alexander, the captain of
the bodyguard, whenever he got an opportunity; being bent
on reconstituting by his own authority even the personal
attendants of the king, and on making a clean sweep of all
arrangements left existing by Antigonus. For as in his life
Antigonus had managed his kingdom and his son with wisdom,
so at his death he made wise provisions for every department
of the State. For in his will he explained to the Macedonians
the nature of these arrangements; and also gave definite
instructions for the future, how and by whom each of these
arrangements was to be carried out: being desirous of leaving
no vantage-ground to the courtiers for mutual rivalry and
strife. Among these arrangements was one selecting Apelles
from among his companions in arms to be one of the guardians
of his son; Leontius to command the peltasts; Megaleas to be
chief secretary; Taurion to be governor of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>;
and Alexander to be captain of the bodyguard. Apelles had
already got Leontius and Megaleas completely under his influence: and he was now desirous to remove Alexander and
Taurion from their offices, and so to control these, as well as
all other departments of the government, by the agency of his
own friends. And he would have easily succeeded in doing
so, had he not raised up an opponent in the person of Aratus.
As it was, he quickly reaped the fruits of his own blind
selfishness and ambition; for that which he purposed inflicting
on his neighbours he had to endure himself, and that within
a very brief space. How and by what means this was brought
about, I must forbear to tell for the present, and must bring
this book to an end: but in subsequent parts of my work I
will endeavour to make every detail of these transactions
clear.</p>
<p>For the present, after concluding the business which I have
described, Philip returned to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and there spent the rest
of the winter season with his friends, while he sent back his
forces to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.

<p>It was at the beginning of this summer that Hannibal entered

his son were indisposed to act for him, because
of the intrigues against them in the matter of the election,
which had been carried on by Apelles; and that Eperatus was
naturally inefficient, and an object of general contempt. These
<pb n="359"/>
facts convinced the king of the folly of Apelles and Leontius,
and he once more decided to stand by Aratus. He therefore
persuaded the magistrates to transfer the assembly to <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>;
and there inviting both the elder and younger Aratus to an
interview, he laid the blame of all that had happened upon
Apelles, and urged them to maintain their original policy.

<div2 id="b5c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Philip Decides to Fight at Sea</head>
<p>Having passed this decree, the Achaeans dispersed to
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The king prepares to carry on the war by sea.</note>
their various cities. And now the king's forces
mustered again from their winter quarters; and
after deliberations with his friends, Philip
decided to transfer the war to the sea. For he had become
convinced that it was only by so doing that he would himself
be able to surprise the enemy at all points at once, and would
best deprive them of the opportunity of coming to each others'
relief; as they were widely scattered, and each would be in
alarm for their own safety, because the approach of an enemy
by sea is so silent and rapid. For he was at war with three
separate nations,&mdash;Aetolians, Lacedaemonians, and Eleans.</p>
<p>Having arrived at this decision, he ordered the ships of
the Achaeans as well as his own to muster at Lechaeum; and
there he made continual experiments in practising the soldiers
of the phalanx to the use of the oar. The Macedonians
answered to his instructions with ready enthusiasm; for they
are in fact the most gallant soldiers on the field of battle, the
promptest to undertake service at sea if need be, and the
most laborious workers at digging trenches, making palisades,
and all such engineering work, in the world: just such as

remained in <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, busied with these practisings and preparations for taking the sea. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fresh intrigue of Apelles.</note> But
Apelles, being neither able to retain an ascendency over Philip, nor to submit to the loss of influence which
resulted from this disregard, entered into a conspiracy with
Leontius and Megaleas, by which it was agreed that these two
men should stay on the spot and damage the king's service by
deliberate neglect; while he went to <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, and contrived
that no supplies should be brought the king from thence for the
promotion of his designs. Having made this arrangement and

for <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, having found some false pretexts to satisfy the king
as to his departure. And while protracting his stay there, he
carried out his sworn agreement with such determination, that,
as all men obeyed him because of this former credit, the king was
at last reduced by want of money to pawn some of the silverplate used at his own table,
to carry on his affairs. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip starts on his naval expedition, B. C. <date value="-218">218</date>.</note>
However, when the ships were all collected, and

six thousand Macedonians and twelve hundred mercenaries.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Philip In Cephallenia</head>
<p>Just at that time the Aetolian Strategus Dorimachus

It is uncertain what the exact meaning of the word is. It seems most

and meant mercenary soldiers (<foreign lang="greek">ne/oi</foreign>) armed like Cretans, that is, as archers.</note> into
<placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>; while the Eleans, in fear of Philip's attempting the siege

citizens, and carefully strengthening the defences of Cyllene.
When Philip saw what was going on, he stationed a force at
<placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName>, consisting of the Achaean-mercenaries, some of the
Cretans serving with him, and some of the Gallic horse,
together with two thousand picked Achaean infantry. These he

the danger of an attack from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>; while he himself, having

arrived off Pronni in Cephallenia. But when he saw that this
fortress was difficult to besiege, and its position a contracted
one, he coasted past it with his fleet and came
to anchor at Palus. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The siege of Palus.</note> Finding that the country
there was full of corn and capable of supporting
an army, he disembarked his troops and encamped close to

them with a trench and palisade, and sent out his Macedonian
soldiers to forage. He himself made a personal inspection of the
town, to see how he could bring his siege-works and artillery to
bear upon the wall. He wished to be able to use the place as a
rendezvous for his allies; but he was also desirous of taking it:
first, because he would thereby deprive the Aetolians of their
most useful support,&mdash;for it was by means of Cephallenian
ships that they made their descents upon the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, and
ravaged the sea-boards of <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>,&mdash;and,
secondly, that he might secure for himself and his allies a
convenient base of operations against the enemy's territory.
For Cephallenia lies exactly opposite the Corinthian Gulf, in
the direction of the Sicilian Sea, and commands the northwestern district of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, and especially <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>; as well

<div2 id="b5c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Philip Besieges Palus</head>
<p>The excellent position, therefore, of the island, both as
a rendezvous for the allies and as a base of attack against the
hostile, or of defence for the friendly, territory, made the king
very anxious to get it into his power. His survey of the town
showed him that it was entirely defended by the sea and steep
hills, except for a short distance in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>,
where the ground was flat; and he accordingly resolved to
erect his works and concentrate his attack at that spot.</p>
<p>While the king was engaged in these operations fifty galleys<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Arrival of the allies at Palus.</note>
arrived from Scerdilaidas, who had been prevented from sending more by the plots and
civil broils throughout <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName>, caused by the
despots of the various cities. There arrived also the appointed
contingents of allies from <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, and even
<placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>; for the Messenians had ceased to excuse themselves
<pb n="362"/>  from taking part in the war ever since the capture of
<placeName key="tgn,5004240">Phigalia</placeName>.</p>
<p>Having now made his arrangements for the siege, and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The walls are undermined and a breach made. Leontius plays the traitor.</note>
having got his catapults and ballistae in
position to annoy the defenders on the walls,
the king harangued his Macedonian troops, and,
bringing his siege-machines up to the walls,
began under their protection to sink mines.
The Macedonians worked with such enthusiastic eagerness
that in a short time two hundred feet of the wall were undermined and underpinned: and the king then approached the
walls and invited the citizens to come to terms. Upon their
refusal, he set fire to the props, and thus brought down
the whole part of the wall that rested upon them simultaneously. Into this breach he first sent his peltasts under the
command of Leontius, divided into cohorts, and with orders
to force their way over the ruin. But Leontius, in fulfilment of
his compact with Apelles, three times running prevented the
soldiers, even after they had carried the breach, from effecting
the capture of the town. He had corrupted beforehand the
most important officers of the several cohorts; and he himself
deliberately affected fear, and shrunk from every service of danger; and finally they were ejected from the town with considerable loss, although they could have mastered the enemy with
ease. When the king saw that the officers were behaving with
cowardice, and that a considerable number of the Macedonian
soldiers were wounded, he abandoned the siege, and deliberated
with his friends on the next step to be taken.</p></div2>

from <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>: the former
urging Philip to prevent Dorimachus's invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>
by himself invading <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, and traversing and plundering the
whole country while there was no one to resist him; the latter
begged him to come to their assistance, representing that in the
<pb n="363"/>
existing state of the Etesian winds the passage from Cephallenia to <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> could be effected in a single day, whereby,
so <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName> of <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> and his colleagues argued, a sudden
and effective attack would be made upon Lycurgus. In
pursuance of his policy Leontius eagerly supported <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName>,
seeing that by this means Philip would absolutely waste the
summer. For it was easy enough to sail to <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>; but to
sail back again, while the Etesian winds prevailed, was impossible. It was plain therefore that Philip would get shut up
in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> with his army, and remain inactive for what
remained of the summer; while the Aetolians would traverse
<placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> and plunder them at their pleasure.
Such was the insidious nature of the advice given by <placeName key="tgn,5000696">Gorgus</placeName>
and Leontius. But Aratus, who was present, advocated an
exactly opposite policy, urging the king to sail to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> and
devote himself to that part of the campaign: for as the
Aetolians had gone on an expedition across the frontier under
Dorimachus, it was a most excellent opportunity for invading

take the Achaean levies, and go to the aid of the Messenians;
while he himself put to sea from Cephallenia, and arrived at

<p>Before they started, Aristophanes the Acarnanian

Strategus arrived with the full levy of his people.
For having in former times suffered many severe
injuries at the hands of the Aetolians, they were
now inspired with a fierce determination to be
revenged upon them and damage them in every
possible way: they gladly therefore seized this opportunity
of getting the help of the Macedonians; and the men who now
appeared in arms were not confined to those forced by law to
serve, but were in some cases past the military age. The
Epirotes were quite as eager to join, and for the same motives;
but owing to the wide extent of their country, and the
suddenness of the Macedonian arrival, they had not been able
to muster their forces in time. As to the Aetolians, Dorimachus
had taken half their army with him, as I have said, while the
the other half he had left at home; thinking that it would be
an adequate reserve to defend the towns and district against
unforeseen contingencies. The king, leaving a sufficient guard
for his baggage, started from Limnaea in the evening, and after
a march of sixty stades pitched his camp: but, having dined
and given his men a short rest, he started again; and marching
right through the night, arrived just as the day was breaking
at the river Achelous, between the towns of Stratus and
Conope, being anxious that his entrance into the district of
Thermus should be sudden and unexpected.</p></div2>

<head>A Rapid March To Thermus</head>
<p>Leontius saw that it was likely that the king would attain

his object, and the Aetolians be unable to
resist him, for the double reason of the speed
and unexpectedness of the Macedonian attack,
and of his having gone to Thermus; for the Aetolians would
never suppose him likely to venture to expose himself so
rashly, seeing the strongly fortified nature of the country,
and would therefore be sure to be caught off their guard and
wholly unprepared for the danger. Clinging still to his
purpose, therefore, he advised the king to encamp on the
Achelous, and rest his army after their night's march; being
anxious to give the Aetolians a short respite to make preparations

<p>The king was now thoroughly annoyed with Leontius: and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The king crosses the Achelous and advances against Thermus.</note>

plundering and devastating the country as he
went, and marching so as to keep Stratus, Agrinium, and
Thestia on his left, Conope, Lysimachia, Trichonium, and
Phytaeum on his right. Arrived at the town of Metapa, which
is on the borders of the Trichonian Lake, and close to the
narrow pass along it, about sixty stades from Thermus, he
found it abandoned by the Aetolians, and occupied it with a
detachment of five hundred men, with a view of its serving as
a fortress to secure both ends of the pass: for the whole shore
of the lake is mountainous and rugged, closely fringed with
forest, and therefore affording but a narrow and difficult path.
He now arranged his order of march, putting the mercenaries
in the van, next them the Illyrians, and then the peltasts and
the men of the phalanx, and thus advanced through the pass;
his rear protected by the Cretans: while the Thracians and
light-armed troops took a different line of country, parallel to
his own, and kept up with him on his right: his left being
secured by the lake for nearly thirty stades.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Thermus</head>
<p>At the end of this distance he arrived at the village of
Pamphia; and having, as in the case of Panapa, secured it by
a guard, he continued his advance towards Thermus: the road
now being not only steep and exceedingly rough, but with
deep precipices also on either side, so as to make the path in
places very dangerous and narrow; and the whole ascent being
nearly thirty stades. But having accomplished this also in a
short time, thanks to the energy with which the Macedonians
conducted the march, he arrived late in the day at Thermus.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The plundering of Thermus.</note> There he pitched a camp, and allowed his men to go off

scouring the plain of Thermus, as well as to
sack the dwelling-houses in Thermus itself,
<pb n="366"/>
which were full, not only of corn and such like provisions, but
of all the most valuable property which the Aetolians
possessed. For as the annual fair and most famous games, as
well as the elections, were held there, everybody kept their most
costly possessions in store at Thermus, to enable them to entertain their friends, and to celebrate the festivals with proper
magnificence. But besides this occasion for the employment
of their property, they expected to find the most complete
security for it there, because no enemy had ever yet ventured
to penetrate to that place; while its natural strength was so
great as to serve as an acropolis to the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>. The
place therefore having been in the enjoyment of peace from
time immemorial, not only were the buildings immediately round
the temple filled with a great variety of property, but the
homesteads on the outskirts also. For that night the army
bivouacked on the spot laden with booty of every description;
but the next morning they selected the most valuable and
portable part of it, and making the rest into a heap in front of
their tents, set fire to it. So also in regard to the dedicated
arms which were hanging up in the porticoes,&mdash;those of them
which were valuable they took down and carried off, some
they exchanged for their own, while the rest they collected
together and burnt. The number of these was more than
fifteen thousand.</p></div2>

<head>Plunder and Sacrilege At Thermus</head>
<p>Up to this point everything was right and fair by the

laws of war; but I do not know how to
characterise their next proceedings. For remembering what the Aetolians had done at
Dium<note anchored="yes">4, 62.</note> and <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>,<note anchored="yes">4, 67.</note> they burnt the colonnades,
and destroyed what were left of the dedicated offerings, some
of which were of costly material, and had been elaborated with
great skill and expense. And they were not content with
destroying the roofs of these buildings with fire, they levelled
them to their foundations; and threw down all the statues, which
numbered no less than two thousand; and many of them they
broke to pieces, sparing only those that were inscribed with
the names or figures of gods. Such they did abstain from
injuring. On the walls also they wrote the celebrated line composed
<pb n="367"/>  by Samus, the son of Chrysogonus, a foster-brother of
the king, whose genius was then beginning to manifest itself.
The line was this&mdash;
<quote><l>"<placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> thou the path the bolt divine has sped?"</l></quote>
And in fact the king and his staff were fully convinced that, in
thus acting, they were obeying the dictates of right and
justice, by retaliating upon the Aetolians with the same
impious outrages as they had themselves committed at Dium.<note anchored="yes">The pun disappears in translation. The line is

But I am clearly of an opposite opinion. And the readiest

from the history of this same royal family of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</p>
<p>For when Antigonus, by his victory in a pitched battle over

any injury to those who had thus fallen into his hands, that
he did not return to his own country until he had bestowed
upon the Lacedaemonians, collectively and individually, some
benefits of the utmost importance. The consequence was
that he was honoured at the time with the title of "Benefactor,"
and after his death with that of "Preserver"; and not only
among the Lacedaemonians, but among the Greeks generally,

<head>The Present Philip Compared to his Ancestors</head>
<p>Take again the case of Philip, the founder of the

family splendour, and the first of the race to establish the
greatness of the kingdom. The success which he obtained,
after his victory over the Athenians at <placeName key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>, was not due so much to his superiority
in arms, as to his justice and humanity. His victory in
the field gave him the mastery only over those immediately
engaged against him; while his equity and moderation
secured his hold upon the entire Athenian people and
their city. For he did not allow his measures to be dictated
by vindictive passion; but laid aside his arms and warlike
<pb n="368"/>
measures, as soon as he found himself in a position to display
the mildness of his temper and the uprightness of his motives.
With this view he dismissed his Athenian prisoners without
ransom, and took measures for the burial of those who had
fallen, and, by the agency of Antipater, caused their bones to
be conveyed home; and presented most of those whom he
released with suits of clothes. And thus, at small expense, his
prudence gained him a most important advantage. The
pride of the Athenians was not proof against such magnanimity;
and they became his zealous supporters, instead of antagonists,
in all his schemes.</p>
<p>Again in the case of Alexander the Great. He was so<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-335">335</date>.</note>
enraged with the Thebans that he sold all the
inhabitants of the town into slavery, and
levelled the city itself with the ground; yet in making
its capture he was careful not to outrage religion, and
took the utmost precautions against even involuntary damage
being done to the temples, or any part of their sacred enclosures. Once more, when he crossed into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, to
avenge on the Persians the impious outrages which they
had inflicted on the Greeks, he did his best to exact the
full penalty from men, but refrained from injuring places
dedicated to the gods; though it was in precisely such that the
injuries of the Persians in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> had been most conspicuous.
These were the precedents which Philip should have called to
mind on this occasion; and so have shown himself the
successor and heir of these men,&mdash;not so much of their power,
as of their principles and magnanimity. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The subsequent decline in Philip's character.</note> But throughout his
life he was exceedingly anxious to establish his relationship
to Alexander and Philip, and yet took not the
least pains to imitate them. The result was
that, as he advanced in years, as his conduct differed from theirs, so his general reputation came to
be different also.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Philip's Crime and Blunder</head>
<p>The present affair was an instance of this. He
imagined that he was doing nothing wrong in giving the rein
to his anger, and retaliating upon the impious acts of the
Aetolians by similar impieties, and "curing ill by ill"; and
while he was always reproaching Scopas and Dorimachus with
<pb n="369"/>
depravity and abandoned wickedness, on the grounds of their
acts of impiety at <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> and Dium, he imagined that, while
emulating their crimes, he would leave quite a different
impression of his character in the minds of those to whom he
spoke. But the fact is, that whereas the taking and demolishing
an enemy's forts, harbours, cities, men, ships and crops, and
other such things, by which our enemy is weakened, and our
own interests and tactics supported, are necessary acts
according to the laws and rights of war; to deface temples,
statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness, and without
any prospect of strengthening oneself or weakening the enemy,
must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity.
For the purpose with which good men wage war is not the
destruction and annihilation of the wrongdoers, but the
reformation and alteration of the wrongful acts. Nor is it
their object to involve the innocent in the destruction of the
guilty, but rather to see that those who are held to be guilty should
share in the preservation and elevation of the guiltless. It is the
act of a tyrant to inflict injury, and so to maintain his power
over unwilling subjects by terror,&mdash;hated, and hating those
under him: but it is the glory of a king to secure, by doing
good to all, that he should rule over willing subjects, whose
love he has earned by humanity and beneficence.</p>
<p>But the best way of appreciating the gravity of Philip's<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The error of such sacrilege as a matter of policy.</note>
mistake is to put before our eyes the idea which
the Aetolians would probably have conceived of
him, had he acted in an opposite way, and destroyed neither colonnades nor statutes, nor done injury to any
of the sacred offerings. For my part I think it would have
been one of the greatest goodness and humanity. For they
would have had on their consciences their own acts at Dium
and <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>; and would have seen unmistakably that,
whereas Philip was absolutely master of the situation, and
could do what he chose, and would have been held fully
justified as far as their deserts went in taking the severest
measures, yet deliberately, from mere gentleness and magnanimity, he refused to copy their conduct in any respect.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Philip Should Not Receive All the Blame</head>
<p>Clearly these considerations would most probably
have led them to condemn themselves, and to view Philip
<pb n="370"/>
with respect and admiration for his kingly and high minded
qualities, shown by his respect for religion and by the moderation of his anger against themselves. For in truth to
conquer one's enemies in integrity and equity is not of less,
but of greater, practical advantage than victories in the field.
In the one case the defeated party yields under compulsion;
in the other with cheerful assent. In the one case the victor
effects his reformation at the cost of great losses; in the other
he recalls the erring to better courses without any damage to
himself. But above all, in the one case the chief credit of the
victory belongs to the soldiers, in the other it falls wholly and
solely to the part of the leaders.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, one ought not to lay all the blame for<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The blame chiefly belongs to Demetrius of Pharos.</note>
what was done on that occasion on Philip, taking
his age into consideration; but chiefly on his
friends, who were in attendance upon him and
co-operating with him, among whom were
Aratus and Demetrius of Pharos. In regard to them it would
not be difficult to assert, even without being there, from
which of the two a counsel of this sort proceeded. For apart
from the general principles animating the whole course of his
life, in which nothing savouring of rashness and want of
judgment can be alleged of Aratus, while the exact contrary
may be said of Demetrius, we have an undisputed instance of
the principles actuating both the one and the other in
analogous circumstances, on which I shall speak in its proper
place.</p></div2>

<head>The Return From Thermus</head>
<p>To return then to Philip. Taking with him as much
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The return of Philip from Thermus.</note>
booty living and dead as he could, he started
from Thermus, returning by the same road as
that by which he had come; putting the booty
and heavy-armed infantry in the van, and reserving the
Acarnanians and mercenaries to bring up the rear. He was
in great haste to get through the difficult passes, because he
expected that the Aetolians, relying on the security of their
strongholds, would harass his rear. And this in fact promptly
took place: for a body of Aetolians, that had collected to the
number of nearly three thousand for the defence of the
country, under the command of Alexander of Trichonium,
<pb n="371"/>
hovered about, concealing themselves in certain secret hiding-places, and not venturing to approach as long as Philip was
on the high ground; but as soon as he got his rear-guard in
motion they promptly threw themselves into Thermus and
began harassing the hindermost of the enemy's column. The
rear being thus thrown into confusion, the attacks and charges
of the Aetolians became more and more furious, encouraged
by the nature of the ground. But Philip had foreseen this
danger, and had provided for it, by stationing his Illyrians
and his best peltasts under cover of a certain hill on the
descent. These men suddenly fell upon the advanced bodies
of the enemy as they were charging; whereupon the rest of
the Aetolian army fled in headlong haste over a wild and
trackless country, with a loss of a hundred and thirty killed, and
about the same number taken prisoners. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Matape.</note> This success relieved
his rear; which, after burning Pamphium, accomplished the
passage of the narrow gorge with rapidity and safety, and
effected a junction with the Macedonians near
Matape, at which place Philip had pitched a
camp and was waiting for his rear-guard to come up. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="tgn,7003793">Acrae</placeName>.</note> Next
day, after levelling Metape to the ground, he advanced to the

the country as he passed, and there encamped
for the night. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Stratus.</note> On the next he marched along the Achelous as
far as Stratus; there he crossed the river, and,
having halted his men out of range, endeavoured
to tempt the garrison outside the walls; for he had been informed that two thousand Aetolian
infantry and about four hundred horse, with five hundred Cretans, had collected into Stratus.
But when no one ventured out, he renewed his march, and
ordered his van to advance towards Limnaea and the ships.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Skirmish at Stratus</head>
<p>But no sooner had his rear passed the town than,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip victorious in a skirmish with the garrison of Stratus.</note>
first, a small body of Aetolian cavalry sallied
out and began harassing the hindmost men;
and then, the whole of the Cretans and some
Aetolian troops having joined their cavalry, the
conflict became more severe, and the rear of Philip's army
were forced to face about and engage the enemy. At first the
conflict was undecided; but on Philip's mercenaries being
<pb n="372"/>
supported by the arrival of the Illyrians, the Aetolian cavalry
and mercenaries gave way and fled in disorder. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Arrival at Limnaea.</note> The royal
troops pursued most of them to the entrance of the gates, or up
to the walls, and killed about a hundred of
them. After this skirmish the garrison remained
inactive, and the rear of the royal army reached
the camp and the ships in safety.</p>
<p>Philip pitched his camp early in the day, and proceeded to
make a thank offering to the gods for the successful issue of
his undertaking; and to invite the officers to a banquet, at
which it was his intention to entertain them all. His view
was that he had ventured upon a dangerous country, and such
as no one had ever ventured to enter with an army before;
while he had not only entered it with an army, but had returned
in safety, after accomplishing all that he had intended. But
while he was thus intent on entertaining his officers in great
elation of mind, Megaleas and Leontius were nursing feelings
of great annoyance at the success of the king. They had
arranged with Apelles to hamper all his plans, but had been
unable to do so; and now saw everything turning out exactly
contrary to their views.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Megaleas and Crinon Fined</head>
<p>Still they came to the banquet, where they from the first
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Megaleas and Leontius betray their chagrin at the king's success.</note>
excited the suspicions of the king and the rest of the company, by showing less joy at the
events than the others present. But as the drinking went on, and grew less and less
moderate, being forced to do just as the others
did, they soon showed themselves in their true colours. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">They assault Aratus.</note> For
as soon as the company broke up, losing control over themselves under the influence of wine, they roamed
about looking for Aratus; and having fallen in
with him on his way home, they first attacked
him with abusive language, and then threw stones at him;
and a number of people coming to the assistance of both
parties, there was a noise and disturbance in the camp. But
the king hearing the noise sent some officers to ascertain the
cause, and to put an end to the disturbance. On their coming
upon the scene, Aratus stated what had occurred, called those
present to witness the truth of his words, and retired to his
<pb n="373"/>
own tent; but Leontius by some unexplained means slipped
away in the crowd. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Megaleas and Crinon held to bail.</note> When informed of what had taken place,
the king sent for Megaleas and Crinon and
rebuked them sharply: and when they not only
expressed no submission, but actually retorted
with a declaration that they would never desist until they had
paid Aratus out, the king, enraged at their words, at once
required them to give security for the payment of a fine of
twenty talents, and ordered them to be placed under arrest.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName></head>
<p>Next morning, too, he sent for Aratus and bade him
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>. Megaleas fined twenty talents.</note>
have no fears, for that he would see that the business was
properly settled. When Leontius learned what had happened
to Megaleas, he came to the king's tent with some peltasts,
believing that, owing to his youth, he should overawe the king,
and quickly induce him to repent of his purpose. Coming
into the royal presence he demanded who had ventured to lay
hands on Megaleas, and lead him to confinement? But when
the king answered with firmness that he had given the order,
Leontius was dismayed; and, with an exclamation of indignant
sorrow, departed in high wrath. Immediately
after getting the fleet across the gulf, and
anchoring at <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>, the king first gave orders
to the officers appointed to distribute the spoils to carry out
that business with all despatch; and then summoned his
friends to council, and tried the case of Megaleas. In his
speech as accuser Aratus went over the crimes of Leontius
and his party from beginning to end; detailed the massacre in
<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> perpetrated by them after the departure of Antigonus;
their arrangement made with Apelles; and finally their contrivance to prevent success at Palus. Of all these accusations he
gave distinct proof, and brought forward witnesses: and
Megaleas and Crinon being entirely unable to refute any of
them, were unanimously condemned by the king's friends.
Crinon remained under arrest, but Leontius went bail for the
payment of the Megaleas's fine. Thus the intrigue of Apelles
and Leontius turned out quite contrary to their original hopes:
for they had expected, by terrifying Aratus and isolating
Philip, to do whatever seemed to suit their interests; whereas
the result had been exactly the reverse.

the army passing along the hills, and wondered what was happening. For they were still in a state of excitement at the news
of Philip which had arrived,&mdash;his destruction

courage and energy beyond his years, with which Philip acted,
reduced all his enemies to a state of the utmost difficulty and
terror. For setting out, as I have shown, from the centre of

than the other allies to undertake it. They
showed indeed great zeal in making the expedition, sending cut the flower of their troops, two thousand
infantry and two hundred cavalry. Owing, however, to their
distance from the seat of war, they arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> after Philip

pressed forward through <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, with a view of
effecting a junction with Philip; and having reached a fort
called Glympes, which is situated on the frontiers of <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, they encamped there in an unskilful and careless
manner: for they neither entrenched themselves with ditch
nor rampart, nor selected an advantageous spot; but trusting
to the friendly disposition of the natives, bivouacked there
unsuspiciously outside the walls of the fortress. But on
news being brought to Lycurgus of the arrival of the
Messenians, he took his mercenaries and some Lacedaemonians with him, and reaching the place before daybreak,
boldly attacked the camp. Ill advised as the proceedings
of the Messenians had been, and especially in advancing
<pb n="377"/>
from <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> with inadequate numbers and without the direction of experts, in the actual hour of danger, when the enemy
was upon them, they did all that circumstances admitted of
to secure their safety. For as soon as they saw the enemy
appearing they abandoned everything and took refuge within
the fort. Accordingly, though Lycurgus captured most of the
horses and the baggage, he did not take a single prisoner, and
only succeeded in killing eight of the cavalry. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Lycurgus resolves to intercept

<p>Leaving directions with his officers and friends as to

occupied the ground near the Menela&iuml;um, with as many as two

several points at once, and draw them up facing the Eurotas, at
the spot where it is nearest the town. Such were the measures

<p>But lest ignorance of the locality should render my story<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Value of local knowledge.</note>
unintelligible and vague, I must describe its
natural features and general position: following
my practice throughout this work of drawing
out the analogies and likenesses between places which are
unknown and those already known and described. For seeing
that in war, whether by sea or land, it is the difference of
position which generally is the cause of failure; and since I
wish all to know, not so much what happened, as how it
happened, I must not pass over local description in detailing
events of any sort, least of all in such as relate to war: and I
must not shrink from using as landmarks, at one time harbours

and seas and islands, at another temples, mountains, or local
names; or, finally, variations in the aspect of the heaven, these
being of the most universal application throughout the world.
For it is thus, and thus only, that it is possible, as I have said,
to bring my readers to a conception of an unknown scene.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c22" type="chapter" n="22">

<p>These then are the features of the country in question.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The position of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and the neighbouring heights.</note>
<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, as a whole, is in the shape of a circle;
and is situated on level ground, broken at
certain points by irregularities and hills. The
river Eurotas flows past it on the east, and for
the greater part of the year is too large to be forded; and the
hills on which the Menela&iuml;um stands are on the other side of
the river, to the south-east of the town, rugged and difficult of
access and exceedingly lofty; they exactly command the space
between the town and the Eurotas, which flows at the very
foot of the hill, the whole valley being at this point no more
than a stade and a half wide. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The dispositions of Lycurgus.</note> Through this Philip was
obliged to pass on his return march, with the
city, and the Lacedaemonians ready and
drawn up for battle, on his left hand, and on
his right the river, and the division of Lycurgus posted upon
the hills. In addition to these arrangements the Lacedaemonians had had recourse to the following device: They
had dammed up the river above the town, and turned the
stream upon the space between the town and the hills; with the
result that the ground became so wet that men could not
keep their feet, to say nothing of horses. The only course,
therefore, left to the king was to lead his men close under the
skirts of the hills, thus presenting to the attack of the enemy
a long line of march, in which it was difficult for one part to
relieve another.</p>
<p>Philip perceived these difficulties, and after consultation<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip succeeds in baffling Lycurgus.</note>
with his friends decided that the matter of most
urgent necessity was to dislodge the division of
Lycurgus, first of all, from the position near the
Menela&iuml;um. He took therefore his mercenaries, peltasts,
and Illyrians, and advanced across the river in the direction of
the hills. Perceiving Philip's design, Lycurgus began getting
his men ready, and exhorted them to face the battle, and
<pb n="379"/>
at the same time displayed the signal to the forces in the
town: whereupon those whose duty it was immediately led
out the troops from the town, as had been arranged, and
drew them up outside the wall, with the cavalry on their right
wing.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Defeat of Lycurgus Near Sparta</head>
<p>When he had got within distance of Lycurgus, Philip
at first ordered the mercenaries to charge alone: and, accordingly, their superiority in arms and position contributed not a
little to give the Lacedaemonians the upper hand at the
beginning of the engagement. But when Philip supported his
men by sending his reserve of peltasts on to the field, and
caused the Illyrians to charge the enemy on the flanks, the
king's mercenaries were encouraged by the appearance of
these reserves to renew the battle with much more vigour than
ever; while Lycurgus's men, terrified at the approach of the
heavy-armed soldiers, gave way and fled, leaving a hundred killed
and rather more prisoners, while the rest escaped into the
town. Lycurgus himself, with a few followers going by a
deserted and pathless route, made his way into the town
under cover of night. Philip secured the hills by means of
the Illyrians; and, accompanied by his light-armed troops and
peltasts, rejoined his main forces. Just at the same time
Aratus, leading the phalanx from Amyclae, had come close
to the town. So the king, after re-crossing the Eurotas, halted
with his light-armed peltasts and cavalry until the heavy-armed
got safely through the narrow part of the road at the foot of
the hills. Then the troops in the city ventured to attack the
covering force of cavalry. There was a serious engagement,
in which the peltasts fought with conspicuous valour; and the
success of Philip being now beyond dispute, he chased the
Lacedaemonians to their very gates, and then, having got his
army safely across the Eurotas he brought up the rear of his
phalanx.</p></div2>

<p>But it was now getting late: and being obliged to

a place at the very mouth of the pass, his
officers having chanced already to have
selected that very place; than which it would be impossible
to find one more advantageous for making an invasion of
<pb n="380"/>
<placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName> by way of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> itself. For it is at the very

<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; being about two stades from the town and right upon

river is entirely covered by a steep, lofty, and entirely
inaccessible rock; while the top of this rock is a table-land of
good soil and well supplied with water, and very conveniently
situated for the exit and entrance of troops. A general,
therefore, who was encamped there, and who had command
of the height overhanging it, would evidently be in a place of
safety as regards the neighbouring town, and in a most
advantageous situation as commanding the entrance and exit
of the narrow pass. Having accordingly encamped himself
on this spot in safety, next day Philip sent forward his baggage;
but drew out his army on the table-land in full view of the
citizens, and remained thus for a short time. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="perseus,Sellasia">Sellasia</placeName>, B. C. <date value="-222">222</date>.</note> Then he wheeled

<p>After this outbreak the king's schemes in <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> met

with certain impediments which prevented their

from <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, and setting forth his own difficulties and the
awkwardness of his position owing to his quarrel with the
king. Now Apelles had been acting in <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> with an
unwarrantable assumption of authority. He gave out that
the king was still a mere boy, and for the most part under his
control, and without independent power over anything; the
management of affairs and the supreme authority in the
kingdom he asserted to belong to himself. Accordingly, the
magistrates and commissioners of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>

annoyed and offended at it,&mdash;Aratus being at his side, and
using skilful means to further his own views; still he kept his
own counsel, and did not let any one see what he intended to
do, or what he had in his mind. In ignorance, therefore, of his
own position, and persuaded that, if he could only come into

Apelles set out from <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> to the assistance
of Leontius. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Apelles rebuffed by the king.</note> On his arrival at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, Leontius,
Ptolemy and Megaleas, being commanders of

pains to incite the young men to go to meet him. He entered
the town, therefore, with great pomp, owing to the number of
officers and soldiers who went to meet him, and proceeded
straight to the royal quarters. But when he would have
entered, according to his former custom, one of the ushers
prevented him, saying that the king was engaged. Troubled
at this unusual repulse, and hesitating for a long while what to
do, Apelles at last turned round and retired. Thereupon all
those who were escorting him began at once openly to fall off
from him and disperse, so that at last he entered his own
lodging, with his children, absolutely alone. So true it is all the
world over that a moment exalts and abases
us; but most especially is this true of courtiers. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Courtiers.</note>
They indeed are exactly like counters on a board, which, according to the pleasure of the calculator, are one moment worth a
farthing, the next a talent. Even so courtiers at the king's
nod are one moment at the summit of prosperity, at another
the objects of pity. When Megaleas saw that the help
he had looked for from Apelles was failing him, he was
exceedingly frightened, and made preparations for flight.
Apelles meanwhile was admitted to the king's banquets and
honours of that sort, but had no share in his council or daily

begging him that, "if he had arrested Leontius on any other
score, not to have him tried on the charges alleged against him
without their presence: for otherwise they should consider
themselves treated with signal contempt, and to be one and all
involved in the condemnation." Such was the freedom of speech
towards their king which the Macedonians always enjoyed.
They added, that "if the arrest was on account of his bail for
Megaleas, they would themselves pay the money by a common
subscription." The king however was so enraged, that he put
Leontius to death sooner than he had intended, owing to the
zeal displayed by the peltasts.</p></div2>

<head>Return to Narrative of the War in <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName></head>
<p>I will first endeavour, in accordance with my original
plan, to give an account of the war between Antiochus and
Ptolemy for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>. Though I am
fully aware that at the period, at which I have stopped in my
Greek history, this war was all but decided and concluded, I
have yet deliberately chosen this particular break and division
in my narrative; believing that I shall effectually provide
against the possibility of mistakes on the part of my readers in
regard to dates, if I indicate in the course of my narrative the
years in this Olympiad in which the events in the several parts
of the world, as well as in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, began and ended. For I
think nothing more essential to the clearness of my history of
this Olympiad than to avoid confusing the several narratives.
Our object should be to distinguish and keep them separate as
much as possible, until we come to the next Olympiad, and
begin setting down the contemporary events in the several
countries under each year. For since I have undertaken to
write, not a particular, but a universal history, and have
<pb n="387"/>
ventured upon a plan on a greater scale, as I have already
shown, than any of my predecessors, it will be necessary also
for me to take greater care than they, as to my method of
treatment and arrangement; so as to secure clearness, both in
the details, and in the general view adopted in my history. I
will accordingly go back a short way in the history of
the kingdoms of Antiochus and Ptolemy, and try to fix upon
a starting-point for my narrative which shall be accepted
and recognised by all: for this is a matter of the first
importance.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c32" type="chapter" n="32">
<head><foreign lang="la">Dimidium Facti Qui Coepit Habet</foreign>, Well Begun is Half Done</head>
<p>For the old saying, "Well begun is half done," was
meant by its inventors to urge the importance of taking the
greater pains to make a good beginning than anything else.
And though some may consider this an exaggeration, in my
opinion it comes short of the truth; for one might say with
confidence, not that "the beginning was half the business," but
rather that it was near being the whole. For how can one
make a good beginning without having first grasped in thought
the complete plan, or without knowing where, with what
object, and with what purpose he is undertaking the business?
Or how can a man sum up a series of events satisfactorily
without a reference to their origin, and without showing his
point of departure, or why and how he has arrived at the
particular crisis at which he finds himself? Therefore both
historian and reader alike should be exceedingly careful to
mark the beginnings of events, with a conviction that their
influence does not stop half-way, but is paramount to the end.
And this is what I shall endeavour to do.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>Previous "Universal" Histories Not Really Universal</head>
<p>I am aware, however, that a similar profession has
been made by many other historians of an intention to write a
universal history, and of undertaking a work on a larger scale
than their predecessors. About these writers, putting out of
the question Ephorus, the first and only man who has really attempted a universal history, I will not mention any name or say
more about them than this,&mdash;that several of my contemporaries,
while professing to write a universal history have imagined that
they could tell the story of the war of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> in
three or four pages. Yet every one knows that events more
numerous or important were never accomplished in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>,
<pb n="388"/>
<placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> than in that war; and that the
Hannibalian war was the most famous and lasting of any that
has taken place except the Sicilian. So momentous was it,
that all the rest of the world were compelled to watch it in
terrified expectation of what would follow from its final
catastrophe. Yet some of these writers, without even giving
as many details of it as those who, after the manner of the
vulgar, inscribe rude records of events on house walls, pretend to have embraced the whole of Greek and foreign history.
The truth of the matter is, that it is a very easy matter to
profess to undertake works of the greatest importance; but by
no means so simple a matter in practice to attain to any
excellence. The former is open to every one with the
requisite audacity: the latter is rare, and is given to few. So
much for those who use pompous language about themselves
and their historical works. I will now return to my narrative.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c34" type="chapter" n="34">
<head>Weakness of Ptolemy Philopator</head>
<p>Immediately after his father's death, Ptolemy Philopator
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of Ptolemy Euergetes, B.C. <date value="-222">222</date>.</note>
put his brother Magas and his partisans to
death, and took possession of the throne of
<placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. He thought that he had now freed himself by this act from domestic danger; and that by the deaths
of Antigonus and Seleucus, and their being respectively
succeeded by mere children like Antiochus and Philip, fortune
had released him from danger abroad. He therefore felt
secure of his position and began conducting his reign as
though it were a perpetual festival. He would attend to no
business, and would hardly grant an interview to the officials
about the court, or at the head of the administrative departments in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. Even his agents abroad found him entirely
careless and indifferent; though his predecessors, far from
taking less interest in foreign affairs, had generally given them
precedence over those of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> itself. For being masters of
<placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, they maintained a threatening
attitude towards the kings of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, both by land and sea; and
were also in a commanding position in regard to the princes of
<placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, as well as the islands, through their possession of the most
splendid cities, strongholds, and harbours all along the seacoast from <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName> to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> and the district round
Lysimachia. Moreover they were favourably placed for an
<pb n="389"/>
attack upon <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> from their possession of
<placeName key="tgn,7007528">Aenus</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Maroneia">Maroneia</placeName>, and more distant cities still. And having
thus stretched forth their hands to remote regions, and long
ago strengthened their position by a ring of princedoms, these
kings had never been anxious about their rule in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; and
had naturally, therefore, given great attention to foreign politics. But when Philopator, absorbed in unworthy intrigues,
and senseless and continuous drunkenness, treated these several
branches of government with equal indifference, it was naturally
not long before more than one was found to lay plots against
his life as well as his power: of whom the first was Cleomenes,
the Spartan.<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b2c69" targOrder="U">2, 69</ref>.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c35" type="chapter" n="35">
<head>Cleomenes Asks for Help from <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName></head>
<p>As long as Euergetes was alive, with whom he had
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cleomenes endeavours to get assistance from the Egyptian court.</note>
agreed to make an alliance and confederacy,
Cleomenes took no steps. But upon that
monarch's death, seeing that the time was
slipping away, and that the peculiar position of
affairs in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> seemed almost to cry aloud for
Cleomenes,&mdash;for Antigonus was dead, the Achaeans involved
in war, and the Lacedaemonians were at one with the
Aetolians in hostility to the Achaeans and Macedonians, which
was the policy originally adopted by Cleomenes,&mdash;then, indeed,
he was actually compelled to use some expedition, and to
bestir himself to secure his departure from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>.
First therefore, in interviews with the king, he urged him to
send him out with the needful amount of supplies and troops;
but not being listened to in this request, he next begged him
earnestly to let him go alone with his own servants; for he
affirmed that the state of affairs was such as to show him sufficient
opportunities for recovering his ancestral throne. The king,
however, for the reasons I have mentioned, taking absolutely
no interest in such matters, nor exercising any foresight
whatever, continued with extraordinary folly and blindness to
neglect the petitions of Cleomenes. But the party of Sosibius,
the leading statesman at the time, took counsel together, and
agreed on the following course of action in regard to him.
They decided not to send him out with a fleet and supplies;
for, owing to the death of Antigonus, they took little account
<pb n="390"/>
of foreign affairs, and thought money spent on such things
would be thrown away. Besides, they were afraid that since
Antigonus was dead, and no one was left who could balance him,
Cleomenes might, if he got <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> into his power quickly and
without trouble, prove a serious and formidable rival to themselves; especially as he had had a clear view of Egyptian
affairs, had learnt to despise the king; and had discovered that
the kingdom had many parts loosely attached, and widely
removed from the centre, and presenting many facilities for
revolutionary movements: for not a few of their ships were at
<placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, and a considerable force of soldiers at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. These
considerations induced them to reject the idea of sending
Cleomenes out with supplies; for they thought it by no means
conducive to their interests to carelessly let a man go, who was
certain to be their opponent and enemy. The other proposal
was to keep him there against his will; but this they all
rejected at once without discussion, on the principle that the
lion and the flock could not safely share the same stall.
Sosibius himself took the lead in regarding this idea with
aversion, and his reason was this.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c36" type="chapter" n="36">
<head>Cleomenes In Alexandria</head>
<p>While engaged in effecting the destruction of Magas
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The reason of the opposition of Sosibius.</note>
and <placeName key="tgn,7016792">Berenice</placeName>, his anxiety at the possible failure
of his attempt, especially through the courageous
character of <placeName key="tgn,7016792">Berenice</placeName>, had forced him to flatter
the courtiers, and give them all hopes of advantage in case
his intrigue succeeded. It was at this juncture that, observing
Cleomenes to stand in need of the king's help, and to be
possessed of a clear understanding and a genuine grasp of the
situation, he admitted him to a knowledge of his design, holding out to him hopes of great advantage. And when
Cleomenes saw that Sosibius was in a state of great anxiety,
and above all afraid of the foreign soldiers and mercenaries,
he bade him not be alarmed; and undertook that the
foreign soldiers should do him no harm, but should
rather be of assistance to him. And on Sosibius expressing surprise rather than conviction at this promise, he
said, "Don't you see that there are three thousand
foreign soldiers here from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, and a thousand
from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>? I have only to nod to these men, and every
<pb n="391"/>
man of them will at once do what I want. With these
all ready to hand, whom do you fear? Surely not mere
Syrians and Carians." Sosibius was much pleased at the
remark at the time, and doubly encouraged in his intrigue
against <placeName key="tgn,7016792">Berenice</placeName>; but ever afterwards, when observing the
indifference of the king, he repeated it to himself, and put
before his eyes the boldness of Cleomenes, and the goodwill
of the foreign contingent towards him.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c37" type="chapter" n="37">
<head>Sosibius Plots Against Cleomenes</head>
<p>These feelings now moved him to advise the king and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The intrigue of Sosibius against Cleomenes.</note>
his friends above all things to arrest and incarcerate Cleomenes: and to carry out this policy
he availed himself of the following circumstance,
which happened conveniently for him. There was a certain
Messenian called Nicagoras, an ancestral guest-friend of the
Lacedaemonian king Archidamus. They had not previously
had much intercourse; but when Archidamus fled from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>,
for fear of Cleomenes, and came to <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName>, not only did
Archidamus show great kindness in receiving him under his
roof and furnishing him with other necessaries, but from the
close association that followed a very warm friendship and
intimacy sprang up between them: and accordingly when
Cleomenes subsequently gave Archidamus some expectation
of being restored to his city, and composing their quarrels,
Nicagoras devoted himself to conducting the negotiation and
settling the terms of their compact. These being ratified,
Archelaus returned to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> relying on the treaty made by
the agency of Nicagoras. But as soon as he met him,
Cleomenes assassinated Archidamus,<note anchored="yes">Archidamus was the brother of Agis, the king of the other line, who had

Phylarchus, represents the murder of Archidamus as not the work of Cleomenes,
but of the same party that had murdered Agis and feared the vengeance of his
brother. (See Thirlwall, 8, p. 158, who agrees with Plutarch.)</note> sparing however Nicagoras and his companions. To the outside world Nicagoras
pretended to be under an obligation to Cleomenes for saving
his life; but in heart he was exceedingly incensed at what had
happened, because he had the discredit of having been the
cause of the king's death. Now it happened that this same
Nicagoras had, a short time before the events of which we are
speaking, come to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> with a cargo of horses. Just as
<pb n="392"/>
he was disembarking he came upon Cleomenes, Panterus, and
Hippitas walking together along the quay. When Cleomenes
saw him, he came up and welcomed him warmly, and asked
him on what business he was come. Upon his replying that
he had brought a cargo of horses, "You had better," said he,
"have brought a cargo of catamites and sakbut girls; for
that is what the present king is fond of." Nicagoras laughed,
and said nothing at the time: but some days afterwards, when
he had, in the course of his horse-sales, become more intimate
with Sosibius, he did Cleomenes the ill turn of repeating his
recent sarcasm; and seeing that Sosibius heard it with
satisfaction, he related to him the whole story of his grievance
against Cleomenes.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c38" type="chapter" n="38">
<head>Cleomenes Is Arrested</head>
<p>Finding then that he was hostile in feeling to
Cleomenes, Sosibius persuaded Nicagoras, partly by presents
given on the spot and partly by promises for the future, to
write a letter accusing Cleomenes, and leave it sealed; that as
soon as he had sailed, as he would do in a few days, his servant
might bring it to him as though sent by Nicagoras. Nicagoras
performed his part in the plot; and after he had sailed, the
letter was brought by the servant to Sosibius, who at once
took the servant and the letter to the king. The servant
stated that Nicagoras had left the letter with orders to deliver
it to Sosibius; and the letter declared that it was the intention
of Cleomenes, if he failed to secure his despatch from the
country with suitable escort and provisions, to stir up a
rebellion against the king. Sosibius at once seized the
opportunity of urging on the king and his friends to take
prompt precautions against Cleomenes and to put him
in ward. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cleomenes put under arrest.</note> This was at once done, and a very
large house was assigned to him in which he
lived under guard, differing from other prisoners
only in the superior size of his prison. Finding himself in
this distressing plight, and with fear of worse for the future,
Cleomenes determined to make the most desperate attempts
for freedom: not so much because he felt confident of success,
&mdash;for he had none of the elements of success in such an enterprise on his side,&mdash;but rather because he was eager to die
nobly, and endure nothing unworthy of the gallantry which he
<pb n="393"/>
had previously displayed. He must, I think, as is usually
the case with men of high courage, have recalled and reflected
upon as his model those words of the hero:<note anchored="yes">Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22.304"><title>Il.,</title> 22, 304</bibl>.</note>&mdash;
<quote lang="en"><l>"Yea, let me die,&mdash;but not a coward's death,</l>

and sent out some flesh of the sacrificial victims,
some garlands, and some wine to his guards.
the latter indulged in these good things unsuspiciously, and
became completely drunk; whereupon Cleomenes walked out
about noon, accompanied by his friends and servants armed
with daggers, without being noticed by his guard. As the
party advanced they met Ptolemy in the street, who had been
left by the king in charge of the city; and overawing his
attendants by the audacity of his proceeding, dragged Ptolemy
himself from his chariot and put him in a place of security,
while they loudly called upon the crowds of citizens to assert
their freedom. But every one was unprepared for the movement, and therefore no one obeyed their summons or joined
them; and they accordingly turned their steps to the citadel,
with the intention of bursting open the doors and obtaining
the help of the prisoners confined there. But the commanders
of the citadel were on the alert, and learning what was going
to take place had secured the entrance gate: having therefore
failed in this design they killed themselves like brave men and
Spartans.</p>
<p>Such was the end of Cleomenes: a man of brilliant social
qualities, with a natural aptitude for affairs, and, in a word,
endued with all the qualifications of a general and a king.</p></div2>

<head>Origin of War in <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName></head>
<p>Shortly after the catastrophe of Cleomenes, the governor
of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>, who was an Aetolian by birth, resolved to hold
treasonable parley with Antiochus and put the cities of that

partly by the contempt with which Ptolemy's

inspired him; and partly by distrust of the

Coele-Syria: for in that campaign he had rendered signal

it, he had been summoned to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> and barely escaped

of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; and in order to do so, I will go back to the
succession of Antiochus to the throne, and give a summary of
events from that point to the beginning of the war of which I
am to speak.</p>
<p>Antiochus was the younger son of Seleucus Callinicus; and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-226">226</date>.</note>
on the death of his father, and the succession
in right of seniority of his brother Seleucus to

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-223">223</date>. See <ref target="b4c48" targOrder="U">4, 48</ref>.</note> But Seleucus having been
treacherously assassinated after crossing Mount Taurus with his army, as I have already related,
he succeeded to the throne himself; and made
Achaeus governor of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> on this side Taurus,
Molon and his brother Alexander guardians of
his dominions in upper <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>,&mdash;Molon acting as Satrap of Media,
his brother of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c41" type="chapter" n="41">
<head>The Royal Family of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName></head>
<p>These two brothers despising the king for his youth,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Revolt of Molon.</note>
and hoping that Achaeus would join in their
treason, but most of all because they dreaded
the cruel character and malign influence of Hermeias, who
was at that time the chief minister of the entire kingdom,
formed the design of revolting themselves and causing the
upper Satrapies to revolt also.</p>
<p>This Hermeias was a Carian and had obtained his power
by the appointment of the king's brother Seleucus, who had
entrusted it to him when he was setting out on his expedition
<pb n="395"/>
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Intrigues of Hermeias.</note> to the Taurus. Invested with this authority he at once began
to display jealousy of all those about the court
who were in any way prominent; and being
cruel by nature he inflicted punishment on
some for acts of ignorance, on which he always managed
to place the worst interpretation; while against others he
brought trumped-up and lying charges, and then acted towards
them the part of an inflexible and harsh judge. But his chief
end and object was to secure the destruction of Epigenes who
had brought home the forces which had accompanied Seleucus;
because he saw that he was a man of eloquence and practical
ability, and highly acceptable to the army. With this design
he was ever on the watch to lay hold of some handle or
pretext against him. Accordingly when a council was
summoned on the subject of Molon's revolt, and when the
king bade each councillor deliver his opinion on the measures
to be taken against the rebels, Epigenes spoke first and urged
that "there ought to be no delay, but the matter should be
taken in hand at once; and that, first and foremost, the king
should go in person to the district, and be ready to seize the
right moments for action. For the actual presence of the king,
and his appearance at the head of an army before the eyes of
the common people, would prevent the party of Molon from
venturing upon revolutionary measures at all; or if they had
the audacity to do so, and persisted in their design, they would
be quickly arrested by the populace and handed over into the
king's power."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c42" type="chapter" n="42">
<head>Antiochus Encouraged to Attack <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName></head>
<p>While Epigenes was still speaking in this strain,
Hermeias, in a burst of rage, exclaimed, "That Epigenes had
long been secretly plotting treason against the king; but that
now he had happily shown his real sentiments by the advice
which he had given, proving how eager he was to expose the
king's person to the rebels with an insignificant guard." For the
present he was content with making this insinuation as fuel for
a future outburst of slander, and without further reference to
Epigenes, after what was rather an ill-timed ebullition of temper
than serious hostility, he delivered his own opinion; which, from
his fear of the danger and his inexperience in war, was against
undertaking the expedition against Molon personally, but was
<pb n="396"/>
warmly in favour of an attack upon Ptolemy; because he was
of opinion that this latter war would involve no danger, owing
to that monarch's cowardly character. For the present he
overawed the rest of the council into agreement with him: and
he thereupon sent Xenon and Theodotus Hemiolius with an
army against Molon; while he employed himself in continually
inciting Antiochus to undertake the expedition into <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>: thinking that it was only by involving the young king in
war on every side that he could escape punishment for his
past misdeeds, and avoid being deprived of his position of
authority; for the king would have need of his services when
he found himself surrounded by struggles and dangers. With
this object in view, he finally hit on the device of forging a
letter, which he presented to the king as having been sent by
Achaeus. In it Achaeus was made to state that "Ptolemy
had urged him to assert his right to the government: and promised to supply him with ships and money for all his attempts,
if he would only take the crown, and come forward in the sight
of all the world as a claimant of the sovereign power; which
he already possessed, in fact, though he grudged himself the
title, and rejected the crown which fortune gave him."</p>
<p>This letter successfully imposed on the king, who became
ready and eager to go on the expedition against Coele-Syria.</p></div2>

shore of the Euxine. Having gone to meet the princess
with all due pomp and splendour, Antiochus immediately
celebrated his nuptials with royal magnificence. The marriage
having been completed, he went to <placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName>; and after proclaiming Laodice queen, devoted himself thenceforth to making
preparation for the war.

<p>Meanwhile Molon had prepared the people of his own<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Molon.</note>
Satrapy to go all lengths, partly by holding out
to them hopes of advantages to be gained, and
partly by working on the fears of their chief men, by means of
forged letters purporting to be from the king, and couched in
threatening terms. He had also a ready coadjutor in his
brother Alexander; and had secured the co-operation of the
neighbouring Satrapies, by winning the goodwill of their leading
men with bribes. It was, therefore, at the head of a large
force that he took the field against the royal generals. Terrified at his approach Xenon and Theodotus retired into the
cities; and Molon, having secured the territory of <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>,
had now a superabundance of supplies.</p></div2>

Of the natural strength and extent of the district it would

of its steppes compares favourably with every other district of
<placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. And again it overlooks some of the most warlike and

which intervenes between <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7016768">Parthia</placeName>; and, moreover,
it borders on and commands the "Caspian Gates," and touches

the barrier of Mount Zagrus, which has an ascent of a

and several other barbarous tribes who have the reputation of
being excellent warriors. Again on the west it is coterminous
<pb n="398"/>
with the tribe called Satrapeii, who are not far from the tribes
which extend as far as the Euxine. Its northern frontier is
fringed by Elymaeans, Aniaracae, Cadusii, and Matiani, and
overlooks that part of the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName> which adjoins the Maeotis.

<head>Xenoetas Sent Against Molon</head>
<p>Being masters, then, of a territory of proportions

worthy of a kingdom, his great power had
made Molon from the first a formidable
enemy: but when the royal generals appeared to have abandoned the country to him, and his own
forces were elated at the successful issue of their first hopes,
the terror which he inspired became absolute, and he was
believed by the Asiatics to be irresistible. Taking advantage
of this, he first of all resolved to cross the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName> and lay siege
to <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>; but when his passage across the river was stopped

<placeName key="tgn,6001610">Ctesiphon</placeName>, and set about preparing winter quarters for his army.</p>
<p>When King Antiochus heard of Molon's advance and the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Xenoetas sent against Molon, B. C. <date value="-221">221</date>.</note>
retreat of his own generals, he was once more for
giving up the expedition against Ptolemy, and
going in person on the campaign against Molon,
and not letting slip the proper time for action. But Hermeias
persisted in his original plan, and despatched the Achaean
Xenoetas against Molon, in command of an army, with full
powers; asserting that against rebels it was fitting that generals
should have the command; but that the king ought to confine
himself to directing plans and conducting national wars against
monarchs. Having therefore the young king entirely in his
power, owing to his age, he set out; and having mustered the
army at <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName> he started thence and arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7002492">Laodiceia</placeName>. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">King Antiochus in <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>.</note> Advancing from that

the desert and entered the ca&ntilde;on called Marsyas, which lies
between the skirts of Libanus and Anti-Libanus, and is contracted into a narrow gorge by those two mountains. Just
where the valley is narrowest it is divided by marshes and
lakes, from which the scented reed is cut.

<head>Xenoetas Has Early Success</head>
<p>On one side of the entrance to this pass lies a place called
Brochi, on the other Gerrha, which leave but a narrow space
between them. After a march of several days through this canon,
and subduing the towns that lay along it, Antiochus arrived
at Gerrha. Finding that Theodotus the Aetolian had already
occupied Gerrha and Brochi, and had secured the narrow road
by the lakes with ditches and palisades and a proper disposition
of guards, the king at first tried to carry the pass by force;
but after sustaining more loss than he inflicted, and finding
that Theodotus remained still stanch, he gave up the
attempt. In the midst of these difficulties news was brought
that Xenoetas had suffered a total defeat and that Molon was
in possession of all the upper country: he therefore abandoned
his foreign expedition and started to relieve his own
dominions.</p>
<p>The fact was that when the general Xenoetas had been despatched with
absolute powers, as I have before<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Xenoetas at first successful.</note>
stated, his unexpected elevation caused him to
treat his friends with haughtiness and his
enemies with overweening temerity. His first move however
was sufficiently prudent. He marched to <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>, and after
sending for Diogenes the governor of <placeName key="tgn,7002147">Susiana</placeName>, and Pythiades
the commander in the <placeName key="tgn,7000228">Persian Gulf</placeName>, he led out his forces and
encamped with the river <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName> protecting his front. But there
he was visited by many men from Molon's camp, who swam
across the river and assured him that, if he would only cross
the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName>, the whole of Molon's army would declare for him;
for the common soldiers were jealous of Molon and warmly
disposed towards the king. Xenoetas was encouraged by
these statements to attempt the passage of the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName>. He
made a feint of bridging the river at a spot where it is divided
by an island; but as he was getting nothing ready for such an
operation, Molon took no notice of his pretended move; while
he was really occupied in collecting boats and getting them
ready with every possible care. Then having selected the most
courageous men, horse and foot, from his entire army, he left
Zeuxis and Pythiades in charge of his camp, and marched up
stream at night about eighty stades above Molon's camp; and
having got his force safely over in boats, encamped them before
<pb n="400"/>
daybreak in an excellent position, nearly surrounded by the
river, and covered where there was no river by marshes and
swamps.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c47" type="chapter" n="47">
<head>Molon Withdraws Toward Media</head>
<p>When Molon learnt what had taken place, he sent his
cavalry, under the idea that they would easily stop those who
were actually crossing, and ride down those who had already
crossed. But as soon as they got near Xenoetas's force, their
ignorance of the ground proved fatal to them without any
enemy to attack them; for they got immersed by their own
weight, and sinking in the lakes were all rendered useless,
while many of them actually lost their lives. Xenoetas, however, feeling sure that if he only approached, Molon's forces
would all desert to him, advanced along the bank of the river and
pitched a camp close to the enemy. Thereupon Molon, either
as a stratagem, or because he really felt some doubt of the
fidelity of his men, and was afraid that some of Xenoetas's
expectations might be fulfilled, left his baggage in his camp
and started under cover of night in the direction of Media.
Xenoetas, imagining that Molon had fled in terror at his approach,
and because he distrusted the fidelity of his own troops, first
attacked and took the enemy's camp, and then sent for his own
cavalry and their baggage from the camp of Zeuxis. He next
summoned the soldiers to a meeting, and told them that they
should feel encouraged and hopeful now that Molon had fled.
With this preface, he ordered them all to attend to their bodily
wants and refresh themselves; as he intended without delay to
go in pursuit of the enemy early next morning.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c48" type="chapter" n="48">
<head>The Fall of Xenoetas</head>
<p>But the soldiers, filled with confidence, and enriched
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Molon returns to his camp.</note>
with every kind of provisions, eagerly turned
to feasting and wine and the demoralisation
which always accompanies such excesses.
But Molon, after marching a considerable distance, caused
his army to get their dinner, and then wheeling round
reappeared at the camp. He found all the enemy scattered
about and drunk, and attacked their palisade just before daybreak. Dismayed by this unexpected danger, and unable to
awake his men from their drunken slumber, Xenoetas and his
staff rushed furiously upon the enemy and were killed. Of
the sleeping soldiers most were killed in their beds, while the
<pb n="401"/>
rest threw themselves into the river and endeavoured to cross
to the opposite camp. The greater part however even of
these perished; for in the blind hurry and confusion which
prevailed, and in the universal panic and dismay, seeing the
camp on the other side divided by so narrow a space, they all
forgot the violence of the stream, and the difficulty of crossing
it, in their eagerness to reach a place of safety. In wild
excitement therefore, and with a blind instinct of self-preservation, they not only hurled themselves into the river,
but threw their beasts of burden in also, with their packs, as
though they thought that the river by some providential
instinct would take their part and convey them safely to the
opposite camp. The result was that the stream presented a
truly pitiable and extraordinary spectacle,&mdash;horses, beasts of
burden, arms, corpses, and every kind of baggage being carried
down the current along with the swimmers.</p>
<p>Having secured the camp of Xenoetas, Molon crossed the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Molon's successful campaign. B.C. <date value="-221">221</date>.</note>
river in perfect safety and without any resistance, as Zeuxis also now fled at his approach;
took possession of the latter's camp, and then
advanced with his whole army to <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>; carried it at the
first assault, Zeuxis and Diomedon the governor of the place
both abandoning it and flying; and advancing from this place
reduced the upper Satrapies to submission without a blow.
That of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName> fell next, and then the Satrapy which lay along
the <placeName key="tgn,7000228">Persian Gulf</placeName>. This brought him to <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>, which he also
carried without a blow; though his assaults upon the citadel
proved unavailing, because Diogenes the general had thrown himself into it before he could get there. He therefore abandoned
the idea of carrying it by storm, and leaving a detachment to
lay siege to it, hurried back with his main army to <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName> on
the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName>. There he took great pains to refresh his army,

<head>Hermeias Overruled</head>
<p>When news of these events was brought to Antiochus, as
I have said before, he gave up all idea of the Coele-Syrian
campaign, and turned all his attention to this war. Another
meeting of his council was thereupon summoned: and on the
<pb n="402"/>
king ordering the members of it to deliver their opinions as to the
tactics to be employed against Molon, the first
to speak on the business was again Epigenes:
who said that "his advice should have been followed all along, and measures have been promptly
taken before the enemy had obtained such important successes:
still even at this late hour they ought to take it in hand
resolutely." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Epigenes put to death by the intrigues of Hermeias.</note> Thereupon Hermeias broke out again into an
unreasonable and violent fit of anger and began to heap abuse
upon Epigenes; and while belauding himself in a fulsome
manner, brought accusations against Epigenes that were
absurd as well as false. He ended by adjuring the king not
to be diverted from his purpose without better reason, nor to
abandon his hopes in <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>. This advice was ill-received
by the majority of the council, and displeasing to Antiochus
himself; and, accordingly, as the king showed great anxiety to
reconcile the two men, Hermeias was at length induced to
put an end to his invectives. The council decided by a
majority that the course recommended by Epigenes was the
most practical and advantageous, and a resolution was come
to that the king should go on the campaign against Molon,
and devote his attention to that. Thereupon Hermeias
promptly made a hypocritical pretence of having changed his
mind: and remarking that it was the duty of all to acquiesce
loyally in the decision, made a great show of readiness and
activity in pushing on the preparations.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c50" type="chapter" n="50">
<head>Death of Epigenes</head>
<p>The forces, however, having been mustered at <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName>,
upon a kind of mutiny arising among the common soldiers,
on account of some arrears of pay, Hermeias, observing the
king to be in a state of anxiety, and to be alarmed at the
disturbance at so critical a moment, offered to discharge all
arrears, if the king would only consent to Epigenes not
accompanying the expedition; on the ground that nothing
could be properly managed in the army when such angry
feelings, and such party spirit, had been excited. The proposal
was very displeasing to the king, who was exceedingly anxious
that Epigenes should accompany him on the campaign, owing
to his experience in the field; but he was bound so
completely hand and foot, and entangled by the craft of
<pb n="403"/>
Hermeias, his skilful finance, constant watchfulness, and
designing flattery, that he was not his own master; and
accordingly he yielded to the necessity of the moment and
consented to his demand. When Epigenes thereupon retired,
as he was bidden, the members of the council were too much
afraid of incurring displeasure to remonstrate; while the army
generally, by a revulsion of feeling, turned with gratitude to
the man to whom they owed the settlement of their claims
for pay. The Cyrrhestae were the only ones that stood out:
and they broke out into open mutiny, and for some time
occasioned much trouble; but, being at last conquered by one
of the king's generals, most of them were killed, and the rest
submitted to the king's mercy. Hermeias having thus secured
the allegiance of his friends by fear, and of the troops by
being of service to them, started on the expedition in company
with the king; while in regard to Epigenes he elaborated the
following plot, with the assistance of Alexis, the commander
of the citadel of <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName>. He wrote a letter purporting to have
been sent from Molon to Epigenes, and persuaded one of the
latter's servants, by holding out the hope of great rewards, to
take it to the house of Epigenes, and mix it with his other
papers. Immediately after this had been done, Alexis came
to the house and asked Epigenes whether he had not received
certain letters from Molon; and, upon his denial, demanded in
menacing terms to be allowed to search. Having entered, he
quickly discovered the letter, which he availed himself of as a
pretext for putting Epigenes to death on the spot. By this
means the king was persuaded to believe that Epigenes had
justly forfeited his life; and though the courtiers had their
suspicions, they were afraid to say anything.</p></div2>

more started on his march and got as far as <placeName key="tgn,7002354">Antioch</placeName>, in Mygdonia, about mid-winter, and there
remained until the worst of the winter should
be over. Thence after a stay of forty days he advanced to
Libba. Molon was now in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>:
and Antiochus consulted his council as to the route to be
pursued, the tactics to be adopted, and the source from which
<pb n="404"/>
provisions could best be obtained for his army on the march
in their expedition against Molon. The proposal of Hermeias
was to march along the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName>, with this river, and the Lycus
and Caprus, on their flank. Zeuxis, having the fate of
Epigenes before his eyes, was in a state of painful doubt
whether to speak his real opinion or no; but as the mistake
involved in the advice of Hermeias was flagrant, he at last
mustered courage to advise that the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName> should be crossed;
alleging as a reason the general difficulty of the road along
the river: especially from the fact that, after a considerable
march, the last six days of which would be through a desert,
they would reach what was called the "King's Dyke," which it
would be impossible to cross if they found it invested by the
enemy; while a retirement by a second march through the
wilderness would be manifestly dangerous, especially as their
provisions would be sure to be running short. On the other
hand he showed that if they crossed the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName> it was evident
the Apolloniates would repent of their treason and join the
king; for even as it was they had submitted to Molon, not from
choice, but under compulsion and terror; and the fertility of
their soil promised abundance of provisions for the troops.
But his most weighty argument was that by their thus acting
Molon would be cut off from a return to Media, and from
drawing supplies from that country, and would thereby be
compelled to risk a general action: or, if he refused to do so,
his troops would promptly fix their hopes upon the king.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c52" type="chapter" n="52">
<head>Antiochus Advances Against Molon</head>
<p>The suggestion of Zeuxis being approved, the army was
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus crosses the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName>.</note>
immediately arranged in three divisions, and got
across with the baggage at three points in the
river. Thence they marched in the direction
of <placeName key="tgn,7002270">Dura</placeName>, where they quickly caused the siege of the citadel to be
raised, which was being invested at the time by some of Molon's
officers; and thence, after a march of eight successive days, they
crossed the mountain called Oreicum and arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Molon had heard of the king's arrival, and not
feeling confidence in the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7002147">Susiana</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylonia</placeName>,
because he had conquered them so recently and by surprise,
fearing also to be cut off from a retreat to Media, he determined to throw a bridge over the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName> and get his army
<pb n="405"/>
across; being eager if it were possible to secure the mountain
district of <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, because he had great confidence in his
corps of slingers called Cyrtii. He carried out
his resolution, and was pushing forward in an
unbroken series of forced marches. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Molon also crosses the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName>.</note> Thus it
came about that, just as he was entering the district of
<placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, the king at the head of his whole army was marching
out. The advanced guard of skirmishers of the two armies
fell in with each other on some high ground, and at first
engaged and made trial of each other's strength; but upon the
main armies on either side coming on to the ground, they
separated. For the present both retired to their respective
entrenchments, and encamped at a distance of forty stades
from each other. When night had fallen, Molon reflected that
there was some risk and disadvantage in a battle
by broad daylight and in the open field between
rebels and their sovereign, and he determined
therefore to attack Antiochus by night. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Abortive attempt of Molon to make a night attack on the king.</note> Selecting

entrenchment where he arrived about daybreak. His arrival
caused a panic in the army; for the troops in the camp,
startled out of their sleep by the arrival of the returning men,
were very near rushing out of the lines.</p></div2>

the king, fully prepared for the engagement, was
marching his whole army out of their lines at
daybreak. On his right wing he stationed his
lancers under the command of Ardys, a man of proved ability
in the field; next to them the Cretan allies, and next the
Gallic Rhigosages. Next these he placed the foreign contingent and mercenary soldiers from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and next to them
he stationed his phalanx: the left wing he assigned to the
cavalry called the "Companions."<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e(/tairoi</foreign> are cavalry;

were ten in number, he placed at intervals in front of
the line. His reserves of infantry and cavalry he divided
between the two wings, with orders to outflank the enemy as
soon as the battle had begun. He then went along the line
and addressed a few words of exhortation to the men suitable
to the occasion; and put Hermeias and Zeuxis in command
of the left wing, taking that of the right himself.</p>
<p>On the other side, owing to the panic caused by his rash<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Molon's disposition.</note>
movement of the previous night, Molon was unable to get his men out of camp, or into position without difficulty and confusion. He did
however divide his cavalry between his two wings, guessing
what the disposition of the enemy would be; and stationed
the scutati and Gauls, and in short all his heavy-armed
men in the space between the two bodies of cavalry. His
archers, slingers, and all such kind of troops he placed
on the outer flank of the cavalry on either wing; while
his scythed chariots he placed at intervals in front of his line.
He gave his brother Neolaus command of the left wing, taking
that of the right himself.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c54" type="chapter" n="54">
<head>Defeat and Death of Molon</head>
<p>When the two armies advanced to the battle, Molon's
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of Molon and his fellow-conspirators.</note>
right wing remained faithful to him, and
vigorously engaged the division of Zeuxis; but
the left wing no sooner came within sight of
the king than it deserted to the enemy: the result of which
was that Molon's army was thrown into consternation, while
the king's troops were inspired with redoubled confidence.
When Molon comprehended what had taken place, and found
himself surrounded on every side, reflecting on the tortures
which would be inflicted upon him if he were taken alive, he
put an end to his own life. So too all who had taken part in the
plot fled severally to their own homes, and terminated their
lives in the same way. Neolaus escaped from the field and
found his way into <placeName key="tgn,7001282">Persis</placeName>, to the house of Molon's brother
Alexander; and there first killed his mother and Molon's children and afterwards himself,
having previously persuaded Alexander to do the same to himself. After plundering the enemy's
camp, the king ordered the body of Molon to be impaled on
the most conspicuous spot in Media: which the men appointed
<pb n="407"/>
to the work immediately did; for they took it to Callonitis
and impaled it close to the pass over Mount Zagrus. The
king, after plundering the enemy's camp, rebuked the rebel
army in a long speech; and finally receiving them back into
favour by holding out his right hand to them, appointed certain
officers to lead them back to Media and settle the affairs of
that district; while he himself went down to <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName> and
made arrangements for the government of the Satrapies round
it, treating all with equal clemency and prudence. But Hermeias acted with his usual harshness: he got up charges
against the people of <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>, and imposed a fine of a thousand talents upon the city; drove their magistrates, called
Adeiganes, into exile; and put many Seleucians to death with
various tortures, by mutilation, the sword and the rack. With
great difficulty, sometimes by dissuading Hermeias, and sometimes by interposing his own authority, the king did at length
put an end to these severities; and, exacting only a fine of a
hundred and fifty talents from the citizens for the error they
had committed, restored the city to a state of order. This

appeared to be the most formidable and able of
all the princes, and who ruled over a tribe called
the Satrapeii, and others on their borders. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Artabazanes.</note> But Hermeias was
at that time afraid of an expedition farther up country, owing to
its danger; and was always yearning for the expedition against
Ptolemy in accordance with his original plan. When news,
however, came that a son had been born to the king, thinking
that Antiochus might possibly fall by the hands of the
<pb n="408"/>
barbarians in upper <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, or give him opportunities of putting
him out of the way, he consented to the expedition; believing
that, if he could only effect the death of Antiochus, he would
be guardian to his son and so sole master of the whole kingdom. This having been decided, the army crossed Mount
Zagrus and entered the territory of Artabazanes, which borders
on Media, and is separated from it by an intervening chain of
mountains. Part of it overlooks the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>, near the valley
of the <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName>; and it extends to the Hyrcanian Sea. Its
inhabitants are numerous and warlike and especially strong in
horsemen; while the district produces within itself all other
things necessary for war. The dynasty has lasted from the
time of the Persians, having been overlooked at the period
of Alexander's conquests. But now in great alarm at the king's
approach, and at his own infirmities, for he was an extremely
old man, Artabazanes yielded to the force of circumstances,
and made a treaty with Antiochus on his own terms.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c56" type="chapter" n="56">
<head>Death of Hermeias</head>
<p>It was after the settlement of this treaty that Apollophanes, the physician, who was regarded with
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fall and death of Hermeias, B. C. 220.</note>
great affection by the king, observing that Hermeias was getting beyond all bounds in his
high place, began to be anxious for the king's safety, and still
more suspicious and uneasy for his own. He took an
opportunity, therefore, of conveying a suggestion to the king,
that he had better not be too careless or unsuspicious of the
audacious character of Hermeias; nor let things go on until he
found himself involved in a disaster like that of his brother.
"The danger," he said, "is not at all remote." And he
begged him to be on his guard, and take prompt measures for
the safety of himself and his friends. Antiochus owned to
him that he disliked and feared Hermeias; and thanked him
for the care of his person, which had emboldened him to
speak to him on the subject. This conversation encouraged
Apollophanes by convincing him that he had not been
mistaken about the feelings and opinions of the king; and
Antiochus begged him not to confine his assistance to words,
but to take some practical steps to secure the safety of himself and his friends. Upon Apollophanes replying that he
was ready to do anything in the world, they concerted the
<pb n="409"/>
following plan. On the pretext of the king being afflicted
with an attack of vertigo, it was given out that the daily
attendance of courtiers and officials was to be discontinued
for a few days: the king and his physician thus getting the
opportunity of conferring with such of his friends as he chose,
who came on the pretext of visiting him. In the course of
these visits suitable persons for carrying out the design were
prepared and instructed; and every one readily responding to
the proposal, from hatred of Hermeias, they proceeded to
complete it. The physicians having prescribed walks at daybreak for Antiochus on account of the coolness, Hermeias
came to the place assigned for the walk, and with him those of
the king's friends who were privy to the design; while the rest
were much too late on account of the time of the king's
coming out being very different from what it had usually been.
Thus they got Hermeias gradually a considerable distance
from the camp, until they came to a certain lonely spot, and
then, on the king's going a little off the road, on the pretence
of a necessary purpose, they stabbed him to death. Such was
the end of Hermeias, whose punishment was by no means
equal to his crimes. Thus freed from much fear and
embarrassment, the king set out on his march home amidst
universal manifestations from the people of the country in
favour of his measures and policy; but nothing was more
emphatically applauded in the course of his progress than the
removal of Hermeias. In <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName>, at the same time, the
women stoned the wife of Hermeias to death, and the boys
his sons.</p></div2>

<head>Achaeus Attempts Treason</head>
<p>When he had reached home and had dismissed his

protesting against his assumption of the diadem and royal
title, and warning him that he was aware of his dealings with
Ptolemy, and of his restless intrigues generally.
For while the king was engaged on his expedition against Artabazanes, Achaeus, being persuaded that Antiochus would fall, or that, if he did not fall,
would be so far off, that it would be possible for him to
invade <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> before his return, and with the assistance of the

arriving at <placeName key="tgn,7002492">Laodiceia</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>, assumed the diadem, and
had the audacity for the first time to adopt the title of king, and
to send royal despatches to the cities, the exile Garsyeris being
his chief adviser in this measure. But as he advanced farther
and farther, and was now almost at <placeName key="tgn,1003785">Lycaonia</placeName>, a mutiny broke
out among his forces, arising from the dissatisfaction of the men
at the idea of being led against their natural king. When
Achaeus found that this disturbed state of feeling existed
among them, he desisted from his enterprise; and wishing to
make his men believe that he had never had any intention of
invading <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, he directed his march into <placeName key="tgn,7016774">Pisidia</placeName>, and
plundered the country. By thus securing large booty for his
army he conciliated its affection and confidence, and then
returned to his own Satrapy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c58" type="chapter" n="58">
<head><placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName></head>
<p>Every detail of these transactions was known to the king:

the war against Ptolemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">War with Ptolemy B. C. <date value="-219">219</date>.</note> Having accordingly

had been made in respect to this undertaking, touching the
nature of the country, the military preparation required, and
the assistance to be rendered by the fleet,&mdash;Apollophanes of
Seleucia, whom I mentioned before, put an abrupt end to all
these suggestions by remarking that "it was folly
to desire <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName> and to march against that,
while they allowed <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName> to be held by

the very inner shrine of the king's realm. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Apollophanes advises that they begin by taking <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>.</note> Besides the disgrace
to the kingdom which its occupation by the Egyptian monarchs
involved, it was a position of the greatest practical importance,
as a most admirable base of operations. Occupied by the
enemy it was of the utmost hindrance to all the king's designs;
for in whatever direction he might have it in his mind to move
his forces, his own country, owing to the fear of danger from
this place, would need as much care and precaution as the
preparations against his foreign enemies. Once taken, on the
<pb n="411"/>
other hand, not only would it perfectly secure the safety of
the home district, but was also capable of rendering effective
aid to the king's other designs and undertakings, whether by
land or sea, owing to its commanding situation." His words
carried conviction to the minds of all, and it was resolved
that the capture of the town should be their first step. For
<placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName> was still held by a garrison for the Egyptian kings;
and had been so since the time of Ptolemy Euergetes, who
took it when he invaded <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> to revenge the murder of
<placeName key="tgn,7016792">Berenice</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c59" type="chapter" n="59">
<head>Description of <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName></head>
<p>In consequence of this decision, orders were sent to
Diognetus the commander of the fleet to sail towards <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>:
while Antiochus himself started from <placeName key="tgn,7017535">Apameia</placeName> with his army,
and encamped near the Hippodrome, about five stades from
the town. He also despatched Theodotus Hemiolius with an
adequate force against <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>, with orders to occupy the
passes and to keep the road open for him.</p>
<p>The situation of <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName> and the natural features of the
surrounding country are of this kind. The city
stands on the sea coast between <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>; and has close to it a very great
mountain called Coryphaeus, which on the west is washed by
the last waves of the sea which lies between <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>; while its eastern slopes overlook the territories of
<placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>. It is on the southern skirt of this
mountain that the town of <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName> lies, separated from it by
a deep and difficult ravine. The town extends down to the
sea in a straggling line broken by irregularities of the soil, and
is surrounded on most parts by cliffs and precipitous rocks.
On the side facing the sea, where the ground is level, stand
the market-places, and the lower town strongly walled. Similarly
the whole of the main town has been fortified by walls of a
costly construction, and splendidly decorated with temples and
other elaborate buildings. There is only one approach to it
on the seaward side, which is an artificial ascent cut in the
form of a stair, interrupted by frequently occurring drops and
awkward places. Not far from the town is the mouth of the
river Orontes, which rises in the district of Libanus and
Anti-Libanus, and after traversing the plain of Amyca reaches
<pb n="412"/>
<placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName>; through which it flows, and carrying off by the force
of its current all the sewage of that town, finally discharges
itself into this sea not far from <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c60" type="chapter" n="60">
<head>Capture of <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName></head>
<p>Antiochus first tried sending messages to the magistrates of <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>, offering money and other
rewards on condition of having the city surrendered without fighting. And though he
failed to persuade the chief authorities, he corrupted some of
the subordinate commanders; and relying on them, he made
preparations to assault the town on the sea-ward side with the
men of his fleet, and on the land side with his soldiers. He
divided his forces therefore into three parts, and addressed
suitable words of exhortation to them, causing a herald to
proclaim a promise to men and officers alike of great gifts and
crowns that should be bestowed for gallantry in action. To
the division under Zeuxis he entrusted the attack upon the
gate leading to <placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName>; to Hermogenes that upon the walls
near the temple of Castor and Pollux; and to Ardys and
Diognetus the assault upon the docks and the lower town: in
accordance with his understanding with his partisans in the
town, whereby it had been agreed that, if he could carry the
lower town by assault, the city also should then be put into his
hands. When the signal was given, a vigorous and determined
assault was begun simultaneously at all these points: though
that made by Ardys and Diognetus was by far the most daring;
for the other points did not admit of any assault at all by
means of scaling ladders, nor could be carried except by the men
climbing up on their hands and knees; while at the docks and
lower town it was possible to apply scaling ladders and fix
them firmly and safely against the walls. The naval contingent therefore having fixed their ladders on the docks, and
the division of Ardys theirs upon the lower town, a violent
effort was made to carry the walls: and the garrison of the
upper town being prevented from coming to the assistance of
these places, because the city was being assaulted at every
other point at the same time, Ardys was not long before he
captured the lower town. No sooner had this fallen, than the
subordinate officers who had been corrupted hurried to the
commander-in-chief Leontius, and urged that he ought to
<pb n="413"/>
send ambassadors to Antiochus, and make terms with him,
before the city was taken by storm. Knowing nothing about
the treason of these officers, but alarmed by their consternation,
Leontius sent commissioners to the king to make terms for
the safety of all within the city.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c61" type="chapter" n="61">
<head>Theodotus Proposes to Help Antiochus</head>
<p>The king accepted the proposal and agreed to grant
safety to all in the town who were free, amounting to six
thousand souls. And when he took over the town, he not
only spared the free, but also recalled those of the inhabitants
who had been exiled; and restored to them their citizenship
and property; while he secured the harbour and citadel with
garrisons.</p>
<p>While still engaged in this business, he received a letter<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Theodotus turns against Ptolemy. See <ref target="b5c46" targOrder="U">ch. 46</ref>.</note>
from Theodotus offering to put <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>
into his hands, and inviting him to come
thither with all speed. This letter caused
him great embarrassment and doubt as to what he ought
to do, and how best to take advantage of the offer. This
Theodotus was an Aetolian who, as I have already narrated,
had rendered important services to Ptolemy's kingdom: for
which, far from being reckoned deserving of gratitude, he had
been in imminent danger of his life, just about the time of the
expedition of Antiochus against Molon. Thereupon conceiving a contempt for Ptolemy, and a distrust of his courtiers,
he seized upon <placeName key="tgn,7000640">Ptolemais</placeName> with his own hands, and upon <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName> by
the agency of Panaetolus, and made haste to invite Antiochus.
Postponing therefore his expedition against Achaeus, and regarding everything else as of secondary importance, Antiochus
started with his army by the same route as he had come.
After passing the canon called Marsyas, he encamped near
Gerrha, close to the lake which lies between the two mountains.
Hearing there that Ptolemy's general Nicolaus was besieging
Theodotus in <placeName key="tgn,7000640">Ptolemais</placeName>, he left his heavy-armed troops
behind with orders to their leaders to besiege Brochi,&mdash;the
stronghold which commands the road along the lake,&mdash;and
led his light-armed troops forward himself, with the intention
of raising the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7000640">Ptolemais</placeName>. But Nicolaus had already
got intelligence of the king's approach; and had accordingly
retired from <placeName key="tgn,7000640">Ptolemais</placeName> himself, and sent forward Diogoras the
<pb n="414"/>
Cretan and Dorymenes the Aetolian to occupy the passes at
<placeName key="tgn,7002857">Berytus</placeName>. The king therefore attacked these men, and having
easily routed them took up a position near the pass.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c62" type="chapter" n="62">
<head>Invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName></head>
<p>There he awaited the coming up of the remainder
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus invades <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>.</note>
of his forces, and, after addressing them in
words befitting the occasion, continued his
advance with his entire army, full of courage
and with high hopes of success. When Theodotus and
Panaetolus met him with their partisans he received them
graciously, and took over from them <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000640">Ptolemais</placeName>, and
the war material which those cities contained. Part of this
consisted of forty vessels, of which twenty were decked and
splendidly equipped, and none with less than four banks of
oars; the other twenty were made up of triremes, biremes,
and cutters. These he handed over to the care of the
Navarch Diognetus; and being informed that Ptolemy had
come out against him, and had reached <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName>, and that all
his forces were collected at <placeName key="tgn,6004608">Pelusium</placeName>, and were opening the
sluices, and filling up the wells of drinking water, he abandoned
the idea of attacking <placeName key="tgn,6004608">Pelusium</placeName>; but making a progress through
the several cities, endeavoured to win them over by force or
persuasion to his authority. Some of the less-fortified cities
were overawed at his approach and made no difficulty about
submitting, but others trusting to their fortifications or the
strength of their situations held out; and to these he was
forced to lay regular siege and so wasted a considerable time.</p>
<p>Though treated with such flagrant perfidy, the character of
Ptolemy was so feeble, and his neglect of all military preparations had been so great, that the idea of protecting his rights
with the sword, which was his most obvious duty, never
occurred to him.</p></div2>

<head>Preparations In Egypt</head>
<p>Agathocles and Sosibius, however, the leading ministers
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Active measures of Agathocles and Sosibius.</note>
in the kingdom at that time, took counsel
together and did the best they could with
the means at their disposal, in view of the
existing crisis. They resolved to devote themselves to the
preparations for war; and, meanwhile, by embassies to
try to retard the advance of Antiochus: pretending to confirm him in the opinion he originally entertained about
<pb n="415"/>
Ptolemy, namely, that he would not venture to fight, but would
trust to negotiations, and the interposition of common friends,
to induce him to evacuate <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>. Having determined
upon this policy, Agathocles and Sosibius, to whom the whole
business was entrusted, lost no time in sending their ambassadors
to Antiochus: and at the same time they sent messages to
<placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, not omitting the Aetolians,
inviting them to send commissioners to discuss the terms of a
treaty. The commissioners duly arrived, and by occupying
the time with going backwards and forwards between the two
kings, abundantly secured to these statesmen the two things
which they wanted,&mdash;delay, and time to make their preparations for war. They fixed their residence at <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName> and
there carried on these negotiations continuously. Nor were
they less attentive to the ambassadors from Antiochus, whom
they received with every mark of courtesy and kindness. But
meanwhile they were calling up and collecting at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>
the mercenaries whom they had on service in towns outside
<placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; were despatching men to recruit foreign soldiers;
and were collecting provisions both for the troops they already
possessed, and for those that were coming in. No less active
were they in every other department of the military preparations. They took turns in going on rapid and frequent visits
to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, to see that the supplies should in no point be
inadequate to the undertaking before them. The manufacture
of arms, the selection of men, and their division into companies,
they committed to the care of Echecrates of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and
Phoxidas of <placeName key="tgn,7005730">Melita</placeName>. With these they associated Eurylochus
of <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName>, and Socrates of Boeotia, who were also joined by
Cnopias of Allaria. By the greatest good fortune they had
got hold of these officers, who, while serving with Demetrius
and Antigonus,<note anchored="yes">That is, Demetrius II, and Antigonus Doson.</note> had acquired some experience of real war and
actual service in the field. Accordingly they took command
of the assembled troops, and made the best of them by giving
them the training of soldiers.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c64" type="chapter" n="64">
<head>Training of Soldiers</head>
<p>Their first measure was to divide them according to

before. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Reorganisation of the army.</note>Next they broke up
their battalions and muster-rolls, which had been formed on the basis
of their old system of pay, and formed
them into companies adapted to the immediate purpose.
Having effected this they began to drill the men; habituating them
severally not only to obey the words of command, but also to the proper management
of their weapons.<note anchored="yes">See Professor Mahaffy, <title>Greek Life and Thought.</title> p. 405, who points out
that this refers to the Egyptian troops especially, whose old military castes (see
<bibl n="Hdt. 2.164">Herod. 2, 164-6</bibl>) though not extinct had forgotten their old skill. In a sense,
however, it applies to both kinds of troops; for they had to be trained to act
<emph>together,</emph> as is shown in the next chapter.</note>
They also frequently summoned general meetings at headquarters, and delivered speeches to the men. The most
useful in this respect were Andromachus of <placeName key="tgn,7002374">Aspendus</placeName> and
Polycrates of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>; because they had recently crossed from
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and were still thoroughly imbued with the Greek
spirit, and the military ideas prevalent in the several states.
Moreover, they were illustrious on the score of their private
wealth, as well as on that of their respective countries; to
which advantages Polycrates added those of an ancient family,
and of the reputation obtained by his father Mnasiades as an
athlete. By private and public exhortations these officers
inspired their men with a zeal and enthusiasm for the struggle
which awaited them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c65" type="chapter" n="65">
<head>Reform of the Egyptian Army</head>
<p>All these officers, too, had commands in the army
suited to their particular accomplishments. Eurylochus
of magnesia commanded about three thousand men of what
were called in the royal armies the Agema, or Guard;
Socrates of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> had two thousand light-armed troops under
him; while the Achaean Phoxidas, and Ptolemy the son of
Thraseas, and Andromachus of <placeName key="tgn,7002374">Aspendus</placeName> were associated in
the duty of drilling the phalanx and the mercenary Greek
soldiers on the same ground,&mdash;Andromachus and Ptolemy
commanding the phalanx, Phoxidas the mercenaries; of which
the numbers were respectively twenty-five thousand and eight
thousand. The cavalry, again, attached to the court, amounting to seven hundred, as well as that which was obtained from
Lybia or enlisted in the country, were being trained by
Polycrates, and were under his personal command: amounting
<pb n="417"/>
in all to about three thousand men. In the actual campaign the
most effective service was performed by Echecrates of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>,
by whom the Greek cavalry, which, with the whole body of mercenary cavalry, amounted to two thousand men, was splendidly
trained. No one took more pains with the men under his
command than Cnopias of Allaria. He commanded all the
Cretans, who numbered three thousand, and among them a
thousand Neo-Cretans,<note anchored="yes">See above, <ref target="b5c5" targOrder="U">ch. 5</ref>, note.</note> over whom he had set Philo of <placeName key="tgn,7010870">Cnossus</placeName>.
They also armed three thousand Libyans in the Macedonian
fashion, who were commanded by Ammonius of <placeName key="tgn,7000645">Barce</placeName>. The
Egyptians themselves supplied twenty thousand soldiers to the
phalanx, and were under the command of Sosibius. A body
of Thracians and Gauls was also enrolled, four thousand being
taken from settlers in the country and their descendants, while
two thousand had been recently enlisted and brought over:
and these were under the command of Dionysius of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.

Ptolemy, and to meet him at <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName>. He then placed the
necessary guards in the various strongholds, committed to
<pb n="418"/>
Theodotus the command-in-chief over them all, and returned
home. On his arrival at <placeName key="tgn,6005333">Seleucia</placeName> he distributed his forces
into their winter quarters; and from that time forth took
no pains to keep the mass of his army under discipline, being
persuaded that the business would not call for any more
fighting; because he was already master of some portions of
<placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>, and expected to secure the rest by
voluntary submission or by diplomacy: for Ptolemy, he believed,
would not venture upon a general engagement. This opinion
was shared also by the ambassadors: because Sosibius fixing
his residence at <placeName key="tgn,7001186">Memphis</placeName> conducted his negotiations with
them in a friendly manner; while he prevented those who went
back wards and forwards to Antiochus from ever becoming eyewitnesses of the preparations that were being carried on at

arrived, Sosibius was already prepared for every eventuality.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c67" type="chapter" n="67">

<p>Meanwhile Antiochus was extremely anxious to have

as much the advantage over the government

belonged of right to himself and not to
Ptolemy; for Ptolemy I. went to war with
Antigonus with the view of annexing this country, not to his
own government, but to that of Seleucus. But, above all, he
<pb n="419"/>
pressed the convention entered into by the three kings,
Cassander, Lysimachus, and Seleucus, when, after having
conquered Antigonus,<note anchored="yes">Battle of Ipsus, B. C. <date value="-301">301</date></note> they deliberated in common upon the
arrangements to be made, and decided that the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>
should belong to Seleucus. The commissioners of Ptolemy
endeavoured to establish the opposite case. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ptolemy's case.</note> They magnified
the existing injury, and dilated on its hardship;
asserting that the treason of Theodotus and the
invasion of Antiochus amounted to a breach of treaty-rights.
They alleged the possession of these places in the reign of
Ptolemy, son of Lagus; and tried to show that Ptolemy had
joined Seleucus in the war on the understanding that he was
to invest Seleucus with the government of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>,
but was to take <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName> for himself.</p>
<p>Such were the arguments brought forward by the two
contracting parties in the course of the embassies and counterembassies and conferences. There was no prospect, however,
of arriving at any result, because the controversy was conducted,
not by the principals, but by the common friends of both; and
there was no one to intervene authoritatively to check and
control the caprice of the party which they might decide to be
in the wrong. But what caused the most insuperable difficulty
was the matter of Achaeus. For Ptolemy was eager that the
terms of the treaty should include him: while Antiochus would
not allow the subject to be so much as mentioned; and was
indignant that Ptolemy should venture to protect rebels, or
bring such a point into the discussion at all.</p></div2>

<head>Antiochus Attempts to Complete his Conquest</head>
<p>The approach of spring found both sides weary of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Renewal of hostilities, B. C. <date value="-218">218</date>.</note>
negotiations, and with no prospect of coming to
a conclusion. Antiochus therefore began collecting his forces, with a view of making an invasion
by land and sea, and completing his conquest of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>.
On his part Ptolemy gave the supreme management of the war
to Nicolaus, sent abundant provisions to <placeName key="tgn,7001390">Gaza</placeName>, and despatched
land and sea forces. The arrival of these reinforcements gave
Nicolaus courage to enter upon the war: the commander of
the navy promptly co-operating with him in carrying out all his
orders. This admiral was Perigenes, whom Ptolemy sent out
<pb n="420"/>
in command of the fleet, consisting of thirty fully-decked ships
and more than four thousand ships of burden. Nicolaus was
by birth an Aetolian, and was the boldest and most experienced
officer in the service of Ptolemy. With one division of his
army he hastened to seize the pass at Platanus; with the rest,
which he personally commanded, he occupied the environs of
Porphyrion; and there prepared to resist the invasion of the
king: the fleet being also anchored close to him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Antiochus had advanced as far as <placeName key="tgn,5003644">Marathus</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus marches to <placeName key="tgn,7002857">Beirut</placeName>.</note>
On his way he had received a deputation
of Aradians, asking for an alliance; and had

an end to a quarrel which they had amongst themselves,
by reconciling those of them who lived on the island with
those who lived on the mainland. Starting from <placeName key="tgn,5003644">Marathus</placeName>
he entered the enemy's country near the promontory called
Theoprosopon, and advanced to <placeName key="tgn,7002857">Berytus</placeName>, having seized Botrys
on his way, and burnt Trieres and Calamus. From <placeName key="tgn,7002857">Berytus</placeName> he
sent forward Nicarchus and Theodotus with orders to secure
the difficult passes near the river Lycus; while he himself set
his army in motion and encamped near the river Damuras:
Diognetus, the commander of his navy, coasting along parallel
with him all the while. Thence once more, taking with him
the divisions commanded by Theodotus and Nicarchus, which
were the light troops of the army, he set out to reconnoitre
the pass occupied already by Nicolaus. After thoroughly
surveying the nature of the ground, he retired to his camp for
that day. But on the next, leaving his heavy-armed troops in
the charge of Nicarchus, he set out with the rest of his forces
to execute his design.</p></div2>

<p>At this point there is but a small and narrow space

between the foot of Libanus and the sea;
and even that is intersected by a steep
and rugged spur, leaving only a narrow and
difficult passage along the very water's edge. On this pass
Nicolaus had taken up his position; and having occupied some
of the points by means of his large numbers, and secured
others by artificial works, he felt certain that he would be
able to prevent Antiochus from effecting an entrance. But
<pb n="421"/>
the king divided his army into three parts, of which he
entrusted one to Theodotus with orders to close with the
enemy and force their way along the skirts of Libanus; the
second to Menedemus with urgent orders to attempt the centre
of the spur; while the third he put under the command of
Diocles, the military governor of Parapotamia, and ordered
them to keep close to the sea. He himself with his guard
occupied a central position, intending to superintend the
whole action and give help where it was wanted. At the
same time Diognetus and Perigenes made preparations
for a sea-fight, coming as close as possible to the shore,
and endeavouring to make the battles at sea and on land
present the appearance of a single contest.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">carried by Antiochus.</note> A general advance having begun by sea

command, the battle on the sea was undecided, because
the number of vessels on either side and their equipment
were about equal: but on land the troops of Nicolaus got
the best of it at first, from the advantage of their position.
But when Theodotus routed the men on the mountain skirts,
and then charged from the higher ground, Nicolaus's men all
turned and fled precipitately. In this flight two thousand of
them fell, and as many were taken prisoners: the rest retreated
towards <placeName key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</placeName>. Though he now had the better prospect of

induced the men of the town to come out to a skirmish, and
enticed their leading columns to a considerable distance; then
his troops suddenly turned from their pretended flight, and
those who were concealed rising from their ambush, he attacked
and killed a large number of the enemy; and finally, by
pursuing close upon their heels, and thus creating a panic in
the town before he reached it, he carried it as he had done
others by assault. At this juncture Ceraeas, one of Ptolemy's

<pb n="423"/>
and were pillaging and overrunning the territory of those
Arabians who had joined him, he threw everything else aside
and started thither; and pitched his camp at the foot of the
high ground on which that city stands. After going round
and reconnoitring the hill, and finding that it admitted of being
ascended only at two points, he led his army to them and set
up his siege artillery at these points. He put one set of siege-works under the care of Nicarchus, the other under that of
Theodotus: while he superintended both equally, and observed
the zeal shown by the two respectively. Great exertions were
accordingly made by each, and a continual rivalry kept up as
to which should be the first to make a breach in the wall
opposite their works: and the result was that both breaches
were made with unexpected rapidity; whereupon they kept
making assaults night and day, and trying every
means to force an entrance, without an hour's
intermission. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fall of Rabbatamana.</note> But though they kept up these
attempts continuously, they failed to make any impression; until

stones and everything of that sort; and when this was done,
the garrison surrendered for want of water. Having thus got
possession of Rabbatamana, Antiochus left Nicarchus with an

Relief of Pednelissus.</note>
being besieged and reduced to great straits by
the Selgians, sent messages to Achaeus asking
for help: and upon receiving a ready assent,
continued to sustain the siege with great spirit in reliance upon
this hope of relief. Achaeus selected Garsyeris to conduct
the expedition; and sent him out in all haste, with six thousand
<pb n="424"/>
infantry and five hundred horse, to relieve the Pednelissians.
But when they heard of the approach of the army of relief,
the Selgians occupied the pass called the Stair with the
main body of their own army; and put a garrison at the
entrance into Saperda: breaking up and spoiling all the
paths and tracks leading to it. After entering Milyades and
encamping under the walls of Cretopolis, perceiving that a
farther advance was made impossible by the occupation
of these positions by the enemy, Garsyeris hit upon the
following ruse. He broke up his camp, and began his
return march, as though he had abandoned all thoughts
of relieving Pednelissus, owing to the enemy's occupation
of these positions. The Selgians were readily persuaded
that he had really abandoned the relief of Pednelissus, and
departed, some to the besieging camp and others home to
<placeName key="perseus,Selge">Selge</placeName>, as it was now close upon harvest-time. Thereupon
Garsyeris faced about, and, marching with great speed, arrived
at the pass over the mountain; and finding it unguarded,
secured it by a garrison, under the command of Phayllus;
while he himself with his main army went to Perga: and thence
sent embassies to the other states in <placeName key="tgn,7016774">Pisidia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName>,
pointing out that the power of the Selgians was A standing
menace, and urging all to ally themselves with Achaeus and
join in relieving Pednelissus.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c73" type="chapter" n="73">
<head>Defeat of the Selgians</head>
<p>Meanwhile the Selgians had sent out a general in command of a force which they hoped would terrify Phallyus by
their superior knowledge of the country, and expel him from his
strong position. But when, far from attaining their object, they
lost large numbers of men in their attacks upon him; though
they abandoned the hope of accomplishing this, they yet
persisted with increased ardour in the siege of Pednelissus.
Garsyeris was now reinforced by eight thousand hoplites from
the Etennes, who inhabit the highlands of <placeName key="tgn,7016774">Pisidia</placeName> above Side,
and half that number from <placeName key="tgn,7002374">Aspendus</placeName>. The people of Side
itself, partly from a wish to curry favour with Antiochus, but
chiefly from hatred to the Aspendians, refused to take part in
the relief of Pednelissus. With these reinforcements, as well
as his own army, Garsyeris advanced towards Pednelissus,
feeling certain that he would be able to raise the siege at the
<pb n="425"/>
first attack: but when the Selgians showed no sign of alarm,
he entrenched himself at a moderate distance from them.
The Pednelissians were now becoming hard pressed from want
of provisions; and Garsyeris, being anxious to do all he could,
got ready two thousand men, giving each a medimnus of
wheat, and despatched them under cover of night into Pednelissus. But the Selgians getting intelligence of what was going
on, and, coming out to intercept them, most of those who
were carrying in the corn were killed, and the Selgians got
possession of the wheat. Elated with this success, they now
essayed to storm the camp of Garsyeris as well as the city. An
adventurous daring in the presence of the enemy is indeed
characteristic of the Selgians: and on this occasion they left a
barely sufficient number to guard their camp; and, surrounding
the enemy's entrenchment with the rest, assaulted it at several
points at once. Finding himself unexpectedly attacked on
every side, and portions of his palisade being already torn down,
Garsyeris, appreciating the gravity of the danger, and feeling
that there was but little chance of averting total destruction,
sent out some cavalry at a point which the enemy had left
unguarded. These the Selgians imagined to be flying in a
panic and for fear of what was coming: and therefore, instead
of attending to them, they treated them with utter contempt.
When these horsemen, however, had ridden round, so as to
get on the rear of the enemy, they charged and fought with
great fierceness. This raised the spirits of Garsyeris's infantry,
though they had already given way: and they therefore faced
round, and once more offered resistance to the troops that were
storming their camp. The Selgians, accordingly, being now
attacked on front and rear at once, broke and fled. At the
same time the Pednelissians sallied out and attacked the
troops left in charge of the Selgian camp, and drove them out.
The pursuit lasted to so great a distance that no less than
ten thousand of the Selgian army fell: of the survivors all
who were allies fled to their own cities; while the Selgians
themselves escaped over the highlands into their native land.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c74" type="chapter" n="74">
<head>Panic at <placeName key="perseus,Selge">Selge</placeName></head>
<p>Garsyeris immediately started in pursuit of the

anxious for the safety of themselves and their country. They
accordingly determined in public assembly to send one of their
citizens on an embassy to Gassyeris; and selected for the
purpose Logbasis, who had been for a long time on terms of

private interview with Garsyeris, and was so far from carrying

interests of his country, that on the contrary he strongly urged
Garsyeris to send with all speed for Achaeus, and undertook
to put the city into their hands. Garsyeris, of course, grasped
eagerly at the chance offered to him and sent messengers to induce Achaeus to come, and to inform him of the position of
affairs. Meanwhile he concluded an armistice with the Selgians,
and protracted the negotiations for a treaty by continually bringing forward objections and scruples on points of detail, in order
to give time for the arrival of Achaeus, and for Logbasis to
conduct his negotiations and mature his plot.</p></div2>

<head>Achaeus At <placeName key="perseus,Selge">Selge</placeName></head>
<p>While this was going on frequent meetings for discussion took place between the camp and the town, and it
became quite an ordinary thing for the soldiers to go into the
town to purchase corn. This is a state of things which has
on many occasions proved fatal. And it appears to me that
of all animals the most easily deceived is man, though he has
the credit of being the most cunning. For consider how
<pb n="427"/>
many entrenched camps and fortresses, how many and what
great cities have been betrayed by this kind of trick! And yet
in spite of such frequent and conspicuous examples of the many
people to whom it has happened, somehow or another we are
always new to such deceit, and fall into the trap with the inexperience of youth. The reason is that we do not keep ready
for reference in our minds the disasters of those who have made
mistakes before us in this or that particular. But while preparing with great labour and cost stores of corn and money, and a
provision of walls and weapons to meet unforeseen eventualities,
that which is the easiest of all and the most serviceable in the
hour of danger&mdash;that we all neglect; although we might obtain
this experience from history and research, which in themselves
add a dignity to leisure and a charm to existence.</p>
<p>Achaeus then duly arrived at the time expected: and after<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Failure of the treason of Logbasis.</note>
conference with him, the Selgians had great
hopes of experiencing some signal kindness at
his hands. But in the interval Logbasis had
little by little collected in his house some of the soldiers who
came into the town from the camp; and now advised the
citizens not to let slip the opportunity, but to act with the
display of Achaeus's kindly disposition towards them before their
eyes; and to put the finishing stroke to the treaty, after holding
a general assembly of the whole community to discuss the
situation. An assembly was at once convened, to which even
those on guard were all summoned to assist in bringing the
treaty to completion; and the citizens began deliberating on
the state of affairs.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c76" type="chapter" n="76">
<head>Death of Logbasis</head>
<p>Meanwhile Logbasis, who had agreed with the enemy
to take that opportunity, began getting ready those who had
congregated at his house, and prepared and armed himself
and his sons also for the fight. And now Achaeus with half
the hostile force was advancing towards the city itself; while
Garsyeris with the remainder was marching towards the
Cesbedium as it is called, or temple of Zeus, which stands
in a position commanding the city and presenting very much
the appearance of a citadel. But a goatherd, having by
chance observed what was going on, brought the news to the
assembly; thereupon some of the citizens made a hurried rush
<pb n="428"/>
to the Cesbedium, others to their posts on the wall, and
the majority in great anger to the house of Logbasis. His
treasonable practice being thus detected, some of them climbed
upon the roof, others forced their way in by the front door, and
murdered Logbasis and his sons and all the other men which
they found there at the same time. Then they caused a proclamation to be made promising freedom to all slaves who
would join them: and dividing themselves into three companies, they hastened to defend all the points of vantage.
When he saw that the Cesbedium was already occupied,
Garsyeris abandoned his enterprise; but Achaeus held on his
way until he came right up to the gates: whereupon the
Selgians sallied out, killed seven hundred, and forced the rest
to give up the attempt. Upon this conclusion of their enterprise, Achaeus and Garsyeris retired to the camp. But the
Selgians fearing treason among themselves, and alarmed at the
presence of a hostile camp, sent out some of their elders in the
guise of suppliants, and concluded a peace, on condition of
paying four hundred talents on the spot and restoring the
Pednelissians whom they had taken prisoners, and paying a
further sum of three hundred talents at a fixed date. Thus
did the Selgians by their own valour save their country, which
they had been in danger of losing through the infamous
treason of Logbasis; and thus neither disgraced their freedom,
nor their relationship to the Lacedaemonians.<note anchored="yes">Selge was said to be a colony of the Lacedaemonians. <bibl n="Strab. 13.7.3">Strabo, 13.7.3</bibl>.</note></p></div2>

Carseae. Overawing the inhabitants of this town, as well as
the garrison of the Two Walls, he got them surrendered to him

remove to more advantageous ground and to inspire confidence
in his troops, Antiochus pushed forward his camp so much
nearer Ptolemy, that the palisades of the two camps were not
more than five stades from each other; and while in this

characteristic of an Aetolian, but undoubtedly
requiring great personal courage. Having
formerly lived at Ptolemy's court he knew the king's tastes and

the enemy's camp just before daybreak; where, owing to the
dim light, he could not be recognised by his face, while his
dress and other accoutrements did not render him noticeable,
owing to the variety of costume prevailing among themselves.
He had marked the position of the king's tent during the
<pb n="432"/>
preceding days, for the skirmishes took place quite close; and
he now walked boldly up to it, and passed through all the outer
ring of attendants without being observed: but when he came
to the tent in which the king was accustomed to transact
business and dine, though he searched it in every conceivable
way, he failed to find the king; for Ptolemy slept in another
tent, separate from the public and official tent. He however
wounded two men who were sleeping there, and killed
<placeName key="tgn,1043060">Andreas</placeName>, the king's physician; and then returned safely to his
own camp, without meeting with any molestation, except just as
he was passing over the vallum of the enemy's camp. As far

in prudence by not taking the precaution to ascertain where
Ptolemy was accustomed to sleep.</p></div2>

<p>After being encamped opposite each other for five

days, the two kings resolved to bring matters
to the decision of battle. And upon
Ptolemy beginning to move his army outside
its camp, Antiochus hastened to do the
same. Both formed their front of their phalanx and men
armed in the Macedonian manner. But Ptolemy's two
wings were formed as follows:&mdash;Polycrates, with the cavalry
under his command, occupied the left, and between him and
the phalanx were Cretans standing close by the horsemen;
next them came the royal guard;<note anchored="yes">Agema. See note on <ref target="b5c25" targOrder="U">5, 25</ref>.</note> then the peltasts under
Socrates, adjoining the Libyans armed in Macedonian fashion.
On the right wing was Echecrates of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, with his division
of cavalry; on his left were stationed Gauls and Thracians;
next them Phoxidas and the Greek mercenaries, extending to
the Egyptian phalanx. Of the elephants forty were on the left
wing, where Ptolemy was to be in person during the battle;
the other thirty-three had been stationed in front of the right
wing opposite the mercenary cavalry.</p>
<p>Antiochus also placed sixty of his elephants commanded
by his foster-brother Philip in front of his right wing, on which
he was to be present personally, to fight opposite Ptolemy.
Behind these he stationed the two thousand cavalry commanded
by Antipater, and two thousand more at right angles to them.
<pb n="433"/>
In line with the cavalry he placed the Cretans, and next
them the Greek mercenaries; with the latter he mixed two
thousand of these armed in the Macedonian fashion under
the command of the Macedonian Byttacus. At the extreme
point of the left wing he placed two thousand cavalry under
the command of Themison; by their side Cardacian and
Lydian javelin-men; next them the light-armed division of
three thousand, commanded by Menedemus; then the Cissians,
Medes, and Carmanians; and by their side the Arabians and
neighbouring peoples who continued the line up to the phalanx.
The remainder of the elephants he placed in front of his left
wing under the command of Myiscus, one of the boys about
the court.</p></div2>

<head>Each King Exhorts His Army</head>
<p>The two armies having been drawn up in the order I

have described; the kings went along their
respective lines, and addressed words of encouragement and exhortation to their officers
and friends. But as they both rested their
strongest hopes on their phalanx, they showed their greatest
earnestness and addressed their strongest exhortations to them;
which were re-echoed in Ptolemy's case by Andromachus and
Sosibius and the king's sister <placeName key="tgn,7016892">Arsinoe</placeName>; in the case of Antiochus
by Theodotus and Nicarchus: these officers being the commanders of the phalanx in the two armies respectively. The
substance of what was said on both sides was the same: for
neither monarch had any glorious or famous achievement of
his own to quote to those whom he was addressing, seeing that
they had but recently succeeded to their crowns; but they
endeavoured to inspire the men of the phalanx with spirit
and boldness, by reminding them of the glory of their ancestors,
and the great deeds performed by them. But they chiefly
dwelt upon the hopes of advancement which the men might
expect at their hands in the future; and they called upon and
exhorted the leaders and the whole body of men, who were
about to be engaged, to maintain the fight with a manly and
courageous spirit. So with these or similar words, delivered
by their own lips or by interpreters, they rode along their lines.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c84" type="chapter" n="84">
<head>The Elephants in the Battle</head>
<p>Ptolemy, accompanied by his sister, having arrived at
<pb n="434"/>
the left wing of his army, and Antiochus with the royal guard
at the right: they gave the signal for the battle,
and opened the fight by a charge of elephants. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle of Rhaphia.</note>Only some few of Ptolemy's elephants
came to close quarters with the foe: seated on these the
soldiers in the howdahs maintained a brilliant fight, lunging at
and striking each other with crossed pikes.<note anchored="yes">Sarissae, the long Macedonian spears.</note> But the elephants
themselves fought still more brilliantly, using all their strength

<p>The way in which elephants fight is this: they get their<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fighting elephants.</note>
tusks entangled and jammed, and then push
against one another with all their might, trying
to make each other yield ground until one of
them proving superior in strength has pushed aside the other's
trunk; and when once he can get a side blow at his enemy,
he pierces him with his tusks as a bull would with his horns.
Now, most of Ptolemy's animals, as is the way with Libyan
elephants, were afraid to face the fight: for they cannot stand
the smell or the trumpeting of the Indian elephants, but are
frightened at their size and strength, I suppose, and run away
from them at once without waiting to come near them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus's right wing successful.</note> This
is exactly what happened on this occasion: and upon their
being thrown into confusion and being driven
back upon their own lines, Ptolemy's guard
gave way before the rush of the animals; while
Antiochus, wheeling his men so as to avoid the elephants,
charged the division of cavalry under Polycrates. At the
same time the Greek mercenaries stationed near the phalanx,
and behind the elephants, charged Ptolemy's peltasts and made
them give ground, the elephants having already thrown their
ranks also into confusion. Thus Ptolemy's whole left wing
began to give way before the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c85" type="chapter" n="85">

<p>Echecrates the commander of the right wing waited at
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ptolemy's right wing also successful.</note>
first to see the result of the struggle between
the other wings of the two armies: but when he
saw the dust coming his way, and that the

<pb n="435"/>
the hostile elephants at all, he ordered Phoxidas to charge the
part of the enemy opposite him with his Greek mercenaries;
while he made a flank movement with the cavalry and the
division behind the elephants; and so getting out of the line of
the hostile elephants' attack, charged the enemy's cavalry on
the rear or the flank and quickly drove them from their
ground. Phoxidas and his men were similarly successful: for
they charged the Arabians and Medes and forced them into
precipitate flight. Thus Antiochus's right wing gained a victory,
while his left was defeated. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The centre coming into action, Ptolemy is victorious.</note>The phalanxes, left
without the support of either wing, remained
intact in the centre of the plain, in a state of
alternate hope and fear for the result. Meanwhile Antiochus was assisting in gaining the victory on his right
wing; while Ptolemy, who had retired behind his phalanx,
now came forward in the centre, and showing himself in the
view of both armies struck terror in the hearts of the enemy,
but inspired great spirit and enthusiasm in his own men;
and Andromachus and Sosibius at once ordered them to lower
their sarissae and charge. The picked Syrian troops stood
their ground only for a short time, and the division of Nicarchus
quickly broke and fled. Antiochus presuming, in his youthful
inexperience, from the success of his own division, that he
would be equally victorious all along the line, was pressing on
the pursuit; but upon one of the older officers at length
giving him warning, and pointing out that the cloud of dust
raised by the phalanx was moving towards their own camp, he
understood too late what was happening; and endeavoured to
gallop back with the squadron of royal cavalry on to the field. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Final retreat of Antiochus.</note>
But finding his whole line in full retreat he was
forced to retire to Rhaphia: comforting himself
with the belief that, as far as he was personally
concerned, he had won a victory, but had been defeated in
the whole battle by the want of spirit and courage shown by
the rest.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c86" type="chapter" n="86">
<head>The Losses on Each Side</head>
<p>Having secured the final victory by his phalanx, and
killed large numbers of the enemy in the pursuit by means of
his cavalry and mercenaries on his right wing, Ptolemy retired
to his own camp and there spent the night. But next day,
<pb n="436"/>
after picking up and burying his own dead, and stripping the
bodies of the enemy, he advanced towards Rhaphia. Antiochus
had wished, immediately after the retreat of his army, to make
a camp outside the city; and there rally such of his men as had
fled in compact bodies: but finding that the greater number
had retreated into the town, he was compelled to enter it himself also. Next morning, however, before daybreak, he led out
the relics of his army and made the best of his way to <placeName key="tgn,7001390">Gaza</placeName>.
There he pitched a camp: and having sent an embassy to
obtain leave to pick up his dead, he obtained a truce for
performing their obsequies. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The losses on either side.</note> His loss amounted
to nearly ten thousand infantry and three
hundred cavalry killed, and four thousand taken
prisoners. Three elephants were killed on the field, and two
died afterwards of their wounds. On Ptolemy's side the
losses were fifteen hundred infantry killed and seven hundred
cavalry: sixteen of his elephants were killed, and most of the
others captured.</p>
<p>Such was the result of the battle of Rhaphia between kings
Ptolemy and Antiochus for the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>.</p>
<p>After picking up his dead Antiochus retired with his army<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The effect of the battle of Rhaphia.</note>
to his own country: while Ptolemy took over
Rhaphia and the other towns without difficulty,
all the states vying with each other as to
which should be first to renew their allegiance and come over
to him. And perhaps it is the way of the world everywhere
to accommodate one's self to circumstances at such times; but
it is eminently true of the race inhabiting that country, that they
have a natural turn and inclination to worship success. Moreover it was all the more natural in this case, owing to the
existing disposition of the people in favour of the Alexandrian
kings; for the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName> are somehow always
more loyally disposed to this family than to any other. Accordingly they now stopped short of no extravagance of adulation,
honouring Ptolemy with crowns, sacrifices, and every possible
compliment of the kind.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c87" type="chapter" n="87">
<head>A Year's Truce Between Antiochus and Ptolemy</head>
<p>Meanwhile Antiochus, on arriving at the city which

Hemiolius, to treat of a peace, in great alarm lest the enemy
should advance upon him. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Peace between Ptolemy and Antiochus for a year, B. C. <date value="-217">217</date>.</note> For his defeat had
inspired him with distrust of his own forces,

occur to Ptolemy to take any of these circumstances into
account: but being thoroughly satisfied with his unexpected
success, and generally at his unlooked for acquisition of <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>, he was by no means indisposed to peace; but even more
inclined to it than he ought to have been: influenced in that
direction by the habitual effeminacy and corruption of his
manner of life. Accordingly, when Antipater and his colleague
arrived, after some little bluster and vituperation of Antiochus
for what had taken place, he agreed to a truce for a year. He
sent Sosibius back with the ambassadors to ratify the treaty:
while he himself, after remaining three months in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>, and settling the towns, left Andromachus of

sister and friends for <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>: having brought the war to a
conclusion in a way that surprised his subjects, when they
contrasted it with the principles on which he spent he rest of
his life. Antiochus after exchanging ratifications of the treaty
with Sosibius, employed himself in making preparations for
attacking Achaeus, as he had originally begun doing. Such
was the political situation in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>.</p></div2>

in human affairs, public or private, is the difference between incapacity and good sense, between idle indifference and a close
attention to business. Good fortune only damages the one,
while disaster is but a means of recovery to the other. This
was illustrated by the manner in which the Rhodians turned

magnitude and importance by the prominence which they gave

by nations and states; that these monarchs may not imagine
that by the expenditure of four or five talents they are doing
anything so very great, or expect to receive at the hands of the
Greeks the honour enjoyed by former kings; and that states
when they see before their eyes the magnitude of the presents

formerly bestowed, may not, nowadays, in return for insignificant and paltry benefactions, blindly bestow their most ample

Now, when Aratas came into office, he found the

in the usual way; and that of these latter five hundred foot and

<p>After adjusting these matters, he settled in accordance with the decree of the league the
intestine disputes at <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>. For it
happened that the people of this town having
been recently deprived of their country by Cleomenes,<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b2c61" targOrder="U">2, 61-4</ref>. B.C. <date value="-222">222</date>.</note> and, to
use a common expression, shaken to their foundations, were
in absolute want of many things, and ill-provided with all:
for they persisted in maintaining their usual scale of living,
while their means both public and private were entirely
crippled. The consequence was that the town was filled with
disputes, jealousies, and mutual hatred; which is ever the
case, both with states and individuals, when means fall short of
desires. The first controversy was about the walling of the
<pb n="442"/>
town,&mdash;one party maintaining that the limits of the city should
be contracted to a size admitting of being completely walled
and guarded at a time of danger; for that in the late occasion
it was its size and unguarded state which had caused their
disaster. In addition to this it was maintained by this party
that the landowners should contribute the third part of their
land to provide for the enrolment of new citizens. The other
party rejected the notion of contracting the limits of the city
and would not consent to contribute a third part of their lands.
But the most serious controversy of all was in regard to the
laws draughted for them by Prytanis, an eminent Peripatetic
philosopher, whom Antigonus Doson appointed to draw them
up a constitution. In this distracted state of politics, Aratus
intervened with all the earnestness he could command, and
succeeded in pacifying the heated feelings of the citizens. The
terms on which the controversies were settled were engraved on
a column, and set up near the altar of Vesta in the Homarium.<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b2c39" targOrder="U">2, 39</ref>.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="b5c94" type="chapter" n="94">

<p>After arranging this settlement, Aratus broke up his

camp; and going on himself to the congress
of the Achaeans, handed over the mercenaries
to Lycus of Pharae, as the Sub-Strategus
of the league. But the Eleans, being dissatisfied with
Pyrrhias, once more induced the Aetolians to send them
Euripidas; who, waiting until the Achaeans were engaged in
their congress, took sixty horse and two thousand foot, and
started on a raid. Having passed through the territory of
Pharae, he overran the country up to the territory of Aegium;
and after securing and driving off a considerable booty, he
began a retreat towards Leontium. But Lycus, learning what
had happened, went in all haste to protect the country; and
falling in with the enemy, he attacked them at once and killed
four hundred and took two hundred prisoners, among whom
were the following men of rank: Physsias, Antanor, Clearchus,
Androlochus, Euanoridas, Aristogeiton, Nicasippus, and
Aspasius. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Achaean fleet retaliates on <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>.</note>The arms and baggage fell entirely

Chalceia and captured two war ships, with their crews, which
put out to resist him; and took also a long boat with its men
on the Aetolian Rhium. There being thus an influx of booty
both by sea and land at the same period, and a considerable
amount of money and provisions being obtained from this, the
soldiers felt confident of getting their pay, and the cities of the
league were sanguine of not being likely to be hard pressed by
their contributions.</p></div2>

<head>More Raids</head>
<p>While these events were taking place Scerdilaidas,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scerdilaidas the Illyrian plunders the coast.</note>
thinking that he was not being treated fairly,
because some of the payments agreed upon
in his treaty with Philip were in arrear, sent
out fifteen galleys, treacherously pretending that their object was to receive and convoy the money. These galleys
sailed to <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>, where they were received by all as friendly,
owing to their former alliance: but the only mischief they
had time to do was to make a treacherous attack on the
Corinthian Agathinus and Cassander, who had come there on
board Taurion's ships, and were lying at anchor close to them
with four vessels. These they captured with their vessels and
sent to Scerdilaidas; and then putting out to sea from <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>,
and sailing towards Malea, they plundered and captured the
merchants whom they met.</p>
<p>Harvest time was now approaching: and as Taurion paid<note anchored="yes" place="marg">More raids.</note>
little attention to the protection of the cities
I mentioned above; Aratus in person, at the
head of some picked Achaean troops, protected the getting
in of the harvest round <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>: while Euripidas at the head
of a force of Aetolians set out on a raid, with the object
of ravaging the territory of Tritaea. But when Lycus and
Demodocus, the Hipparch of the league, heard of the expedition of the Aetolians from <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, they collected the people of
Dymae, <placeName key="tgn,7011025">Patrae</placeName> and Pharae, and joining the mercenaries to
these forces made an incursion upon <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. Arrived at a place
called Phyxium, they allowed their light-armed troops and
their horse to plunder the country, but kept their hoplites
concealed near this place: and when the Eleans had sallied
out in full force to attack the foraging parties, and were
<pb n="444"/>
pursuing them as they retreated, the hoplites with Lycus rose
from their hiding-place and charged them as they rushed
heedlessly on. The Eleans did not stand against the attack,
but fled at the mere appearance of the hoplites: who killed two
hundred of them and took eighty prisoners, and carried off
with them in safety all the booty that had been driven in from
the country. At the same time the Navarch of the league
made numerous descents upon Calydonia and the territory of
<placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>; and not only overran the country, but twice
annihilated the force sent out to resist him. Among others he
took Cleonicus of <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> prisoner: who owing to this being
a proxenus of the Achaeans was not sold on the spot, and after
some little time was set free without ransom.</p></div2>

Strategus of the Aetolian league, agreeing to hand over to him
the citadel of Phanoteus; and he confirmed his offer by a
regularly sworn treaty. On the appointed day Agetas came
with his Aetolian levy to Phanoteus under cover of night; and
concealing the rest at some little distance, he selected a hundred
of the most active men and sent them towards the citadel. Jason
had Alexander all ready with his soldiers, but duly received
the Aetolians as he had sworn into the citadel. Immediately
Alexander and his men threw themselves into the citadel also:

<p>About this same period King Philip captured Bylazora,

<div2 id="b5c98" type="chapter" n="98">
<head>Importance of Careful Measurement</head>
<p>This is the kind of mistake which above all others
reflects discredit on the commanders. For what can be more
culpable than to arrive at a town which they mean to carry, in
an entirely unprovided state, without having taken the precaution of measuring walls, cliffs, and the like, by which they
intend to effect their entrance? Or again, while satisfying
themselves as to these measurements, to entrust the construction
of ladders and all such machinery, which, though taking little
time to make, have to stand the test of a very critical service,
without consideration, and to incompetent persons,&mdash;is not
this deserving of censure? For in such actions it is not a
question of succeeding or failing without ill consequences; but
failure is followed by positive damage in manifold respects:
danger to the bravest of the men at the actual time, and still
greater danger during their retreat, when they have once
<pb n="446"/>
incurred the contempt of the enemy. The examples of such
disasters are numerous; for you will find that of those who
have failed in such attempts, many more have perished, or
have been reduced to the last extremity of danger, than have
come off scatheless. Moreover, no one can deny that they
arouse distrust and hatred against themselves for the future,
and give all men warning to be on their guard. For it is not
only the persons attacked, but all who know what has
happened, who are thereby bidden to look out for themselves
and be on the watch. Wherefore it is never right for men
in places of trust to conduct such enterprises inconsiderately.
The method also of taking such measurements, and constructing machines of this kind, is easy and liable to no
mistakes, if they are taken in hand scientifically.</p>
<p>For the present, however, I must resume the thread of my
narrative; but I shall take another fitting opportunity in the
course of my work to speak of these matters, and will endeavour to show how mistakes may best be avoided in such
undertakings.</p></div2>

<head>Capture of Thebes In Phthiotis</head>
<p>Thus baffled in his attempt upon <placeName key="tgn,5002021">Meliteia</placeName>, Philip encamped upon the bank of the Enipeus, and collected from
<placeName key="tgn,7010894">Larisa</placeName> and the other cities the siege train which he had caused

of <placeName key="perseus,Demetrias">Demetrias</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName>, and of <placeName key="tgn,7010797">Pharsalus</placeName> and Pherae in

being inflicted upon the Demetrians, Pharsalians, and
Larisaeans; as the Aetolians were in occupation of it, and
made continual predatory expeditions, often as far as to the
plain of Amyrus. Philip did not regard the matter as at all
of small importance, but was exceedingly bent on taking the
town. Having therefore got together a hundred and fifty
catapults, and twenty-five stone-throwing balistae, he sat down
before <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. He distributed his forces between three
points in the vicinity of the city; one was encamped near
<pb n="447"/>
Scopium; a second near a place called Heliotropium; and the
third on the hill overhanging the town. The spaces between
these camps he fortified by a trench and double palisade, and
further secured them by towers of wood, at intervals of a
hundred feet, with an adequate guard. When these works
were finished, he collected all his siege train together and began
to move his engines towards the citadel.</p></div2>

any progress in bringing his machines against
the town, owing to the gallant and even desperate defence which the garrison opposed to him.
But when the continual skirmishing, and the
volleys of missiles, had began to tell upon the
defenders, and some of them were killed and others disabled by wounds; the defence becoming a little slacker, the
Macedonians began sinking mines, and at last after nine days'
work reached the walls. They then carried on the work by
relays, so as never to leave it off day or night: and thus in three
days had undermined and underpinned two hundred feet of
the wall. The props, however, proved too weak to support
the weight, and gave way; so that the wall fell without the
Macedonians having the trouble of setting fire to them.
When they had worked energetically at clearing the debris, and
had made every preparation for entering by the breach, and
were just on the point of carrying it, the Thebans in a panic

<p>The commissioners having now assembled, Philip sent
Aratus and Taurion, and some others who had come with
them, to the Aetolians. They found them in full assembly
at <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>; and after a short conference with them, and
satisfying themselves as to their inclination for peace, they
sailed back to Philip to inform him of the state of the case.
But the Aetolians, being very eager to bring the war to a
conclusion, sent ambassadors with them to Philip urging him
to visit them with his army, that by a personal conference the
business might be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
Moved by these representations, the king
sailed across with his army to what is
called the Hollows of <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, about
twenty stades from the town. Having pitched a camp there,
and having caused both it and his ships to be surrounded by
a palisade, he waited for the time fixed for the interview.
The Aetolians came <foreign lang="fr">en masse</foreign> without arms; and keeping at a
distance of two stades from Philip's camp, interchanged
messages and discussions on the subjects in question. The
negotiation was begun by the king sending all the commissioners
of the allies, with instructions to offer the Aetolians peace, on
the condition of both parties retaining what they then held.
This preliminary the Aetolians readily agreed to; and then
there began a continuous interchange of messages between the
two, most of which I shall omit as containing no point of
interest: but I shall record the speech made by Agelaus of
<placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> in the first conference before the king and the
assembled allies. It was this.</p></div2>

gods hearty thanks if by all speaking with
one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, they may be able to repel the

their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the
present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our
guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast

proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is
evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public
affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans,
or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable
that the victors will remain contented with the empire of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. They will move forward: and will extend their
forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the
danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do
this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and
thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult
on the contrary for their good as you would for your own
person, and have a care for all parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> alike, as part
and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the
Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all
your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form
designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the
Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the
west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Wait
with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity
to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone
your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater
tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power
of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once
you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or
war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing
against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the

only this power of making war or peace with each other at our
own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes."</p></div2>

<p>This speech of Agelaus greatly influenced the allies
in favour of peace; and Philip more than any
one: as the arguments employed chimed in with
the wishes which the advice of Demetrius had
already roused in him. Both parties therefore came to terms
on the details of the treaty; and after ratifying it, separated to

leading statesmen of the Greek cities made war

was it long before the islanders and inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>
were affected in the same way; for those who were displeased
with Philip, or who had quarrels with Attalus, no longer turned
to Antiochus or Ptolemy, to the south or the east, but from
this time forth fixed their eyes on the west, some sending

regular ways and habits. Along with the

had all but sunk into oblivion in most of the states through
the persistent continuance of the late wars. It has ever
somehow been the case that the Peloponnesians, who of
all men are the most inclined to a peaceful and civilised
way of life, have hitherto enjoyed it less than any other
nation in the world; but have been rather as Euripides<note anchored="yes">Euripides, fr. 529. Ed. Nauck.</note> says
"still worn with toil and war's unrest." But to me it seems clear
that they bring this upon themselves in the natural course of
events: for their universal desire of supremacy, and their obstinate love of freedom, involve them in perpetual wars with each
other, all alike being resolutely set upon occupying the first place.
The Athenians on the contrary had by this time
freed themselves from fear of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and
considered that they had now permanently secured
their independence.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Isolation of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> They accordingly adopted Eurycleidas

<p>Ptolemy however immediately after these events
became involved in a war with his Egyptian
subjects. For in arming them for his campaign against Antiochus he had taken a step which, while it
served his immediate purpose sufficiently well, proved eventually disastrous. Elated with their victory at Rhaphia they
refused any longer to receive orders from the king; but looked
out for a leader to represent them, on the ground that they
were quite able to maintain their independence. And this
they succeeded in doing before very long.</p>

war against Achaeus.</p>
<p>At the time the Aetolians were delighted at the settlement

answered to their wishes; and they accordingly
elected Agelaus of <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> as their Strategus,

But this was scarcely arranged before they began to be discontented, and to find fault with Agelaus for having cut off all

definite states, but with all Greeks. But this statesman
patiently endured these unreasonable reproaches and succeeded
in checking the popular impulse. The Aetolians therefore were

that Scerdilaidas on the same pretext of money
owed to him, on which he had treacherously
seized the vessels at <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>, had now plundered
a town in <placeName key="tgn,4008520">Pelagonia</placeName> called Pissaeum; had won
over by promises some cities of the Dassaretae, namely, Phibotides, Antipatria, Chrysondym, and Geston; and had overrun
much of the district of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> bordering on these places.
He therefore at once started with his army in great haste to
recover the revolted cities, and determined to proclaim open
war with Scerdilaidas; for he thought it a matter of the most
vital importance to bring <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName> into a state of good order, with
a view to the success of all his projects, and above all of his
passage into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. For Demetrius was so assiduous in
keeping hot these hopes and projects in the king's mind, that
Philip even dreamed of them in his sleep, and thought of
nothing else but this Italian expedition. The motive of
Demetrius in so acting was not a consideration for Philip, for
he certainly did not rank higher than third in the calculations
of Demetrius. A stronger motive than that was his hatred of
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>: but the strongest of all was the consideration of his
own prospects. For he had made up his mind that it was
only in this way that he could ever recover his principality in

recovered the cities I have named, and took besides Creonium
<pb n="455"/>
and Gerus in Dassaretis; Enchelanae, Cerax, Sation, Boei, round
the Lychnidian Lake; <placeName key="perseus,Bantia">Bantia</placeName> in the district of the Calicoeni;
and Orgyssus in that of the Pisantini. After completing these

consideration that he would want ships to
carry out his designs, and men for rowing, not
for fighting,&mdash;for he could never have even
entertained a hope of fighting the Romans at sea,&mdash;but rather
for the transport of soldiers, and to enable him to cross with
greater speed to any point to which he might desire to go,

thinking that the Illyrian build was the best for the sort of
ships he wanted, determined to have a hundred galleys built;
which hardly any Macedonian king had ever done before. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. 216</note>
Having had these fitted out, he collected his
forces at the beginning of the summer; and, after
a brief training of the Macedonians in rowing them, put to sea.
It was just at the time that just at the time that Antiochus crossed Mount Taurus
when Philip, after sailing through the Euripus and rounding
Cape Malea, came to Cephallenia and <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>, where he
dropped anchor, and awaited anxiously the movements of the

called <placeName key="tgn,1086511">Sason</placeName>, which lies at the entrance to the

report that some men who had lately come from

<pb n="456"/>
reported that they left some Roman quinqueremes at <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>,
which were bound for <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName> to support Scerdilaidas. Thinking this fleet must be all but upon him, Philip, in great alarm,
promptly ordered his ships to weigh anchor and sail back the
way they came. They started and got out to sea in great
disorder, and reached Cephallenia, after sailing two nights and
days without intermission. Having now partially recovered
his courage, Philip remained there, covering his flight under the
pretext of having returned for some operations in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. It turned out that it was a false alarm altogether.
The truth was that Scerdilaidas, hearing in the course of the
winter that Philip was having a number of galleys built, and
expecting him to come to attack him by sea, had sent
messages to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> stating the facts and imploring help; and
the Romans had detached a squadron of ten ships from the
fleet at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, which were what had been seen at
<placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>. But if Philip had not fled from them in such

<head>Preface:  Political Constitutions</head>
<p>I AM aware that some will be at a loss to account for
my interrupting the course of my narrative for the sake
of entering upon the following disquisition on the Roman
constitution. But I think that I have already in many
passages made it fully evident that this particular branch of my
work was one of the necessities imposed on me by the nature of
my original design; and I pointed this out with special clearness in the preface which explained the scope of my history.
I there stated that the feature of my work which was at once
the best in itself, and the most instructive to the students of it,
was that it would enable them to know and fully realise in
what manner, and under what kind of constitution, it came
about that nearly the whole world fell under the power of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
in somewhat less than fifty-three years,&mdash;an event certainly
without precedent. This being my settled purpose, I could
see no more fitting period than the present for making a pause,
and examining the truth of the remarks about to be made on
this constitution. In private life if you wish to satisfy yourself
as to the badness or goodness of particular persons, you would
not, if you wish to get a genuine test, examine their conduct
at a time of uneventful repose, but in the hour of brilliant
success or conspicuous reverse. For the true test of a perfect
man is the power of bearing with spirit and dignity violent
changes of fortune. An examination of a constitution should
be conducted in the same way: and therefore being unable to
find in our day a more rapid or more signal change than
that which has happened to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, I reserved my disquistion on its constitution for this place. . . .
<pb n="459"/></p>
<p>What is really educational and beneficial to students of
history is the clear view of the causes of events, and the consequent power of choosing the better policy in a particular
case. Now in every practical undertaking by a state we must
regard as the most powerful agent for success or failure the
form of its constitution; for from this as from a fountain-head
all conceptions and plans of action not only proceed, but
attain their consummation.</p></div2>

<div2 id="b6c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Classification of Constitutions</head>
<p>Of the Greek republics, which have again and again
risen to greatness and fallen into insignificance, it is not difficult
to speak, whether we recount their past history or venture an
opinion on their future. For to report what is already known
is an easy task, nor is it hard to guess what is to come from
our knowledge of what has been. But in regard to the
Romans it is neither an easy matter to describe their present
state, owing to the complexity of their constitution; nor to
speak with confidence of their future, from our inadequate
acquaintance with their peculiar institutions in the past whether
affecting their public or their private life. It will require then
no ordinary attention and study to get a clear and comprehensive conception of the distinctive features of this constitution.</p>
<p>Now, it is undoubtedly the case that most of those who<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Classification of polities.</note>
profess to give us authoritative instruction
on this subject distinguish three kinds of
constitutions, which they designate <term>kingship,
aristocracy, democracy.</term> But in my opinion the question
might fairly be put to them, whether they name these as
being the <emph>only</emph> ones, or as the <emph>best.</emph> In either case I think
they are wrong. For it is plain that we must regard as the
<emph>best</emph> constitution that which partakes of all these three
elements. And this is no mere assertion, but has been proved
by the example of Lycurgus, who was the first to construct a
constitution&mdash;that of Sparta&mdash;on this principle. Nor can we
<pb n="460"/>
admit that these are the <emph>only</emph> forms: for we have had before
now examples of absolute and tyrannical forms of government,
which, while differing as widely as possible from kingship, yet
appear to have some points of resemblance to it; on which
account all absolute rulers falsely assume and use, as far as
they can, the title of king. Again there have been many
instances of oligarchical governments having in appearance
some analogy to aristocracies, which are, if I may say so, as
different from them as it is possible to be. The same also
holds good about democracy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>The Rotation of Polities</head>
<p>I will illustrate the truth of what I say. We cannot
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Six forms of polity, and their natural cycle.</note>
hold every absolute government to be a kingship, but only that which is accepted voluntarily, and is directed by an appeal to reason
rather than to fear and force. Nor again is every oligarchy
to be regarded as an aristocracy; the latter exists only
where the power is wielded by the justest and wisest men
selected on their merits. Similarly, it is not enough to constitute a democracy that the whole crowd of citizens should
have the right to do whatever they wish or propose. But
where reverence to the gods, succour of parents, respect to
elders, obedience to laws, are traditional and habitual, in such
communities, if the will of the majority prevail, we may speak
of the form of government as a democracy. So then we
enumerate six forms of government,&mdash;the three commonly
spoken of which I have just mentioned, and three more allied
forms, I mean <term>despotism, oligarchy</term> and <term>mob-rule.</term> The first
of these arises without artificial aid and in the natural order of
events. Next to this, and produced from it by the aid of art
and adjustment, comes <term>kingship;</term> which degenerating into the
evil form allied to it, by which I mean <term>tyranny,</term> both are once
more destroyed and <term>aristocracy</term> produced. Again the latter
being in the course of nature perverted to <term>oligarchy,</term> and the
people passionately avenging the unjust acts of their rulers,
<term>democracy</term> comes into existence; which again by its violence
and contempt of law becomes sheer <term>mob-rule.</term><note anchored="yes">Aristotle's classification is kingship, aristocracy, <foreign lang="greek">politei/a,</foreign> democracy,

Democracy degenerates into Mob-rule.</note> No clearer
<pb n="461"/>
proof of the truth of what I say could be obtained than by a
careful observation of the natural origin, genesis, and decadence
of these several forms of government. For it is only by seeing
distinctly how each of them is produced that a distinct view
can also be obtained of its growth, zenith, and decadence,
and the time, circumstance, and place in which each of these
may be expected to recur. This method I have assumed to
be especially applicable to the Roman constitution, because
its origin and growth have from the first followed natural
causes.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>The Origin of Constitutions</head>
<p>Now the natural laws which regulate the merging of one
form of government into another are perhaps discussed with
greater accuracy by Plato and some other philosophers. But
their treatment, from its intricacy and exhaustiveness, is only
within the capacity of a few. I will therefore endeavour to
give a summary of the subject, just so far as I suppose it to fall
within the scope of a practical history and the intelligence of
ordinary people. For if my exposition appear in any way
inadequate, owing to the general terms in which it is expressed,
the details contained in what is immediately to follow will
amply atone for what is left for the present unsolved.</p>
<p>What is the origin then of a constitution, and whence is it<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The origin of the social compact.</note>
produced? Suppose that from floods, pestilences, failure of crops, or some such causes
the race of man is reduced almost to extinction. Such things we are told have happened, and it is
reasonable to think will happen again. Suppose accordingly
all knowledge of social habits and arts to have been lost.
Suppose that from the survivors, as from seeds, the race of
man to have again multiplied. In that case I presume they
would, like the animals, herd together; for it is but reasonable
to suppose that bodily weakness would induce them to seek
those of their own kind to herd with. And in that case too,
as with the animals, he who was superior to the rest in strength
<pb n="462"/>
of body or courage of soul would lead and rule them. For
what we see happen in the case of animals that are without the
faculty of reason, such as bulls, goats, and cocks,&mdash;among
whom there can be no dispute that the strongest take the lead,
&mdash;that we must regard as in the truest sense the teaching of
nature. Originally then it is probable that the condition of
life among men was this,&mdash;herding together like animals and
following the strongest and bravest as leaders. The limit of
this authority would be physical strength, and the name we
should give it would be despotism. But as soon as the idea
of family ties and social relation has arisen amongst such
agglomerations of men, then is born also the idea of kingship,
and then for the first time mankind conceives the notion of
goodness and justice and their reverse.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Origin of Morality and Rule</head>
<p>The way in which such conceptions originate and come
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Origin of morality</note>
into existence is this. The intercourse of
the sexes is an instinct of nature, and the
result is the birth of children. Now, if any
one of these children who have been brought up, when
arrived at maturity, is ungrateful and makes no return to those
by whom he was nurtured, but on the contrary presumes to
injure them by word and deed, it is plain that he will probably
offend and annoy such as are present, and have seen the care
and trouble bestowed by the parents on the nurture and
bringing up of their children. For seeing that men differ from
the other animals in being the only creatures possessed of
reasoning powers, it is clear that such a difference of conduct
is not likely to escape their observation; but that they will
remark it when it occurs, and express their displeasure on the
spot: because they will have an eye to the future, and will
reason on the likelihood of the same occurring to each of
themselves. Again, if a man has been rescued or helped in
an hour of danger, and, instead of showing gratitude to his
preserver, seeks to do him harm, it is clearly probable that the
rest will be displeased and offended with him, when they know
it: sympathising with their neighbour and imagining themselves
in his case. Hence arises a notion in every breast of the
meaning and theory of duty, which is in fact the beginning
and end of justice. Similarly, again, when any one man
<pb n="463"/>
stands out as the champion of all in a time of danger, and
braves with firm courage the onslaught of the most powerful
wild beasts, it is probable that such a man would meet with
marks of favour and pre-eminence from the common people;
while he who acted in a contrary way would fall under their
contempt and dislike. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Morality transmutes despotism into kingship</note> From this, once more, it is reasonable
to suppose that there would arise in the minds of the multitude a theory of the disgraceful and the
honourable, and of the difference between
them; and that one should be sought and
imitated for its advantages, the other shunned. When, therefore, the leading and most powerful man among his people
ever encourages such persons in accordance with the popular
sentiment, and thereby assumes in the eyes of his subject the
appearance of being the distributor to each man according to
his deserts, they no longer obey him and support his rule from
fear of violence, but rather from conviction of its utility, however old he may be, rallying round him with one heart and soul,
and fighting against all who form designs against his government. In this way he becomes a <term>king</term> instead of a <term>despot</term> by
imperceptible degrees, reason having ousted brute courage and
bodily strength from their supremacy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>How Kingship Turns into Tyranny</head>
<p>This then is the natural process of formation among
mankind of the notion of goodness and justice, and their
opposites; and this is the origin and genesis of genuine kingship: for people do not only keep up the government of such
men personally, but for their descendants also for many generations; from the conviction that those who are born from and
educated by men of this kind will have principles also like
theirs. But if they subsequently become displeased with their
descendants, they do not any longer decide their choice of
rulers and kings by their physical strength or brute courage;
but by the differences of their intellectual and reasoning
faculties, from practical experience of the decisive importance
of such a distinction. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Kingship in its turn degenerates into tyranny.</note> In old times, then,
those who were once thus selected, and obtained this office, grew old in their royal
functions, making magnificent strongholds and surrounding
them with walls and extending their frontiers, partly for the
<pb n="464"/>
security of their subjects, and partly to provide them with
abundance of the necessaries of life; and while engaged in
these works they were exempt from all vituperation or jealousy;
because they did not make their distinctive dress, food, or drink,
at all conspicuous, but lived very much like the rest, and joined
in the everyday employments of the common people. But
when their royal power became hereditary in their family, and
they found every necessary for security ready to their hands,
as well as more than was necessary for their personal support,
then they gave the rein to their appetites; imagined that
rulers must needs wear different clothes from those of
subjects; have different and elaborate luxuries of the table;
and must even seek sensual indulgence, however unlawful the
source, without fear of denial. These things having given rise
in the one case to jealousy and offence, in the other to outburst of hatred and passionate resentment, the kingship
became a tyranny: the first step in disintegration was taken;
and plots began to be formed against the government, which
did not now proceed from the worst men but from the noblest,
most high-minded, and most courageous, because these are
the men who can least submit to the tyrannical acts of their
rulers.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Degeneration of Constitutions</head>
<p>But as soon as the people got leaders, they cooperated with them against the dynasty for
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Tyranny is then displaced by aristocracy</note>
the reasons I have mentioned; and then
<term>kingship</term> and <term>despotism</term> were alike entirely
abolished, and <term>aristocracy</term> once more began to revive and
start afresh. For in their immediate gratitude to those
who had deposed the despots, the people employed them as
leaders, and entrusted their interests to them; who, looking
upon this charge at first as a great privilege, made the public
advantage their chief concern, and conducted all kinds of
business, public or private, with diligence and caution. But
when the sons of these men received the same position of
authority from their fathers,&mdash;having had no experience of
misfortunes, and none at all of civil equality and freedom of
speech, but having been bred up from the first under the
shadow of their fathers' authority and lofty position,&mdash;some
of them gave themselves up with passion to avarice and
<pb n="465"/>
unscrupulous love of money, others to drinking and the
boundless debaucheries which accompanies it,
and others to the violation of women or the
forcible appropriation of boys; and so they
turned an <term>aristocracy</term> into an <term>oligarchy.</term> <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aristocracy degenerates into oligarchy</note> But it was not long
before they roused in the minds of the people the same
feelings as before; and their fall therefore was very like the
disaster which befell the tyrants.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c9" type="chapter" n="9">
<head>How Democracy Arises and Degenerates</head>
<p>For no sooner had the knowledge of the jealousy and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Oligarchy is replaced by democracy</note>
hatred existing in the citizens against them
emboldened some one to oppose the government by word or deed, than he was sure to
find the whole people ready and prepared to take his side.
Having then got rid of these rulers by assassination or exile,
they do not venture to set up a king again, being still in terror
of the injustice to which this led before; nor dare they intrust
the common interests again to more than one, considering the
recent example of their misconduct: and therefore, as the only
sound hope left them is that which depends upon themselves,
they are driven to take refuge in that; and so changed the
constitution from an oligarchy to a <term>democracy,</term> and took upon
themselves the superintendence and charge of the state. And
as long as any survive who have had experience of oligarchical
supremacy and domination, they regard their present constitution as a blessing, and hold equality and freedom as
of the utmost value. But as soon as a new generation has
arisen, and the democracy has descended to their children's
children, long association weakens their value for equality
and freedom, and some seek to become more powerful
than the ordinary citizens; and the most liable to this temptation are the rich.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Democracy degenerates into rule of corruption and violence, only to be stopped by a return to despotism.</note>
So when they begin to be fond of office,
and find themselves unable to obtain it by
their own unassisted efforts and their own
merits, they ruin their estates, while enticing
and corrupting the common people in every
possible way. By which means when, in their
senseless mania for reputation, they have made
the populace ready and greedy to receive bribes, the virtue of
democracy is destroyed, and it is transformed into a government
<pb n="466"/>  of violence and the strong hand. For the mob,
habituated to feed at the expense of others, and to have its
hopes of a livelihood in the property of its neighbours, as soon
as it has got a leader sufficiently ambitious and daring, being
excluded by poverty from the sweets of civil honours, produces a reign of mere violence. Then come tumultuous
assemblies, massacres, banishments, redivisions of land; until,
after losing all trace of civilisation, it has once more found a
master and a despot.</p>
<p>This is the regular cycle of constitutional revolutions, and
the natural order in which constitutions change, are transformed, and return again to their original stage. If a man
have a clear grasp of these principles he may perhaps make a
mistake as to the dates at which this or that will happen to a
particular constitution; but he will rarely be entirely mistaken
as to the stage of growth or decay at which it has arrived, or
as to the point at which it will undergo some revolutionary
change. However, it is in the case of the Roman constitution
that this method of inquiry will most fully teach us its
formation, its growth, and zenith, as well as the changes
awaiting it in the future; for this, if any constitution ever did,
owed, as I said just now, its original foundation and growth
to natural causes, and to natural causes will owe its decay. My
subsequent narrative will be the best illustration of what I say.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c10" type="chapter" n="10">
<head>Lycurgus</head>
<p>For the present I will make a brief reference to the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Lycurgus recognised these truths, and legislated accordingly.</note>
legislation of Lycurgus: for such a discussion
is not at all alien to my subject. That statesman was fully aware that all those changes
which I have enumerated come about by an
undeviating law of nature; and reflected that every form of
government that was unmixed, and rested on one species of
power, was unstable; because it was swiftly perverted into that
particular form of evil peculiar to it and inherent in its nature.
For just as rust is the natural dissolvent of iron, wood-worms
and grubs to timber, by which they are destroyed without any
external injury, but by that which is engendered in themselves;
so in each constitution there is naturally engendered a particular
vice inseparable from it: in kingship it is absolutism; in
aristocracy it is oligarchy; in democracy lawless ferocity and
<pb n="467"/>
violence; and to these vicious states all these forms of government are, as I have lately shown, inevitably transformed.
Lycurgus, I say, saw all this, and accordingly combined
together all the excellences and distinctive features of the best
constitutions, that no part should become unduly predominant,
and be perverted into its kindred vice; and that, each power
being checked by the others, no one part should turn the scale
or decisively out-balance the others; but that, by being
accurately adjusted and in exact equilibrium, the whole might
remain long steady like a ship sailing close to the wind. The
royal power was prevented from growing insolent by fear of
the people, which had also assigned to it an adequate share
in the constitution. The people in their turn were restrained from a bold contempt of the kings by fear of
the Gerusia: the members of which, being selected on grounds
of merit, were certain to throw their influence on the side of
justice in every question that arose; and thus the party placed
at a disadvantage by its conservative tendency was always
strengthened and supported by the weight and influence of
the Gerusia. The result of this combination has been that the
Lacedaemonians retained their freedom for the longest period
of any people with which we are acquainted.</p>
<p>Lycurgus however established his constitution without the
discipline of adversity, because he was able to foresee by the
light of reason the course which events naturally take and the
source from which they come. But though the Romans have
arrived at the same result in framing their commonwealth, they
have not done so by means of abstract reasoning, but through
many struggles and difficulties, and by continually adopting
reforms from knowledge gained in disaster. The result has
been a constitution like that of Lycurgus, and the best of any
existing in my time. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>The Roman Constitution</head>
<p>I have given an account of the constitution of Lycurgus,
I will now endeavour to describe that of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> at the period
of their disastrous defeat at <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName>.</p>
<p>I am fully conscious that to those who actually live under
<pb n="468"/>
this constitution I shall appear to give an inadequate account
of it by the omission of certain details. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman constitution at the epoch of <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName>, B.C. 216.</note>
Knowing accurately every portion of it from personal
experience, and from having been bred up in
its customs and laws from childhood, they will
not be struck so much by the accuracy of the description,
as annoyed by its omissions; nor will they believe that the
historian has purposely omitted unimportant distinctions, but
will attribute his silence upon the origin of existing institutions
or other important facts to ignorance. What is told they depreciate as insignificant or beside the purpose; what is omitted
they desiderate as vital to the question: their object being to
appear to know more than the writers. But a good critic
should not judge a writer by what he leaves unsaid, but from
what he says: if he detects mis-statement in the latter, he may
then feel certain that ignorance accounts for the former; but
if what he says is accurate, his omissions ought to be attributed
to deliberate judgment and not to ignorance. So much for
those whose criticisms are prompted by personal ambition
rather than by justice. . . .</p>
<p>Another requisite for obtaining a judicious approval for an
historical disquisition, is that it should be germane to the
matter in hand; if this is not observed, though its style may
be excellent and its matter irreproachable, it will seem out of
place, and disgust rather than please. . . .</p>
<p>As for the Roman constitution, it had three elements,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Triple element in the Roman Constitution.</note>
each of them possessing sovereign powers:
and their respective share of power in the
whole state had been regulated with such a
scrupulous regard to equality and equilibrium, that no one
could say for certain, not even a native, whether the constitution as a whole were an aristocracy or democracy or
despotism. And no wonder: for if we confine our observation
to the power of the Consuls we should be inclined to regard it
as despotic; if on that of the Senate, as aristocratic; and
if finally one looks at the power possessed by the people it
would seem a clear case of a democracy. What the exact
powers of these several parts were, and still, with slight modifications, are, I will now state.
<pb n="469"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>The Consuls</head>
<p>The Consuls, before leading out the legions, remain
in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and are supreme masters of the
administration. All other magistrates, except
the Tribunes, are under them and take their orders. They
introduce foreign ambassadors to the Senate; bring matters
requiring deliberation before it; and see to the execution
of its decrees. If, again, there are any matters of state
which require the authorisation of the people, it is their
business to see to them, to summon the popular meetings, to
bring the proposals before them, and to carry out the decrees
of the majority. In the preparations for war also, and in a
word in the entire administration of a campaign, they have all
but absolute power. It is competent to them to impose on
the allies such levies as they think good, to appoint the
Military Tribunes, to make up the roll for soldiers and select
those that are suitable. Besides they have absolute power of
inflicting punishment on all who are under their command
while on active service: and they have authority to expend as
much of the public money as they choose, being accompanied
by a quaestor who is entirely at their orders. A survey of
these powers would in fact justify our describing the constitution as despotic,&mdash;a clear case of royal government.
Nor will it affect the truth of my description, if any of the
institutions I have described are changed in our time, or in
that of our posterity: and the same remarks apply to what
follows.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c13" type="chapter" n="13">
<head>The Senate</head>
<p>The Senate has first of all the control of the treasury,
and regulates the receipts and disbursements
alike. For the Quaestors cannot issue any
public money for the various departments of the state
without a decree of the Senate, except for the service of
the Consuls. The Senate controls also what is by far the
largest and most important expenditure, that, namely, which
is made by the censors every <foreign lang="la">lustrum</foreign> for the repair or construction of public buildings; this money cannot be obtained
by the censors except by the grant of the Senate. Similarly all
crimes committed in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> requiring a public investigation,
such as treason, conspiracy, poisoning, or wilful murder, are
in the hands of the Senate. Besides, if any individual or state
<pb n="470"/>
among the Italian allies requires a controversy to be settled, a
penalty to be assessed, help or protection to be afforded,&mdash;all
this is the province of the Senate. Or again, outside <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, if
it is necessary to send an embassy to reconcile warring communities, or to remind them of their duty, or sometimes to
impose requisitions upon them, or to receive their submission,
or finally to proclaim war against them,&mdash;this too is the
business of the Senate. In like manner the reception to be given
to foreign ambassadors in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and the answers to be returned to them,
are decided by the Senate. With such business the people have nothing to do. Consequently, if one
were staying at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> when the Consuls were not in town, one
would imagine the constitution to be a complete aristocracy:
and this has been the idea entertained by many Greeks, and
by many kings as well, from the fact that nearly all the business
they had with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was settled by the Senate.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>The People</head>
<p>After this one would naturally be inclined to ask
what part is left for the people in the constitution, when the Senate has these various
functions, especially the control of the receipts and expenditure of the exchequer; and when the Consuls, again,
have absolute power over the details of military preparation,
and an absolute authority in the field? There is, however,
a part left the people, and it is a most important one.
For the people is the sole fountain of honour and of punishment; and it is by these two things and these alone that
dynasties and constitutions and, in a word, human society are
held together: for where the distinction between them is not
sharply drawn both in theory and practice, there no undertaking can be properly administered,&mdash;as indeed we might expect
when good and bad are held in exactly the same honour.
The people then are the only court to decide matters of life
and death; and even in-cases where the penalty is money, if
the sum to be assessed is sufficiently serious, and especially
when the accused have held the higher magistracies. And in
regard to this arrangement there is one point deserving especial
commendation and record. Men who are on trial for their
lives at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, while sentence is in process of being voted,&mdash;if
even only one of the tribes whose votes are needed to ratify the
<pb n="471"/>
sentence has not voted,&mdash;have the privilege at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> of openly
departing and condemning themselves to a voluntary exile.
Such men are safe at <placeName key="tgn,7004474">Naples</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Praeneste">Praeneste</placeName> or at <placeName key="perseus,Tibur">Tibur</placeName>, and
at other towns with which this arrangement has been duly
ratified on oath.</p>
<p>Again, it is the people who bestow offices on the deserving,
which are the most honourable rewards of virtue. It has also
the absolute power of passing or repealing laws; and, most
important of all, it is the people who deliberate on the question
of peace or war. And when provisional terms are made for
alliance, suspension of hostilities, or treaties, it is the people
who ratify them or the reverse.</p>
<p>These considerations again would lead one to say that the
chief power in the state was the people's, and that the constitution was a democracy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Division of Political Power At Rome</head>
<p>Such, then, is the distribution of power between the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The mutual relation of the three.</note>
several parts of the state. I must now show
how each of these several parts can, when they
choose, oppose or support each other.</p>
<p>The Consul, then, when he has started on an expedition<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Consul dependent on the Senate,</note>
with the powers I have described, is to all
appearance absolute in the administration of
the business in hand; still be has need of
the support both of people and Senate, and, without them,
is quite unable to bring the matter to a successful conclusion. For it is plain that he must have supplies sent to his
legions from time to time; but without a decree of the Senate
they can be supplied neither with corn, nor clothes, nor pay,
so that all the plans of a commander must be futile, if the
Senate is resolved either to shrink from danger or hamper his
plans. And again, whether a Consul shall bring any undertaking to a conclusion or no depends entirely upon the Senate:
for it has absolute authority at the end of a year to send another Consul to supersede him, or to continue the existing one
in his command. Again, even to the successes of the generals
the Senate has the power to add distinction and glory, and on
the other hand to obscure their merits and lower their credit,
For these high achievements are brought in tangible form before the eyes of the citizens by what are called "triumphs."
<pb n="472"/>
But these triumphs the commanders cannot celebrate with
proper pomp, or in some cases celebrate at all, unless the
Senate concurs and grants the necessary money. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">and on the people.</note> As for the
people, the Consuls are pre-eminently obliged
to court their favour, however distant from
home may be the field of their operations; for
it is the people, as I have said before, that ratifies, or refuses
to ratify, terms of peace and treaties; but most of all because
when laying down their office they have to give an
account<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">eu)qu/nas.</foreign> Polybius uses a word well known at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and other Greek
states, but the audit of a Consul seems to have been one of money accounts
only. At the expiration, however, of his office he took an oath in public that he
had obeyed the laws, and if any prosecution were brought against him it would
be tried before the people. See the case of Publius Claudius, <ref target="b1c52" targOrder="U">1, 52</ref>.</note>
of their administration before it. Therefore in no case is it
safe for the Consuls to neglect either the Senate or the goodwill of the people.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>The Senate Controlled by the People</head>
<p>As for the Senate, which possesses the immense
power I have described, in the first place
it is obliged in public affairs to take the
multitude into account, and respect the
wishes of the people; and it cannot put into execution the
penalty for offences against the republic, which are punishable with death, unless the people first ratify its decrees.
Similarly even in matters which directly affect the senators,&mdash;
for instance, in the case of a law diminishing the Senate's
traditional authority, or depriving senators of certain dignities
and offices, or even actually cutting down their property,&mdash;
even in such cases the people have the sole power of passing
or rejecting the law. But most important of all is the fact
that, if the Tribunes interpose their veto, the Senate not only
are unable to pass a decree, but cannot even hold a meeting
at all, whether formal or informal. Now, the Tribunes are
always bound to carry out the decree of the people, and above
all things to have regard to their wishes: therefore, for all these
reasons the Senate stands in awe of the multitude, and cannot
neglect the feelings of the people.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c17" type="chapter" n="17">
<head>Powers of the Senate</head>
<p>In like manner the people on its part is far from
being independent of the Senate, and is bound to take its
wishes into account both collectively and individually. For

contracts, too numerous to count, are given out by the

purchase the contracts from the censors for themselves; and
others go partners with them; while others again go security
for these contractors, or actually pledge their property to the
treasury for them. Now over all these transactions the Senate
has absolute control. It can grant an extension of time; and
in case of unforeseen accident can relieve the contractors from
a portion of their obligation, or release them from it altogether,
if they are absolutely unable to fulfil it. And there are many
details in which the Senate can inflict great hardships, or, on
the other hand, grant great indulgences to the contractors: for
in every case the appeal is to it. But the most important
point of all is that the judges are taken from its members in
the majority of trials, whether public or private, in which the
charges are heavy.<note anchored="yes">This refers primarily to the <foreign lang="la">consilium</foreign> of the <foreign lang="la">quaesitor</foreign> in any special

<head>Interdependency Brings Strength</head>
<p>The result of this power of the several estates for
mutual help or harm is a union sufficiently firm for all emergencies, and a constitution than which it is impossible to find
a better. For whenever any danger from without compels
<pb n="474"/>
them to unite and work together, the strength which is developed by the State is so extraordinary, that everything required
is unfailingly carried out by the eager rivalry shown by all
classes to devote their whole minds to the need of the hour,
and to secure that any determination come to should not fail
for want of promptitude; while each individual works, privately
and publicly alike, for the accomplishment of the business in
hand. Accordingly, the peculiar constitution of the State
makes it irresistible, and certain of obtaining whatever it
determines to attempt. Nay, even when these external alarms
are past, and the people are enjoying their good fortune and
the fruits of their victories, and, as usually happens, growing
corrupted by flattery and idleness, show a tendency to violence
and arrogance,&mdash;it is in these circumstances, more than ever,
that the constitution is seen to possess within itself the power
of correcting abuses. For when any one of the three classes
becomes puffed up, and manifests an inclination to be contentious and unduly encroaching, the mutual interdependency
of all the three, and the possibility of the pretensions of any
one being checked and thwarted by the others, must plainly
check this tendency: and so the proper equilibrium is maintained by the impulsiveness of the one part being checked
by its fear of the other. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c19" type="chapter" n="19">
<head>On the Roman Army</head>
<p>After electing the Consuls they proceed to elect military tribunes,&mdash;fourteen from those who had five years', and
ten from those who had ten years', service. All citizens must
serve ten years in the cavalry or twenty years in the infantry
before the forty-sixth year of their age, except those rated
below four hundred asses. The latter are employed in the
navy; but if any great public necessity arises they are obliged
to serve as infantry also for twenty campaigns: and no one can
hold an office in the state until he has completed ten years of
military service. . . .</p>
<p>When the Consuls are about to enrol the army they<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The levy.</note>
give public notice of the day on which all
Roman citizens of military age must appear.
This is done every year. When the day has arrived,
<pb n="475"/>
and the citizens fit for service are come to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and
have assembled on the Capitoline, the fourteen junior
tribunes divide themselves, in the order in which they were
appointed by the people or by the Imperators, into four
divisions, because the primary division of the forces thus raised
is into four legions. The four tribunes first appointed are
assigned to the legion called the 1st; the next three to the
2d; the next four to the 3d; and the three last to the
4th. Of the ten senior tribunes, the two first are assigned to
the 1st legion; the next three to the 2d; the two next to
the 3d; and the three last to the 4th.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c20" type="chapter" n="20">
<head>Allocation of Men to the Legions</head>
<p>This division and assignment of the tribunes having
been settled in such a way that all four legions have an
equal number of officers, the tribunes of the several legions
take up a separate position and draw lots for the tribes
one by one; and summon the tribe on whom it from time
to time falls. From this tribe they select four young men
as nearly like each other in age and physical strength as
possible. These four are brought forward, and the tribunes
of the first legion picks out one of them, those of the second
another, those of the third another, and the fourth has to
take the last. When the next four are selected the tribunes
of the second legion have the first choice, and those of the first
the last. With the next four the tribunes of the third legion
have the first choice, those of the second the last; and so on
in regular rotation: of which the result is that each legion
gets men of much the same standard. But when they have
selected the number prescribed,&mdash;which is four thousand two
hundred infantry for each legion, or at times of special danger
five thousand,&mdash;they next used to pass men for the cavalry, in
old times <emph>after</emph> the four thousand two hundred infantry; but
now they do it before them, the selection having been made by
the censor on the basis of wealth; and they enrol three hundred
for each legion.<note anchored="yes">Casaubon altered this to "two hundred." In <ref target="b3c107" targOrder="U">3, 107</ref>, Polybius certainly
states that the ordinary number of cavalry was 200, raised in cases of emergency to 300;
and <bibl n="Liv. 22.36">Livy, 22, 36</bibl>, gives an instance. But both authors in
many other passages mention 300 as the usual number, and any alteration of
this passage would be unsafe.</note></p></div2>

<head>Fourfold Division of the Legionaries</head>
<p>The roll having been completed in this manner, the
<pb n="476"/>
tribunes belonging to the several legions muster their men;
and selecting one of the whole body that they think most
suitable for the purpose, they cause him to take an oath that
he will obey his officers and do their orders to the best of his
ability. And all the others come up and take the oath
separately, merely affirming that they will do the same as the
first man.</p>
<p>At the same time the Consuls send orders to the magistrates
of the allied cities in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, from which they determine that
allied troops are to serve: declaring the number required, and
the day and place at which the men selected must appear.

appoint a commander and a paymaster.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="la">Praefectus sociis</foreign>

of the oath to their men, and giving out the

When they arrive on the appointed day, they first select the
youngest and poorest to form the <foreign lang="la">Velites,</foreign> the next to them
the <foreign lang="la">Hastati,</foreign> while those who are in the prime of life they
select as <foreign lang="la">Principes,</foreign> and the oldest of all as <foreign lang="la">Triarii.</foreign> For in
the Roman army these divisions, distinct not only as to their
ages and nomenclature, but also as to the manner in which
they are armed, exist in each legion. The division is made in such
proportions that the senior men, called <foreign lang="la">Triarii,</foreign> should number
six hundred, the <foreign lang="la">Principes</foreign> twelve hundred, the <foreign lang="la">Hastati</foreign> twelve
hundred, and that all the rest as the youngest should be
reckoned among the <foreign lang="la">Velites.</foreign> And if the whole number of the
legion is more than four thousand, they vary the numbers of
these divisions proportionally, except those of the <foreign lang="la">Triarii,</foreign>
which is always the same.</p></div2>

<head>Arms of the Youngest Roman Soldiers</head>
<p>The youngest soldiers or <foreign lang="la">Velites</foreign> are ordered to

carry a sword, spears, and target (<foreign lang="la">parma</foreign>). The
target is strongly made, and large enough to
protect the man; being round, with a diameter
of three feet. Each man also wears a headpiece without a

crest (<foreign lang="la">galea</foreign>); which he sometimes covers with a piece of
wolfs skin or something of that kind, for the sake both of
protection and identification; that the officers of his company
may be able to observe whether he shows courage or the
reverse on confronting dangers. The spear of the velites has
a wooden haft of about two cubits, and about a finger's
breadth in thickness; its head is a span long, hammered fine,
and sharpened to such an extent that it becomes bent the first
time it strikes, and cannot be used by the enemy to hurl
back; otherwise the weapon would be available for both
sides alike.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Arms of the Other Soldiers</head>
<p>The second rank, the <foreign lang="la">Hastati,</foreign> are ordered
to have the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">2. Arms of the <foreign lang="la">Hastati, Principes,</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">Triarii.</foreign></note>
complete panoply. This to a Roman means,
first, a large shield (<foreign lang="la">scutum</foreign>), the surface of
which is curved outwards, its breadth two and
a half feet, its length four feet,&mdash;though there is also an extra
sized shield in which these measures are increased by a palm's
breadth. It consists of two layers of wood fastened together
with bull's-hide glue; the outer surface of which is first
covered with canvas, then with calf's skin, on the upper and
lower edges it is bound with iron to resist the downward
strokes of the sword, and the wear of resting upon the ground.
Upon it also is fixed an iron boss (<foreign lang="la">umbo</foreign>), to resist the more formidable blows of stones and pikes, and of heavy missiles
generally. With the shield they also carry a sword (<foreign lang="la">gladius</foreign>)
hanging down by their right thigh, which is called a Spanish
sword.<note anchored="yes">For the Spanish sword see Fr. xxii.</note> It has an excellent point, and can deal a formidable
blow with either edge, because its blade is stout and unbending.
In addition to these they have two <foreign lang="la">pila,</foreign> a brass helmet, and
greaves (<foreign lang="la">ocreae</foreign>). Some of the <foreign lang="la">pila</foreign> are thick, some fine.
Of the thicker, some are round with the diameter of a palm's
length, others are a palm square. The fine pila are like
moderate sized hunting spears, and they are carried along with
the former sort. The wooden haft of them all is about three
cubits long; and the iron head fixed to each half is barbed, and
of the same length as the haft. They take extraordinary pains
to attach the head to the haft firmly; they make the fastening
of the one to the other so secure for use by binding it half
<pb n="478"/>
way up the wood, and riveting it with a series of clasps, that
the iron breaks sooner than this fastening comes loose,
although its thickness at the socket and where it is fastened
to the wood is a finger and a half's breadth. Besides these
each man is decorated with a plume of feathers, with three
purple or black feathers standing upright, about a cubit long.
The effect of these being placed on the helmet, combined with
the rest of the armour, is to give the man the appearance of
being twice his real height, and to give him a noble aspect
calculated to strike terror into the enemy. The common
soldiers also receive a brass plate, a span square, which they
put upon their breast and call a breastpiece (<foreign lang="la">pectorale</foreign>),
and so complete their panoply. Those who are rated above
a hundred thousand asses, instead of these breastpieces
wear, with the rest of their armour, coats of mail (<foreign lang="la">loricae</foreign>).
The Principes and Triarii are armed in the same way as the
<foreign lang="la">Hastati,</foreign> except that instead of <foreign lang="la">pila</foreign> they carry long spears
(<foreign lang="la">hastae</foreign>).</p></div2>

centurions according to merit, and then a

title of centurion alike, of whom the first man
chosen is a member of the council of war. And they in
their turn select a rear-rank officer each who is called <foreign lang="la">optio.</foreign>
Next, in conjunction with the centurions, they divide the
several orders (omitting the <foreign lang="la">Velites</foreign>) into ten companies each,
and appoint to each company two centurions and two
<foreign lang="la">optiones;</foreign> the <foreign lang="la">Velites</foreign> are divided equally among all the companies;
these companies are called orders (<foreign lang="la">ordines</foreign>) or maniples
(<foreign lang="la">manipuli</foreign>), or vexilla, and their officers are called centurions or
<foreign lang="la">ordinum ductores.</foreign><note anchored="yes">Polybius does not mention the subdivision of maniples into centuries, for
which the word ordines is sometimes used. <bibl n="Liv. 8.8">Livy, 8, 8</bibl>; <bibl n="Liv. 42.34">42, 34</bibl>.</note>
Each maniple selects two of their strongest
and best born men as standard-bearers (<foreign lang="la">vexillarii</foreign>). And that
each maniple should have two commanding officers is only
reasonable; for it being impossible to know what a commander
may be doing or what may happen to him, and necessities of
war admitting of no parleying, they are anxious that the
maniple may never be without a leader and commander.
<pb n="479"/>
When the two centurions are both on the field, the first elected
commands the right of the maniple, the second the left: if
both are not there, the one who is commands the whole. And
they wish the centurions not to be so much bold and adventurous, as men with a faculty for command, steady, and of a
profound rather than a showy spirit; not prone to engage
wantonly or be unnecessarily forward in giving battle; but such
as in the face of superior numbers and overwhelming pressure
will die in defence of their post.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c25" type="chapter" n="25">
<head>Officers and Armour of the Cavalry</head>
<p>Similarly they divide the cavalry into ten squadrons
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Officers and arms of the equites.</note>
(<foreign lang="la">turmae</foreign>), and from each they select three
officers (<foreign lang="la">decuriones</foreign>), who each select a subaltern (<foreign lang="la">optio</foreign>). The decurio first elected
commands the squadron, the other two have the rank
of <foreign lang="la">decuriones:</foreign> a name indeed which applies to all alike. If
the first <foreign lang="la">decurio</foreign> is not on the field, the second takes command
of the squadron. The armour of the cavalry is very like that
in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. In old times they did not wear the lorica, but
fought in their tunics (<foreign lang="la">campestria</foreign>); the result of which was
that they were prompt and nimble at dismounting and
mounting again with despatch, but were in great danger at
close quarters from the unprotected state of their bodies.
And their lances too were useless in two ways: first because
they were thin, and prevented their taking a good aim; and
before they could get the head fixed in the enemy, the
lances were so shaken by the mere motion of the horse
that they generally broke. Secondly, because, having no
spike at the butt end of their lance, they only had one stroke,
namely that with the spear-head; and if the lance broke, what
was left in their hands was entirely useless. Again they used
to have shields of bull's hide, just like those round cakes, with
a knob in the middle which are used at sacrifices, which were
useless at close quarters because they were flexible rather than
firm; and, when their leather shrunk and rotted from the rain,
unserviceable as they were before, they then became entirely
so. Wherefore, as experience showed them the uselessness of
these, they lost no time in changing to the Greek fashion of
arms: the advantages of which were, first, that men were able
to deliver the first stroke of their lance-head with a good
<pb n="480"/>
aim and effect, because the shaft from the nature of its construction was steady and not quivering; and, secondly, that they
were able, by reversing the lance, to use the spike at the buttend for a steady and effective blow. And the same may be
said about the Greek shields: for, whether used to ward off
a blow or to thrust against the enemy, they neither give nor
bend. When the Romans learnt these facts about the Greek
arms they were not long in copying them; for no nation has
ever surpassed them in readiness to adopt new fashions from
other people, and to imitate what they see is better in others
than themselves.</p></div2>

<head>The Roman Camp</head>
<p>Having made this distribution of their men and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Assembly of the legions.</note>
given orders for their being armed, as I have
described, the military tribunes dismiss them
to their homes. But when the day has arrived
on which they were all bound by their oath to appear at
the place named by the Consuls (for each Consul generally
appoints a separate place for his own legions, each having
assigned to him two legions and a moiety of the allies), all
whose names were placed on the roll appear without fail: no
excuse being accepted in the case of those
who have taken the oath, except a prohibitory
omen or absolute impossibility. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Socii.</note> The allies muster along
with the citizens, and are distributed and managed by
the officers appointed by the Consuls, who have the title
of <foreign lang="la">Praefecti sociis</foreign> and are twelve in number. These officers
select for the Consuls from the whole infantry and cavalry
of the allies such as are most fitted for actual service,
and these are called <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii</foreign> (which in Greek is
<foreign lang="greek">e)pi/lektoi</foreign>). The whole number of the infantry of the socii
generally equals that of the legions, but the cavalry is treble
that of the citizens. Of these they select a third of the
cavalry, and a fifth of the infantry to serve as <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii.</foreign>
The rest they divide into two parts, one of which is called the
right, the other the left wing (<foreign lang="la">alae</foreign>).</p>
<p>These arrangements made, the military tribunes take over
the citizens and allies and proceed to form a camp. Now the
principle on which they construct their camps, no matter when
or where, is the same; I think therefore that it will be in place
<pb n="481"/>
here to try and make my readers understand, as far as words
can do so, the Roman tactics in regard to the march (<foreign lang="la">agmen</foreign>),
the camp (<foreign lang="la">castrorum metatio</foreign>), and the line of battle (<foreign lang="la">acies</foreign>). I
cannot imagine any one so indifferent to things noble and,
great, as to refuse to take some little extra trouble to understand things like these; for if he has once heard them, he will
be acquainted with one of those things genuinely worth observation and knowledge.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c27" type="chapter" n="27">
<head>How the Camp is Constructed</head>
<p>Their method of laying out a camp is as follows. The
<note anchored="yes" place="marg" lang="la">Castrorum metatio.</note>
place for the camp having been selected,
the spot in it best calculated to give a view
of the whole, and most convenient for issuing
orders, is appropriated for the general's tent (<foreign lang="la">Praetorium</foreign>).</p>
<p>Having placed a standard on the spot on which they intend
to put the Praetorium, they measure off a square round this
standard; in such a way that each of its sides is a hundred feet
from the standard, and the area of the square is four plethra.<note anchored="yes">the plethrum = 10,000 square feet.
The side of the square of the Praetorium, therefore, is 200 feet.</note>
Along one side of this square&mdash;whichever aspect appears
most convenient for watering and foraging&mdash;the legions are
stationed as follows. I have said that there were six Tribuni
in each legion, and that each Consul had two legions,&mdash;it
follows that there are twelve <foreign lang="la">Tribuni</foreign> in a Consular army. Well,
they pitch the tents of these Tribuni all in one straight line,
parallel to the side of the square selected, at a distance of fifty
feet from it (there is a place too selected for the horses,
beasts of burden, and other baggage of the Tribuni); these
tents face the outer side of the camp and away from the square
described above,&mdash;a direction which will henceforth be called
"the front" by me. The tents of the Tribuni stand at equal
distances from each other, so that they extend along the whole
breadth of the space occupied by the legions.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c28" type="chapter" n="28">
<head>Division by Roads and Squares</head>
<p>From the line described by the front of these tents
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The principia.</note>
they measure another distance of a hundred
feet towards the front. At that distance another
parallel straight line is drawn, and it is from this last that they
begin arranging the quarters of the legions, which they do as
follows:&mdash;they bisect the last mentioned straight line, and
<pb n="482"/>
from that point draw another straight line at right angles
to it; along this line, on either side of it facing
each other, the cavalry of the two legions are
quartered with a space of fifty feet between them, which space
is exactly bisected by the line last mentioned.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The quarters.</note> The manner
of encamping the infantry is similar to that of the cavalry.
The whole area of each space occupied by the maniples and
squadrons is a square, and faces the <foreign lang="la">via;</foreign><note anchored="yes">That is the <foreign lang="la">via</foreign>
separating it from the next block, or from the vallum.</note> the length facing
the <foreign lang="la">via</foreign> is one hundred feet, and they generally try to make the
depth the same, except in the case of the socii; and when they
are employing legions of an extra number, they increase the
length and depth of these squares proportionally.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c29" type="chapter" n="29">
<head>Placement of <foreign lang="la">Triarii, Principes</foreign>, and <foreign lang="la">Hastati</foreign></head>
<p>The spaces assigned to the cavalry are opposite the
space between the two groups of tents belonging to the Tribuni
of the two legions, at right angles to the line along which they
stand, like a cross-road; and indeed the whole arrangement
of the <foreign lang="la">viae</foreign> is like a system of cross-roads, running on either side
of the blocks of tents, those of the cavalry on one side and those
of the infantry on the other. The spaces assigned to the
cavalry and the Triarii in each legion are back to back, with no
<foreign lang="la">via</foreign> between them, but touching each other, looking opposite
ways; and the depth of the spaces assigned to the Triarii is
only half that assigned to other maniples, because their
numbers are generally only half; but though the number of
the men is different, the length of the space is always the same
owing to the lesser depth. Next, parallel with these spaces, at
a distance of fifty feet, they place the <foreign lang="la">Principes</foreign> facing the
Triarii; and as they face the space between themselves and
the <foreign lang="la">Triarii,</foreign> we have two more roads formed at right angles
to the hundred-foot area in front of the tents of the Tribunes,
and running down from it to the outer agger of the camp on the
side opposite to that of the Principia, which we agreed to call
the front of the camp. Behind the spaces for the <foreign lang="la">Triarii</foreign> and
looking in the opposite direction, and touching each other, are
the spaces for the <foreign lang="la">Hastati.</foreign> These several branches of the
service (<foreign lang="la">Triarii, Principes, Hastati</foreign>), being each divided into
ten maniples, the cross-roads between the blocks are all the
same length and terminate in the front agger of the camp;
<pb n="483"/>
towards which they cause the last maniples in the rows to face.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>Placement of the Allies</head>
<p>Beyond the <foreign lang="la">Hastati</foreign> they again leave a space of fifty
feet, and there, beginning from the same base (the Principia),
and going in a parallel direction, and to the same distance
as the other blocks, they place the cavalry of the allies facing
the <foreign lang="la">Hastati.</foreign> Now the number of the allies, as I have stated
above, is equal to that of the legions in regard to the infantry,
though it falls below that if we omit the <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii;</foreign> but
that of the cavalry is double, when the third part is deducted
for service among the <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii.</foreign> Therefore in marking
out the camp the spaces assigned to the latter are made proportionally deeper, so that their length remains the same as
those occupied by the legions. Thus five viae are formed:<note anchored="yes">That is, one between the two legions, and two between the blocks in each.</note>
and back to back with these cavalry are the spaces for the
infantry of the allies, the depth being proportionally increased
according to their numbers;<note anchored="yes">That is to say&mdash;without the <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii</foreign> (1/5)&mdash;there are 2400 to get into
10 spaces instead of 3000 into 30.</note> and these maniples face the outer
sides of the camp and the agger. In each maniple the first
tent at either end is occupied by the centurions. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Via Quintana.</note> Between
the fifth and sixth squadrons of cavalry, and the
fifth and sixth maniple of infantry, there is a
space of fifty left, so that another road is made across the
camp at right angles to the others and parallel to the tents
of the Tribuni, and this they call the <foreign lang="la">Via Quintana,</foreign> as it runs
along the fifth squadrons and maniples.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c31" type="chapter" n="31">
<head>The Camp Market-Place</head>
<p>The space behind the tents of the Tribuni is thus
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The space between the Principia and the agger.</note>
used. On one side of the square of the Praetorium is the market, on the other the office of
the Quaestor and the supplies which he has
charge of. Then behind the last tent of the Tribuni on
either side, arranged at right angles to those tents, are the
quarters of the cavalry picked out of the <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii,</foreign> as
well as of some of those who are serving as
volunteers from personal friendship to the
Consuls. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Staff, or Praetoria cohors.</note> All these are arranged parallel to
the side aggers, facing on the one side the Quaestorium, on
<pb n="484"/>
the other the market-place. And, generally speaking, it falls
to the lot of these men not only to be near the Consul in the
camp, but to be wholly employed about the persons of the
Consul and the Quaestor on the march and all other occasions.
Back to back with these again, facing the agger, are placed
the infantry who serve in the same way as these cavalry.<note anchored="yes">That is, who have been selected from the pedites sociorum to serve on the

<p>Beyond these there is another empty space or road left,
one hundred feet broad, parallel to the tents of the Tribuni,

the <foreign lang="la">equites extraordinarii</foreign> are placed facing the market-place

to the rearward agger.</p>
<p>Back to back with the <foreign lang="la">equites extraordinarii</foreign> are the infantry
of the same, facing the agger at the rear of the whole camp.
And the space left empty on either side of these, facing the
agger on each side of the camp, is given up to foreigners and
such allies as chance to come to the camp.</p>
<p>The result of these arrangements is that the whole camp is<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The space round the quarters.</note>
a square, with streets and other constructions
regularly planned like a town. Between the line
of the tents and the agger there is an empty space
of two hundred feet on every side of the square, which is turned
to a great variety of uses. To begin with, it is exceedingly convenient for the marching in and out of the legions. For each
division descends into this space by the <foreign lang="la">via</foreign> which passes its own
quarters, and so avoids crowding and hustling each other, as
they would if they were all collected on one road. Again, all
cattle brought into the camp, as well as booty of all sorts taken
from the enemy, are deposited in this space and securely
guarded during the night-watches. But the most important
use of this space is that, in night assaults, it secures the tents
from the danger of being set on fire, and keeps the soldiers
out of the range of the enemy's missiles; or, if a few of them
do carry so far, they are spent and cannot penetrate the tents.

<head>Arrangements When There Are More Men</head>
<p>The number then of foot-soldiers and cavalry being
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Provision for extra numbers.</note>
given (at the rate, that is to say, of four
thousand or of five thousand for each legion),
and the length, depth, and number of the
maniples being likewise known, as well as the breadth of
the passages and roads, it becomes possible to calculate
the area occupied by the camp and the length of the
aggers. If on any occasion the number of allies, either
those originally enrolled or those who joined subsequently,
exceeds their due proportion, the difficulty is provided for
in this way. To the overplus of allies who joined subsequent
to the enrolment of the army are assigned the spaces on either
side of the Praetorium, the market-place and Quaestorium being proportionally contracted. For the extra numbers of allies
who joined originally an extra line of tents (forming thus another <foreign lang="la">via</foreign>) is put up parallel with the other tents of the socii,
facing the agger on either side of the camp. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">and for two consular armies.</note> But if all four
legions and both Consuls are in the same
camp, all we have to do is to imagine a second
army, arranged back to back to the one
already placed, in exactly the same spaces as the former,
but side by side with it at the part where the picked men
from the <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii</foreign> are stationed facing the rearward agger.
In this case the shape of the camp becomes an oblong, the
area double, and the length of the entire agger half as much
again. This is the arrangement when both Consuls are within
the same agger; but if they occupy two separate camps, the
above arrangements hold good, except that the market-place is
placed half way between the two camps.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>Guard Duty and Other Assignments</head>
<p>The camp having thus been laid out, the Tribuni
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Guard duty.</note>
next administer an oath to all in it separately,
whether free or slave, that they will steal
nothing within the agger, and in case they find anything will
bring it to the Tribuni. They next select for their several
duties the maniples of the Principes and Hastati in each
legion. Two are told off to guard the space in front of the
quarters of the Tribuni. For in this space, which is called the
Principia, most of the Romans in the camp transact all the
business of the day; and are therefore very particular about its
<pb n="486"/>
being kept well watered and properly swept. Of the other
eighteen maniples, three are assigned to each of the six Tribuni,
that being the respective numbers in each legion; and of these
three maniples each takes its turn of duty in waiting upon the
Tribune. The services they render him are such as these:
they pitch his tent for him when a place is selected for
encampment, and level the ground all round it; and if any
extra precaution is required for the protection of his baggage,
it is their duty to see to it. They also supply him with two
relays of guards. A guard consists of four men, two of whom
act as sentries in front of his tent, and two on the rear of it
near the horses. Seeing that each Tribune has three maniples,
and each maniple has a hundred men, without counting <foreign lang="la">Triarii</foreign>
and <foreign lang="la">Velites</foreign> who are not liable for this service, the duty is a
light one, coming round to each maniple only once in three
days; while by this arrangement ample provision is made for
the convenience as well as the dignity of the Tribuni. The
maniples of Triarii are exempted from this personal service to
the Tribuni, but they each supply a watch of four men to the
squadron of cavalry nearest them. These watches have to
keep a general look out; but their chief duty is to keep an eye
upon the horses, to prevent their hurting themselves by getting
entangled in their tethers, and so becoming unfit for use; or
from getting loose, and making a confusion and disturbance in
the camp by running against other horses. Finally, all the
maniples take turns to mount guard for a day each at the
Consul's tent, to protect him from plots, and maintain the
dignity of his office.</p></div2>

by and superintend the work of each maniple; while two
of the Tribunes superintend the construction of the whole
<pb n="487"/>
side and see that it is adequate. In the same way the
Tribunes superintend all other operations in the camp. They
divide themselves in twos, and each pair is on duty for two
months out of six; they draw lots for their turns, and the pair
on whom the lot falls takes the superintendence of all active
operations. The prefects of the socii divide their duty in the

them on to the rank and file as occasion may demand.</p>
<p>To secure the passing round of the watchword for the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The watchword.</note>
night the following course is followed. One
man is selected from the tenth maniple,
which, in the case both of cavalry and infantry, is quartered at the ends of the road between the tents; this
man is relieved from guard-duty and appears each day
about sunset at the tent of the Tribune on duty, takes the
<foreign lang="la">tessera</foreign> or wooden tablet on which the watchword is inscribed,
and returns to his own maniple and delivers the wooden tablet
and watchword in the presence of witnesses to the chief
officer of the maniple next his own; he in the same way to
the officer of the next, and so on, until it arrives at the first
maniple stationed next the Tribunes. These men are
obliged to deliver the tablet (<foreign lang="la">tessera</foreign>) to the Tribunes before
dark. If they are all handed in, the Tribune knows that the
watchword has been delivered to all, and has passed through
all the ranks back to his hands: but if any one is missing, he
at once investigates the matter; for he knows by the marks on
the tablets from which division of the army the tablet has not
appeared; and the man who is discovered to be responsible
for its non-appearance is visited with condign punishment.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c35" type="chapter" n="35">
<head>Night Watches</head>
<p>Next as to the keeping guard at night. The
Consul's tent is guarded by the maniple
on duty: those of the Tribuni and praefects
of the cavalry by the pickets formed as described above
from the several maniples. And in the same way each
maniple and squadron posts guards of their own men. The
<pb n="488"/>
other pickets are posted by the Consul. Generally speaking
there are three pickets at the Quaestorium, and two at the
tent of each of the legati or members of council. The vallum
is lined by the <foreign lang="la">velites</foreign>, who are on guard all along it from
day to day. That is their special duty; while they also guard
all the entrances to the camp, telling off ten sentinels to take
their turn at each of them. Of the men told off for duty at the
several <foreign lang="la">stationes</foreign>, the man who in each maniple is to take the
first watch is brought by the rear-rank man of his company to
the Tribune at eventide. The latter hands over to them
severally small wooden tablets (<foreign lang="la">tesserae</foreign>), one for each watch,
inscribed with small marks; on receiving which they go off to
the places indicated.</p>
<p>The duty of going the rounds is intrusted to the cavalry.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Visiting rounds.</note>
The first Praefect of cavalry in each legion, early
in the morning, orders one of his rear-rank men
to give notice before breakfast to four young men of his squadron
who are to go the rounds. At evening this same man's duty
is to give notice to the Praefect of the next squadron that it is
his turn to provide for going the rounds until next morning.
This officer thereupon takes measures similar to the preceding
one until the next day; and so on throughout the cavalry
squadrons. The four men thus selected by the rear-rank men
from the first squadron, after drawing lots for the watch they
are to take, proceed to the tent of the Tribune on duty, and
receive from him a writing stating the order<note anchored="yes">That is, whether in first, second, or other watch in the night.</note> and the number
of the watches they are to visit. The four then take up their
quarters for the night alongside of the first maniple of
Triarii; for it is the duty of the centurion of this maniple to
see that a bugle is blown at the beginning of every watch.
When the time has arrived, the man to whose lot the first
watch has fallen goes his rounds, taking some of his friends as
witnesses. He walks through the posts assigned, which are
not only those along the vallum and gates, but also the
pickets set by the several maniples and squadrons. If he
find the men of the first watch awake he takes from them their
tessera; but if he find any one of them asleep or absent from
his post, he calls those with him to witness the fact and passes
<pb n="489"/>
on. The same process is repeated by those who go the
rounds during the other watches. The charge of seeing that
the bugle is blown at the beginning of each watch, so that the
right man might visit the right pickets, is as I have said, laid
upon the centurions of the first maniple of Triarii, each one
taking the duty for a day.</p>
<p>Each of these men who have gone the rounds (<foreign lang="la">tessarii</foreign>) at
daybreak conveys the tesserae to the Tribune on duty. If the
whole number are given in they are dismissed without
question; but if any of them brings a number less than that
of the pickets, an investigation is made by means of the mark
on the tessera, as to which picket he has omitted. Upon this
being ascertained the centurion is summoned; he brings the
men who were on duty, and they are confronted with the
patrol. If the fault is with the men on guard, the patrol
clears himself by producing the witnesses whom he took with
him; for he cannot do so without. If nothing of that sort
happened, the blame recoils upon the patrol.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c37" type="chapter" n="37">
<head>The Tribunes' Court</head>
<p>Then the Tribunes at once hold a court-martial,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Military punishments: the <foreign lang="la">fustuarium.</foreign></note>
and the man who is found guilty is punished
by the <foreign lang="la">fustuarium</foreign>; the nature of which is
this. The Tribune takes a cudgel and merely
touches the condemned man; whereupon all the soldiers
fall upon him with cudgels and stones. Generally speaking men thus punished are killed on the spot; but if
by any chance, after running the gauntlet, they manage
to escape from the camp, they have no hope of ultimately
surviving even so. They may not return to their own country,
nor would any one venture to receive such an one into his
house. Therefore those who have once fallen into this
misfortune are utterly and finally ruined. The same fate
awaits the praefect of the squadron, as well as his rear-rank
man, if they fail to give the necessary order at the proper time,
the latter to the patrols, and the former to the praefect of the
next squadron. The result of the severity and inevitableness of this punishment is that in the Roman army the night
watches are faultlessly kept. The common soldiers are
amenable to the Tribunes; the Tribunes to the Consuls.
The Tribune is competent to punish a soldier by inflicting a
<pb n="490"/>
fine, distraining his goods, or ordering him to be flogged; so too
the praefects in the case of the socii. The punishment of the
<foreign lang="la">fustuarium</foreign> is assigned also to any one committing theft in
the camp, or bearing false witness: as also to any one who in
full manhood is detected in shameful immorality: or to any
one who has been thrice punished for the same offence. All
these things are punished as crimes. But such as the following are reckoned as cowardly and dishonourable in a soldier:
&mdash;for a man to make a false report to the Tribunes of his
valour in order to get reward; or for men who have been
told off to an ambuscade to quit the place assigned them from
fear; and also for a man to throw away any of his arms from
fear, on the actual field of battle. Consequently it sometimes
happens that men confront certain death at their stations, because, from their fear of the punishment awaiting them at
home, they refuse to quit their post: while others, who have
lost shield or spear or any other arm on the field, throw themselves upon the foe, in hopes of recovering what they have lost,
or of escaping by death from certain disgrace and the insults
of their relations.<note anchored="yes">See the story of Cato's son, <bibl n="Plut. Cat. Ma. 20">Plutarch, <title>Cato Maj.</title> 20</bibl>.</note></p></div2>

<head>Military Punishments and Rewards</head>
<p>But if it ever happens that a number of men are
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Decimation.</note>
involved in these same acts: if, for instance,
some entire maniples have quitted their ground
in the presence of the enemy, it is deemed impossible to
subject all to the<foreign lang="la">fustuarium</foreign> or to military execution;
but a solution of the difficulty has been found at once
adequate to the maintenance of discipline and calculated
to strike terror. The Tribune assembles the legion, calls
the defaulters to the front, and, after administering a sharp
rebuke, selects five or eight or twenty out of them by lot,
so that those selected should be about a tenth of those who
have been guilty of the act of cowardice. These selected
are punished with the<foreign lang="la">fustuarium</foreign> without mercy; the rest are
put on rations of barley instead of wheat, and are ordered to
take up their quarters outside the vallum and the protection of
the camp. As all are equally in danger of having the lot fall
on them, and as all alike who escape that, are made a conspicuous example of by having their rations of barley, the best
<pb n="491"/>
possible means are thus taken to inspire fear for the future,
and to correct the mischief which has actually occurred.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c39" type="chapter" n="39">
<head>Military Decorations</head>
<p>A very excellent plan also is adopted for inducing
young soldiers to brave danger. When an
engagement has taken place and any of them
have showed conspicuous gallantry, the Consul
summons an assembly of the legion, puts forward those
whom he considers to have distinguished themselves in any
way, and first compliments each of them individually on his
gallantry, and mentions any other distinction he may have
earned in the course of his life, and then presents them with
gifts: to the man who has wounded an enemy, a spear; to
the man who has killed one and stripped his armour, a cup,
if he be in the infantry, horse-trappings if in the cavalry:
though originally the only present made was a spear. This
does not take place in the event of their having wounded or
stripped any of the enemy in a set engagement or the storming of a town; but in skirmishes or other occasions of that
sort, in which, without there being any positive necessity for
them to expose themselves singly to danger, they have done
so voluntarily and deliberately. In the capture of a town
those who are first to mount the walls are presented with a gold crown. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Mural crown.</note> So too those who
have covered and saved any citizens or allies are distinguished
by the Consul with certain presents; and those whom they
have preserved present them voluntarily with a
crown, or if not, they are compelled to do so
by the Tribunes. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Civic crown.</note> The man thus preserved, too, reverences
his preserver throughout his life as a father, and is bound to
act towards him as a father in every respect. By such incentives those who stay at home are stirred up to a noble
rivalry and emulation in confronting danger, no less than those
who actually hear and see what takes place. For the recipients of such rewards not only enjoy great glory among
their comrades in the army, and an immediate reputation at
home, but after their return they are marked men in all
solemn festivals; for they alone, who have been thus distinguished by the Consuls for bravery, are allowed to wear
robes of honour on those occasions: and moreover they place
<pb n="492"/>
the spoils they have taken in the most conspicuous places in
their houses, as visible tokens and proofs of their valour. No
wonder that a people, whose rewards and punishments are
allotted with such care and received with such feelings, should
be brilliantly successful in war.</p>
<p>The pay of the foot soldier is 5 1/3 asses a day; of the
centurion 10 2/3; of the cavalry 16. The infantry receive a
ration of wheat equal to about 2/3 of an Attic medimnus a
month, and the cavalry 7 medimni of barley, and 2 of wheat;
of the allies the infantry receive the same, the cavalry 1 1/3
medimnus of wheat, and 5 of barley. This is a free gift to
the allies; but in the cases of the Romans, the Quaestor stops
out of their pay the price of their corn and clothes, or any
additional arms they may require at a fixed rate.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c40" type="chapter" n="40">
<head>The Army On the March</head>
<p>The following is their manner of moving camp. At
the first bugle the men all strike their tents and collect their
baggage; but no soldier may strike his tent, or set it up either,
till the same is done to that of the Tribuni and the Consul.
At the second bugle they load the beasts of burden with their
baggage: at the third the first maniples must advance and
set the whole camp in motion. Generally speaking, the men
appointed to make this start are the <foreign lang="la">extraordinarii:</foreign> next comes
the right wing of the socii; and behind them their beasts of
burden. These are followed by the first legion with its own
baggage immediately on its rear; then comes the second
legion, followed by its own beasts of burden, and the baggage
of those socii who have to bring up the rear of the march,
that is to say, the left wing of the socii. The cavalry sometimes ride on the rear of their respective divisions, sometimes
on either side of the beasts of burden, to keep them together
and secure them. If an attack is expected on the rear, the
<foreign lang="la">extraordinarii</foreign> themselves occupy the rear instead of the
van. Of the two legions and wings each takes the lead in
the march on alternate days, that by this interchange of position all may have an equal share in the advantage of being
first at the water and forage. The order of march, however,
is different at times of unusual danger, if they have open ground
enough. For in that case they advance in three parallel
columns, consisting of the <foreign lang="la">Hastati, Principes,</foreign> and <foreign lang="la">Triarii:</foreign> the
<pb n="493"/>
beasts of burden belonging to the maniples in the van are placed
in front of all, those belonging to the second behind the leading maniples, and those belonging to the third behind the second
maniples, thus having the baggage and the maniples in alternate
lines. With this order of march, on an alarm being given, the
columns face to the right or left according to the quarter on
which the enemy appears, and get clear of the baggage. So
that in a short space of time, and by one movement, the whole
of the hoplites are in line of battle&mdash;except that sometimes it
is necessary to half-wheel the <foreign lang="la">Hastati</foreign> also&mdash;and the baggage
and the rest of the army are in their proper place for safety,
namely, in the rear of the line of combatants.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c41" type="chapter" n="41">
<head>Making Camp</head>
<p>When the army on the march is approaching the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="tgn,7020688">Encampment</placeName> on the march.</note>
place of encampment, a Tribune, and those
of the centurions who have been from time
to time selected for that duty, are sent
forward to survey the place of encampment. Having done
this they proceed first of all to fix upon the place for the Consul's tent (as I have described above), and to determine on
which side of the Praetorium to quarter the legions. Having
decided these points they measure out the Praetorium, then
they draw the straight line along which the tents of the Tribunes
are to be pitched, and then the line parallel to this, beyond
which the quarters of the legions are to begin. In the same
way they draw the lines on the other sides of the Praetorium
in accordance with the plan which I have already detailed at
length. This does not take long, nor is the marking out of
the camp a matter of difficulty, because the dimensions are all
regularly laid down, and are in accordance with precedent.
Then they fix one flag in the ground where the Consul's tent
is to stand, and another on the base of the square containing
it, and a third on the line of the Tribunes' tents; the two latter
are scarlet, that which marks the Consul's tent is white; the
lines on the other sides of the Praetorium are marked sometimes with plain spears and sometimes by flags of other colours.
After this they lay out the <foreign lang="la">viae</foreign> between the quarters, fixing
spears at each <foreign lang="la">via.</foreign> Consequently when the legions in the
course of their march have come near enough to get a clear
view of the place of encampment, they can all make out
<pb n="494"/>
exactly the whole plan of it, taking as their base the Consul's
flag and calculating from that. Moreover as each soldier
knows precisely on which <foreign lang="la">via,</foreign> and at what point of it, his
quarters are to be, because all occupy the same position in
the camp wherever it may be, it is exactly like a legion entering
its own city; when breaking off at the gates each man makes
straight for his own residence without hesitation, because he
knows the direction and the quarter of the town in which
home lies. It is precisely the same in a Roman camp.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c42" type="chapter" n="42">
<head>Roman Camps Designed for Facility and Familiarity</head>
<p>It is because the first object of the Romans in the
matter of encampment is facility, that they seem to me to
differ diametrically from Greek military men in this respect.
Greeks, in choosing a place for a camp, think primarily of
security from the natural strength of the position: first, because
they are averse from the toil of digging a foss, and, secondly,
because they think that no artificial defences are comparable
to those afforded by the nature of the ground. Accordingly,
they not only have to vary the whole configuration of the camp
to suit the nature of the ground, but to change the arrangement of details in all kinds of irregular ways; so that neither
soldier nor company has a fixed place in it. The Romans, on
the other hand, prefer to undergo the fatigue of digging, and
of the other labours of circumvallation, for the sake of the
facility in arrangement, and to secure a plan of encampment
which shall be one and the same and familiar to all.</p>
<p>Such are the most important facts in regard to the legions
and the method of encamping them. . . .</p></div2>

<head>The Roman Republic Compared with Others</head>
<p>Nearly all historians have recorded as constitutions

of eminent excellence those of Lacedaemonia,
<placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7010918">Mantinea</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. Some have

The former I may allow to pass; but I am convinced that
little need be said of the Athenian and Theban constitutions: their growth was abnormal, the period of their
zenith brief, and the changes they experienced unusually
violent. Their glory was a sudden and fortuitous flash, so to
<pb n="495"/>
speak; and while they still thought themselves prosperous, and
likely to remain so, they found themselves involved in
circumstances completely the reverse. The Thebans got their
reputation for valour among the Greeks, by taking advantage
of the senseless policy of the Lacedaemonians, and the hatred
of the allies towards them, owing to the valour of one, or at
most two, men who were wise enough to appreciate the
situation. Since fortune quickly made it evident that it was
not the peculiarity of their constitution, but the valour of
their leaders, which gave the Thebans their success. For the
great power of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> notoriously took its rise, attained its
zenith, and fell to the ground with the lives of Epaminondas
and Pelopidas. We must therefore conclude that it was not
its constitution, but its men, that caused the high fortune
which it then enjoyed.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c44" type="chapter" n="44">
<head>The Athenian Constitution</head>
<p>A somewhat similar remark applies to the Athenian
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Athenian constitution may be put aside.</note>
constitution also. For though it perhaps had
more frequent interludes of excellence, yet
its highest perfection was attained during the
brilliant career of Themistocles; and having reached that
point it quickly declined, owing to its essential instability.
For the Athenian demus is always in the position of a ship
without a commander. In such a ship, if fear of the enemy,
or the occurrence of a storm induce the crew to be of one mind
and to obey the helmsman, everything goes well; but if they
recover from this fear, and begin to treat their officers with
contempt, and to quarrel with each other because they are no
longer all of one mind,&mdash;one party wishing to continue the
voyage, and the other urging the steersman to bring the ship
to anchor; some letting out the sheets, and others hauling
them in, and ordering the sails to be furled,&mdash;their discord and
quarrels make a sorry show to lookers on; and the position of
affairs is full of risk to those on board engaged on the same
voyage: and the result has often been that, after escaping the
dangers of the widest seas, and the most violent storms, they
wreck their ship in harbour and close to shore. And this is what
has often happened to the Athenian constitution. For, after
repelling, on various occasions, the greatest and most formidable
dangers by the valour of its people and their leaders, there
<pb n="496"/>
have been times when, in periods of secure tranquillity, it has
gratuitously and recklessly encountered disaster.<note anchored="yes">In seeking a constitution to compare with that of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>

loosely. The power of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, of which Themistocles laid the foundation,
was mainly consolidated by Pericles; so that Polybius includes much of the

need say no more about either it, or the Theban constitution: in
both of which a mob manages everything on its own unfettered

of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; and secondly how they came to assert that it was
at all admirable. I can agree with neither assertion; and
I will explain why I say so. And first as to its dissimilarity
with the Spartan constitution. The peculiar merit of the latter
is said to be its land laws, by which no one possesses more than
another, but all citizens have an equal share in the public
land.<note anchored="yes">This equality of land had gradually disappeared by the time of King
Agis IV. (B.C. <dateRange from="-243" to="-239">243</dateRange>-239): so that, according to Plutarch <bibl n="Plut. Agis 5">[<title>Agis</title> 5]</bibl>, the number
of landowners was reduced to 100. This process had been accelerated by the
Rhetra of Epitadeus, allowing free bequest of land, Plutarch, <foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> See Thirlwall, vol. viii. p. 132.</note>
The next distinctive feature regards the possession of
money: for as it is utterly discredited among them, the
jealous competition which arises from inequality of wealth is
entirely removed from the city. A third peculiarity of the
Lacedaemonian polity is that, of the officials by whose hands
and with whose advice the whole government is conducted,
the kings hold an hereditary office, while the members of the
Gerusia are elected for life.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c46" type="chapter" n="46">
<head>Greed Among the Cretans</head>
<p>Among the Cretans the exact reverse of all these arrangements
<pb n="497"/>  obtains. The laws allow them to possess as much land
as they can get with no limitation whatever. Money is so
highly valued among them, that its possession is not only
thought to be necessary but in the highest degree creditable.
And in fact greed and avarice are so native to the soil in
<placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, that they are the only people in the world among whom
no stigma attaches to any sort of gain whatever. Again all
their offices are annual and on a democratical footing. I have
therefore often felt at a loss to account for these writers
speaking of the two constitutions, which are radically different,
as though they were closely united and allied. But, besides
overlooking these important differences, these writers have
gone out of their way to comment at length on the legislation
of Lycurgus: "He was the only legislator," they say, "who
saw the important points. For there being two things on
which the safety of a commonwealth depends,&mdash;courage in
the face of the enemy and concord at home,&mdash;by abolishing
covetousness, he with it removed all motive for civil broil and
contest: whence it has been brought about that the Lacedaemonians are the best governed and most united people in
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>." Yet while giving utterance to these sentiments, and
though they see that, in contrast to this, the Cretans by their
ingrained avarice are engaged in countless public and private
seditions, murders and civil wars, they yet regard these facts as
not affecting their contention, but are bold enough to speak of
the two constitutions as alike. Ephorus, indeed, putting aside
names, employs expressions so precisely the same, when discoursing on the two constitutions, that, unless one noticed the
proper names, there would be no means whatever of distinguishing which of the two he was describing.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c47" type="chapter" n="47">
<head>What Makes a Constitution Good</head>
<p>In what the difference between them consists I have
already stated. I will now address myself to showing that the
Cretan constitution deserves neither praise nor imitation.</p>
<p>To my mind, then, there are two things fundamental<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Tests of a good polity.</note>
to every state, in virtue of which its powers
and constitution become desirable or objectionable. These are customs and laws.
Of these the desirable are those which make men's private
lives holy and pure, and the public character of the state
<pb n="498"/>
civilised and just. The objectionable are those whose effect
is the reverse. As, then, when we see good customs
and good laws prevailing among certain people, we confidently assume that, in consequence of them, the men and
their civil constitution will be good also, so when we see
private life full of covetousness, and public policy of injustice,
plainly we have reason for asserting their laws, particular customs, and general constitution
to be bad. Now, with few exceptions, you could find no habits prevailing in private life more
steeped in treachery than those in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and no public policy
more inequitable. Holding, then, the Cretan constitution to
be neither like the Spartan, nor worthy of choice or imitation,
I reject it from the comparison which I have instituted.</p>
<p>Nor again would it be fair to introduce the Republic<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ideal polities may be omitted.</note>
of Plato, which is also spoken of in high
terms by some philosophers. For just as we
refuse admission to the athletic contests
to those actors or athletes who have not acquired a
recognised position<note anchored="yes">The meaning of <foreign lang="greek">nenenhme/nous,</foreign> which I here represent by "acquired a
recognised position," is at least doubtful. Casaubon translates it <foreign lang="la">qui in
album non fuerint recepti,</foreign> referring to <bibl n="Suet. Nero 21">Sueton. Nero, 21</bibl>. But nothing
is elsewhere known of such an <foreign lang="la">album</foreign> for registering the names of recognised athletes.
The passage is important as helping to explain how the number of those entering for the contests in the greater games was practically limited, and therefore
how it happened that, for instance, the five contests of the Pentathlum did not
often fall to different athletes so as to leave the victory uncertain.</note> or trained for them, so we ought not to
admit this Platonic constitution to the contest for the prize
of merit unless it can first point to some genuine and practical
achievement. Up to this time the notion of bringing it into
comparison with the constitutions of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> would be like putting up a statue to compare with living
and breathing men. Even if such a statue were faultless in
point of art, the comparison of the lifeless with the living
would naturally leave an impression of imperfection and incongruity upon the minds of the spectators.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c48" type="chapter" n="48">
<head>Institutions of Lycurgus</head>
<p>I shall therefore omit these, and proceed with my
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The aims of Lycurgus.</note>
description of the Laconian constitution. Now
it seems to me that for securing unity among
the citizens, for safe-guarding the Laconian
<pb n="499"/>
territory, and preserving the liberty of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> inviolate,
the legislation and provisions of Lycurgus were so excellent, that I am forced to regard his wisdom as something
superhuman. For the equality of landed possessions, the
simplicity in their food, and the practice of taking it in common,
which he established, were well calculated to secure morality
in private life and to prevent civil broils in the State; as also
their training in the endurance of labours and dangers to make
men brave and noble minded: but when both these virtues,
courage and high morality, are combined in one soul or in one
state, vice will not readily spring from such a soil, nor will
such men easily be overcome by their enemies. By constructing his constitution therefore in this spirit, and of these
elements, he secured two blessings to the Spartans,&mdash;safety for
their territory, and a lasting freedom for themselves long after he
was gone. He appears however to have made no one provision
whatever, particular or general, for the acquisition of the territory
of their neighbours; or for the assertion of their supremacy; or,
in a word, for any policy of aggrandisement at all. What he
had still to do was to impose such a necessity, or create such a
spirit among the citizens, that, as he had succeeded in making
their individual lives independent and simple, the public
character of the state should also become independent and
moral. But the actual fact is, that, though he made them the
most disinterested and sober-minded men in
the world, as far as their own ways of life and
their national institutions were concerned, he
left them in regard to the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> ambitious, eager for
supremacy, and encroaching in the highest degree. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Their partial failure.</note></p></div2>

<head>The Defect in the Spartan Constitution</head>

were nearly the first Greeks to cast a covetous eye upon the territory of their neighbours, and that accordingly they waged a
war of subjugation on the Messenians?
In the next place is it not related in all histories that in
their dogged obstinacy they bound themselves with an oath
never to desist from the siege of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> until they
had taken it? And lastly it is known to all that in their
efforts for supremacy in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> they submitted to do

material of war ready to hand, and being able without much
expenditure of time to return home or convey provisions with

their use of crops for payment in kind, would be able to
supply them with what they lacked if they abided by the
legislation of Lycurgus; for such undertakings required money
universally current, and goods from foreign countries. Thus
they were compelled to wait humbly at Persian doors, impose
tribute on the islanders, and exact contributions from all the
Greeks: knowing that, if they abided by the laws of Lycurgus,
it was impossible to advance any claims upon any outside power
at all, much less upon the supremacy in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div2>

manifest by actual facts that, for guarding

are content with these objects we must concede that there
neither exists, nor ever has existed, a constitution and civil order
preferable to that of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. But if any one is seeking
aggrandisement, and believes that to be a leader and ruler and

view we must acknowledge that the Spartan constitution is
<pb n="501"/>
deficient, and that of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> superior and better constituted for
obtaining power. And this has been proved by actual facts.
For when the Lacedaemonians strove to possess themselves of
the supremacy in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, it was not long before they brought
their own freedom itself into danger. Whereas the Romans,
after obtaining supreme power over the Italians themselves, soon

<p>Now the Carthaginian constitution seems to me
<note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> fresher than <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>;</note>
originally to have been well contrived in
these most distinctively important particulars. For they had
kings,<note anchored="yes">The Carthaginian Suffetes are always called <foreign lang="greek">basilei=s</foreign> by the Greek

<bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1273a.20">[<title>Pol.</title> 2, 11]</bibl>, in contrasting the Spartan and Carthaginian constitutions,
mentions with approval that, unlike the Spartan kings, those at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> were
elected, and were not confined to a particular family.</note> and the Gerusia
had the powers of an aristocracy, and the multitude were
supreme in such things as affected them; and on the whole
the adjustment of its several parts was very like that of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. But about the period of its entering on the
Hannibalian war the political state of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> was on the
decline,<note anchored="yes">See Bosworth Smith, <title><placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and the Carthaginians,</title> p. 26 ff.</note> that of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> improving. For whereas there is in
every body, or polity, or business a natural stage of growth,
zenith, and decay; and whereas everything in them is at its
best at the zenith; we may thereby judge of the difference between these two constitutions as they existed at that period.
For exactly so far as the strength and prosperity of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>
preceded that of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in point of time, by so much was
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> then past its prime, while <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was exactly at its
zenith, as far as its political constitution was concerned. In
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> therefore the influence of the people in the policy
of the state had already risen to be supreme, while at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
the Senate was at the height of its power: and so, as in the
one measures were deliberated upon by the many, in the
other by the best men, the policy of the Romans in
all public undertakings proved the stronger; on which
account, though they met with capital disasters, by force of
<pb n="502"/>
prudent counsels they finally conquered the Carthaginians in
the war.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b6c52" type="chapter" n="52">
<head>The Causes of Roman Superiority</head>
<p>If we look however at separate details, for instance
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">and its citizen levies superior to Carthaginian mercenaries.</note>
at the provisions for carrying on a war, we
shall find that whereas for a naval expedition
the Carthaginians are the better trained and
prepared,&mdash;as it is only natural with a people
with whom it has been hereditary for many generations to
practise this craft, and to follow the seaman's trade above all
nations in the world,&mdash;yet, in regard to military service on
land, the Romans train themselves to a much higher pitch
than the Carthaginians. The former bestow their whole
attention upon this department: whereas the Carthaginians
wholly neglect their infantry, though they do take some slight
interest in the cavalry. The reason of this is that they employ
foreign mercenaries, the Romans native and citizen levies. It
is in this point that the latter polity is preferable to the
former. They have their hopes of freedom ever resting on the
courage of mercenary troops: the Romans on the valour of their
own citizens and the aid of their allies. The result is that even
if the Romans have suffered a defeat at first, they renew the war
with undiminished forces, which the Carthaginians cannot do.
For, as the Romans are fighting for country and children, it is
impossible for them to relax the fury of their struggle; but
they persist with obstinate resolution until they have overcome their enemies. What has happened in regard to their
navy is an instance in point. In skill the Romans are much
behind the Carthaginians, as I have already said; yet the upshot of the whole naval war has been a decided triumph for
the Romans, owing to the valour of their men. For although
nautical science contributes largely to success in sea-fights,
still it is the courage of the marines that turns the scale most
decisively in favour of victory. The fact is that Italians as a
nation are by nature superior to Phoenicians and Libyans both
in physical strength and courage; but still their habits also do
much to inspire the youth with enthusiasm for such exploits.
One example will be sufficient of the pains taken by the
Roman state to turn out men ready to endure anything to win
a reputation in their country for valour.

Rostra, as a raised platform there is called,
and sometimes is propped upright upon it so as to be
conspicuous, or, more rarely, is laid upon it. Then with all
the people standing round, his son, if he has left one of full
age and he is there, or, failing him, one of his relations, mounts
the Rostra and delivers a speech concerning the virtues of the
deceased, and the successful exploits performed by him in his
lifetime. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Imagines.</note> By these means the people are reminded of what
has been done, and made to see it with their own eyes,&mdash;not
only such as were engaged in the actual

and their sympathies are so deeply moved, that the loss
appears not to be confined to the actual mourners, but to be
a public one affecting the whole people. After the burial
and all the usual ceremonies have been performed, they place
the likeness of the deceased in the most conspicuous spot in
his house, surmounted by a wooden canopy or shrine. This
likeness consists of a mask made to represent the deceased
with extraordinary fidelity both in shape and colour. These
likenesses they display at public sacrifices adorned with much
care. And when any illustrious member of the family dies,
they carry these masks to the funeral, putting them on men
whom they thought as like the originals as possible in height
and other personal peculiarities. And these substitutes assume
clothes according to the rank of the person represented: if he
was a consul or praetor, a toga with purple
stripes; if a censor, whole purple<note anchored="yes">This seems to be the only authority for assigning to
the censors the <foreign lang="la">toga purpurea</foreign> instead of the <foreign lang="la">toga praetexta:</foreign> and, indeed, Athenaeus speaks of them

There could not easily be a more inspiring spectacle than this

and part of the heritage of posterity. But the chief benefit of
the ceremony is that it inspires young men to shrink from no
exertion for the general welfare, in the hope of obtaining the
glory which awaits the brave. And what I say is confirmed
by this fact. Many Romans have volunteered to decide a
whole battle by single combat; not a few have deliberately
accepted certain death, some in time of war to secure the
safety of the rest, some in time of peace to preserve the safety
of the commonwealth. There have also been instances of
men in office putting their own sons to death, in defiance of
every custom and law, because they rated the interests of
their country higher than those of natural ties even with their
nearest and dearest. There are many stories of this kind,
related of many men in Roman history; but one will be

<head>Religion Keeps the Roman Commonwealth Together</head>
<p>Again the Roman customs and principles regarding
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Purity of election.</note>
money transactions are better than those of
the Carthaginians. In the view of the latter
nothing is disgraceful that makes for gain;
with the former nothing is more disgraceful than to receive
bribes and to make profit by improper means. For they
regard wealth obtained from unlawful transactions to be as
much a subject of reproach, as a fair profit from the most
unquestioned source is of commendation. A proof of the fact
is this. The Carthaginians obtain office by open bribery, but
among the Romans the penalty for it is death. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cf. <ref target="b6c14" targOrder="U">ch. 14</ref>.</note>
With such a radical difference, therefore, between
the rewards offered to virtue among the two peoples, it is natural
that the ways adopted for obtaining them should be different also.</p>
<p>But the most important difference for the better which
the Roman commonwealth appears to me to
display is in their religious beliefs. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Regard to religion.</note> For I
conceive that what in other nations is looked
upon as a reproach, I mean a scrupulous fear of the gods, is
the very thing which keeps the Roman commonwealth together.
To such an extraordinary height is this carried among them,
both in private and public business, that nothing could
<pb n="506"/>
exceed it. Many people might think this unaccountable; but
in my opinion their object is to use it as a check upon the
common people. If it were possible to form a state wholly of
philosophers, such a custom would perhaps be unnecessary.
But seeing that every multitude is fickle, and full of lawless
desires, unreasoning anger, and violent passion, the only
resource is to keep them in check by mysterious terrors and
scenic effects of this sort. Wherefore, to my mind, the ancients
were not acting without purpose or at random, when they
brought in among the vulgar those opinions about the gods,
and the belief in the punishments in Hades: much rather do
I think that men nowadays are acting rashly and foolishly in
rejecting them. This is the reason why, apart from anything
else, Greek statesmen, if entrusted with a single talent, though
protected by ten checking-clerks, as many seals, and twice as
many witnesses, yet cannot be induced to keep faith: whereas
among the Romans, in their magistracies and embassies, men
have the handling of a great amount of money, and yet from
pure respect to their oath keep their faith intact. And, again,
in other nations it is a rare thing to find a man who keeps his
hands out of the public purse, and is entirely pure in such
matters: but among the Romans it is a rare thing to detect a
man in the act of committing such a crime.<note anchored="yes">But Polybius afterwards admits that a falling off in this respect had begun.

<p>That to all things, then, which exist there is ordained
decay and change I think requires no further arguments to
show: for the inexorable course of nature is sufficient to
convince us of it.</p>
<p>But in all polities we observe two sources of decay existing
from natural causes, the one external, the other internal and
self-produced. The external admits of no certain or fixed
definition, but the internal follows a definite order. What
kind of polity, then, comes naturally first, and what second, I
have already stated in such a way, that those who are capable
of taking in the whole drift of my argument can henceforth
<pb n="507"/>
draw their own conclusions as to the future of the Roman
polity. For it is quite clear, in my opinion. When a commonwealth, after warding off many great dangers, has arrived at a
high pitch of prosperity and undisputed power, it is evident
that, by the lengthened continuance of great wealth within it,
the manner of life of its citizens will become more extravagant;
and that the rivalry for office, and in other spheres of activity, will
become fiercer than it ought to be. And as this state of things
goes on more and more, the desire of office and the shame of
losing reputation, as well as the ostentation and extravagance
of living, will prove the beginning of a deterioration. And of
this change the people will be credited with being the authors,
when they become convinced that they are being cheated by
some from avarice, and are puffed up with flattery by others from
love of office. For when that comes about, in their passionate
resentment and acting under the dictates of anger, they will
refuse to obey any longer, or to be content with having equal
powers with their leaders, but will demand to have all or far
the greatest themselves. And when that comes to pass the
constitution will receive a new name, which sounds better than
any other in the world, liberty or democracy; but, in fact, it
will become that worst of all governments, mob-rule.</p>
<p>With this description of the formation, growth, zenith, and
present state of the Roman polity, and having discussed also

<head>Even Hannibal Acknowledges the Spirit of the Romans</head>
<p>Resuming my history from the point at which I started
on this digression I will briefly refer to one transaction, that
I may give a practical illustration of the perfection and power
of the Roman polity at that period, as though I were producing
one of his works as a specimen of the skill of a good artist.</p>
<p>When Hannibal, after conquering the Romans in the
battle at<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-216">216</date>. Hannibal offers to put the prisoners at <placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName> to ransom.</note>
<placeName key="perseus,Cannae">Cannae</placeName>, got possession of the eight thousand who
were guarding the Roman camp, he made them
all prisoners of war, and granted them permission
to send messages to their relations that they might
be ransomed and return home. They accordingly selected ten of their chief men, whom Hannibal allowed
to depart after binding them with an oath to return. But one
<pb n="508"/>
of them, just as he had got outside the palisade of the camp,
saying that he had forgotten something, went back; and, having
got what he had left behind, once more set out, under the belief
that by means of this return he had kept his promise and discharged his oath. Upon the arrival of the envoys at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
imploring and beseeching the Senate not to grudge the captured
troops their return home, but to allow them to rejoin their
friends by paying three minae each for them,&mdash;for these were
the terms, they said, granted by Hannibal,&mdash;and declaring that
the men deserved redemption, for they had neither played the
coward in the field, nor done anything unworthy of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
but had been left behind to guard the camp; and that, when
all the rest had perished, they had yielded to absolute necessity in surrendering to Hannibal: though the Romans had
been severely defeated in the battles, and though they were at
the time deprived of, roughly speaking, all their allies, they
neither yielded so far to misfortune as to disregard what was
becoming to themselves, nor omitted to take into account
any necessary consideration. They saw through Hannibal's
purpose in thus acting,&mdash;which was at once to get a large supply
of money, and at the same time to take away all enthusiasm
from the troops opposed to him, by showing that even the
conquered had a hope of getting safe home again. Therefore
the Senate, far from acceding to the request, refused all pity
even to their own relations, and disregarded the services to be
expected from these men in the future: and thus frustrated
Hannibal's calculations, and the hopes which he had founded
on these prisoners, by refusing to ransom them; and at the
same time established the rule for their own men, that they
must either conquer or die on the field, as there was no other
hope of safety for them if they were beaten. With this answer
they dismissed the nine envoys who returned of their own
accord; but the tenth who had put the cunning trick in
practice for discharging himself of his oath they put in chains
and delivered to the enemy. So that Hannibal was not so
much rejoiced at his victory in the battle, as struck with
astonishment at the unshaken firmness and lofty spirit
displayed in the resolutions of these senators.<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Liv. 22.58">Livy, 22, 58</bibl>-61.</note>

<pb n="510"/>
the commander of his triremes, a Carthaginian also named
Hannibal, and the Syracusan Hippocrates and his younger
brother Epicydes. These men had been for some time
serving in Hannibal's army, being domiciled at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>,
owing to their grandfather having been banished from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>
because he was believed to have assassinated Agatharchus,
one of the sons of Agathocles. On the arrival of these
commissioners at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, Polycleitus and his colleague
reported the result of their embassy, and the Carthaginian

to go with all speed to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, promised that
he also would send commissioners from his own court, to

<div2 id="b7c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Hieronymus of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName></head>
<p>Meanwhile intelligence of this transaction had reached
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman praetor sends to remonstrate. scene with the king.</note>
the Roman praetor at <placeName key="tgn,7003850">Lilybaeum</placeName>, who immediately despatched legates to Hieronymus, to
renew the treaty which had been made with his
ancestors. Being thoroughly annoyed with this
embassy, Hieronymus said that "He was sorry
for the Romans that they had come to such utter and shameful
grief<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kakoi/ kakw=s,</foreign> a phrase at once insulting and vulgar.</note> in the battles
in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> at the hands of the Carthaginians." The legates were overpowered by the rudeness of
the answer: still they proceeded to ask him, "Who said
such things about them?" Whereupon the king pointed
to the Carthaginian envoys who were there, and said, "You
had better convict them, if they have really been telling
me lies?" The Roman legates answered that it was not
their habit to take the word of enemies: and advised him
to do nothing in violation of the existing treaty; for that
would be at once equitable and the best thing for himself.
To this the king answered that he would take time to consider
of it, and tell them his decision another time; but he proceeded
to ask them, "How it came about that before his grandfather's
death a squadron of fifty Roman ships had sailed as far as
Pachynus and then gone back again." The fact was that a short
<pb n="511"/>
time ago the Romans had heard that Hiero was dead; and being
much alarmed lest people in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, despising the youth of
the grandson whom he left, should stir up a revolution, they
had made this cruise with the intention of being ready there
to assist his youthful weakness, and to help in maintaining his
authority; but being informed that his grandfather was still
alive, they sailed back again. When the ambassadors had
stated these facts, the young king answered again, "Then
please to allow me too now, O Romans, to maintain my
authority by 'sailing back' to see what I can get from
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>." The Roman legates perceiving the warmth
with which the king was engaging in his policy, said nothing
at the time; but returned and informed the praetor who had
sent them of what had been said. From that time forward,
therefore, the Romans kept a careful watch upon him as an enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b7c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>The Treaty with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName></head>
<p>Hieronymus on his part selected Agatharchus, Onesimus,
and Hipposthenes to send with Hannibal to
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, with instructions to make an alliance
on the following terms: "The Carthaginians to
assist him with land and sea forces, in expelling the Romans
from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and then divide the island with him; so as to have
the river Himera, which divides <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> almost exactly in half, as
the boundary between the two provinces." The commissioners
arrived in <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>: and finding, on coming to a conference,
that the Carthaginians were prepared to meet them in every
point, they completed the arrangement. Meanwhile Hippocrates
got the young Hieronymus entirely into his hands: and at first
fired his imagination by telling him of Hannibal's marches
and pitched battles in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; and afterwards by repeating to
him that no one had a better right to the government of all
Siceliots than he; in the first place as the son of Nereis
daughter of Pyrrhus, the only man whom all Siceliots alike
had accepted deliberately and with full assent as their leader
and king; and in the second place in virtue of his grandfather
Hiero's sovereign rights. At last he and his brother so won
upon the young man by their conversation, that he would
attend to no one else at all: partly from the natural feebleness
of his character, but still more from the ambitious feelings
<pb n="512"/>
which they had excited in him. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The king's pretensions rise, and a new arrangement is made with <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>.</note> And therefore, just when
Agatharchus and his colleagues were completing
the business on which they had been sent in
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, he sent fresh ambassadors, saying that
all <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> belonged to him; and demanding that
the Carthaginians should help him to recover
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>: while he promised that he would assist the Carthaginians
in their Italian campaign. Though the Carthaginians now saw
perfectly well the whole extent of the young man's fickleness
and infatuation: yet thinking it to be in manifold ways to their
interests not to let Sicilian affairs out of their hands, they
assented to his demands; and having already prepared ships
and men, they set about arranging for the transport of their
forces into <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b7c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Hieronymus Decides For War</head>
<p>When they heard of this, the Romans sent legates to him
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans again remonstrate. Another scene at the Council.</note>
again, protesting against his violation of the
treaty made with his forefathers. Hieronymus
thereupon summoned a meeting of his council
and consulted them as to what he was to do.
The native members of it kept silent, because
they feared the folly of their ruler. Aristomachus of <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>,
Damippus of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, Autonous of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> advised that he
should abide by the treaty with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Andranodorus alone
urged that he should not let the opportunity slip; and affirmed
that the present was the only chance of establishing his rule
over <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. After the delivery of this speech, the king
asked Hippocrates and his brother what they thought, and
upon their answering, "The same as Andranodorus," the deliberation was concluded in that sense. Thus, then, war with
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had been decided upon: but while the king was anxious
to be thought to have given an adroit answer to the ambassadors, he committed himself to such an utter absurdity as
to make it certain that he would not only fail to conciliate the
Romans, but would inevitably offend them violently. For he
said that he would abide by the treaty, firstly, if the Romans
would repay all the gold they had received from his grandfather Hiero; and secondly, if they would return the corn and
other presents which they had received from him from the first
day of their intercourse with him; and thirdly, if they would

territory. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">War with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> decided upon.</note>At these propositions of course the

<head>Fall of Heronymus</head>
<p>Some of the historians who have described the fall of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fall of Hieronymus, B. C. <date value="-214">214</date>.</note>
Hieronymus have written at great length and in
terms of mysterious solemnity. They tell us of
prodigies preceding his coming to the throne,
and of the misfortunes of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. They describe in dramatic
language the cruelty of his character and the impiety of his
actions; and crown all with the sudden and terrible nature of
the circumstances attending his fall. One would think from
their description that neither Phalaris, nor Apollodorus, nor
any other tyrant was ever fiercer than he. Yet he was a mere
boy when he succeeded to power, and only lived thirteen
months after. In this space of time it is possible that one or
two men may have been put to the rack, or certain of his
friends, or other Syracusan citizens, put to death; but it is improbable that his tyranny could have been extravagantly wicked,
or his impiety outrageous. It must be confessed that he was
reckless and unscrupulous in disposition; still we cannot
compare him with either of the tyrants I have named. The
fact is that those who write the histories of particular episodes,
<pb n="514"/>
having undertaken limited and narrow themes, appear to me to
be compelled from poverty of matter to exaggerate insignificant
incidents, and to speak at inordinate length on subjects that
scarcely deserve to be recorded at all. There are some, too,
who fall into a similar mistake from mere want of judgment.
With how much more reason might the space employed on
these descriptions,&mdash;which they use merely to fill up and spin
out their books,&mdash;have been devoted to Hiero and Gelo,
without mentioning Hieronymus at all! It would have given
greater pleasure to readers and more instruction to students.</p></div2>

<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and her allies by his own unaided

or any other advantage of fortune. And, in
the second place, was established king of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> without putting to death, banishing, or
harassing any one of the citizens,&mdash;which is the most astonishing circumstance of all. And what is quite as surprising as
the innocence of his acquisition of power is the fact that it did
not change his character. For during a reign of fifty-four
years he preserved peace for the country, maintained his own
power free from all hostile plots, and entirely escaped the envy
which generally follows greatness; for though he tried on
several occasions to lay down his power, he was prevented by
the common remonstrances of the citizens. And having
shown himself most beneficent to the Greeks, and most
anxious to earn their good opinion, he left behind him not
merely a great personal reputation but also a universal feeling of
goodwill towards the Syracusans. Again, though he passed his
life in the midst of the greatest wealth, luxury, and abundance,
he survived for more than ninety years, in full possession of
his senses and with all parts of his body unimpaired; which,
to my mind, is a decisive proof of a well-spent life. . . .</p>

an opportunity again: for it is by thus holding the two horns
that you can alone keep the ox under your control." By the
"two horns" he meant <placeName key="perseus,Ithome">Ithome</placeName> and the Acrocorinthus, and by
<pb n="518"/>
the "ox" the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>. Thereupon Philip turned to
Aratus and said, "And do you give the same advice?"
Aratus not making any answer at once, he urged him to speak
his real opinion. After some hesitation he said, "If you can
get possession of this place without treachery to the Messenians, I advise you to do so; but if, by the act of occupying this
citadel with a guard, you shall ruin all the citadels, and the
guard wherewith the allies were protected when they came into
your hands from Antigonus" (meaning by that, <gloss>confidence</gloss>),
"consider whether it is not better to take your men away and
leave the confidence there, and with it guard the Messenians,
and the other allies as well." As far as his own inclination was
concerned, Philip was ready enough to commit an act of treachery,
as his own subsequent conduct proved: but having been sharply
rebuked a little while before by the younger Aratus for his
destruction of human life; and seeing that, on the present
occasion, the elder spoke with boldness and authority, and
begged him not to neglect his advice, he gave in from sheer
shame, and taking the latter by his right hand, said, "Then let
us go back the same way we came."</p></div2>

<head>Philip's Loss of Popularity</head>
<p>I wish here to stop in my narrative in order to speak
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Deterioration in the character of Philip V. See <ref target="b4c77" targOrder="U">4. 77</ref>.</note>
briefly of the character of Philip, because this
was the beginning of the change and deterioration in it. For I think that no more telling
example can be proposed to practical statesmen
who wish to correct their ideas by a study of history. For
the splendour of his early career, and the brilliancy of his
genius, have caused the dispositions for good and evil displayed by this king to be more conspicuous and widely known
throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> than is the case with any other man; as
well as the contrast between the results accompanying the
display of those opposite tendencies.</p>
<p>Now that, upon his accession to the throne, <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>,
<placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and in fact all parts of his own kingdom were more
thoroughly loyal and well disposed to him, young as he was on
his succeeding to the government of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, than they had
ever been to any of his predecessors, may be without difficulty
inferred from the following fact. Though he was with extreme
frequency forced to leave <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> by the Aetolian and
<pb n="519"/>
Lacedaemonian wars, not only was there no disturbance in
these countries, but not a single one of the neighbouring
barbarians ventured to touch <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. It would be impossible, again, to speak in strong enough terms of the affection
of Alexander, Chrysogonus, and his other friends towards
him; or that of the Epirotes, Acarnanians, and all those on
whom he had within a short time conferred great benefits.
On the whole, if one may use a somewhat hyperbolical phrase,
I think it has been said of Philip with very great propriety,
that his beneficent policy had made him "The darling of all
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>." And it is a conspicuous and striking proof of the
advantage of lofty principle and strict integrity, that the Cretans,
having at length come to an understanding with each other and
made a national alliance, selected Philip to arbitrate between
them; and that this settlement was completed without an
appeal to arms and without danger,&mdash;a thing for which it
would be difficult to find a precedent in similar circumstances.
From the time of his exploits at <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> all this was utterly
changed. And it was natural that it should be so. For his
purposes being now entirely reversed, it inevitably followed
that men's opinions of him should be reversed also, as well as
the success of his various undertakings. This actually was the
case, as will become evident to attentive students from what
I am now about to relate. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b7c13" type="chapter" n="13">

<p>Aratus seeing that Philip was now openly engaging in
war with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and entirely changed in his policy toward his
allies, with difficulty diverted him from his intention by
suggesting numerous difficulties and scruples.</p>
<p>I wish now to remind my readers of what, in my fifth Book, I
put forward merely as a promise and unsupported statement, but
which has now been confirmed by facts; in order that I may
not leave any proposition of mine unproved or open to
question. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><ref target="b5c12" targOrder="U">5, 12</ref>.</note> In the course of my history of the Aetolian war,
where I had to relate the violent proceedings of
Philip in destroying the colonnades and other
sacred objects at Thermus; and added that, in consideration of
his youth, the blame of these measures ought not to be referred
to Philip so much as to his advisers; I then remarked that
the life of Aratus sufficiently proved that he would not have
<pb n="520"/>
committed such an act of wickedness, but that such principles
exactly suited Demetrius of Pharos; and I promised to make this
clear from what I was next to narrate. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Recapitulation of the
substance of book 7, viz. the treacherous dealings of Philip with the Messenians, B.C. <date value="-215">215</date>.</note>I thereby designedly
postponed the demonstration of the truth of my assertion, till
I had come to the period of which I have just
been speaking; that, namely, in which with the
presence of Demetrius, and in the absence of
Aratus, who arrived a day too late, Philip made
the first step in his career of crime; and, as
though from the first taste of human blood and
murder and treason to his allies, was changed
not into a wolf from a man, as in the Arcadian fable
mentioned by Plato, but from a king into a
savage tyrant. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Plato, <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 565d"><title>Rep.</title> 565 D</bibl>.</note>But a still more decisive proof
of the sentiments of these two men is furnished
by the plot against the citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>, and may help us to
make up our minds which of the two were responsible for the
proceedings in the Aetolian war; and, when we are satisfied
on that point, it will be easy to form a judgment on the
differences of their principles.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b7c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Aratus a Moderating Influence on Philip</head>
<p>For as in this instance, under the influence of Aratus,
Philip refrained from actually breaking faith with the Messenians in regard to the citadel; and thus, to use a common
expression, poured a little balm into the wide wound which his
slaughters had caused: so in the Aetolian war, when under the
influence of Demetrius, he sinned against the gods by destroying the objects consecrated to them, and against man by
transgressing the laws of war; and entirely deserted his
original principles, by showing himself an implacable and
bitter foe to all who opposed him. The same remark
applies to the Cretan business.<note anchored="yes">Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. Arat. 48"><title>Aratus,</title> ch. 48</bibl>.</note> As long as he employed
Aratus as his chief director, not only without doing injustice
to a single islander, but without even causing them any
vexation, he kept the whole Cretan people under control; and
led all the Greeks to regard him with favour, owing to the
greatness of character which he displayed. So again, when
under the guidance of Demetrius, he became the cause of the
misfortunes I have described to the Messenians, he at once
<pb n="521"/>
lost the good-will of the allies and his credit with the rest of
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. Such a decisive influence for good or evil in the
security of their government has the choice by youthful
sovereigns of the friends who are to surround them; though
it is a subject on which by some unaccountable carelessness
they take not the smallest care. . . .</p></div2>

taking place and fighting by night and day, both
armies inventing every possible kind of plot and
counterplot against each other: to describe
which in detail would be as useless as it would
be in the last degree wearisome. At last, when
the siege had already entered upon its second year, Lagoras
the Cretan came forward. He had had a considerable experience in war, and had learnt that as a rule cities fall into
the hands of their enemies most easily from some neglect on
the part of their inhabitants, when, trusting to the natural or
artificial strength of their defences, they neglect to keep proper
guard and become thoroughly careless. He had observed
too, that in such fortified cities captures were effected at
the points of greatest strength, which were believed to have
been despaired of by the enemy. So in the present instance,
when he saw that the prevailing notion of the strength of
<placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> caused the whole army to despair of taking it by storm,
and to believe that the one hope of getting it was by starving
it out, he gave all the closer attention to the subject; and
eagerly scanned every possible method of making an attempt to
capture the town. Having observed therefore that a portion
of the wall was unguarded, near a place called the Saw, which
unites the citadel and city, he conceived the hope and idea of
performing this exploit. He had discovered the carelessness
of the men guarding this wall from the following circumstance.
The place was extremely precipitous: and there was a deep
gully below, into which dead bodies from the city, and the
offal of horses and beasts of burden that died, were accustomed
<pb n="522"/>
to be thrown; and in this place therefore there was always a
great number of vultures and other birds collected. Having
observed, then, that when these creatures were gorged, they
always sat undisturbed upon the cliffs and the wall, he
concluded that the wall must necessarily be left unguarded and
deserted for the larger part of the day. Accordingly, under
cover of night, he went to the spot and carefully examined the
possibilities of approaching it and setting ladders; and finding
that this was possible at one particular rock, he communicated
the facts to the king.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b7c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Antiochus Takes <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></head>
<p>Antiochus encouraged the attempt and urged Lagoras
to carry it out. The latter promised to do his best, and
desired the king to join with him Theodotus the Aetolian, and
Dionysius the commander of his bodyguard, with orders to
devote them to assist him in carrying out the intended interprise. The king at once granted his request, and these officers
agreed to undertake it: and having held a consultation on the
whole subject, they waited for a night on which there should
be no moon just before daybreak. Such a night having
arrived, on the day on which they intended to act, an hour
before sunset, they selected from the whole army fifteen of
the strongest and most courageous men to carry the ladders,
and also to mount with them and share in the daring attempt.
After these they selected thirty others, to remain in reserve at
a certain distance; that, as soon as they had themselves climbed
over the walls, and come to the nearest gate, the thirty might
come up to it from the outside and try to knock off the hinges
and fastenings, while they on the inside cut the cross bar and
bolt pins.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">balana/gras.</foreign> The <foreign lang="greek">balana/gra</foreign> was a straight piece of wood with upright
pins corresponding with those that fall into the bolt (the <foreign lang="greek">ba/lanoi</foreign>), and which
are pushed up by it. It was thus used as a key which could be taken out
and kept by the Commandant, as in <bibl n="Hdt. 3.155">Herod. 3, 155</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 2.4">Thucyd. 2, 4</bibl>. But
Polybius here seems to use it as equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">ba/lanos.</foreign> See Aeneas, <bibl n="Aen.Tact. 18"><title>Tact.</title> 18-20</bibl>,
who recommends that the <foreign lang="greek">mo/xlos</foreign> should be sheeted with iron to prevent this
very operation. Cp. <ref target="b4c57" targOrder="U">4. 57</ref>. What he means by <foreign lang="greek">zu/gwma</foreign> on the outside (here
translated "fastenings") is also somewhat doubtful. From Hesychius, s. v.
<foreign lang="greek">e)piceukth/r,</foreign> it might be conjectured that chains of some kind were intended.
Casaubon supposed it to be a cross bar similar to the <foreign lang="greek">mo/xlos</foreign> inside, and
Schw. to represent the posts and the lintel connecting them.</note> They also selected two thousand men to follow
behind the thirty, who were to rush into the town with them
<pb n="523"/>
and seize the area of the theatre, which was a favourable position
to hold against those on the citadel, as well as those in the town.
To prevent suspicion of the truth getting about, owing to the
picking out of the men, the king gave out that the Aetolians
were about to throw themselves into the town through a certain
gully, and that it was necessary, in view of that information, to
take energetic measures to prevent them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b7c17" type="chapter" n="17">
<head>The Sack of <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName></head>
<p>When Lagoras and his party had made all their

preparations, as soon as the moon set, they
came stealthily to the foot of the cliffs with
their scaling ladders, and ensconced themselves
under a certain overhanging rock. When day broke, and
the picket as usual broke up from that spot; and the king
in the ordinary way told off some men to take their usual
posts, and led the main body on to the hippodrome and
drew them up; at first no one suspected what was going on.
But when two ladders were fixed, and Dionysius led the way
up one, and Lagoras up the other, there was excitement and a
stir throughout the camp. For while the climbing party were
not visible to the people in the town, or to Achaeus in the
citadel, because of the beetling brow of the rock, their bold
and adventurous ascent was in full view of the camp; which
accordingly was divided in feeling between astonishment at
the strangeness of the spectacle, and a nervous horror of what
was going to happen next, all standing dumb with exulting
wonder. Observing the excitement in the camp, and wishing to
divert the attention both of his own men and of those in the
city from what was going on, the king ordered an advance; and
delivered an attack upon the gates on the other side of the
town, called the Persian gates. Seeing from the citadel the
unwonted stir in the camp, Achaeus was for some time at a
loss to know what to do, being puzzled to account for it, and
quite unable to see what was taking place. However he despatched a force to oppose the enemy at the gate; whose
assistance was slow in arriving, because they had to descend
from the citadel by a narrow and precipitous path. But
Aribazus, the commandant of the town, went unsuspiciously
to the gates on which he saw Antiochus advancing; and
caused some of his men to mount the wall, and sent
<pb n="524"/>
others out through the gate, with orders to hinder the
approaching enemies, and come to close quarters with them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b7c18" type="chapter" n="18">
<head>Sardis Destroyed</head>
<p>Meanwhile Lagoras, Theodotus, Dionysius, and their
men had climbed the rocks and had arrived at the gate
nearest them; and some of them were engaged in fighting the
troops sent from the citadel to oppose them, while others were
cutting through the bars; and at the same time the party outside
told off for that service were doing the same. The gates
having thus been quickly forced open, the two thousand entered
and occupied the area round the theatre. On this all the men
from the walls, and from the Persian gate, to which Aribazus
had already led a relieving force, rushed in hot haste to pass
the word to attack the enemy within the gates. The result
was that, the gate having been opened as they retreated, some
of the king's army rushed in along with the retiring garrison;
and, when they had thus taken possession of the gate, they were
followed by an unbroken stream of their comrades; some of
whom poured through the gate, while others employed themselves in bursting open other gates in the vicinity. Aribazus
and all the men in the city, after a brief struggle against the
enemy who had thus got within the walls, fled with all speed to
the citadel. After that, Theodotus and Lagoras and their party
remained on the ground near the theatre, determining with
great good sense and soldier-like prudence to form a reserve
until the whole operation was completed; while the main body
rushed in on every side and occupied the town. And now by
dint of some putting all they met to the sword, others setting
fire to the houses, others devoting themselves to plunder and
taking booty, the destruction and sacking of the town was
completed. Thus did Antiochus become master of Sardis. . . .

to return, put himself in the power of the latter. The

could he expect to meet any other fate than he did, if he

<p>The conclusion, then, is that those who put themselves
in the power of the enemy from want of proper precaution
deserve blame; but those who use every practicable precaution
not so: for to trust absolutely no one is to make all action impossible; but reasonable action, taken after receiving adequate
security, cannot be censured. Adequate securities are oaths,
children, wives, and, strongest of all, a blameless past. To be
betrayed and entrapped by such a security as any of these is a
slur, not on the deceived, but on the deceiver. The first
object then should be to seek such securities as it is impossible
for the recipient of the confidence to evade; but since such
are rare, the next best thing will be to take every reasonable
precaution one's self: and then, if we meet with any disaster, we
shall at least be acquitted of wrong conduct by the lookers on.
And this has been the case with many before now: of which the
most conspicuous example, and the one nearest to the times on

latter method. For the fact of the Romans having sought to
gain <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, or at another time <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; or having gone on a
campaign with military and naval forces, told by itself, would
not be anything very wonderful. But if we learn that these
were all done at once, and that many more undertakings were
in course of accomplishment at the same time,&mdash;all at the cost
of one government and commonwealth; and if we see what
dangers and wars in their own territory were, at the very time,
encumbering the men who had all these things on hand: thus,
and only thus, will the astonishing nature of the events fully
dawn upon us, and obtain the attention which they deserve.
So much for those who suppose that by studying an episode
they have become acquainted with universal history. . . .

of wishing to come to terms with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and legates were actually
sent to Marcellus, at Morgantia (near <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName>).  But when the
Carthaginian fleet arrived at Pachynus, Hippocrates and
Epicydes threw off their mask, and declared that the other
magistrates were betraying the town to the Romans. This
accusation was rendered more specious by the appearance of
Appius with a Roman fleet at the mouth of the harbour. A rush
was made to the shore by the inhabitants to prevent the Romans
landing; and the tumult was with difficulty composed by the
wisdom of one of the magistrates, Apollonides, who persuaded the
people to vote for the peace with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> (B. C. <date value="-215">215</date>. <bibl n="Liv. 24.21">Livy, 24, 21-28</bibl>).
But Hippocrates and Epicydes determined not to acknowledge the

officers took up a position not far from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and
determined to assault the town from the land at Hexapylus,
and by sea at what was called Stoa Scytice in Achradina,
where the wall has its foundation close down to the sea.
Having prepared their wicker pent-houses, and darts, and
other siege material, they felt confident that, with so many
hands employed, they would in five days get their works in
such an advanced state as to give them the
advantage over the enemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Archimedes.</note> But in this they
did not take into account the abilities of Archimedes; nor calculate on the truth that, in certain circumstances, the genius
of one man is more effective than any numbers whatever.<note anchored="yes">Cp. <ref target="b1c35" targOrder="U">1, 35</ref>.</note>
However they now learnt it by experience. The city was strong
from the fact of its encircling wall lying along a chain of hills
with overhanging brows, the ascent of which was no easy task,
even with no one to hinder it, except at certain definite points.
Taking advantage of this, Archimedes had constructed such
defences both in the town, and at the places where an
attack might be made by sea, that the garrison would have
everything at hand which they might require at any moment,
and be ready to meet without delay whatever the enemy might
attempt against them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Siege of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName></head>
<p>The attack was begun by Appius bringing his penthouses, and scaling ladders, and attempting to fix the latter
against that part of the wall which abuts on Hexapylus towards
the east. At the same time Marcus Claudius Marcellus with
sixty quinqueremes was making a descent upon Achradina. Each
<pb n="531"/>
of these vessels were full of men armed with bows and slings
and javelins, with which to dislodge those who fought on the
battlements. As well as these vessels he had eight quinqueremes in pairs. Each pair had had their oars removed,
one on the larboard and the other on the starboard side, and
then had been lashed together on the sides thus left bare. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Sambucae or Harps.</note>
On these double vessels, rowed by the outer oars of each of
the pair, they brought up under the walls some
engines called "Sambucae," the construction
of which was as follows:&mdash;A ladder was made
four feet broad, and of a height to reach the top of the wall
from the place where its foot had to rest; each side of the
ladder was protected by a railing, and a covering or pent-house
was added overhead. It was then placed so that its foot
rested across the sides of the lashed-together vessels, which
touched each other with its other extremity protruding a
considerable way beyond the prows. On the tops of the masts
pulleys were fixed with ropes: and when the engines were
about to be used, men standing on the sterns of the vessels
drew the ropes tied to the head of the ladder, while others
standing on the prows assisted the raising of the machine and
kept it steady with long poles. Having then brought the
ships close in shore by using the outer oars of both vessels
they tried to let the machine down upon the wall. At the
head of the ladder was fixed a wooden stage secured on three
sides by wicker-shields, upon which stood four men who
fought and struggled with those who tried to prevent the
Sambuca from being made to rest on the battlements. But
when they have fixed it and so got above the level of the top
of the wall, the four men unfasten the wicker-shields from
either side of the stage, and walk out upon the battlements
or towers as the case may be; they are followed by their
comrades coming up by the Sambuca, since the ladder's
foot is safely secured with ropes and stands upon both the
ships. This construction has got the name of "Sambuca,"
or "Harp," for the natural reason, that when it is raised the
combination of the ship and ladder has very much the appearance of such an instrument.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Archimedes</head>
<p>With such contrivances and preparations were the
<pb n="532"/>
Romans intending to assault the towers.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The engines invented
by Archimedes. Cf. <bibl n="Plut. Marc. 15">Plut. <title>Marcellus,</title> 15</bibl>.</note>But Archimedes
had constructed catapults to suit every range;
and as the ships sailing up were still at a considerable distance, he so wounded the enemy with
stones and darts, from the tighter wound and
longer engines, as to harass and perplex them to the last
degree; and when these began to carry over their heads, he
used smaller engines graduated according to the range required
from time to time, and by this means caused so much
confusion among them as to altogether check their advance
and attack; and finally Marcellus was reduced in despair to
bringing up his ships under cover of night. But when they
had come close to land, and so too near to be hit by the
catapults, they found that Archimedes had prepared another
contrivance against the soldiers who fought from the decks.
He had pierced the wall as high as a man's stature with
numerous loop-holes, which, on the outside, were about as
big as the palm of the hand. Inside the wall he stationed
archers and cross-bows, or scorpions,<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">skorpi/dia,</foreign> mentioned among a number of similar engines in 1 Macc. 6,
51. Plutarch calls them <foreign lang="greek">skorpi/oi,</foreign> and explains that they only carried a short
distance, but, being concealed, gave wounds at close quarters; hence, doubtless, their name.</note> and by the volleys
discharged through these he made the marines useless. By
these means he not only baffled the enemy, whether at a
distance or close at hand, but also killed the greater number
of them. As often, too, as they tried to work their Sambucae,
he had engines ready all along the walls, not visible at other
times, but which suddenly reared themselves above the wall
from inside, when the moment for their use had come, and
stretched their beams far over the battlements, some of them
carrying stones weighing as much as ten talents,
and others great masses of lead. So whenever
the Sambucae were approaching, these beams swung round on
their pivot the required distance, and by means of a rope
running through a pulley dropped the stone upon the Sambucae, with the result that it not only smashed the machine
itself to pieces, but put the ship also and all on board into the
most serious danger. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">570 lbs. av.</note>
<pb n="533"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Other Inventions of Archimedes</head>
<p>Other machines which he invented were directed against
storming parties, who, advancing under the protection of penthouses, were secured by them from being hurt by missiles
shot through the walls. Against these he either shot stones
big enough to drive the marines from the prow; or let down
an iron hand swung on a chain, by which the man who
guided the crane, having fastened on some part of the prow
where he could get a hold, pressed down the lever of the
machine inside the wall; and when he had thus lifted the prow
and made the vessel rest upright on its stern, he fastened
the lever of his machine so that it could not be moved; and then
suddenly slackened the hand and chain by means of a rope
and pulley. The result was that many of the vessels heeled over
and fell on their sides: some completely capsized; while the
greater number, by their prows coming down suddenly from a
height, dipped low in the sea, shipped a great quantity of
water, and became a scene of the utmost confusion. Though
reduced almost to despair by these baffling inventions of
Archimedes, and though he saw that all his attempts were
repulsed by the garrison with mockery on their part and loss
to himself, Marcellus could not yet refrain from making a joke
at his own expense, saying that "Archimedes was using his
ships to ladle out the sea-water, but that his 'harps' not having
been invited to the party were buffeted and turned out with
disgrace." Such was the end of the attempt at storming
<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> by sea.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c9" type="chapter" n="9">
<head>The Assault By Land Repulsed</head>
<p>Nor was Appius Claudius more successful. He, too,
was compelled by similar difficulties to desist
from the attempt; for while his men were
still at a considerable distance from the
wall, they began falling by the stones and shots from the
engines and catapults. The volleys of missiles, indeed, were
extraordinarily rapid and sharp, for their construction had been
provided for by all the liberality of a Hiero, and had been
planned and engineered by the skill of an Archimedes. Moreover, when they did at length get near the walls, they were
prevented from making an assault by the unceasing fire
through the loop-holes, which I mentioned before; or if they
tried to carry the place under cover of pent-houses, they were
<pb n="534"/>
killed by the stones and beams let down upon their heads.
The garrison also did them no little damage with those hands
at the end of their engines; for they used to lift the men,
armour, and all, into the air, and then throw them down. At
last Appius retired into the camp, and summoning the Tribunes
to a council of war, decided to try every possible means of
taking <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> except a storm. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The siege turned into a blockade, B.C. <date value="-214">214</date>. Coss. Q. Fabius Maximus IV. M. Claudius Marcellus III.</note>And this
decision they carried out; for during the eight
months of siege which followed, though there
was no stratagem or measure of daring which they
did not attempt, they never again ventured to
attempt a storm. So true it is that one man
and one intellect, properly qualified for the particular undertaking, is a host in itself and of extraordinary efficacy. In
this instance, at any rate, we find the Romans confident that
their forces by land and sea would enable them to become
masters of the town, if only one old man could be got rid of;
while as long as he remained there, they did not venture even
to think of making the attempt, at least by any method which
made it possible for Archimedes to oppose them. They
believed, however, that their best chance of reducing the
garrison was by a failure of provisions sufficient for so large a
number as were within the town; they therefore relied upon
this hope, and with their ships tried to cut off their supplies by
sea, and with their army by land. But desiring that the time
during which they were blockading <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> should not be
entirely wasted, but that some addition should be made to their
power in other parts of the country, the two commanders
separated and divided the troops between them: Appius
Claudius keeping two-thirds and continuing the blockade, while
Marcus Marcellus with the remaining third went to attack the
cities that sided with the Carthaginians. . . .</p></div2>

to speak of these proceedings in somewhat full
detail in the present as well as in the last book, not alone by
the same motives as those which I have assigned for other
parts of my work, but also by the fact that of our historians,
some have entirely omitted this Messenian episode; while
others from love or fear of kings have maintained that, so far
from the outrages committed by Philip in defiance of religion
and law upon the Messenians being a subject of blame, his
actions were on the contrary matters for praise and gratulation.
But it is not only in regard to the Messenians that we
may notice the historians of Philip acting thus; they have
done much the same in other cases also. And the result is
that their compositions have the appearance of a panegyric
rather than of a history. I however hold that an historian ought
neither to blame or praise kings untruly, as has often been
done; but to make what we say consistent with what has been
written before, and tally with the characters of the several
persons in question. But it may be urged perhaps that this is
easy to say, but very difficult to carry out; because situations
and circumstances are so many and various, to which men
have to give way in the course of their life, and which prevent
them from speaking out their real opinions. This may excuse
some, but not others.</p></div2>

<head>Criticism Of Theopompus</head>
<p>I do not know any one who deserves more blame in
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The extravagance of Theopompus's account of Philip II.</note>
this particular than Theopompus. In the beginning of his history of Philip he said that what
chiefly induced him to undertake it was the fact
that <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> had never produced such a man as
Philip son of Amyntas; and then immediately afterwards, both
in his preface and in the whole course of his history, he
represents this king as so madly addicted to women, that he
did all that in him lay to ruin his own family by this inordinate
passion; as having behaved with the grossest unfairness and
perfidy to his friends and allies; as having enslaved and
treacherously seized a vast number of towns by force or fraud;
and as having been besides so violently addicted to strong
drink, that he was often seen by his friends drunk in open day.
<pb n="536"/>
But if any one will take the trouble to read the opening
passage of his forty-ninth book, he would be indeed astonished
at this writer's extravagance. Besides his other strange statements he has ventured to write as follows&mdash;for I here subjoin
his actual words:&mdash;"If there was any one in all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, or among
the Barbarians, whose character was lascivious and shameless, he
was invariably attracted to Philip's court in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and got
the title of 'the king's companion.' For it was Philip's constant
habit to reject those who lived respectably and were careful of
their property; but to honour and promote those who were
extravagant, and passed their lives in drinking and dicing. His
influence accordingly tended not only to confirm them in these
vices, but to make them proficients in every kind of rascality
and lewdness. What vice or infamy did they not possess?
What was there virtuous or of good report that they did not
lack? Some of them, men as they were, were ever clean
shaven and smooth-skinned; and even bearded men did not
shrink from mutual defilement. They took about with them
two or three slaves of their lust, while submitting to the same
shameful service themselves. The men whom they called
companions deserved a grosser name, and the title of soldier
was but a cover to mercenary vice; for, though bloodthirsty
by nature, they were lascivious by habit. In a word, to make
a long story short, especially as I have such a mass of matter
to deal with, I believe that the so-called 'friends' and
'companions' of Philip were more bestial in nature and
character than the Centaurs who lived on <placeName key="tgn,4008379">Pelion</placeName>, or the
Laestrygones who inhabited the Leontine plain, or in fact any
other monsters whatever."<note anchored="yes">See also Athenaeus, 4, 166-167. Theopompus of Chius was a contemporary

<head>Philip, Alexander, And the Diadochi</head>
<p>Who would not disapprove of such bitterness and intemperance of language in an historian? It is not only because
his words contradict his opening statement that he deserves
stricture; but also because he has libelled the king and his
friends; and still more because his falsehood is expressed in
disgusting and unbecoming words. If he had been speaking
of Sardanapalus, or one of his associates, he could hardly have
ventured to use such foul language; and what that monarch's
<pb n="537"/>
principles and debauchery were in his lifetime we gather from
the inscription on his tomb, which runs thus:
<quote><l>"The joys I had from love or wine</l>
<l>Or dainty meats&mdash;those now are mine."</l></quote>
But when speaking of Philip and his friends, a man ought to be
on his guard, not so much of accusing them of effeminacy and
want of courage, or still more of shameless immorality, but on
the contrary lest he should prove unequal to express their praises
in a manner worthy of their manliness, indefatigable energy,
and the general virtue of their character.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The vigorous characters of the Diadochi.</note> It is notorious that
by their energy and boldness they raised the
Macedonian Empire from a most insignificant
monarchy to the first rank in reputation and
extent. And, putting aside the achievements of Philip, what
was accomplished by them after his death, under the rule
of Alexander, has secured for them a reputation for valour
with posterity universally acknowledged. For although a large
share of the credit must perhaps be given to Alexander, as
the presiding genius of the whole, though so young a man;
yet no less is due to his coadjutors and friends, who won many
wonderful victories over the enemy; endured numerous desperate labours, dangers and sufferings; and, though put into
possession of the most ample wealth, and the most abundant
means of gratifying all their desires, never lost their bodily
vigour by these means, or contracted tastes for violence or
debauchery. On the contrary, all those who were associated
with Philip, and afterwards with Alexander, became truly royal in
greatness of soul, temperance of life, and courage. Nor is it
necessary to mention any names: but after Alexander's death,
in their mutual rivalries for the possession of various parts of
nearly all the world, they filled a very large number of histories
with the record of their glorious deeds. We may admit then
that the bitter invective of the historian Timaeus against
Agathocles, despot of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, though it seems unmeasured, has
yet some reason in it,&mdash;for it is directed against a personal
enemy, a bad man, and a tyrant; but that of Theopompus is
too scurrilous to be taken seriously.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c13" type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Flawed Structure of Theopompus's History</head>
<p>For, after premising that he is going to write about a
<pb n="538"/>
king most richly endowed by nature with virtue, he has raked up
against him every shameful and atrocious charge that he could
find. There are therefore but two alternatives: either this
writer in the preface to his work has shown himself a liar and
a flatterer; or in the body of that history a fool and utter
simpleton, if he imagined that by senseless and improper
invective he would either increase his own credit, or gain
great acceptance for his laudatory expressions about Philip.</p>
<p>But the fact is that the general plan of this writer is one
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Thucydides breaks off in B. C. <date value="-411">411</date>. Battle of Leuctra, B. C. <date value="-371">371</date>.</note>
also which can meet with no one's approval. For
having undertaken to write a Greek History from
the point at which Thucydides left off, when he
got near the period of the battle of Leuctra, and
the most splendid exploits of the Greeks, he threw aside <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>
and its achievements in the middle of his story, and, changing
his purpose, undertook to write the history of Philip. And yet
it would have been far more telling and fair to have included
the actions of Philip in the general history of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, than the
history of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> in that of Philip. For one cannot conceive
any one, who had been preoccupied by the study of a royal
government, hesitating, if he got the power and opportunity, to
transfer his attention to the great name and splendid personality
of a nation like <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>; but no one in his senses, after beginning
with the latter, would have exchanged it for the showy biography
of a tyrant. Now what could it have been that compelled
Theopompus to overlook such inconsistencies? Nothing
surely but this, that whereas the aim of his original history was
honour, that of his history of Philip was expediency. As to
this deviation from the right path however, which made him
change the theme of his history, he might perhaps have had
something to say, if any one had questioned him about it; but
as to his abominable language about the king's friends, I do not
think that he could have said a word of defence, but must have
owned to a serious breach of propriety. . . .</p></div2>

Though he kept the secret from the rest of the world, he did not
conceal it from one of his servants named Cepholon, with whom
he was on terms of great affection. This man waited on him

pointed out some spittle on the wall which was stained with
blood, Aratus remarked, 'That is the reward I have got for
my friendship to Philip." Such a grand and noble thing is
disinterested virtue, that the sufferer was more ashamed, than
the inflicter of the injury, of having it known, that, after so
many splendid services performed in the interests of Philip, he
had got such a return as that for his loyalty.<note anchored="yes">The accusation of administering slow poisons is a very common one, as

<p>Philip had long had his thoughts fixed upon <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName> and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg"><placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName> founded by Dionysius of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, B. C. <date value="-385">385</date>. See Diod. Sic. 15. 13.</note>
its citadel; and, being anxious to become master
of those places, he started with his army, and
after two days' march got through the pass and
pitched his camp on the bank of the river
Ardaxanus, not far from the town. He found
on surveying the place that the fortifications of
<placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>, both on the side of the sea and of the land, were
exceedingly strong both by nature and art; and that the citadel,
which was near it, from its extraordinary height and its other
sources of strength, looked more than any one could hope to
carry by storm. He therefore gave up all hope of the latter,
but did not entirely despair of taking the town. He observed
that there was a space between <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName> and the foot of the Acrolissus which was fairly well suited for making an attempt upon
the town. He conceived the idea therefore of bringing on a
skirmish in this space, and then employing a strategem suited
to the circumstances of the case. Having given his men a day
for rest; and having in the course of it addressed them in
suitable words of exhortation; he hid the greater and most
effective part of his light-armed troops during the night in
some woody gulleys, close to this space on the land side; and
next morning marched to the other side of the town next the
sea, with his peltasts and the rest of his light-armed. Having
thus marched round the town, and arrived at this spot, he
made a show of intending to assault it at that point. Now as
Philip's advent had been no secret, a large body of men from
the surrounding country of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyria</placeName> had flocked into <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>;
but feeling confidence in the strength of the citadel, they had
assigned a very moderate number of men to garrison it.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Philip V. In Illyria</head>
<p>As soon therefore as the Macedonians approached,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Acrolissus taken by a feint, and <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName> afterwards.</note>
they began pouring out of the town, confident
in their numbers and in the strength of the places.
The king stationed his peltasts on the level
ground, and ordered the light-armed troops to
advance towards the hills and energetically engage the enemy.
<pb n="541"/>
These orders being obeyed, the fight remained doubtful for a
time; but presently Philip's men yielded to the inequality of
the ground, and the superior number of the enemy, and gave
way. Upon their retreating within the ranks of the peltasts,
the sallying party advanced with feelings of contempt, and
having descended to the same level as the peltasts joined battle
with them. But the garrison of the citadel seeing Philip
moving his divisions one after the other slowly to the rear, and
believing that he was abandoning the field, allowed themselves
to be insensibly decoyed out, in their confidence in the strength
of their fortifications; and thus, leaving the citadel by degrees,
kept pouring down by bye-ways into the lower plain, under the
belief that they would have an opportunity of getting booty and
completing the enemy's discomfiture. Meanwhile the division,
which had been lying concealed on the side of the mainland,
rose without being observed, and advanced at a rapid pace.
At their approach the peltasts also wheeled round and charged
the enemy. On this the troops from <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName> were thrown into
confusion, and, after a straggling retreat, got safely back into
the town; while the garrison which had abandoned the citadel
got cut off from it by the rising of the troops which had been
lying in ambush. The result accordingly was that what
seemed hopeless, namely the capture of the citadel, was
effected at once and without any fighting; while <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName> did
not fall until next day, and then only after desperate struggles,
the Macedonians assaulting with vigour and even terrific fury.
Thus Philip having, beyond all expectation, made himself
master of these places, reduced by this exploit all the
neighbouring populations to obedience; so much so that the
greater number of the Illyrians voluntarily surrendered their
cities to his protection; for it had come to be believed that,
after the storming of such strongholds as these, no fortification
and no provision for security could be of any avail against the
might of Philip.</p></div2>

<head>Bolis the Cretan Agrees to Rescue Achaeus</head>
<p>(See <ref target="b7c15" targOrder="U">7, 15-18</ref>)</p>
<p>Bolis was by birth a Cretan, who had long enjoyed
<pb n="542"/>
the honours of high military rank at King Ptolemy's court,
and the reputation of being second to none
in natural ability, adventurous daring, and experience in war. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-214">214</date>. Sosibius secures the help of Bolis to rescue Achaeus.</note>
By repeated arguments Sosibius secured this man's fidelity; and when he felt
sure of his zeal and affection he communicated
the business in hand to him. He told him that he could not
do the king a more acceptable service at the present crisis
than by contriving some way of saving Achaeus. At the
moment Bolis listened, and retired without saying more than
that he would consider the suggestion. But after two or
three days' reflection, he came to Sosibius and said that he would
undertake the business; remarking that, having spent some
considerable time at <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>, he knew its topography, and that
Cambylus, the commander of the Cretan contingent of the
army of Antiochus, was not only a fellow citizen of his but a
kinsmen and friend. It chanced moreover that Cambylus and
his men had in charge one of the outposts on the rear of the
acropolis, where the nature of the ground did not admit of
siege-works, but was guarded by the permanent cantonment of
troops under Cambylus. Sosibius caught at the suggestion,
convinced that, if Achaeus could be saved at all from his
dangerous situation, it could be better accomplished by the
agency of Bolis than of any one else; and, this conviction being
backed by great zeal on the part of Bolis, the undertaking was
pushed on with despatch. Sosibius at once supplied the
money necessary for the attempt, and promised a large sum
besides in case of its success; at the same time raising the
hopes of Bolis to the utmost by dilating upon the favours he
might look for from the king, as well as from the rescued
prince himself.</p>
<p>Full of eagerness therefore for success, Bolis set sail without delay, taking with him a letter in cipher and other
credentials addressed to Nicomachus at <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, who was
believed to entertain a fatherly affection and devotion for
Achaeus, and also to Melancomas at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>; for these were
the men formerly employed by Achaeus in his negotiations
with Ptolemy, and in all other foreign affairs.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c18" type="chapter" n="18">
<head>Bolis Turns Traitor</head>
<p>Bolis went to <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, and thence to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>; communicated
<pb n="543"/>  his purpose to Nicomachus and Melancomas; and
found them ready to do what they were asked. He then
despatched one of his staff, named Arianus, to Cambylus, with
a message to the effect that he had been sent from <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>
on a recruiting tour, and that he wished for an interview with
Cambylus on some matters of importance; he thought it
therefore necessary to have a time and place arranged for them
to meet without the privity of a third person. Arianus quickly
obtained an interview with Cambylus and delivered his
message; nor was the latter at all unwilling to listen to the
proposal. Having appointed a day, and a place known to
both himself and Bolis, at which he would be after nightfall,
he dismissed Arianus. Now Bolis had all the subtlety of a
Cretan, and he accordingly weighed carefully in his own mind
every possible line of action, and patiently examined every
idea which presented itself to him. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Bolis turns traitor.</note> Finally he
met Cambylus according to the arrangement
made with Arianus, and delivered his letter. This
was now made the subject of discussion between them in a
truly Cretan spirit. They never took into consideration the
means of saving the person in danger, or their obligations of
honour to those who had entrusted them with the undertaking,
but confined their discussions entirely to the question of their
own safety and their own advantage. As they were both
Cretans they were not long in coming to an unanimous
agreement: which was, first of all, to divide the ten talents
supplied by Sosibius between themselves in equal shares; and,
secondly, to discover the whole affair to Antiochus, and to
offer with his support to put Achaeus into his hands, on
condition of receiving a sum of money and promises for the
future, on a scale commensurate with the greatness of the
undertaking. Having settled upon this plan of action:
Cambylus undertook the negotiation with Antiochus, while to
Bolis was assigned the duty of sending Arianus within the
next few days to Achaeus, bearing letters in cipher from
Nicomachus and Melancomas: he bade Cambylus however
take upon himself to consider how Arianus was to make his
way into the acropolis and return with safety. "If," said
Bolis, "Achaeus consents to make the attempt, and sends an
<pb n="544"/>
answer to Nicomachus and Melancomas, I will be ready to
act and will communicate with you." Having thus arranged
the parts which each was to take in the plot, they separated
and set about their several tasks.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c19" type="chapter" n="19">
<head>Antiochus Approves the Plan</head>
<p>At the first opportunity Cambylus laid the proposal
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The intended treason against Achaeus communicated to Antiochus.</note>
before the king. It was as acceptable to
Antiochus as it was unexpected: in the first
flush of his exultation he promised everything
they asked; but presently feeling some distrust,
he questioned Cambylus on every detail of their
plan, and their means of carrying it out. Being eventually
satisfied on these points, and believing that the undertaking
was under the special favour of Providence, he repeatedly
begged and prayed Cambylus to bring it to a conclusion.
Bolis was equally successful with Nicomachus and Melancomas.
They entertained no doubt of his sincerity, and joined him in
the composition of letters to Achaeus,&mdash;composed in a
cipher which they had been accustomed to use,&mdash;to prevent
any one who got hold of the letter from making out its contents,
exhorting him to trust Bolis and Cambylus. So Arianus,
having by the aid of Cambylus made his way into the acropolis,
delivered the letters to Achaeus; and having had personal
acquaintance with the whole business from its commencement,
he was able to give an account of every detail when questioned
and cross-questioned again and again by Achaeus about
Sosibius and Bolis, about Nicomachus and Melancomas, and
most particularly about the part which Cambylus was taking
in the affair. He could of course stand this cross-examination
with some air of sincerity and candour, because, in point of
fact, he was not acquainted with the most important part of
the plan which Cambylus and Bolis had
adopted. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Achaeus is deceived.</note>Achaeus was convinced by the
answers returned by Arianus, and still more
by the cipher of Nicomachus and Melancomas; gave his
answer; and sent Arianus back with it without delay. This
kind of communication was repeated more than once: and at
last Achaeus entrusted himself without reserve to Nicomachus,
there being absolutely no other hope of saving himself left
remaining, and bade him send Bolis with Arianus on a certain
<pb n="545"/>
moonless night, promising to place himself in their hands.
The idea of Achaeus was, first of all, to escape his immediate
danger; and then by a circuitous route to make his way into
<placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. For he entertained very great hopes that, if he appeared
suddenly and unexpectedly to the Syrians, while Antiochus
was still lingering about <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>, he would be able to stir up a
great movement, and meet with a cordial reception from the
people of <placeName key="tgn,7002351">Antioch</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002858">Coele-Syria</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>.</p>
<p>With such expectations and calculations Achaeus was
waiting for the appearance of Bolis.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c20" type="chapter" n="20">
<head>The Final Arrangements are Made</head>
<p>Meanwhile Arianus had reached Melancomas, who, on
reading the letter which he brought, immediately despatched
Bolis with many words of exhortation and great promises of
profit if he succeeded in his enterprise. Bolis sent Arianus
in advance to signify his arrival to Cambylus, and went after
nightfall to their usual place of meeting. There they spent a
whole day together settling every detail of their plan of
operations; and having done this they went into the camp
under cover of night. The arrangement made between them
was this. If it turned out that Achaeus came from the
acropolis alone with Bolis and Arianus, or with only one
attendant, he would give them no cause for anxiety at all,
but would be easily captured by the ambuscade set for him.
If, on the other hand, he should be accompanied by a
considerable number, the business would be one of some
difficulty to those on whose good faith he relied; especially
as they were anxious to capture him alive, that being what
would most gratify Antiochus. In that case, therefore, Arianus,
while conducting Achaeus, was to go in front, because he knew
the path by which he had on several occasions effected his
entrance and return; Bolis was to bring up the rear, in order
that, when they arrived at the spot where Cambylus was to
have his ambuscade ready, he might lay hold on Achaeus, and
prevent his getting away through wooded ground, in the confusion and darkness of the night, or throwing himself in his
terror from some precipice; thus they would secure that he
fell, as they intended, into his enemies' hands alive.</p>
<p>These arrangements having been agreed upon, Bolis was
taken by Cambylus on the very night of his arrival, without
<pb n="546"/>
any one else, and introduced to Antiochus. The king was
alone and received them graciously; he pledged himself to
the performance of his promises, and urged them both again
and again not to postpone any longer the performance of their
purpose. Thereupon they returned for the present to their
own camp; but towards morning Bolis, accompanied by
Arianus, ascended to the acropolis, and entered it before
daybreak.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c21" type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Achaeus Takes Precautions</head>
<p>Achaeus received them with warmth and cordiality,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Achaeus takes vain precautions.</note>
and questioned Bolis at great length on every
detail. From the expression of his face, and
his conversation, he judged Bolis to be a man of
a character weighty enough for so serious an undertaking; but
while at one time he exulted in the prospect of his release, at
another, he grew painfully excited, and was torn with an agony of
anxiety at the gravity of the issues at stake. But no one had a
clearer head or greater experience in affairs than he; and in spite
of the good opinion he had formed of him, he still determined
that his safety should not depend entirely on the good faith of
Bolis. He accordingly told him that it was impossible for
him to leave the acropolis at the moment: but that he would
send some two or three of his friends with him, and by the
time that they had joined Melancomas he would be prepared
to depart. So Achaeus did all he could for his security; but
he did not know that he was trying to do what the proverb
declares to be impossible&mdash;out-cretan a Cretan. For there was
no trick likely to be tried that Bolis had not anticipated. However when the night came, in which Achaeus said that he would
send his friends with them, he sent on Arianus and Bolis to the
entrance of the acropolis, with instructions to wait there until
those who were to go with them arrived. They did as he bade
them. Achaeus then, at the very moment of his departure,
communicated his plan to his wife Laodice; and she was so
terrified at his sudden resolve, that he had to spend some time
in entreating her to be calm, in soothing her feelings, and
encouraging her by pointing out the hopes which he entertained. This done he started with four companions, whom he
dressed in ordinary clothes, while he himself put on a mean
and common dress and disguised his rank as much as possible.
<pb n="547"/>
He selected one of his four companions to be always prepared
to answer anything said by Arianus, and to ask any necessary
question of him, and bade him say that the other four did not
speak Greek.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c22" type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Capture of Achaeus</head>
<p>The five then joined Arianus, and they all started
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Achaeus made prisoner.</note>
together on their journey. Arianus went in
front, as being acquainted with the way; while
Bolis took up his position behind in accordance
with the original plan, puzzled and annoyed at the way things
were turning out. For, Cretan as he was, and ready to suspect
every one he came near, he yet could not make out which of
the five was Achaeus, or whether he was there at all. But the
path was for the most part precipitous and difficult, and in
some places there were abrupt descents which were slippery
and dangerous; and whenever they came to one of these,
some of the four gave Achaeus a hand down, and the others
caught him at the bottom, for they could not entirely conceal
their habitual respect for him; and Bolis was quick to detect,
by observing this, which of them was Achaeus. When therefore
they arrived at the spot at which it had been arranged that
Cambylus was to be, Bolis gave the signal by a whistle, and
the men sprang from their places of concealment and seized
the other four, while Bolis himself caught hold of Achaeus,
at the same time grasping his mantle, as his hands were inside
it; for he was afraid that having a sword concealed about his
person he would attempt to kill himself when he understood
what was happening. Being thus quickly surrounded on every
side, Achaeus fell into the hands of his enemies, and along
with his four friends was taken straight off to Antiochus.</p>
<p>The king was in his tent in a state of extreme anxiety<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Achaeus brought to Antiochus, sentenced and executed.</note>
awaiting the result. He had dismissed his
usual court, and, with the exception of two
or three of the bodyguard, was alone and
sleepless. But when Cambylus and his men
entered, and placed Achaeus in chains on the ground, he fell
into a state of speechless astonishment: and for a considerable
time could not utter a word, and finally overcome by a feeling
of pity burst into tears; caused, I have no doubt, by this
exhibition of the capriciousness of Fortune, which defies
<pb n="548"/>
precaution and calculation alike. For here was Achaeus, a
son of Andromachus, the brother of Seleucus's queen Laodice,
and married to Laodice, a daughter of King Mithridates, and
who had made himself master of all <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> this side of Taurus,
and who at that very moment was believed by his own army,
as well as by that of his enemy, to be safely ensconced in
the strongest position in the world,&mdash;sitting chained upon the
ground, in the hands of his enemies, before a single person
knew of it except those who had effected the capture.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Antiochus In Armenia</head>
<p>And, indeed, when at daybreak the king's friends
assembled as usual at his tent, and saw this strange spectacle,
they too felt emotions very like those of the king; while extreme
astonishment made them almost disbelieve the evidence of their
senses. However the council met, and a long debate ensued
as to what punishment they were to inflict upon Achaeus.
Finally, it was resolved that his extremities should be cut off,
his head severed from his body and sewn up in the skin of an
ass, and his body impaled. When this sentence had been
carried out, and the army learnt what had happened, there
was such excitement in the ranks and such a rush of the soldiers
to the spectacle, that Laodice on the acropolis, who alone
knew that her husband had left it, guessed what had happened
from the commotion and stir in the camp. And before long
a herald arrived, told Laodice what had happened to Achaeus,
and ordered her to resign the command and quit the
acropolis. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The citadel of <placeName key="tgn,7002615">Sardis</placeName> surrendered.</note> At first any answer was prevented
by an outburst of sorrow and overpowering
lamentation on the part of the occupants of
the acropolis; not so much from affection towards Achaeus,
as from the suddenness and utter unexpectedness of the
catastrophe. But this was succeeded by a feeling of
hesitation and dismay; and Antiochus, having got rid of
Achaeus, never ceased putting pressure on the garrison of
the acropolis, feeling confident that a means of taking it
would be put into his hands by those who occupied it, and
most probably by the rank and file of the garrison. And this
is just what did finally happen: for the soldiers split up into
factions, one joining Ariobazus, the other Laodice. This
produced mutual distrust, and before long both parties surrendered
<pb n="549"/>  themselves and the acropolis. Thus Achaeus, in spite
of having taken every reasonable precaution, lost his life by
the perfidy of those in whom he trusted. His fate may teach
posterity two useful lessons,&mdash;not to put faith in any one
lightly; and not to be over-confident in the hour of prosperity,
knowing that, in human affairs, there is no accident which we
may not expect. . . .</p></div2>

and hand over the principality to Mithridates, his own sister's

a foray, and got near Hannibal's camp before
daybreak. Then, while the rest crouched down
on a certain wooded spot by the side of the
road, Philemenus and Nicon went up to the
camp. They were seized by the sentries and
taken off to Hannibal, without saying a word as
to where they came from or who they were, but
simply stating that they wished for an interview
with the general. Being taken without delay
to Hannibal they said that they wished to
speak with him privately. He assented with
the utmost readiness; whereupon they explained
to him their own position and that of their
native city, charging the Romans with many
various acts of oppression, that they might not
seem to be entering on their present undertaking without good reason. For the present
<pb n="551"/>
Hannibal dismissed them with thanks and a cordial acceptance
of their proposed movement, and charging them to come back
very soon and have another interview with him. "This time,"
he added, "when you get at a sufficient distance from the camp,
take possession of the first cattle you find being driven out to
pasture in the early morning, and go off boldly with them and
their herdsmen; for I will take care that you are unmolested."
His object in doing this was to give himself time to inquire
into the tale of the young men; and also to confirm their credit
with their fellow-citizens, by making it appear that their
expedition had really been for the purpose of foraging.
Nicon and his companions did as they were bidden, and left
Hannibal in great exultation at having at last got an opportunity of completing his enterprise: while they themselves
were made all the more eager to carry out their plot by having
been able to accomplish their interview with Hannibal without
danger, and by having found him warmly disposed to their
undertaking, and by having besides gained the confidence of
their own people by the considerable amount of booty which
they had brought home. This they partly sold and partly
used in splendid entertainments, and thus not only were
believed in by the Tarentines, but excited a considerable
number to emulate their exploit.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c27" type="chapter" n="27">
<head>A Bargain Made with Hannibal</head>
<p>On their next expedition, which they conducted in the

of fidelity with Hannibal on the following conditions: "He was to set the Tarentines free;
and the Carthaginians were neither to exact tribute of any sort
from them, nor impose any burden upon them; but the houses
and lodgings occupied by Romans should, on their taking
possession of the town, be given up to the Carthaginians to
plunder." They also arranged on a watch-word at which the
sentries were to admit them without delay into the camp
whenever they came. After making these arrangements, they
got the opportunity of often having interviews with Hannibal:
sometimes pretending to be going out of the town on a foray,
and sometimes on a hunting expedition. Everything having
thus been put in train, the greater part of the conspirators
waited for the proper occasions for acting, while they assigned
<pb n="552"/>
to Philemenus the part of leader of their hunting excursions; for,
owing to his excessive taste for that amusement, he had the reputation of thinking hunting the most important thing in life.
Accordingly they left it to him, first to win the favour of Gaius
Livius the commander of the town by presents of game, and
then that of the guards of the gate-tower which protected what
were called the Temenid gates. Philemenus undertook the
task: and partly by what he caught himself, and partly with what
Hannibal supplied, always managed to bring in some game;
which he divided between Livius and the guards of the gate,
to induce them to be always ready to open the wicket to him.
For he generally went and returned from his expeditions after
nightfall, under the pretext of being afraid of the enemy, but
really with a view of preparing for the plot. When Philemenus
then had managed to make it a regular arranged thing with
the picket at the gate, that the guards should have no hesitation;
but that, whenever he came under the wall and whistled, they
should open the wicket to him; he waited for a day on which
the Roman commander of the town was engaged to be present
at a large party, meeting early in the Musaeum, which is near
the agora, and agreed with Hannibal to carry out their plot
on that day.</p></div2>

<p>For some time before this, Hannibal had given out that
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal prepares to act.</note>
he was ill, to prevent the Romans wondering
when they were told of his staying so long on
the same ground; and he now made a greater
pretence than ever of ill-health, and remained encamped three
days' march from <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>. But when the time was come, he
got ready the most conspicuous for their speed and daring in
his cavalry and infantry, to the number of about ten thousand,
and gave orders that they should take provisions for four days.
He started just before daybreak, and marched at full speed;
having told off eighty Numidian horsemen to keep thirty stades
ahead, and to scour the country on both sides of the road; so
that no one might get a sight of the main body, but might
either be taken prisoners by this advanced guard, or, if he
escaped, might carry a report of it into the city as if it were
merely a raid of Numidian horsemen. When the Numidians
were about a hundred and twenty stades from the town,
<pb n="553"/>
Hannibal halted his men for supper by the side of a river
flowing through a deep gully, and offering excellent cover; and
having summoned his officers, did not indeed tell them outright what the service was on which they were going, but
simply exhorted them, first to show themselves brave men,
as the prize awaiting them was the greatest they had ever had;
and, secondly, that each should keep the men of his own
company well together, and rebuke sharply all who left their
own division on any pretext whatever; and, thirdly, to attend
strictly to orders, and not attempt anything on their own account
outside them. Dismissing the officers with these words, he got
his troops on the march just after dark, being very anxious to
reach the wall about midnight; having Philemenus to act as
guide, and having got ready for him a wild-boar to enable
him to sustain the part which he was to perform.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c29" type="chapter" n="29">
<head>Gaius Livius Has a Party</head>
<p>About sunset news was brought to Gaius Livius, who
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Gaius Livius thrown off the scent.</note>
had been with his friends in the Musaeum since
early in the day, just when the drinking was at
its height, that the Numidians were scouring
the country. He therefore took measures for that and
nothing more, calling some of his officers and bidding
them take half the cavalry, and sally out to stop the progress
of the enemy, who were devasting the country: but this
only made him still more unsuspicious of the whole extent
of the movement. Nicon, Tragiscus, and their confederates
collected together at nightfall in the town and waited for the
return of Livius and his friends. As these last rose from table
somewhat early, because the banquet had begun before the usual
time, the greater number of the conspirators retired to a certain
spot and there remained; but some of the younger men went to
meet Gaius, imitating by their disorderly procession and mutual
jests a company returning from a carouse. As Livius and his
company were even more flustered with drink, as soon as
they met laughter and joking were readily excited on both
sides. Finally, they turned and conducted Gaius to his house;
where he went to bed full of wine, as might be expected after
a party beginning so early in the day, without any anxiety or
trouble in his thoughts, but full of cheerfulness and idle
content. Then Nicon and Tragiscus rejoined their companions,
<pb n="554"/>  and, dividing themselves into three companies, took
up their positions at the most favourable points in the marketplace, to keep themselves fully acquainted with everything
reported from outside the walls, or that happened within the
city itself. They posted some also close to the house of
Livius: being well aware that, if any suspicion of what was
coming arose, it would be to him that the news would be first
brought, and that from him every measure taken would
originate. So when the noise of the returning guests, and every
disturbance of the sort, had subsided, and the great bulk of the
citizens was asleep; and now the night was advancing, and
nothing had happened to dash their hopes, they collected
together and proceeded to perform their part of the undertaking.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>Hannibal Enters Tarentum</head>
<p>The arrangements between these young men and
Hannibal were these. Hannibal was to arrive at the town by the
inland road and on the eastern side near the Temenid gates;
and when there, was to light a fire on the tomb, which some
called the tomb of Hyacinthus, and others of Apollo: Tragiscus
and his confederates, when they saw this, were to light an
answering fire from within the walls. This done, Hannibal
was to put out his fire and advance slowly towards the gate.
In pursuance of these arrangements, the young men marched
through the inhabited part of town and
came to the tombs. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Why the Tarentines bury within the walls.</note> For the eastern quarter of
Tarentum is full of monuments, because those who
die there are to this day all buried within the walls, in obedience
to an ancient oracle. For it is said that the god delivered
this answer to the Tarentines, "That it were better and more
profitable for them if they made their dwelling with the majority"; and they thought therefore that they would be living
in accordance with the oracle if they kept the departed within
the walls. That is why to this day they bury inside the gates.</p>
<p>The young men, then, having gone as far as the tomb of<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal arrives and gets into the town.</note>
Pythionicus, waited to see what would happen.
Presently Hannibal arrived and did as arranged:
whereupon Nicon and Tragiscus with renewed
courage displayed their beacon also; and, as soon as they saw
the fire of the Carthaginians being put out, they ran to the
<pb n="555"/>
gates as fast as they could go, wishing to get the picket at the
gate tower killed before the Carthaginians arrived; as it had
been agreed that they should advance leisurely and at a foot's
pace. Everything went smoothly: the guards were overpowered; and while some of the young men were engaged in
killing them, others were cutting the bolts. The gates having
been quickly thrown open, Hannibal arrived at the right
moment, having so timed his march that he never had to stop
on the way to the town at all.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c31" type="chapter" n="31">
<head>Philemenus and his Retinue Get In Too</head>
<p>Having thus effected their intended entrance, without

danger or any disturbance whatever, and thinking that the most
important part of their undertaking was accomplished, the
Carthaginians now began advancing boldly along the street
leading up from what is called the Batheia or Deep Road.
They left the cavalry however outside the walls, numbering as
many as two thousand, intending them to act as a reserve both
in case of any appearance of the enemy from without, and of
any of those unforeseen casualities which do occur in such
operations. But when they had come to the immediate
neighbourhood of the market-place, they halted, and waited
to see how the attempt of Philemenus would turn out: being
anxious as to the success of this part of their plan as well as
the other. For at the same moment that he lighted his fire,
and was on the point of starting for the gates, Hannibal had
despatched Philemenus also, with his boar on
a litter, and a thousand Libyans, to the next
gate; wishing, in accordance with his original
design, not to depend solely on one chance, but to have several.
When Philemenus, then, arrived at the wall and gave his
customary signal by whistling, the sentry immediately appeared
coming down to open the wicket; and when Philemenus told
him from outside to open quickly because they had a great
weight to carry, as they were bringing a wild boar, he made
haste to open the wicket, expecting that some of the game
which Philemenus was conveying would come his way, as
he had always had a share of what was brought in.</p>
<p>Thereupon Philemenus himself, being at the head of the
litter, entered first; and with him another dressed like a
shepherd, as though he were one of the country folk
<pb n="556"/>
of those parts; and after him two others besides who were
carrying the dead beast behind. But when the four had
got inside the wicket, they struck and killed the man who
opened it, as he was unsuspiciously examining and feeling the
boar, and then let the men who were just behind them, and
were in advance of the main body of Libyan horsemen, to
the number of thirty, leisurely and quietly through. This
having been accomplished without a hitch, some set about
cutting the bolts, others were engaged in killing the picket
on duty at the gate, and others in giving the signal to
the Libyans still outside to come in. These having also
effected their entrance in safety, they began making their way
towards the market-place according to the arrangement. As
soon as he was joined by this division also, in great delight at
the successful progress of the operation, Hannibal proceeded
to carry out the next step.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c32" type="chapter" n="32">
<head>Massacre of Romans In Tarentum</head>
<p>He told off two thousand of his Celts: and, having
divided them into three companies, he assigned two of the
young men who had managed the plot to each company; and
sent with them also certain of his own officers, with orders to
close up the several most convenient streets that led to the
market-place. And when he had done this, he bade the
young men of the town pick out and save those of their
fellow-citizens whom they might chance to meet, by shouting
out before they came up with them, "That Tarentines should
remain where they were, as they were in no danger"; but he
ordered both Carthaginian and Celtic officers to kill all the
Romans they met.</p>
<p>So these companies separated and proceeded to carry out<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Escape of Livius into the citadel.</note>
their orders. But when the entrance of the
enemy became known to the Tarentines, the
city began to be full of shouting and extraordinary confusion. As for Gaius, when the enemy's entrance was
announced to him, being fully aware that his drunkenness had
incapacitated him, he rushed straight out of the house with his
servants, and having come to the gate leading to the harbour,
and the sentinel having opened the wicket for him, he got
through that way; and having seized one of the boats lying at
anchor there, went on board it with his servants and arrived
<pb n="557"/>
safely at the citadel. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Massacre of Roman soldiers. </note>Meanwhile Philemenus had provided
himself with some Roman bugles, and some
men who were able to blow them, from being
used to do so; and they stood in the theatre and
sounded a call to arms. The Romans promptly rallying in
arms, as was their custom at this sound, and directing their
steps towards the citadel, everything happened exactly as the
Carthaginians intended; for as the Roman soldiers came into
the streets, without any order and in scattered groups, some of
them came upon the Carthaginians and others upon the Celts;
and by their being in this way put to the sword in detail, a
very considerable number of them perished.</p>
<p>But when day began to break, the Tarentines kept quietly
in their houses, not yet being able to comprehend what was
happening. For thanks to the bugle, and the absence of all
outrage or plundering in the town, they thought that the
movement arose from the Romans themselves. But the sight
of many of the latter lying killed in the streets, and the
spectacle of some Gauls openly stripping the Roman corpses,
suggested a suspicion of the presence of the Carthaginians.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>The Tarentines Themselves Spared</head>
<p>Presently when Hannibal had marched his forces into

the market-place, and the Romans had retired
into the citadel, as having been previously
secured by them with a garrison, and it had
become broad daylight, the Carthaginian general caused a
proclamation to be made to the Tarentines to assemble in full
number in the market-place; while the young conspirators
went meanwhile round the town talking loudly about liberty,
and bidding everybody not to be afraid, for the Carthaginians had
come to save them. Such of the Tarentines as held to their
loyalty to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, upon learning the state of the case, went off
to the citadel; but the rest came to the meeting, in obedience
to the proclamation, without their arms: and to them Hannibal
addressed a cordial speech. The Tarentines heartily cheered
everything he said from joy at their unexpected safety; and he
dismissed the crowd with an injunction to each man, to go with
all speed to his own house, and write over the door, "A
Tarentine's"; but if any one wrote the same word on a house
where a Roman was living, he declared the penalty to be
<pb n="558"/>
death. He then personally told off the best men he had for
the service, and sent them to plunder the houses of the
Romans; giving them as their instructions to consider all
houses which had no inscription as belonging to the enemy:
the rest of his men he kept drawn up as a reserve.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c34" type="chapter" n="34">
<head>Hannibal Secures <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName></head>
<p>A vast quantity of miscellaneous property having been
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fortifications raised to preserve the town from attack from the citadel.</note>
got together by this plundering, and a booty
fully answering the expectations of the Carthaginians, they bivouacked for that night under
arms. But the next day, after consulting with the
Tarentines, Hannibal decided to cut off the city
from the citadel by a wall, that the Tarentines might not any
longer be under continual alarm from the Romans in possession of the citadel. His first measure was to throw up a
palisade, parallel to the wall of the citadel and to the trench in
front of it. But as he very well knew that the enemy would
not allow this tamely, but would make a demonstration of their
power in that direction, he got ready for the work a number
of his best hands, thinking that the first thing necessary was to
overawe the Romans and give confidence to the Tarentines.
But as soon as the first palisade was begun, the Romans began
a bold and determined attack; whereupon Hannibal, offering
just enough resistance to induce the rest to come out, as soon
as the greater part of them had crossed the trench, gave the
word of command to his men and charged the enemy. A
desperate struggle ensued; for the fight took place in a narrow
space surrounded by walls; but at last the Romans were forced
to turn and fly. Many of them fell in the actual fighting, but
the larger number were forced over the edge of the trench and
were killed by the fall over its steep bank.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c35" type="chapter" n="35">
<head>Additional Fortifications</head>
<p>For the present Hannibal, after completing the palisade
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Further works of security.</note>
unmolested, was content to remain quiet, as his
plan had succeeded to his wish; for he had
shut in the enemy and compelled them to
remain inside their wall, in terror for the safety of the citadel
as well as for their own; while he had raised the courage of
the citizens of Tarentum to such an extent, that they now
imagined themselves to be a match for the Romans, even
without the Carthaginians. A little later he made at a short
<pb n="559"/>
distance from the palisade, in the direction of the town, a trench
parallel to the palisade and the wall of the citadel; and the
earth dug out from it having been piled up on the other side
along the edge nearest the town, he erected another palisade
on the top, thus making a fortification no less secure than the
wall itself. Once more, at a moderate distance, nearer the city,
he commenced building a wall, starting from the street called
Soteira up to that called Batheia; so that, even without a garrison,
the Tarentines were adequately protected by the mere constructions themselves. Then leaving a sufficient garrison, and
enough cavalry to serve on outpost duty for the protection of the
wall, he encamped along the bank of the river which is called by
some the Galaesus, but by most people the Eurotas, after the
river which flows past <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. The Tarentines have many
such derived names, both in town and country, from the
acknowledged fact of their being a colony from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and
connected by blood with the Lacedaemonians. As the wall
quickly approached completion, owing to the activity and zeal
of the Tarentines, and the vigorous co-operation of the Carthaginians, Hannibal next conceived the idea of taking the
citadel also.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b8c36" type="chapter" n="36">
<head>The Tarantines Blockade the Romans</head>
<p>But when he had already completed the preparation
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's arrangements for storming the citadel frustrated.</note>
of the necessary engines for the assault, the
Romans received some slight encouragement
on a reinforcement throwing itself into the
citadel by sea from Metapontium; and consequently they sallied out by night and attacked the works, and
destroyed all Hannibal's apparatus and engines. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Romans reinforced.</note>
After this Hannibal abandoned the idea of a
storm: but as the new wall was now completed,
he summoned a meeting of the Tarentines and pointed out to
them that the most imperative necessity, in view of the present
state of things, was to get command of the sea. For as the citadel
commanded the entrance to the harbour, the Tarentines could
not use their ships nor sail out of it; while the Romans could
get supplies conveyed to them by sea without danger: and as
long as that was the case, it was impossible that the city should
have any security for its freedom. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">New plans for cutting off the</note> Hannibal
saw this clearly, and explained to the Tarentines
<pb n="560"/>  that, if the enemy on the citadel were
deprived of hope of succour by sea, they
would at once give way, and abandon it of their own accord,
without attempting to defend the place. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Roman supplies by sea.</note> The Tarentines were
fully convinced by his words: but how it was to be brought
about in the present state of affairs they could form no idea,
unless a fleet should appear from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>; which at that
time of the year was impossible. They therefore said that they
could not understand what Hannibal was aiming at in these
remarks to them. When he replied that it was plain that,
even without the Carthaginians, they were all but in command
of the sea, they were still more puzzled, and could not guess
his meaning. The truth was that Hannibal had noticed that the
broad street, which was at once within the wall separating the
town from the citadel, and led from the harbour into the open
sea, was well suited for the purpose; and he had conceived the
idea of dragging the ships out of the harbour to the sea on
the southern side of the town. Upon his disclosing his idea to
the Tarentines, they not only expressed their agreement with
the proposal, but the greatest admiration for himself; and made
up their minds that there was nothing which his acuteness and
daring could not accomplish. Trucks on wheels were quickly
constructed: and it was scarcely sooner said than done, owing
to the zeal of the people and the numbers who helped to work
at it. In this way the Tarentines dragged their ships across
into the open sea, and were enabled without danger to themselves to blockade the Romans on the citadel, having deprived
them of their supplies from without. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-212" to="-211">212</dateRange>-211.</note> But Hannibal himself,

certain Syracusans having given a large supply;
Marcus Marcellus selected a part of the wall somewhat lower
than the rest, and thinking it probable that the men were
drunk, owing to the license of the hour, and the short supply of
food with their wine, he determined to attempt an escalade. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fall of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> by an escalade,

Two ladders of the proper height for the wall having been
quickly made, he pressed on the undertaking. He spoke
openly to those who were fit to make the ascent and to face
the first and most conspicuous risk, holding out to them
brilliant prospects of reward. He also picked out some men
to give them necessary help and bring ladders, without telling them anything except to bid them be ready to obey
orders. His directions having been accurately obeyed, at
the proper time in the night he put the first men in motion,
sending with them the men with the ladders together with a
maniple and a tribune, and having first reminded them of the
rewards awaiting them if they behaved with gallantry. After
this he got his whole force ready to start; and despatching the
vanguard by maniples at intervals, when a thousand had been
massed in this way, after a short pause, he marched himself
with the main body. The men carrying the ladders having
succeeded in safely placing them against the wall, those who
had been told off to make the ascent mounted at once without hesitation. Having accomplished this
without being observed, and having got a firm footing on the top of the wall,
the rest began to mount by the ladders also, not in any fixed
order, but as best they could. At first as they made their way
upon the wall they found no one to oppose them, for the
guards of the several towers, owing to it being a time of public
sacrifice, were either still drinking or were gone to sleep again
in a state of drunkenness. Consequently of the first and second
companies of guards, which they came upon, they killed the
greater number before they knew that they were being attacked.
And when they came near Hexapyli, they descended from the
wall, and forced open the first postern they came to which was

Olympiad, that is, of the four years which an
Olympiad must be reckoned to contain; and I
shall endeavour to include the history of them
in two books.</p>
<p>I am quite aware that my history has an element of
austerity in it, and is adapted to, and will be approved by
only one class of readers, owing to the uniformity of its plan.
Nearly all other historians, or at any rate most, attract a
variety of readers by entering upon all the various branches of
history. The curious reader is attracted by the genealogical
style; the antiquarian by the discussion of colonisations,
origins of cities, and ties of blood, such as is found in
Ephorus; the student of polities by the story of tribes, cities,
and dynasties. It is to this last branch of the subject that I
have had a single eye, and have devoted my whole work; and
accordingly have, as I said before, accommodated all my
plans to one particular class of narrative. The result is that I
have made my work by no means attractive reading to the
majority. Why I thus neglected other departments of history,
and deliberately resolved to confine myself to chronicling
actions, I have already stated at length; however, there is
no reason why I should not briefly remind my readers
of it again in this place, for the sake of impressing it upon
them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Why Focus on Actions</head>
<p>Seeing that many writers have discussed in many
varieties of style the question of genealogies, myths, and
colonisations, as well as of the foundations of cities and the
<pb n="564"/>
consanguinity of peoples, there was nothing left for a writer at
this date but to copy the words of others and claim them as his
own,&mdash;than which nothing could be more dishonourable; or,
if he did not choose to do that, to absolutely waste his labour,
being obliged to acknowledge that he is composing a history
and bestowing thought on what has already been sufficiently set
forth and transmitted to posterity by his predecessors. For
these and sundry other reasons I abandoned such themes as
these, and determined on writing a history of actions: first,
because they are continually new and require a new narrative,
&mdash;as of course one generation cannot give us the history of
the next; and secondly, because such a narrative is of all
others the most instructive. This it has always been: but it
is eminently so now, because the arts and sciences have made
such an advance in our day, that students are able to arrange
every event as it happens according to fixed rules, as it were,
of scientific classification. Therefore, as I did not aim so
much at giving pleasure to my readers, as at profiting those
who apply to such studies, I omitted all other themes and
devoted myself wholly to this. But on these points, those who
give a careful attention to my narrative will be the best
witnesses to the truth of what I say. . . .</p></div2>

Hannibal at first skirmished, and tried all he
could to tempt him to come out and give him
battle. But as no one attended to him, his
attack became very like an attempt to storm
the camp; for his cavalry charged in their
squadrons, and with loud cries hurled their
<pb n="565"/>
javelins inside the entrenchments, and the
infantry attacked in their regular companies,
and tried to pull down the palisading round
the camp.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Q. Fulvius and Appius Claudius, the Consuls of the previous year,

Romans from their purpose: they employed
their light-armed troops to repulse those who
were actually attacking the palisade, but protecting themselves with their heavy shields
against the javelins of the enemy, they remained
drawn up near their standards without moving.
Discomfited at being neither able to throw himself into <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>,
nor induce the Romans to leave their camp, Hannibal retired
to consult as to what was best to be done.</p>
<p>It is no wonder, in my opinion, that the Carthaginians<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The determination and cautious tactics of the Romans.</note>
were puzzled. I think any one who heard
the facts would be the same. For who would
not have received with incredulity the statement
that the Romans, after losing so many battles to
the Carthaginians, and though they did not venture to meet
them on the field, could not nevertheless be induced to give
up the contest or abandon the command of the country?
Up to this time, moreover, they had contented themselves
with hovering in his neighbourhood, keeping along the skirts
of the mountains; but now they had taken up a position on
the plains, and those the fairest in all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and were besieging
the strongest city in it; and that with an enemy attacking
them, whom they could not endure even the thought of
meeting face to face: while the Carthaginians, who beyond
all dispute had won the battles, were sometimes in as great
difficulties as the losers. I think the reason of the strategy
adopted by the two sides respectively was, that they both had
seen that Hannibal's cavalry was the main cause of the
Carthaginian victory and Roman defeat. Accordingly the
plan of the losers after the battles, of following their enemies
at a distance, was the natural one to adopt; for the country
through which they went was such that the enemy's cavalry
would be unable to do them any damage. Similarly what
now happened at <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName> to either side was natural and
inevitable.

<div2 id="b9c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>The Siege of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName></head>
<p>For the Roman army did not venture to come out
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Carthaginian difficulties.</note>
and give battle, from fear of the enemy's
horse, but remained resolutely within their
entrenchment; well knowing that the cavalry,
by which they had been worsted in the battles, could not
hurt them there. While the Carthaginians, again, naturally
could not remain any longer encamped with their cavalry,
because all the pastures in the surrounding country had been
utterly destroyed by the Romans with that very view; and it was
impossible for animals to come from such a distance, carrying
on their backs hay and barley for so large a body of cavalry,
and so many beasts of burden; nor again did they venture,
when encamped without their cavalry, to attack an enemy
protected by a palisade and fosse, with whom a contest, even
without these advantages in their favour, was likely to be a
doubtful one if they had not got their cavalry. Besides this
they were much alarmed about the new Consuls, lest they
should come and encamp against them, and reduce them to
serious straits by cutting off their supplies of provisions.</p>
<p>These considerations convinced Hannibal that it was<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal determines on creating a diversion by threatening <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</note>
impossible to raise the siege by an open attack,
and he therefore changed his tactics. He
imagined that if by a secret march he could
suddenly appear in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,
he might by the alarm which he would inspire
in the inhabitants by his unexpected movement, perhaps do
something worth while against the city itself; or, if he could not
do that, would at least force Appius either to raise the siege of
<placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>, in order to hasten to the relief of his native town, or
to divide the Roman forces; which would then be easier for
him to conquer in detail.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Hannibal Advances Upon Rome</head>
<p>With this purpose in his mind he sent a letter-carrier
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal informs the Capuans of his purpose</note>
into <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>. This he did by persuading one of
his Libyans to desert to the Roman camp, and
thence to <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>. He took this trouble to
secure the safe delivery of his letter, because he was very
much afraid that the Capuans, if they saw him departing,
would consider that he despaired of them, and would therefore
give up hope and surrender to the Romans. He wrote therefore
<pb n="567"/>  an explanation of his design, and sent the Libyan the day
after, in order that the Capuans, being acquainted with the
purpose of his departure, might go on courageously sustaining
the siege.</p>
<p>When the news had arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> that Hannibal had<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Excitement and activity at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></note>
encamped over against their lines, and was
actually besieging their forces, there was a
universal excitement and terror, from a
feeling that the result of the impending battle would
decide the whole war. Consequently, with one heart and
soul, the citizens had all devoted themselves to sending out
reinforcements and making preparations for this struggle. On
their part, the Capuans were encouraged by the receipt of
Hannibal's letter, and by thus learning the object of the
Carthaginian movement, to stand by their determination, and
to await the issue of this new hope. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal starts.</note> At the end of the fifth day,
therefore, after his arrival on the ground, Hannibal ordered his
men to take their supper as usual, and leave
their watch-fires burning; and started with such
secrecy, that none of the enemy knew what was happening.
He took the road through Samnium, and marched at a great
pace and without stopping, his skirmishers always keeping
before him to reconnoitre and occupy all the posts along the
route: and while those in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> had their thoughts still wholly
occupied with <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName> and the campaign there, he crossed the
Anio without being observed; and having arrived at a distance of not more than forty stades from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, there pitched
his camp.</p></div2>

<p>On this being known at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the utmost confusion
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Terror at Rome.</note>
and terror prevailed among the inhabitants,&mdash;
this movement of Hannibal's being as unexpected as it was sudden; for he had never
been so close to the city before. At the same time their
alarm was increased by the idea at once occurring to them,
that he would not have ventured so near, if it were not that
the armies at <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName> were destroyed. Accordingly, the men
at once went to line the walls, and the points of vantage in the
defences of the town; while the women went round to the
temples of the gods and implored their protection, sweeping
<pb n="568"/>
the pavements of the temples with their hair: for this is their
customary way of behaving when any serious danger comes
upon their country. But just as Hannibal had encamped,
and was intending to attempt the city itself next day, an
extraordinary coincidence occurred which proved fortunate
for the preservation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>
<p>For Gnaeus Fulvius and Publius Sulpicius, having already<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Consular levies fortunately

enrolled one consular army, had bound the men
with the usual oath to appear at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> armed on
that very day; and were also engaged on that day
in drawing out the lists and testing the men for
the other army:<note anchored="yes">Or "legion," according to others. But as both Consuls are engaged in
the business, it seems reasonable to refer it to the two consular armies of two
legions each.</note> whereby it so happened that a
large number of men had been collected in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
spontaneously in the very nick of time. These troops the
Consuls boldly led outside the walls, and, entrenching themselves there, checked Hannibal's intended movement. For the
Carthaginians were at first eager to advance, and were not
altogether without hope that they would be able to take <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
itself by assault. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal devastates the <placeName key="tgn,1043765">Campagna</placeName>.</note> But when they saw the enemy drawn up in
order, and learnt before long from a prisoner what had
happened, they abandoned the idea of attacking
the city, and began devasting the country-side
instead, and setting fire to the houses. In
these first raids they collected an innumerable amount of booty,
for the field of plunder upon which they were entered was
one into which no one had ever expected an enemy to set foot.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Hannibal In Sight of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName></head>
<p>But presently, when the Consuls ventured to encamp
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal starts on his return.</note>
within ten stades of him, Hannibal broke up his
quarters before daylight. He did so for three
reasons:&mdash;first, because he had collected an
enormous booty; secondly, because he had given up all hope
of taking <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and lastly, because he reckoned that the
time had now come at which he expected, according to
his original idea, that Appius would have learnt the danger
threatening <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and would have raised the siege of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>
<pb n="569"/>
and come with his whole force to the relief of the city; or at
any rate would hurry up with the greater part, leaving a detachment
to carry on the siege. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The passage of the Anio.</note> Publius had caused the bridges
over the Anio to be broken down, and thus compelled
Hannibal to get his army across by a ford; and
he now attacked the Carthaginians as they were
engaged in making the passage of the stream
and caused them great distress. They were not able however
to strike an important blow, owing to the number of Hannibal's
cavalry, and the activity of the Numidians in every part of the
field. But before retiring to their camp they wrested the
greater part of the booty from them, and killed about three
hundred men; and then, being convinced that the Carthaginians were beating a hasty retreat in a panic, they followed
in their rear, keeping along the line of hills. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal turns upon his pursuers.</note> At first Hannibal
continued to march at a rapid pace, being anxious to meet the

enemy to come up, made an attack upon his
camp before daylight, killed a large number of them, and drove
the rest out of their camp. But when day broke, and he saw
the Romans in a strong position upon a steep hill, to which
they had retired, he decided not to continue his attack upon
them; but marching through Daunia and <placeName key="tgn,7007850">Bruttium</placeName> he
appeared at <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>, so unexpectedly, that he was within an

<head>Epaminondas and Hannibal Compared</head>
<p>It seems to me that the courage and determination both
of the Carthaginians and Romans at this crisis were truly remarkable; and merit quite as much admiration as the conduct
of Epaminondas, which I will describe here for the sake of
pointing the comparison.</p>
<p>He reached <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> with the allies, and when he saw that

the Lacedaemonians with their own forces in
full were come to <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, and that their allies
had mustered together in the same city, with the
intention of offering the Thebans battle; having
<pb n="570"/>
given orders to his men to get their supper
early, he led his army out immediately after
nightfall, on the pretext of being anxious to
seize certain posts with a view to the coming battle.  But
having impressed this idea upon the common soldiers, he led
them along the road to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> itself; and having arrived
at the city about the third hour of his march, contrary to all
expectation, and finding <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> destitute of defenders, he
forced his way right up to the market-place, and occupied the
quarters of the town which slope down to the river. Then
however a contretemps occurred: a deserter
made his way into <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> and told Agesilaus
what was going on. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A Cretan warns Agesilaus.</note> Assistance accordingly
arrived just as the city was on the point of being taken; and
Epaminondas was disappointed of his hope. But having
caused his men to get their breakfast along the bank of the
Eurotas, and recovered them from their fatigue, he started to
march back again by the same road, calculating that, as the
Lacedaemonians and their allies had come to the relief of
<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> would in its turn be left undefended: which
turned out to be the case. So he exhorted the Thebans to
exert themselves; and, after a rapid night march, arrived at
<placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName> about mid-day, finding it entirely destitute of
defenders.</p>
<p>But the Athenians, who were at that time zealously supporting the Lacedaemonians in their contest with the Thebans, had
arrived in virtue of their treaty of alliance; and just as the
Theban vanguard reached the temple of Poseidon, seven stades
from the town, it happened that the Athenians showed themselves, by design, as if on the brow of the hill overhanging
<placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>. And when they saw them, the Mantineans who
had been left behind at last ventured to man the wall and
resist the attack of the Thebans. Therefore historians are
justified in speaking with some dissatisfaction of these events,<note anchored="yes">That is "blaming Fortune or Providence." Schw. quotes <cit><bibl n="Xen. Hell. 7.5.12">Xenophon

when they say that the leader did everything which a good

<head>When Audacity is the Truest Safety</head>
<p>Much the same remark applies to Hannibal. For who
can refrain from regarding with respect and admiration a
general capable of doing what he did? First he attempted by
harassing the enemy with skirmishing attacks to raise the siege:
having failed in this he made direct for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> itself: baffled
once more by a turn of fortune entirely independent of human

to me to be opposed to <foreign lang="greek">fugei=n</foreign> or some such idea. Hannibal was not in

moment was ripe to see whether the besiegers of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>
stirred: and finally, without relaxing in his determination, swept
down upon his enemies to their destruction, and all but
depopulated <placeName key="tgn,7004296">Rhegium</placeName>. One would be inclined however to
judge the Romans to be superior to the Lacedaemonians at this
crisis. For the Lacedaemonians rushed off <foreign lang="fr">en masse</foreign> at the
first message and relieved <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, but, as far as they were
concerned, lost <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>. The Romans guarded their own
city without breaking up the siege of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>: on the contrary,
they remained unshaken and firm in their purpose, and in fact
from that time pressed the Capuans with renewed spirit.</p>
<p>I have not said this for the sake of making a panegyric on
either the Romans or Carthaginians, whose great qualities I
have already remarked upon more than once: but for the sake
of those who are in office among the one or the other people, or
who are in future times to direct the affairs of any state whatever; that by the memory, or actual contemplation, of exploits
such as these they may be inspired with emulation. For in an

they were right in doing so, and consulted their
true interests or the reverse, is a matter admitting
of much discussion; but I think the balance of
argument is in favour of believing it to have been
wrong then, and wrong now. If such had been
the works by which they had exalted their
country, it is clear that there would have been
some reason in transferring thither the things by which they
had become great. But the fact was that, while leading lives
of the greatest simplicity themselves, as far as possible removed from the luxury and extravagance which these things
imply, they yet conquered the men who had always possessed
them in the greatest abundance and of the finest quality. Could
there have been a greater mistake than theirs? Surely it
would be an incontestable error for a people to abandon the
habits of the conquerors and adopt those of the conquered;
and at the same time involve itself in that jealousy which is the
most dangerous concomitant of excessive prosperity. For the
looker-on never congratulates those who take what belongs
<pb n="573"/>
to others, without a feeling of jealousy mingling with his pity for
the losers. But suppose such prosperity to go on increasing, and
a people to accumulate into its own hands all the possessions
of the rest of the world, and moreover to invite in a way the
plundered to share in the spectacle they present, in that case
surely the mischief is doubled. For it is no longer a case of
the spectators pitying their neighbours, but themselves, as they
recall the ruin of their own country. Such a sight produces
an outburst, not of jealousy merely, but of rage against the
victors. For the reminder of their own disaster serves to enhance
their hatred of the authors of it. To sweep the gold and silver,
however, into their own coffers was perhaps reasonable; for it
was impossible for them to aim at universal empire without
crippling the means of the rest of the world, and securing the
same kind of resources for themselves. But they might have
left in their original sites things that had nothing to do with
material wealth; and thus at the same time have avoided
exciting jealousy, and raised the reputation of their country:
adorning it, not with pictures and statues, but with dignity of
character and greatness of soul. I have spoken thus much as
a warning to those who take upon themselves to rule over
others, that they may not imagine that, when they pillage cities,
the misfortunes of others are an honour to their own country.
The Romans, however, when they transferred these things to

<head>On the Art of Commanding Armies</head>
<p>The chances and accidents that attend military expeditions require great circumspection; and it is possible to
provide for all of them with precision, provided that a man
gives his mind to the conduct of his plan of campaign. Now
that fewer operations in war are carried out openly and by
mere force, than by stratagem and the skilful use of opportunity, any one that chooses may readily learn from the history
of the past. And again that operations depending on the
choice of opportunity oftener fail than succeed is easily proved
from experience. Nor can there be any doubt that the greater
part of such failures are due to the folly or carelessness of the
leaders. It is time therefore to inquire into the rules of this
art of strategy.</p>
<p>Such things as occur in campaigns without having been
calculated upon in any way we must not speak of as operations,
but as accidents or casualties. It is the conduct of a campaign in accordance with an exact plan that I am to set forth:
omitting all such things as do not fall under a scientfic rule,
and have no fixed design.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c13" type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Scientific Strategy</head>
<p>Every operation requires a time fixed for its commencement, a period and place for its execution,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The points of inherent importance in the conduct of a campaign,&mdash;time, place, secrecy, code of signals, agents, and method.</note>
secrecy, definite signals, persons by whom and
with whom it is to be executed, and a settled plan
for conducting it. It is evident that the man
who has rightly provided for each of these details
will not fail in the ultimate result, while he who
has neglected any single one of them will fail in
the whole. Such is the order of nature, that one insignificant
<pb n="575"/>
circumstance will suffice for failure, while for success rigid
perfection of every detail is barely enough.</p>
<p>Leaders then should neglect no single point in conducting
such expeditions.</p>
<p>Now the head and front of such precautions is silence; and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Things necessary. 1. Silence.</note>
not to allow either joy at the appearance of an
unexpected hope, or fear, or familiarity, or
natural affection, to induce a man to communicate his plans to any one unconcerned, but to impart it
to those and those alone without whom it is impossible to
complete his plan; and not even to them a moment sooner
than necessary, but only when the exigencies of the particular
service make it inevitable. It is necessary, moreover, not only
to be silent with the tongue, but much more so in the mind.
For it has happened to many generals before now, while
preserving an inviolable silence, to betray their thoughts
either by the expression of their countenances or by their
actions.</p>
<p>The second requisite is to know accurately the conditions<note anchored="yes" place="marg">2. Knowledge of the capabilities of the force in moving.</note>
under which marches by day or night may be
performed, and the distances to which they can
extend; and not only marches on land, but also
voyages by sea.</p>
<p>The third and most important is to have some knowledge
of the seasons, and to be able to adapt the design to them.</p>
<p>Nor again is the selection of the ground for the operation
to be regarded as unimportant, since it often happens that it
is this which makes what seems impossible possible, and what
seemed possible impossible.</p>
<p>Finally there must be no neglect of the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">3. Care in concerting signals. 4. Care in selecting men.</note>
subject of signals and counter signals; and the
choice of persons by whom and with whom the
operation is to be carried out.</p></div2>

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">5. Knowledge of localities.</note>
from history, and others by the study of
scientific strategy. It is a most excellent thing
too that the general should have a personal
knowledge both of the roads, and the locality which he has
to reach, and its natural features; as well as of the persons by
<pb n="576"/>
whom and with whom he is to act. If that is not possible, the
next best thing is that he should make careful inquiries and
not trust just any one: and men who undertake to act as
guides to such places should always deposit security with
those whom they are conducting.</p>
<p>These,&mdash;and other points like them, it is perhaps possible<note anchored="yes" place="marg">6. Accurate knowledge of natural
phenomena enabling a general to make accurate calculation of time.</note>
that leaders may learn sufficiently from the mere
study of strategy, whether practical or in books.
But scientific investigation requires scientific
processes and demonstrations, especially in
astronomy and geometry; the working out of
which is not much to our present point, though
their results are important, and may contribute largely to the
success of such undertakings.</p>
<p>The most important operation in astronomy is the calculation of the lengths of the days and nights. If these had been
uniform it would not have been a matter requiring any study,
but the knowledge would have been common to all the world:
since however they not only differ with each other but also
with themselves, it is plainly necessary to be acquainted with
the increase and diminution of both the one and the other.
How can a man calculate a march, and the distance practicable
in a day or in a night, if he is unacquainted with the variation of
these periods of time? In fact nothing can be done up to time
without this knowledge,&mdash;it is inevitable otherwise that a man
should be sometimes too late and sometimes too soon. And
these operations are the only ones in which being too soon is a
worse fault than being too late. For the general who overstays
the proper hour of action only misses his chance, since he can
find out that he has done so before he arrives, and so get off
safely: but he that anticipates the hour is detected when he
comes up; and so not only misses his immediate aim, but runs
a risk of ruining himself altogether.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Mode of Calculating Time</head>
<p>In all human undertakings opportuneness is the most
important thing, but especially in operations of war. Therefore a general must have at his fingers' ends the season of the
summer and winter solstice, the equinoxes, and the periods
between them in which the days and nights increase and
diminish. For it is by this knowledge alone that he can
<pb n="577"/>
compute the distance that can be done whether by sea or
land. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The divisions of the day;</note> Again, he must necessarily understand the subdivisions both of the day and
the night, in order to know at what hour to
order the reveille, or the march out; for the end cannot be
attained unless the beginning be rightly taken. As for the
periods of the day, they may be observed by the shadows or
by the sun's course, and the quarter of the heaven in which
it has arrived, but it is difficult to do the same for the
night, unless a man is familiar with the phenomenon of the twelve signs of the Zodiac,
and their law and order: and this is easy to those who
have studied astronomy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">of the night.</note> For since, though the nights are
unequal in length, at least six of the signs of the Zodiac are
nevertheless above the horizon every night, it is plain that in
the same portions of every night equal portions of the twelve
signs of the Zodiac rise. Now as it is known what portion of
the sphere is occupied by the sun during the day, it is evident
that when he has set the are subtended by the diameter of
his are must rise. Therefore the length of the night is exactly
commensurate with the portion of the Zodiac which appears
above the horizon after sunset. And, given that we know the
number and size of the signs of the Zodiac, the corresponding
divisions of the night are also known. If however the nights
be cloudy, the moon must be watched, since owing to its size
its light as a general rule is always visible, at whatsoever point
in the heaven it may be. The hour may be guessed sometimes by observing the time and place of its rising, or again of
its setting, if you only have sufficient acquaintance with this
phenomenon to be familiar with the daily variation of its rising.
And the law which it too follows admits of being easily
observed; for its revolution is limited by the period of one
month, which serves as a model to which all subsequent
revolutions conform.</p></div2>

<head>Failures Arising From Ignorance</head>
<p>When Aratus, the Strategus of the Achaean league,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aratus fails at Cynaetha.</note>
attempted to take Cynaetha by treachery, he
arranged a day with those in the town who
were co-operating with him, on which he was to arrive on the
banks of the river which flows past Cynaetha, and to remain
there quietly with his forces: while the party inside the town
about midday, when they got an opportunity, were to send
out one of their men quietly, wrapped in a cloak, and order
him to take his stand upon a tomb agreed upon in front of
the city; the rest were to attack the officers who were accustomed to guard the gate while taking their siesta. This being
done, the Achaeans were to rise from their ambush and to
make all haste to occupy the gate. These arrangements
made, and the time having come, Aratus arrived; and having
concealed himself down by the river, waited there for the
signal. But about an hour before noon, a man, whose profession it was to keep a fine kind of sheep near the town,
wishing to ask some business question of the shepherd, came
out of the gate with his cloak on, and standing upon the same
tomb looked round to find the shepherd. Whereupon Aratus,
thinking that the signal had been given, hurried with all his
men as fast as he could towards the gate. But the gate being
hurriedly closed by the guard, owing to no preparations having yet been made by the party in the town, the result was
that Aratus not only failed in his attempt but was the cause
of the worst misfortunes to his partisans. For being thus
detected they were dragged forward and put to death. What
is one to say was the cause of this catastrophe? Surely that
the general arranged only for a single signal, and being then
<pb n="579"/>
quite young had no experience of the accuracy secured by
double signals and counter-signals. On so small a point in
war does the success or failure of an operation turn.</p></div2>

The ladders which he brought were too short

<placeName key="tgn,5002021">Meliteia</placeName> too early, and was neither able to halt, for fear of his
arrival being announced in the city, nor to get back again
without being discovered. Being compelled therefore to continue his advance, he arrived at the city while the inhabitants
were still awake. Consequently he could neither carry the
wall by an escalade, because of the insufficient length of the
ladders; nor enter by the gate, because it was too early for his
partisans inside to help him. Finally, he did nothing but
irritate the people of the town; and, after losing a considerable
number of his own men, retired unsuccessful and covered with
disgrace; having only given a warning to the rest of the
world to distrust him and be on their guard against him.</p></div2>

<p>Such then are examples of the necessity of studying celestial<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The method of judging of the length necessary for scaling ladders.</note>
phenomena. But as for securing the proper
length of scaling ladders, the following is the
method of making the calculation. Suppose
the height of the wall to be given by one of the
conspirators within, the measurement required
for the ladders is evident; for example, if the height of the
wall is ten feet or any other unit, the ladders must be full
twelve; and the interval between the wall and the foot of the
ladder must be half the length of the ladder, that the ladders
may not break under the weight of those mounting if they
are set farther away, nor be too steep to be safe if set nearer
the perpendicular. But supposing it not to be possible to
measure or get near the wall: the height of any object which
rises perpendicularly on its base can be taken by those who
choose to study mathematics.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c20" type="chapter" n="20">
<head>Need of Some Knowledge of Mathematics</head>
<p>Once more, therefore, those who wish to succeed in
military projects and operations must have studied geometry,
not with professional completeness, but far enough to have a
comprehension of proportion and equations. For it is not
only in such cases that these are necessary, but also for raising
the scale of the divisions of a camp. For sometimes the
problem is to change the entire form of the camp, and yet to
keep the same proportion between all the parts included: at
<pb n="581"/>
other times to keep the same shape in the parts, and to increase
or diminish the whole area on which the camp stands, adding
or subtracting from all proportionally. On which point I
have already spoken in more elaborate detail in my Notes on
Military Tactics. For I do not think that any one will reasonably object to me that I add a great burden to strategy, in
urging on those who endeavour to acquire it the study of
astronomy and geometry: for, while rather rejecting all that
is superfluous in these studies, and brought in for show and
talk, as well as all idea of enjoining their prosecution beyond
the point of practical utility, I am most earnest and eager for
so much as is barely necessary. For it would be strange if
those who aim at the sciences of dancing and flute-playing
should study the preparatory sciences of rhythms and music,
(and the like might be said of the pursuits of the palaestra),
from the belief that the final attainment of each of these
sciences requires the assistance of the latter; while the students
of strategy are to feel aggrieved if they find that they require
subsidiary sciences up to a certain point. That would mean
that men practising common and inferior arts are more diligent
and energetic than those who resolve to excel in the best
and most dignified subject; which no man of sense would admit. . . .</p></div2>

length of the circumference [of towns or

to say that a city or camp may have a circuit of forty stades
and yet be double the size of one having a perimeter of a
hundred, the statement would utterly puzzle them. The
reason of this is that we do not remember the lessons in
geometry taught us at school. I was led to make these
remarks because it is not only common people, but actually

some statesmen and military commanders, who have puzzled

that <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> should be bigger, and that too by a great deal,
than <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, while having a shorter circuit; and at other

is also made in pronouncing as to the number of the inhabitants of cities. For most people imagine that cities in which
the ground is broken and hilly contain more houses than a
flat site. But the fact is not so; because houses are built at
right angles not to sloping foundations but to the plains below,
upon which the hills themselves are excrescences. And this
admits of a proof within the intelligence of a child. For if
one would imagine houses on slopes to be raised until they
were of the same height; it is evident that the plane of the
roofs of the houses thus united will be equal and parallel
to the plane underlying the hills and foundations.</p>

<head>Estimate of Hannibal</head>
<p>Of all that befell the Romans and Carthaginians, good
or bad, the cause was one man and one mind,&mdash;Hannibal.
<pb n="583"/>
For it is notorious that he managed the Italian campaigns in
person, and the Spanish by the agency of the elder of his
brothers, Hasdrubal, and subsequently by that of Mago, the
leaders who killed the two Roman generals in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> about the
same time. Again, he conducted the Sicilian campaign at
first through Hippocrates and afterwards through Myttonus<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Liv. 25.40">Livy, 25, 40</bibl>, calls him Mutines.</note>
the Libyan. So also in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and Illyria: and, by brandishing before their faces the dangers arising from these latter
places, he was enabled to distract the attention of the Romans,
thanks to his understanding with Philip. So great and wonderful is the influence of a Man, and a mind duly fitted by
original constitution for any undertaking within the reach of
human powers.</p>
<p>But since the position of affairs has brought us to an
inquiry into the genius of Hannibal, the occasion seems to
me to demand that I should explain in regard to him the
peculiarities of his character which have been especially the
subject of controversy. Some regard him as having been
extraordinarily cruel, some exceedingly grasping of money.
But to speak the truth of him, or of any person engaged in
public affairs, is not easy. Some maintain that men's real
natures are brought out by their circumstances, and that they
are detected when in office, or as some say when
in misfortunes, though they have up to that time
completely maintained their secrecy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><foreign lang="greek">a)rxh\ a)/ndra dei/cei.</foreign> Bias,

contrary, do not regard this as a sound dictum. For I think
that men in these circumstances are compelled, not only
occasionally but frequently, either by the suggestions of friends
or the complexity of affairs, to speak and act contrary to their
real principles.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Examples of Actions Contrary to Principles</head>
<p>And there are many proofs of this to be found in past
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Examples to the contrary. 1. Agathocles.</note>
history if any one will give the necessary
attention. Is it not universally stated by
the historians that Agathocles, tyrant of
<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, after having the reputation of extreme cruelty in his
original measures for the establishment of his dynasty, when
he had once become convinced that his power over the
Siceliots was firmly established, is considered to have become
<pb n="584"/>
the most humane and mild of rulers? Again, was not
Cleomenes of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> a most excellent king, a
most cruel tyrant, and then again as a private
individual most obliging and benevolent? And yet it is not
reasonable to suppose the most opposite dispositions to exist
in the same nature. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">2. Cleomenes.</note> They are compelled to change with the
changes of circumstances: and so some rulers often display to
the world a disposition as opposite as possible to their true
nature. Therefore the natures of men not only are not brought
out by such things, but on the contrary are rather obscured.
The same effect is produced also not only in commanders,
despots, and kings, but in states also, by the suggestions of
friends. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">3. <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> For instance, you will find the

<head>Estimate of Hannibal</head>
<p>The case of Hannibal seems to me to be on a par
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal mastered by circumstances.</note>
with these. His circumstances were so extraordinary and shifting, his closest friends
so widely different, that it is exceedingly
difficult to estimate his character from his proceedings
in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. What those circumstances suggested to him may
easily be understood from what I have already said, and what
is immediately to follow; but it is not right to omit the
suggestions made by his friends either, especially as this
matter may be rendered sufficiently clear by one instance of
the advice offered him. At the time that Hannibal was
meditating the march from <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> with his army,
he was confronted with the extreme difficulty of providing
food and securing provisions, both because the journey
<pb n="585"/>
was thought to be of insuperable length, and because the
barbarians that lived in the intervening country were so
numerous and savage. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">His cruelty.</note> It appears that at that time this
difficulty frequently came on for discussion at
the council; and that one of his friends, called
Hannibal Monomachus, gave it as his opinion that there was
one and only one way by which it was possible to get as far as
<placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Upon Hannibal bidding him speak out, he said that
they must teach the army to eat human flesh, and make them
accustomed to it. Hannibal could say nothing against the
boldness and effectiveness of the idea, but was unable to persuade himself or his friends to entertain it. It is this man's
acts in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> that they say were attributed to Hannibal, to
maintain the accusation of cruelty, as well as such as were the
result of circumstances.</p></div2>

the Carthaginians themselves; for natives know best not
only which way the wind lies, as the proverb has it, but
the characters also of their fellow-countrymen. But I
heard a still more detailed story from Massanissa, who
maintained the charge of money-loving against all Carthaginians generally, but especially against Hannibal and Mago
called the Samnite. Among other stories, he told me that
these two men had arranged a most generous subdivision of
operations between each other from their earliest youth; and
though they had each taken a very large number of cities in
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by force or fraud, they had never taken part in
the same operation together; but had always schemed against
each other, more than against the enemy, in order to prevent
the one being with the other at the taking of a city: that they
might neither quarrel in consequence of things of this sort,
nor have to divide the profit on the ground of their equality
of rank.</p></div2>

the other cities naturally became restless,
and began to look round for opportunities and pretexts for revolting back again to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. It
was then that Hannibal seems to have been at his lowest
point of distress and despair. For neither was he able to
keep a watch upon all the cities so widely removed from each
other,&mdash;while he remained entrenched at one spot, and the
enemy were man&oelig;uvering against him with several armies,&mdash;
nor could he divide his force into many parts; for he would
have put an easy victory into the hands of the enemy by
becoming inferior to them in numbers, and finding it impossible to be personally present at all points. Wherefore he was
obliged to completely abandon some of the cities, and withdraw his garrisons from others: being afraid lest, in the course
of the revolutions which might occur, he should lose his own
soldiers as well. Some cities again he made up his mind to
treat with treacherous violence, removing their inhabitants to
other cities, and giving their property up to plunder; in
consequence of which many were enraged with him, and
accused him of impiety or cruelty. For the fact was that
these movements were accompanied by robberies of money,
murders, and violence, on various pretexts at the hands of the
outgoing or incoming soldiers in the cities, because they
always supposed that the inhabitants that were left behind
were on the verge of turning over to the enemy. It is, therefore, very difficult to express an opinion on the natural
character of Hannibal, owing to the influence exercised on it
by the counsel of friends and the force of circumstances. The

Who again is ignorant of the deeds of Cassander, Demetrius,
and Antigonus Gonatas? For owing to their recency the
knowledge of them still remains distinct. Some of them by
introducing garrisons, and others by implanting despots in the
cities, effectually secured that every state should share the
infamous brand of slavery. But passing by all these I will
now come to the last Antigonus,<note anchored="yes">Antigonus Doson.</note> lest any of you, viewing his
policy unsuspiciously, should consider that you are under an
obligation to the Macedonians. For it was with no purpose
of saving the Achaeans that he undertook the war against
you, nor from any dislike of the tyranny of Cleomenes inducing him to free the Lacedaemonians. If any man among you
holds this opinion, he must be simple indeed. No! It was
because he saw that his own power would not be secure if
you got the rule of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>; and because he saw that
Cleomenes was of a nature well calculated to secure this
object, and that fortune was splendidly seconding your efforts,
that he came in a tumult of fear and jealousy, not to help
Peloponnesians, but to destroy your hopes and abase your
<pb n="590"/>
power. Therefore you do not owe the Macedonians so much
gratitude for not destroying your city when they had taken it,
as hostility and hatred, for having more than once already
stood in your way, when you were strong enough to grasp the
supremacy of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</p></div2>

<head>Impiety of Philip</head>
<p>"Again, what need to speak more on the wickedness of

Philip? For of his impiety towards the gods
his outrages on the temples at Thermus are a
sufficient proof; and of his cruelty towards man, his perfidy
and treachery to the Messenians.</p>
<p>"So much for the past. But as to the present resolution
before you, it is in a way necessary to draft it, and vote on it,
as though you were deciding on war, and yet in real truth not
to regard it as a war. For it is impossible for the Achaeans,
beaten as they are, to damage your territory: but I imagine
that they will be only too thankful to heaven if they can but
protect their own, when they find themselves surrounded by
war with Eleans and Messenians as allied to us, and with ourselves at the same time. And Philip, I am persuaded, will
soon desist from his attack, when involved in a war by land
with Aetolians, and by sea with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and King Attalus.
The future may be easily conjectured from the past. For if
he always failed to subdue Aetolians when they were his only

<div2 id="b9c31" type="chapter" n="31">
<head>Conclusion of the Speech</head>
<p>"I have said thus much with the deliberate purpose of
showing you that you are not hampered by previous engagements, but are entirely free in your deliberations as to which
you ought to join&mdash;Aetolians or Macedonians. If you are
under an earlier engagement, and have already made up your
minds on these points, what room is there for further argument? For if you had made the alliance now existing
between yourselves and us, previous to the good services done
you by Antigonus, there might perhaps have been some
reason for questioning whether it were right to neglect an old
treaty in gratitude for recent favours. But since it was
subsequent to this much vaunted freedom and security given
you by Antigonus, and with which they are perpetually
taunting you, that, after deliberation and frequent consideration
<pb n="591"/>  as to which of the two you ought to join, you decided
to combine with us Aetolians; and have actually exchanged
pledges of fidelity with us, and have fought by our side in the
late war against <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, how can any one entertain a
doubt on the subject any longer? For the obligations of
kindness between you and Antigonus and Philip were
cancelled then. It now remains for you to point out some
subsequent wrong done you by Aetolians, or subsequent
favour by Macedonians: or if neither of these exist, on what
grounds are you now, at the instance of the very men to whom
you justly refused to listen formerly, when no obligation
existed, about to undo treaties and oaths&mdash;the strongest
bonds of fidelity existing among mankind."</p>
<p>Such was the conclusion of what was considered a very
cogent speech by Chlaeneas.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c32" type="chapter" n="32">
<head>Lyciscus Replies To Chlaeneas</head>
<p>After him the ambassador of the Acarnanians, Lyciscus,
came forward: and at first he paused, seeing the multitude
talking to each other about the last speech; but when at last
silence was obtained, he began his speech as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I and my colleagues, men of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, have been sent to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Lyciscus,
envoy from <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, which country was to fall to the Aetolians by the proposed new treaty. See <bibl n="Liv. 26.24">Livy, 26, 24</bibl>.</note>
you by the common league of the Acarnanians;
and as we have always shared in the same
prospects as the Macedonians, we consider
that this mission also is common to us and
them. For just as on the field of war, owing to
the superiority and magnitude of the Macedonian, force, our safety is involved in their
valour; so, in the controversies of diplomacy,
our interests are inseparable from the rights of the Macedonians.
Now Chlaeneas in the peroration of his address gave a
summary of the obligations existing between the Aetolians and
yourselves. For he said, If subsequent to your making the
alliance with them any fresh injury or offence had been committed by Aetolians, or any kindness done by Macedonians,
the present proposal ought properly to be discussed as a fresh
start; but that if, nothing of the sort having taken place, we
believe that by quoting the services of Antigonus, and your
former decrees, we shall be able to annul existing oaths and
treaties, we are the greatest simpletons in the world.' To this
<pb n="592"/>
I reply by acknowledging that I must indeed be the most
foolish of men, and that the arguments I am about to put
forward are indeed futile, if, as he maintains, nothing fresh has
happened, and Greek affairs are in precisely the same position
as before. But if exactly the reverse be the case, as I shall
clearly prove in the course of my speech,&mdash;then I imagine that
I shall be shown to give you some salutary advice, and Chlaeneas
to be quite in the wrong. We are come, then, expressly
because we are convinced that it is needful for us to speak on
this very point: namely, to point out to you that it is at once
your duty and your interest, after hearing of the evils threatening <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, to adopt if possible a policy excellent and worthy of
yourselves by uniting your prospects with ours; or if that cannot
be, at least to abstain from this movement for the present.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>Defence of Macedonian Policy</head>
<p>"But since the last speaker has ventured to go back to
ancient times for his denunciations of the Macedonian royal
family, I feel it incumbent on me also to say a few words first
on these points, to remove the misconception of those who have
been carried away by his words.</p>
<p>"Chlaeneas said, then, that Philip son of Amyntas became<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Sacred war, B. C. <dateRange from="-357" to="-346">357</dateRange>-346. Onomarchus

master of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> by the ruin of <placeName key="perseus,Olynthus">Olynthus</placeName>. But I conceive
that not only the Thessalians, but the other Greeks also, were
preserved by Philip's means. For at the time
when Onomarchus and Philomelus, in defiance
of religion and law, seized <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and made
themselves masters of the treasury of the god,
who is there among you who does not know
that they collected such a mighty force as no
Greek dared any longer face? Nay, along with
this violation of religion, they were within an ace of becoming
lords of all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> also. At that crisis Philip volunteered his
assistance; destroyed the tyrants, secured the temple, and
became the author of freedom to the Greeks, as is testified
even to posterity by the facts. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip elected generalissimo against <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> in the congress of allies at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, B. C. <date value="-338">338</date>.</note> For Philip
was unanimously elected general-in-chief by

to assert, as one who had wronged <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>;
but on the ground of his being a benefactor
of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>: an honour which no one had previously obtained.
<pb n="593"/>
'Ay, but,' he says, 'Philip came with an armed force into <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>.' Yes, but it was not of his own choice, as you know: he
reluctantly consented to do so, after repeated invitations and
appeals by the Peloponnesians, under the name of their friend
and ally. And when he did come, pray observe, Chlaeneas,
how he behaved. Though he could have availed himself of
the wishes of the neighbouring states for the destruction of these
men's territory and the humiliation of their city, and have won
much gratitude too by his act, he by no means lent himself to
such a policy; but, by striking terror into the one and the other
alike, he compelled both parties to accommodate their
differences in a congress, to the common benefit of all: not
putting himself forward as arbitrator of the points in dispute,
but appointing a joint board of arbitration selected from all
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. Is that a proceeding which deserves to be held up to
reproach and execration?</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c34" type="chapter" n="34">

<p>"Again, you bitterly denounced Alexander, because,

when he believed himself to be wronged, he
punished <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>: but of his having exacted

<p>"As for Alexander's successors how had you the audacity<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Diadochi.</note>

But to <emph>you</emph> Aetolians it is in no circumstance open to do so,&mdash;

of <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>? Was it not you? What nation ever sent out

any of these acts, you talk pompously about
your having resisted the invasion of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>

to be grateful to you. But if for this one service some gratitude is owing to the Aetolians; what high honour do the
Macedonians deserve, who throughout nearly their whole
lives are ceaselessly engaged in a struggle with the barbarians
for the safety of the Greeks? For that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> would have
been continually involved in great dangers, if we had not had
the Macedonians and the ambition of their kings as a barrier,
who is ignorant? And there is a very striking
proof of this. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Defeat and death of Ptolemy Ceraunus in the battle

their victory over Ptolemy Ceraunus, than,
thinking the rest of no account, Brennus
promptly marched into the middle of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.
And this would often have happened if the
Macedonians had not been on our frontiers.</p>
<p>"However, though I have much that I could say on the past,
I think this is enough. Of all the actions of Philip, they have
selected his destruction of the temple, to fasten the charge of
impiety upon him. They did not add a word about their own
outrage and crime, which they perpetrated in regard to the
temples in Dium, and <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>, and the sacred enclosures of
the gods. The speaker should have mentioned this first.
But anything you Aetolians have suffered you recount to these
gentlemen with exaggeration: but the things you have inflicted
<pb n="595"/>
unprovoked, though many times as numerous as the others,
you pass over in silence; because you know full well that everybody lays the blame of acts of injustice and mischief on those

<head><placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> Should Have Allied Herself with the Macedonians</head>
<p>"Of Antigonus I will only make mention so far, as to
avoid appearing to despise what was done, or to treat as
unimportant so great an undertaking. For my part I think
that history does not contain the record of a more admirable
service than that which Antigonus performed for you: indeed
it appears to me to be unsurpassable. And the following facts
will show this. Antigonus went to war with you and conquered
you in a pitched battle. By force of arms he became master
of your territory and city at once. He might have exercised
all the rights of war upon you: but he was so far from
inflicting any hardships upon you, that, besides other benefits,
he expelled your tyrant and restored your laws and ancestral
constitution. In return for which, in the national assemblies,
calling the Greeks to witness your words, you proclaimed
Antigonus your benefactor and preserver.</p>
<p>"What then ought to have been your policy? I will speak
what I really think, gentlemen of Sparta: and you will I am sure
bear with me. For I shall do this now from no wish to go out
of my way to bring railing accusations against you, but under
the pressure of circumstances, and for the common good. What
then am I to say? This: that both in the late war you ought to
have allied yourselves not with Aetolians but with Macedonians;
and now again, in answer to these invitations, you ought to join
Philip rather than the former people. But, it may be objected,
you will be breaking a treaty. Which will be the graver
breach of right on your part,&mdash;to neglect a private arrangement
made with Aetolians, or one that has been inscribed on a
column and solemnly consecrated in the sight of all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>?
On what ground are you so careful of breaking faith with this
people, from whom you have never received any favour, while
you pay no heed to Philip and the Macedonians, to whom
you owe even the very power of deliberating to-day? Do you
regard it as a duty to keep faith with friends? Yet it is not
so much a point of conscience to confirm written pledges of
faith, as it is a violation of conscience to go to war with those
<pb n="596"/>
who preserved you: and this is what, in the present instance,
the Aetolians are come to demand of you.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b9c37" type="chapter" n="37">
<head>A Mightly Cloud is Coming From the West</head>
<p>"Let it, however, be granted that what I have now said
may in the eyes of severe critics be regarded as beside the
subject. I will now return to the main point at issue, as they
state it. It was this: 'If the circumstances are the same now
as at the time when you made alliance with the Aetolians, then
your policy ought to remain on the same lines.' That was
their first proposition. 'But if they have been entirely changed,
then it is fair that you should now deliberate on the demands
made to you as on a matter entirely new and unprejudiced.'
I ask you therefore, Cleonicus and Chlaeneas, who were your
allies on the former occasion when you invited this people to
join you? Were they not all the Greeks? But with whom
are you now united, or to what kind of federation are
you now inviting this people? Is it not to one with the
foreigner? A mighty similarity exists, no doubt, in your
minds, and no diversity at all! <emph>Then</emph> you were contending for
glory and supremacy with Achaeans and Macedonians, men of
kindred blood with yourselves, and with Philip their leader;
<emph>now</emph> a war of slavery is threatening <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> against men of
another race, whom you think to bring against Philip, but
have really unconsciously brought against yourselves and all
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. For just as men in the stress of war, by introducing into their cities garrisons superior in strength to their own
forces, while successfully repelling all danger from the enemy,
put themselves at the mercy of their friends,&mdash;just so are the
Aetolians acting in the present case. For in their desire to
conquer Philip and humble <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, they have unconsciously brought such a mighty cloud from the west, as for the
present perhaps will overshadow <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> first, but which in

and support from the Illyrians, they at once set about acts of
piracy at sea, and treacherously seized Pylus; while by land
they stormed the city of Cleitor, and sold the Cynethans into
slavery. Once before they made a treaty with Antigonus, as I

to them diggers' sheds and rams; and opposite the space between the towers he erected
a covered way between the rams, parallel
to the wall. And when the plan was complete, the appearance of the works was very
like the style of the wall. For the superstructures on the pent-houses had the appearance and style of towers, owing to the placing
of the wattles side by side; and the space
between looked like a wall, because the row of
wattles at the top of the covered way were divided into battlements by the fashion in which they were woven. In the
lowest division of these besieging towers the diggers employed
in levelling inequalities, to allow the stands of the batteringrams to be brought up, kept throwing on earth, and the ram
was propelled forward: in the second story were water vessels
and other appliances for quenching fires, and along with them
the catapults: and on the third a considerable body of men
were placed to fight with all who tried to damage the rams;
and they were on a level with the city towers. From the
covered way between the besieging towers a double trench
was to be dug towards the wall, between the city towers.
There were also three batteries for stone-throwing machines,
one of which carried stones of a talent weight, and the other
two half that weight. From the camp to the pent-houses and
diggers' sheds underground tunnels had been constructed,
to prevent men, going to the works from the camp or returning from the works, being wounded in any way by missiles

a harsh answer, saying, that "When they were

to have sent ambassadors to their betters to ask for mercy,
not now when they were slaves. A little while ago they had
not thought an ambassador from him worthy of even a word;

in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, and in fact all the achievements in
his life, I think it necessary to direct my
readers' attention, to begin with, to his moral
and mental qualities. For as he is perhaps the most illustrious man of any born
before the present generation, everybody seeks to know what kind of man he was, and what
advantages from natural ability or experience he enjoyed, to
account for a career so crowded with brilliant achievement;
and yet is compelled to remain in the dark, or to entertain false
opinions, because those who write about him have not kept to
the truth. The soundness of this assertion will be rendered
evident in the course of my narrative to all who are capable of
estimating the noblest and most gallant of his exploits. Now
all other writers represent him as a man favoured by fortune,
who succeeded in his undertakings contrary to rational expectation, and by the mere force of circumstances. They
consider apparently such men to be, so to speak, more godlike and worthy of admiration, than those who act in every
case by calculation. They do not seem to be aware of the
distinction between credit for good fortune and credit for
good conduct in the case of such men; and that the former
may be assigned to any one however commonplace, while the
latter belongs to those alone who act from prudent calculation
and clear intelligence: and it is these last whom we should
look upon as the most god-like and god-beloved.</p>
<p>Now it seems to me that in his character and views
<pb n="3"/>
Publius was very like Lycurgus the legislator of the Lacedaemonians.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's use of religion compared with that of Lycurgus.</note> For we must not suppose that it
was from superstition that Lycurgus continually consulted the Pythian priestess in the

words for his success in securing empire for his country. But
as both saw that the majority of mankind cannot be got to
accept contentedly what is new and strange, nor to face dangers
with courage, without some hope of divine favour,&mdash;Lycurgus,
by always supporting his own schemes by an oracular response
from the Pythia, secured better acceptation and credit for his
ideas; and Publius, by always in like manner instilling into
the minds of the vulgar an opinion of his acting on some
divine suggestion in the formation of his designs, caused
those under his command to confront dangerous services with
greater courage and cheerfulness. But that he invariably
acted on calculation and with foresight, and that the successful
issue of his plans was always in harmony with rational expectation, will be evident by what I am about to relate.</p></div2>

no one will admit, except those who have
lived with him, and contemplated his character, so to speak,
in broad daylight. Of such Gaius Laelius was one. He
took part in everything he did or said from boyhood to the
day of his death; and he it was who convinced me of this
truth: because what he said appeared to me to be likely in
in itself, and in harmony with the achievements of that great
man. He told me that the first brilliant exploit of Publius
was when his father fought the cavalry engagement with
Hannibal near the <placeName key="tgn,7010018">Padus</placeName>. He was then, as it seems, eighteen
years old and on his first campaign. His father had given
him a squadron of picked cavalry for his protection; but when
in the course of the battle he saw his father surrounded by
the enemy, with only two or three horsemen near him, and
dangerously wounded, he first tried to cheer on his own
squadron to go to his father's assistance, but when he found
<pb n="4"/>
them considerably cowed by the numbers of the enemy
surrounding them, he appears to have plunged by himself
with reckless courage into the midst of the enemy: whereupon,
his comrades being forced to charge also, the enemy were
everawed<note anchored="yes" resp="fww">line 5: "everawed" should read "overawed".</note> and divided their ranks to let them pass; and
Publius the elder, being thus unexpectedly saved, was the first
to address his son as his preserver in the hearing of the whole
army.<note anchored="yes">See on <ref target="b3c66" targOrder="U">3, 66</ref>.</note> Having gained an acknowledged reputation for bravery
by this exploit, he ever afterwards freely exposed himself

candidate for the Aedileship, which is about the most honourable office open to a "young" man at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>: it being the
custom for two patricians to be appointed, and there being
many candidates, for some time he did not venture to stand

day of election drew near, judging from the
demeanour of the people that his brother would<note anchored="yes" resp="fww">line 20: "his brother would" should read "his brother would not".</note>
easily obtain the office, and observing that his own popularity
with the multitude was very great, he made up his mind that the
only hope of his brother's success was that they should combine
their candidatures. He therefore resolved to act as follows:
His mother was going round to the temples and sacrificing
to the gods in behalf of his brother, and was altogether in a
state of eager expectation as to the result. She was the only
parent whose wishes he had to consult; for his father was
then on his voyage to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, having been appointed to command
in the war there. He therefore said to her that he had seen
the same dream twice: for he thought that he was coming home
from the Forum after being elected Aedile with his brother,
and that she met them at the door and threw her arms round
them and kissed them. His mother with true womanly feeling
exclaimed, "Oh, that I might see that day!" He replied, "Do
you wish us to try"? Upon her assenting, under the idea
that he would not venture, but was only jesting on the spur
of the moment (for of course he was quite a young man), he
<pb n="5"/>
begged her to prepare him at once a white toga, such as it is
the custom for candidates for office to wear.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Publius and Lucius Become Aediles</head>
<p>His mother thought no more about it: but Publius,
having obtained a white toga, went to the Forum before his
mother was awake. His boldness, as well as his previous
popularity, secured him a brilliant reception from the people;
and when he advanced to the spot assigned for candidates, and
took his place by the side of his brother, the people not only
invested him with the office, but his brother also for his sake;
and both brothers returned home Aediles designate. The
news having been suddenly brought to their mother, she
rushed in the utmost delight to meet them at the door, and
kissed the young men in an ecstasy of joy. Accordingly
Publius was believed by all who had heard previously about
his dream to have held commune with the gods, not merely in
his sleep, but rather in a waking vision, and by day. But in
point of fact there was no dream at all: Scipio was kind,
open-handed, and courteous, and by these means had conciliated the favour of the multitude. But by a dexterous use
of the occasion, both with the people and his mother, he
obtained his purpose, and moreover got the reputation of
acting under divine inspiration. For those persons, who, from
dulness or want of experience, or idleness, can never take a
clear view of the occasions or causes or connexion of events,
are apt to give the gods and chance the credit for what is
really effected by sagacity and far-seeing calculation. I have
thought it worth while to say thus much, that my readers may
not be misled by unfounded gossip to pass over this great
man's finest and most splendid qualities, I mean his wealth of
resource and untiring diligence; which will become still more
apparent when we come to recount his actual achievements.</p></div2>

exhorted them not to be dismayed by the
disaster which had befallen them. "For," said
he, "Romans have never been beaten by Carthaginians in a trial of valour. It was the result
of treachery on the part of the Celtiberians, and of rashness, the two commanders getting cut off from each other
owing to their trust in the alliance of these men. But now
<pb n="6"/>
these two disadvantages are on the side of the enemy: for they
are encamped at a wide distance from each other; and by
their tyrannical conduct to their allies have alienated them all,
and made them hostile to themselves. The consequence is
that some of them are already sending messages to us; while
the rest, as soon as they dare, and see that we have crossed
the river, will gladly join us; not so much because they have
any affection for us, as because they are eager to punish the
outrages of the Carthaginians. Most important of all is
the fact that the enemy are at variance with each other, and
will refuse to fight against us in a body, and by thus engaging
in detail will be more easily dealt with by us." Looking to
these facts, therefore, he bade them cross the river with confidence, and undertook that he and the other officers would
see to the next step to be taken.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio crosses the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Ebro</placeName>, and swoops down upon New Carthage.</note> With these words he left
his colleague, Marcus Silanus, with five hundred horse to
guard the ford, and to protect the allies on the
north of the river, while he himself began taking
his army across, without revealing his design
to any one. As a matter of fact he had resolved
to do nothing of what he gave out publicly, and had made
up his mind to make a rapid attack upon the town called
Iberian Carthage. This may be looked upon as the first
and strongest proof of the judgment which I lately passed
upon him. He was now only in his twenty-seventh year: and
yet he, in the first place, undertook to accomplish what the
magnitude of the previous disasters had made the world look
upon as completely hopeless; and, in the second place, having
undertaken it, he left on one side the plain and obvious course,
and conceived and carried out a plan which was a surprise to
the enemy himself. This could only be the result of the
closest calculation.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>He Determines To Attack Carthagena</head>
<p>The fact is that he had made minute inquiries, before
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's careful inquiries as to the state of things in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>.</note>
leaving <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, both about the treason of the Celtiberians, and
the separation of the two Roman armies; and
had inferred that his father's disaster was
entirely attributable to these. He had not therefore shared the popular terror
of the Carthaginians, nor allowed himself to be overcome by the general panic.
<pb n="7"/>
And when he subsequently heard that the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>
north of the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Ebro</placeName> were remaining loyal, while the Carthaginian
commanders were quarrelling with each other, and maltreating
the natives subject to them, he began to feel very cheerful
about his expedition, not from a blind confidence in Fortune,
but from deliberate calculation. Accordingly, when he arrived
in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, he learnt, by questioning everybody and making
inquiries about the enemy from every one, that the forces of
the Carthaginians were divided into three. Mago, he was informed, was lingering west of the pillars of Hercules among
the Conii; Hasdrubal, the son of Gesco, in <placeName key="tgn,1000090">Lusitania</placeName>, near the
mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7016546">Tagus</placeName>; while the other Hasdrubal was besieging
a certain city of the Caspetani; and none of the three were less
than ten days' march from the <placeName key="tgn,7013527">New Town</placeName>. Now he calculated that, if he decided to give the enemy battle, it would
be risking too much to do so against all three at once, because his predecessors had been beaten, and because the enemy
would vastly out-number him; if, on the other hand, he were to
march rapidly to engage one of the three, and should then find
himself surrounded&mdash;which might happen by the one attacked
retreating, and the others coming up to his relief,&mdash;he dreaded
a disaster like that of his uncle Gnaeus and his father
Publius.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Why New Carthage is a Desirable Target</head>
<p>He therefore rejected that idea altogether: but being
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">He determines to attempt New Carthage.</note>
informed that New Carthage was the most important source of supplies to the enemy and
of damage to the Romans in the present war, he
had taken the trouble to make minute inquiries about it during
the winter from those who were well informed. He learnt
that it was nearly the only town in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> which possessed a
harbour suitable for a fleet and naval force; that it lay
very conveniently for the Carthaginians to make the sea
passage from <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>; that they in fact had the bulk of their
money and war material in it, as well as their hostages from
the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>; that, most important of all, the number of fighting men garrisoning the citadel only amounted
to a thousand,&mdash;because no one would ever suppose that,
while the Carthaginians commanded nearly the whole of
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, any one would conceive the idea of assaulting this
<pb n="8"/>
town; that the other inhabitants were exceedingly numerous,
but all consisted of craftsmen, mechanics, and fisher-folk, as
far as possible removed from any knowledge of warfare. All
this he regarded as being fatal to the town, in case of the
sudden appearance of an enemy. Nor did he moreover fail
to acquaint himself with the topography of <placeName key="tgn,7014631">New Carthage</placeName>, or
the nature of its defences, or the lie of the lagoon: but by
means of certain fishermen who had worked there he had
ascertained that the lagoon was quite shallow and fordable at
most points; and that, generally speaking, the water ebbed
every day towards evening sufficiently to secure this. These
considerations convinced him that, if he could accomplish his
purpose, he would not only damage his opponents, but gain a
considerable advantage for himself; and that, if on the other
hand he failed in effecting it, he would yet be able to secure
the safety of his men owing to his command of the sea, provided he had once made his camp secure,&mdash;and this was easy,
because of the wide dispersion of the enemy's forces. He
had therefore, during his residence in winter quarters, devoted
himself to preparing for this operation to the exclusion of
every other: and in spite of the magnitude of the idea which
he had conceived, and in spite of his youth, he concealed it
from all except Gaius Laelius, until he had himself decided to
reveal it.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c9" type="chapter" n="9">
<head>Laelius and Scipio Proceed to <placeName key="tgn,7014631">New Carthage</placeName></head>
<p>But although historians agree in attributing these calculations to him; yet, when they come to narrate their issue,
they somehow or another attribute the success obtained not
to the man and his foresight, but to the gods and to Fortune,
and that, in spite of all probability, and the evidence of those
who lived with him; and in spite of the fact that Publius

a harbour by the fact that an island<note anchored="yes">Escombrera (<foreign lang="greek">*skombrari/a</foreign>). I must refer
my readers to Mr. Strachan-Davidson's appendix on <title>The Site of the Spanish Carthage</title> for a discussion of

makes the entrance channels on each side of it exceedingly
narrow. It breaks the force of the waves also, and the whole
gulf has thus smooth water, except when south-west winds
setting down the two channels raise a surf: with all other
winds it is perfectly calm, from being so nearly landlocked.
In the recess of the gulf a mountain juts out in the form of a
chersonese, and it is on this mountain that the city stands,
surrounded by the sea on the east and south, and on the
west by a lagoon extending so far northward that the
remaining space to the sea on the other side, to connect it
with the continent, is not more than two stades. The
city itself has a deep depression in its centre, presenting
on its south side a level approach from the sea; while the
rest of it is hemmed in by hills, two of them mountainous
and rough, three others much lower, but rocky and difficult of
ascent; the largest of which lies on the east of the town running
<pb n="10"/>  out into the sea, on which stands a temple of Asclepius.
Exactly opposite this lies the western mountain in a closely-corresponding position, on which a palace had been erected at
great cost, which it is said was built by Hasdrubal when he
was aiming at establishing royal power. The remaining three
lesser elevations bound it on the north, of which the westernmost is called the hill of Hephaestus, the next to it that of
Aletes,&mdash;who is believed to have attained divine honours from
having been the discoverer of the silver mines,&mdash;and the third
is called the hill of Cronus. The lagoon has been connected
with the adjoining sea artificially for the sake of the maritime
folk; and over the channel thus cut between it and the sea a
bridge has been built, for beasts of burden and carts to bring
in provisions from the country.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Scipio Briefs His Troops</head>
<p>Such is the nature of this city's situation. The side
of the Roman camp which faced the city therefore was
secured, without any artificial means, by the lagoon and the
sea. The neck of land lying between these two, and connecting the city with the continent, Scipio did not fence off
with a stockade, although it abutted on the middle of his
camp,&mdash;either for the sake of making an impression upon the
enemy, or by way of suiting the arrangement to his own design,
&mdash;that he might have nothing to hamper the free egress and
return of his troops to and from the camp. The circuit of
the city wall was not more than twenty stades formerly,&mdash;
though I am aware that it has been stated at forty stades;
but this is false, as I know from personal inspection and not
from mere report,&mdash;and in our day it has been still farther
contracted.</p>
<p>The fleet arrived to the hour, and Publius then thought it<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio discloses his intention of assaulting <placeName key="tgn,7014631">New Carthage</placeName>.</note>
time to summon a meeting of his men and to
encourage them to the undertaking by the use
of the same arguments by which he had convinced himself, and which I have just now
detailed. He pointed out to them that the plan was practicable; and briefly summing up the blow which their success
would be to their enemies, and the advantage it would be to
themselves, he ended by promising crowns of gold to those
who first mounted the walls, and the usual rewards to those who
<pb n="11"/>
displayed conspicuous gallantry. And finally he declared that
"Poseidon had appeared to him in his sleep, and originally
suggested his plan to him; and had promised to give him such
signal aid in the actual hour of battle that his assistance should
be made manifest to all." The skilful mixture in this speech
of accurate calculation with promises of gold crowns, and a
reference to Divine Providence, created a great impression and
enthusiasm in the minds of the young soldiers.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>The Attack On Carthagena Begun</head>
<p>Next morning he stationed ships supplied with missiles
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The assault.</note>
of every sort, all along the seaboard, under the command of
Gaius Laelius; and having told off two thousand
of his strongest men to accompany the ladder-carriers, he begun the assault about the third hour. The
commandant of the town, Mago, divided his garrison of a
thousand men into two companies; half he left upon the
citadel, and the rest he stationed upon the eastern hill.
Of the other inhabitants he accoutred about two thousand of
the strongest men with such arms as there were in the city,
and stationed them at the gate leading to the isthmus and
the enemy's camp: the rest he ordered to assist to the best
of their power at all points in the wall. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A sally of the defenders repulsed.</note> As soon as the
bugles of Publius sounded the moment of the
assault, Mago caused those whom he had
armed to sally from the gate, feeling confident that he should create a panic among the assailants
and entirely baffle their design. These men vigorously attacked those of the Roman army who were drawn up opposite
the isthmus, and a sharp engagement took place accompanied
by loud cries of encouragement on both sides: the Romans in
the camp cheering on their men, and the people in the city
theirs. But the contest was an unequal one in the respect of
the facility of bringing up reserves. The Carthaginians had all
to come out by one gate, and had nearly two stades to
march before they got on the ground; whereas the Romans
had their supports close at hand and able to come out over a
wide area; for Publius had purposely stationed his men close
to the camp in order to induce the enemy to come out as far
as possible: being quite aware that if he succeeded in destroying these, who were so to speak the sharp edge of the urban
<pb n="12"/>
population, universal consternation would be the result, and
no more of those in the town would have the
courage to come out of the gate.  The contest however for a certain time was undecided,
for it was between picked men on both sides; but finally the Carthaginians
were overpowered by the superior weight of their opponents,
owing to the constant reinforcements from the camp, and
turned to flight. A large number of them fell in the actual
engagement, and during the retreat; but the greater number
were trampled to death by each other as they crowded through
the gate. The city people were thrown into such a panic by
these events, that even those who were guarding the walls
fled. The Romans very nearly succeeded in forcing their
way in through the gates with the fugitives; and of course
fixed their scaling-ladders against the wall in perfect security.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c13" type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Double Assault By The Romans</head>
<p>Meanwhile Publius, though throwing himself heartily
into the struggle, yet took all possible precautions to protect
his life. He had three men with him carrying large shields,
which they held in such a position as to completely protect
him from the side of the wall; and accordingly he went along
the lines, or mounted on elevated ground, and contributed
greatly to the success of the day. For he was enabled to see
all that was going on, and at the same time, by being himself
in view of all, inspired great zeal in the hearts of the combatants. The result was that nothing was omitted which could
contribute to the success of the battle; but any help he
saw to be at any moment required was rapidly and thoroughly
supplied.</p>
<p>But though the leaders of the escalade had begun mounting the walls with great spirit,
they found the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Difficulties of the escalade.</note>
operation accompanied by some danger: not
so much from the number of the defenders, as
from the height of the walls. The defenders accordingly
plucked up courage considerably when they saw the distress of
the assailants: for some of the ladders were breaking under
the weight of the numbers which, owing to their length, were on
them at the same time; while on others the first to mount
turned giddy owing to their great height, and without requiring
much resistance from the defenders threw themselves from
<pb n="13"/>
the ladders: and when beams, or anything of that sort, were
hurled upon them from the battlements, they were swept off
<foreign lang="fr">en masse</foreign> and fell to the ground. In spite however of these
difficulties nothing could check the zeal and fury of the
Roman attack; but as the first fell their place was always
taken at once by the next in order. And now, as the day was
far advanced, and the soldiers were worn out with fatigue,
Scipio sounded a recall for the assaulting party.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Scipio Creates a Distraction</head>
<p>The men in the town were accordingly in high spirits
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Towards evening Scipio renews the assault on the gate, to distract attention from his attack by way of the lagoon.</note>
at having, as they thought, repulsed the assault.
But Scipio, who was conscious that the time
was now approaching for the ebb of the lagoon,
had five hundred men stationed ready by its
edge with ladders; and meanwhile massed some
fresh soldiers upon the gate and isthmus, and,
after urging them to undertake the work, furnished them with
a larger number of ladders than before: so that the wall was
almost covered with men scaling it. When the signal for
attack was sounded, and the men placed their ladders against
the wall, and began ascending at every point, the excitement
and consternation inside the walls was extreme; for when
they thought themselves released from the threatened danger,
they saw it beginning all over again by another assault. Besides, their missiles were beginning to fall short; and the
number of men they had lost greatly disheartened them. Still,
though they were in great distress, they continued the defence
as well as they could.</p>
<p>Just when the struggle at the ladders was at its hottest the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio crosses the lagoon and gets his men upon the wall.</note>
ebb of the tide began. The water began gradually to leave the edges of the lagoon, and the
current ran with such violence, and in such a
mass through its channel into the adjoining
sea, that to those who were unprepared for the sight it appeared incredible. Being provided with guides, Scipio at
once ordered his men, who had been stationed ready for this
service, to step in and to fear nothing. His was a nature especially fitted to inspire courage and sympathy with his own
feelings. So now the men at once obeyed him, and when
the army saw them racing each other across the marsh, it
<pb n="14"/>
could not but suppose that the movement was a kind of
heaven-sent inspiration. This reminded them of the reference
Scipio had made to Poseidon, and the promises contained in
his harangue: and their enthusiasm rose to such a height that
they locked their shields above their heads, and, charging up
to the gate, they began trying to hew their way through the
panels of the doors with their axes and hatchets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the party which had crossed the marsh had approached the wall. They found the battlements unguarded:
and therefore, not only fixed their ladders against the wall,
but actually mounted and took it without striking a blow; for
the attention of the garrison was distracted to other points,
especially to the isthmus and the gate leading to it, and they
never expected that the enemy were likely to attack on the
side of the lagoon: besides, and above all, there was such
disorderly shouting, and such a scene of confusion within the
wall, that they could neither hear nor see to any purpose.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Carthagena Captured and Looted</head>
<p>As soon as they found themselves in possession of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The city entered and given up to the sword.</note>
the wall, the Romans began making their way along the top of it,
hurling off such of the enemy as they met, the nature of
their arms being especially suited for an operation of that
sort. But when they arrived at the gate they descended and
began cutting through the bolts, while those without began
forcing their way in, and those who were mounting the walls
in the direction of the isthmus, beginning by this time to get
the better of their opponents, were getting a footing on the
battlements. Thus the walls were finally in possession of the
enemy: and the troops, which entered by the gate, carried the
eastern hill and drove off the garrison occupying it.</p>
<p>When Scipio thought that a sufficient number of troops
had entered the town, he gave leave to the larger number of
them to attack those in it, according to the Roman custom,
with directions to kill everything they met, and to spare
nothing; and not to begin looting until they got the order
to do so. The object of this is, I suppose, to strike terror.
Accordingly, one may often see in towns captured by the
Romans, not only human beings who have been put to the
sword, but even dogs cloven down the middle, and the limbs
<pb n="15"/>
of other animals hewn off. On this occasion the amount of
such slaughter was exceedingly great, because of the numbers
included in the city.</p>
<p>Scipio himself with about a thousand men now pressed on<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Mago surrenders the citadel.</note>
towards the citadel. When he arrived there,
Mago at first thought of resistance; but afterwards, when he was satisfied that the city
was completely in the power of the enemy, he sent to
demand a promise of his life, and then surrendered. This
being concluded, the signal was given to stop the slaughter:
whereupon the soldiers left off slaying, and
turned to plunder. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Sack of the city.</note> When night fell those of
the soldiers to whom this duty had been assigned remained
in the camp, while Scipio with his thousand men bivouacked

all their booty into the market-place by maniples, and to
take up their quarters for the night by these several heaps.
He then summoned the light-armed from the camp, and
stationed them upon the eastern hill.</p>
<p>Thus did the Romans become masters of <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> in
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>How the Romans Distribute Booty</head>
<p>Next morning the baggage of those who had served
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman customs in the distribution of booty.</note>
in the Carthaginian ranks, as well as the property of the city-folk and the craftsmen, having
been collected together in the market-place,
the Tribunes divided it according to the Roman
custom among their several legions. Now the Roman
method of procedure in the capture of cities is the following: Sometimes certain soldiers taken from each maniple are
told off for this duty, their numbers depending on the size of
the city; sometimes maniples are told off in turn for it: but
there are never more than half the whole number assigned to
the work. The rest remain in their own ranks in reserve, sometimes outside, at others inside the city,
for taking such precautions as may be from time to time necessary. Sometimes,
though rarely, four legions are massed together; but generally
speaking the whole force is divided into two legions of
Romans and two of allies. This being settled, all who are
<pb n="16"/>
told off for plundering carry all they get, each to his own
legion; and when this booty has been sold, the Tribunes distribute the proceeds among all equally, including not only
those who were thus held in reserve, but even those who
were guarding the tents, or were invalided, or had been sent
away anywhere on any service. But I have spoken fully
before, when discussing the Roman constitution, on the subject of the distribution of
booty, showing how no one is excluded from a share in
it, in accordance with the oath which all take upon first
joining the camp. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">See <ref target="b6c33" targOrder="U">6, 33</ref>.</note> I may now add
that the arrangement whereby the Roman army is thus divided, half being
engaged in gathering booty and half remaining drawn up in
reserve, precludes all danger of a general catastrophe arising
from personal rivalry in greed. For as both parties feel absolute confidence in the fair dealing of each in respect to the
booty,&mdash;the reserves no less than the plunderers,&mdash;no one
leaves the ranks, which has been the most frequent cause of
disaster in the case of other armies.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c17" type="chapter" n="17">
<head>Scipio's Treatment of the Prisoners</head>
<p>For, as the majority of mankind encounter miseries and
embrace dangers for the sake of gain, it is plain that when
such opportunity is presented to them as this, the men in the reserve or in the camp would be with difficulty induced to abstain
from taking advantage of it; because the usual idea is that everything belongs to the man who actually takes it: and though a
general or king may be careful to order all booty to be brought
into the common stock, yet everybody considers that what he
can conceal is his own. The result is that, while the ruck
of the army cannot be prevented from eagerly devoting themselves to plunder,
they often run the risk of a complete overthrow: and it has often in fact happened that after a successful
movement, such as the carrying of an entrenched camp or the
capture of a city, the victorious army has, from no other cause
but this, been not only ejected but even utterly defeated.
Therefore there is nothing about which leaders ought to exercise
more care or foresight, than that, on such an occasion, all
may have an absolutely equal prospect of sharing in the booty.</p>
<p>Thus on the present occasion, while the Tribunes were
busied in the distribution of the spoil; the Roman commander
<pb n="17"/>  caused the prisoners, who numbered little short of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's treatment of the prisoners. The citizens are dismissed to their homes.</note> With
ten thousand, to be assembled; and having first
ordered them to be divided into two groups,

children, the other the craftsmen, he exhorted
the first of these to be loyal to the Romans,
and to remember the favour which they were now receiving,
and allowed them all to depart to their own houses.
tears of joy at this unexpected preservation, they bowed in
reverence to Scipio and dispersed. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The skilled slaves are promised their freedom at the end of the war.</note> He then
told the craftsmen that they were for the present

then bade them go get their names enrolled in the office of
the Quaestor, and appointed a Roman overseer for every
thirty of them, their whole number being about two thousand.
From the remaining captives he selected the
strongest, those who were in the prime of
youth and physical vigour, and assigned them
to serve on board ship: and having thus increased the number
of his naval allies by one half, he manned the ships taken from
the enemy as well as his own; so that the number of men on
board each vessel were now little short of double what it was
before. For the captured ships numbered eighteen, his
original fleet thirty-five. These men he also promised their
freedom, if they showed themselves loyal and zealous, as soon
as they had conquered the Carthaginians. By this treatment
of the captives he inspired the citizens with warm feelings of
loyalty and fidelity, and the handicraftsmen with great
readiness to serve, from the hope held out to them of recovering
their freedom.</p></div2>

first, that they were safe and well; and, secondly, that the
Romans were minded to restore them all unharmed to their
homes, if only their relations adopted the Roman alliance.
With these words, having already selected from the spoils such
articles as were fitting for his purpose, he presented each with
what was suitable to their sex and age: the girls with ear-rings
and bracelets, the young men with daggers and swords. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The women.</note> Among
the captive women was the wife of Mandonius,

This woman fell at his feet and besought him with tears to
protect their honour better than the Carthaginians had done.
Touched by her distress Scipio asked her in what respect she
and the other women were left unprovided. She was a lady
of advanced years and of a certain majestic dignity of appearance: and upon her meeting his question by perfect silence,
he summoned the men who had been appointed to take charge
of the women; and when they reported that they had supplied
them with all necessaries in abundance, and when the woman
again clasped his knees and repeated the same request, Scipio
felt still more embarrassed; and, conceiving the idea that their
guardians had neglected them, and were now making a false
report, he bade the women fear nothing, for that he would
appoint different men to see to their interests, and secure that
they were not left in want of anything. Then after a brief
hesitation the woman said, "You mistake my meaning, General,
if you think that we are asking you for food." Scipio then at
length began to understand what she wished to convey; and
seeing under his eyes the youthful beauty of the daughters of
Andobalus, and of many of the other nobles, he could not
<pb n="19"/>
refrain from tears, while the aged lady indicated in a few words
the danger in which they were. He showed at once that he
understood her words: and taking her by the hand, he bade
her and the others also be of good cheer, for that he would
watch over them as he would over his own sisters and
daughters, and would accordingly put men in charge of them
on whom he could rely.</p></div2>

<head>The Money</head>
<p>His next business was to pay over to the Quaestors
such public money of the Carthaginians as had
been captured. It amounted to more than
six hundred talents, so that when this was added to the four
hundred which he had brought with him from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he found
himself in possession of more than one thousand talents.</p>
<p>It was on this occasion that some young Romans fell in<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's continence.</note>
with a girl surpassing all the other women in
bloom and beauty; and seeing that Scipio was
fond of the society of women, they brought her
to him, and, placing her before him, said that they desired to
present the damsel to him. He was struck with admiration
for her beauty, and replied that, if he had been in a private
position, he could have received no present that would have
given him greater pleasure; but as general it was the last in the
world which he could receive. He meant to convey, I presume,
by this ambiguous answer that, in hours of rest and idleness,
such things are the most delightful enjoyments and pastimes
for young men; whereas in times of activity they are hindrances
physically and mentally. However that may be, he thanked
the young men; but called the girl's father, and handing her
over at once to him, told him to bestow her in marriage on
whichever of the citizens he chose. By this display of continence
and self-control he gained the warm respect of his men.</p>
<p>Having made these arrangements, and handed over the rest<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Laelius sent to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> with the news. B.C. <date value="-209">209</date>.</note>

with the Carthaginian prisoners and the noblest
of the others, to announce at home what had taken place.
For as the prevailing feeling at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was one of despair of

<p>Scipio himself stayed a certain time in New
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Preparations for an advance.</note>
<placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> and assiduously practised his fleet;
and drew up the following scheme for his
military Tribunes for training their men. The
first day he ordered the men to go at the double for thirty
stades in their full arms; and on the second all of them to rub
down, clean, and thoroughly examine their whole equipments;
on the third to rest and do nothing; on the fourth to have a
sham fight, some with wooden swords covered with leather and
with a button at the end, others with javelins also buttoned at
the end; on the fifth the same march at the double as on the
first. That there might be no lack of weapons for the
practises, or for the real fighting, he took the greatest pains with
the handicraftsmen. He had, as I have already stated, appointed
overseers over them in regular divisions to secure that this was
done; but he also personally inspected them every day, and
saw that they were severally supplied with what was necessary.
Thus while the legions were practising and training in the
vicinity of the town, and the fleet man&oelig;uvring and rowing in
the sea, and the city people sharpening weapons or forging
arms or working in wood, every one in short busily employed
in making armour, the whole place must have presented the
appearance of what Xenophon called "a workshop of war." <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.4.17">Xen. <title>Hellen.</title> 3, 4, 17</bibl>:

timid character, and quite unsuited for service

But as my history has now arrived at a point
at which the achievements of Philopoemen begin, I think it only
<pb n="21"/>
proper that, as I have attempted to describe the habits and
characters of the other men of eminence with whom we have
had to deal, I should do the same for him. It is strangely inconsistent in historians to record in elaborate detail the founding
of cities, stating when and how and by whom they were established, and even the circumstances and difficulties which
accompanied the transaction, and yet to pass over in complete
silence the characteristics and aims of the men by whom the
whole thing was done, though these in fact are the points of
the greatest value. For as one feels more roused to emulation
and imitation by men that have life, than by buildings that
have none, it is natural that the history of the former should
have a greater educational value. If I had not therefore already
composed a separate account of him, clearly setting forth who
he was, his origin, and his policy as a young man, it would
have been necessary to have given an account now of each of
these particulars. But since I have done this in a work in
three books, unconnected with my present history, detailing the
circumstances of his childhood and his most famous achievements, it is clear that in my present narrative my proper
course will be to remove anything like details from my account
of his youthful characteristics and aims; while I am careful to
<emph>add</emph> details to the story of the achievements of his manhood,
which in that treatise were only stated summarily. I shall thus
preserve the proper features of both works. The former being
in the nature of a panegyric demanded an account of his
actions, put briefly and in a style deliberately intended to
enhance their merits; my present work, which is history, and
therefore absolutely uncommitted to praise or blame, requires
only a true statement, which puts the facts clearly, and traces
the policy which dictated the several actions.</p></div2>

<head>His Birth and Education</head>
<p>Philopoemen, then, to begin with, was of good birth,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Birth, parentage, and education of Philopoemen b. B.C. <date value="-252">252</date></note>
descended from one of the noblest families
in <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>. He was also educated under that
most distinguished Mantinean, Cleander, who
had been his father's friend before, and happened
at that time to be in exile. When he came to man's estate he
attached himself to Ecdemus and Demophanes, who were by
birth natives of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName>, but who having been exiled by the
<pb n="22"/>
tyrant, and having associated with the philosopher Arcesilaus
during their exile, not only set their own country free by
entering into an intrigue against Aristodemus the tyrant, but
also helped in conjunction with Aratus to put down Nicocles,
the tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName>. On another occasion also, on the invitation of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, they stood forward as their
champions and preserved their freedom for them. Such were
the men with whom he passed his early life; and he at once began
to show a superiority to his contemporaries, by his power of
enduring hardships in hunting, and by his acts of daring in war.
He was moreover careful in his manner of life, and moderate
in the outward show which he maintained; for he had imbibed from these men the conviction, that it was impossible for
a man to take the lead in public business with honour
who neglected his own private affairs; nor again to abstain
from embezzling public money if he lived beyond his private
income.</p>

this time, and finding the squadrons in a state
of utter demoralisation, and the men thoroughly
dispirited, he not only restored them to a better
state than they were, but in a short time made
them even superior to the enemy's cavalry, by
bringing them all to adopt habits of real training
and genuine emulation. The fact is that most of those who
hold this office of Hipparch, either, from being without any
genius themselves for cavalry tactics, do not venture to enforce
necessary orders upon others; or, because they are aiming at
being elected Strategus, try all through their year of office to
attach the young men to themselves and to secure their favour
in the coming election: and accordingly never administer
necessary reprimands, which are the salvation of the
public interests, but hush up all transgressions, and, for the sake
of gaining an insignificant popularity, do great damage to those
who trust them. Sometimes again, commanders, though neither
feeble nor corrupt, do more damage to the soldiers by intemperate zeal than the negligent ones, and this is still oftener the
case with regard to the cavalry. . . .</p></div2>

seems right in placing them thus, and assigning them to the account of the
tactics of Philopoemen.</note> In the first place each separate
horse was to be practised in wheeling first to
the left and then to the right, and also to face
right-about; and in the next place they were
to be taught to wheel in squadrons, face-about, and by a
treble movement to face-about right-turn. Next they were to
learn to throw out flying columns of single or double companies at full speed from both wings or from the centre;
and then to pull up and fall in again into troops, or squadrons, or regiments: next to deploy into line on both wings,
either by filling up the intervals in the line or by a lateral
movement on the rear. Simply to form an oblique line,
he said, required no practice, for it was exactly the same
order as that taken up on a march. After this they were to
practice charging the enemy and retreating by every kind of
movement, until they were able to advance at an alarming
pace; provided only that they kept together, both line and
column, and preserved the proper intervals between the
squadrons: for nothing is more dangerous and unserviceable
than cavalry that have broken up their squadrons, and attempt
to engage in this state.</p>
<p>After giving these instructions both to the people and their
magistrates, he went on a round of inspection through the
towns, and inquired, first, whether the men obeyed the words of
command; and, secondly, whether the officers in the several
towns knew how to give them clearly and properly: for he held
that the first thing requisite was technical knowledge on the
part of the commanders of each company.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c24" type="chapter" n="24">
<head>How to Drill a Large Company</head>
<p>When he had thus made the proper preliminary
preparations, he mustered the cavalry from the various cities
into one place, and set about perfecting their evolutions
under his own command, and personally directed the whole
drill. He did not ride in front of the army, as generals nowadays do, from the notion that this is the proper position for
<pb n="24"/>
a commander. For what can be less scientific or more
dangerous than for a commander to be seen by all his men,
and yet not to see one of them? In such man&oelig;uvres a
Hipparch should not make a display not of mere military dignity,
but of the skill and ability of an officer, appearing at one time
in the front, at another on the rear, and at another in the
centre. This is what he did, riding along the lines, and
personally seeing to all the men, giving them directions when
they were at a loss what to do, and correcting at once every
mistake that was being made. Such mistakes, however, were
trifling and rare, owing to the previous care bestowed on every
individual and company. Demetrius of Phalerum has, as far
as words go, given expression to the same idea: "As in the
case of building, if you lay each single brick rightly, and if
proper care is taken in placing each successive course, all will
be well; so in an army, accuracy in the arrangement of each
soldier and each company makes the whole strong. . . ."</p></div2>

laid aside his crown and purple robe, with
the view of making a display of democratic

democratic the dress which he wore, the more
absolute and royal were the privileges which he
claimed. He was not now content with seducing unmarried
women, or even with intriguing with married women, but
assumed the right of sending authoritatively for any woman
whose appearance struck him; and offered violence to those
who did not at once obey, by leading a band of revellers to
their houses; and, summoning their sons or their husbands, he
trumped up false pretexts for menacing them. In fact his
conduct was exceedingly outrageous and lawless. But though
this abuse of his privileges as a guest was exceedingly annoying
to many of the Achaeans, and especially to the orderly part of
them, the wars that threatened them on every side compelled
them to show a patience under it uncongenial to their

<placeName key="tgn,7002115">Ecbatana</placeName>, which stands on the north of Media, in the district
of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> bordering on the Maeotis and Euxine. It was
originally the royal city of the Medes, and vastly superior to
the other cities in wealth and the splendour of its buildings.
It is situated on the skirts of Mount Orontes, and is without
walls, though containing an artificially formed citadel fortified
to an astonishing strength. Beneath this stands the palace,
which it is in some degree difficult to describe in detail, or to
pass over in complete silence. To those authors whose aim
is to produce astonishment, and who are accustomed to deal in
exaggeration and picturesque writing, this city offers the best
possible subject; but to those who, like myself, are cautious
when approaching descriptions which go beyond ordinary
notions, it presents much difficulty and embarrassment. However, as regards size, the palace covers ground the circuit of
which is nearly seven stades; and by the costliness of the
structure in its several parts it testifies to the wealth of its
original builders: for all its woodwork being cedar or cypress
not a single plank was left uncovered; beams and fretwork
in the ceilings, and columns in the arcades and peristyle, were
overlaid with plates of silver or gold, while all the tiles were of
silver. Most of these had been stripped off during the
invasion of Alexander and the Macedonians, and the rest in the
reigns of Antigonus and Seleucus Nicanor. However, even at
the time of Antiochus's arrival, the temple of Aena<note anchored="yes">This goddess is variously called
Anaitis (<bibl n="Plut. Art. 27">Plut. <title>Artax.</title> 27</bibl>) and Nanea

columns covered with gold, and a considerable number of
silver tiles had been piled up in it, and some few gold bricks
and a good many silver ones were still remaining. It was

<head>Antiochus the Great In Media</head>
<p>Arsaces expected that Antiochus would come as far as
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The nature of the desert between Media and <placeName key="tgn,7016768">Parthia</placeName>.</note>
this district (of Media), but that he would not
venture to proceed across the adjoining desert
with so large a force, if for no other reason, yet
from the scarcity of water. For in this tract of
country there is no water appearing on the surface, though
there are many subterranean channels which have well-shafts
sunk to them, at spots in the desert unknown to persons unacquainted with the district. A true account of these channels
has been preserved among the natives to the effect that, during
the Persian ascendency, they granted the enjoyment of the
profits of the land to the inhabitants of some of the waterless
districts for five generations, on condition of their bringing
fresh water in; and that, there being many large streams flowing
down Mount Taurus, these people at infinite toil and expense
constructed these underground channels through a long tract
of country, in such a way, that the very people who now use
the water are ignorant of the sources from which the channels
are originally supplied.</p>
<p>When, however, Arsaces saw that Antiochus was determined to attempt to cross the desert,
he endeavoured at once to choke up and spoil the wells.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus prepares to cross it: Arsaces orders the wells to be choked.</note>
But King Antiochus, upon this being reported
to him, despatched Nicomedes with a thousand
horse; who found that Arsaces had retired with
his main army, but came upon some of his cavalry in the act
of choking up the shafts which went down into the underground channels. They promptly attacked these men, and,
having routed and forced them to fly, returned back again to
Antiochus. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus arrives at <placeName key="tgn,7016671">Hecatompylos</placeName>.</note> The king, having thus accomplished

sought a ground more favourable to his own army

it stood to reason that he had entirely changed
his mind. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus determines to follow Arsaces into Hyrcania.</note> He therefore decided to advance into Hyrcania.
But having arrived at Tagae, he learnt from the natives that
the country he had to cross, until he reached the ridges of
Mount Labus sloping down into Hyrcania, was exceedingly
rough and difficult, and that large numbers of barbarians were
stationed at the narrowest points. He therefore resolved to
divide his light-armed troops into companies, and distribute
their officers among them, giving them directions as to
the route they were severally to take. He did the same
with the pioneers, whose business it was to make the positions
occupied by the light-armed possible of approach for the
phalanx and beasts of burden. Having made these arrangements, he entrusted the first division to Diogenes, strengthening
him with bowmen and slingers and some mountaineers skilled
in throwing javelins and stones, and who, without keeping
any regular order, were always ready to skirmish at a
moment's notice, and in any direction, and rendered the most
effective assistance at the narrow passes. Next to these he
ordered a company of about two thousand Cretans armed with
shields to advance, under the command of Polyxenidas of
<placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>. The rear was to be brought up by companies armed
with breastplate and shield, and commanded by Nicomedes of
Cos, and Nicolaus the Aetolian.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>Fighting On Mount Labus</head>
<p>But as they advanced, the ruggedness of the ground
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The ascent of Mount Labus.</note>
and the narrowness of the passes were found to
far exceed the king's expectations. The length
of the ascent was altogether about three hundred
stades; and a great part had to be made up the bed of a
winter torrent of great depth, into which numerous rocks and
trees had been hurled by natural causes from the overhanging
precipices, and made a passage up it difficult, to say nothing of
the obstacles which the barbarians had helped to construct
expressly to impede them. These latter had felled a large
number of trees and piled up heaps of huge rocks; and had
<pb n="29"/>
besides occupied all along the gully the high points, which
were at once convenient for attack and capable of covering
themselves; so that, if it had not been for one glaring error on
their part, Antiochus would have found the attempt beyond
his powers, and would have desisted from it. The error was
this. They assumed that the whole army would be obliged
to march the entire way up the gully, and they accordingly
occupied the points of vantage. But they did not perceive this
fact, that, though the phalanx and the baggage could not possibly
go by any other route than the one they supposed, there was yet
nothing to make it impossible for the light-armed and active
troops to accomplish the ascent of the bare rocks. Consequently, as soon as Diogenes had come upon the first outpost
of the enemy, he and his men began climbing out of the gully,
and the affair at once took a different aspect. For no sooner
had they come to close quarters, than, acting on the suggestion
of the moment, Diogenes avoided the engagement by ascending
the mountains that flanked the enemy's position, and so got
above him; and by pouring down volleys of darts and stones he
seriously harassed the barbarians. Their most deadly weapons
however proved to be the slings, which could carry a great
distance; and when by these means they had dislodged the
first outpost and occupied their position, an opportunity was
secured for the pioneers to clear the way and level it, without
being exposed to danger. Owing to the number of hands the
work went on rapidly; and meanwhile the slingers, bowmen,
and javelin-men advanced in skirmishing order along the
higher ground, every now and then reforming and seizing on
strong points of vantage; while the men with shields formed a
reserve, marching in order and at a regular pace along the side
of the gully itself. The barbarians thereupon abandoned
their positions, and, ascending the mountain, mustered in full
force on the summit.</p></div2>

<p>Thus Antiochus effected this ascent without loss, but

slowly and painfully, for it was not until the

to prevent a pursuit, and caused a recall to be sounded,

royal palace, and there encamped. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Capture of Sirynx.</note> Most of the natives fled
from the battle-field, and its immediate neighbourhood, into a city called Sirynx, which was
not far from Tambrax, and from its secure and
convenient situation was considered as the capital of <placeName key="tgn,7016639">Hyrcania</placeName>.
Antiochus therefore determined to carry this town by assault;
and having accordingly advanced thither, and pitched his
camp under its walls, he commenced the assault. The
operation consisted chiefly of mining under pent-houses. For
the city was defended by three trenches, thirty cubits broad
and fifteen deep, with a double vallum on the edge of each;
and behind these there was a strong wall. Frequent struggles
took place at the works, in which neither side were strong
enough to carry off their killed and wounded: for these hand-to-hand battles took place,
not above ground only, but underground also in the mines. However, owing to the numbers
employed and the activity of the king, it was not long before
the trenches were choked up and the walls were undermined
and fell. Upon this the barbarians, giving up all as lost, put to
death such Greeks as were in the town; and having plundered
all that was most worth taking, made off under cover of night.
When the king saw this, he despatched Hyperbasus with the
mercenaries; upon whose approach the barbarians threw down
their booty and fled back again into the city; and when they
found the peltasts pouring in energetically through the breach
in the walls they gave up in despair and surrendered.

occurrences of this sort; for I perceive that it is this, more
than anything else connected with the science of tactics, that
ruins commanders. And yet the blunder is a very obvious
one. For what is the use of a commander or general, who has
not learnt that the leader ought to keep as far as possible aloof
from those minor operations, in which the whole fortune of the
campaign is not involved? Or of one who does not know that,

even if circumstances should at times force them to engage in

this, that though engaged for a great length of time in an
enemy's country, and though he experienced a great variety of
fortune, he again and again inflicted a disaster on his opponents
in minor encounters, but never suffered one himself, in spite of
the number and severity of the contests which he conducted:
and the reason, we may suppose was, that he took great care
of his personal safety. And very properly so: for if the leader
escapes uninjured and safe, though a decisive defeat may
have been sustained, fortune offers many opportunities for
retrieving disasters; but if he has fallen, the pilot as it were of
the ship, even should fortune give the victory to the army,
no real advantage is gained; because all the hopes of the

supporter of his measures in the person of
Edeco, the prince of the Edetani; who no
sooner heard that New Carthage had been taken, and that
Scipio had got his wife and children into his hands, than,
concluding that the Iberians would change sides, he resolved
to take the lead in the movement: conceiving that, by acting
thus, he would best be able to get back his wife and children,
and at the same time have the credit of joining the Romans
by deliberate choice, and not under compulsion. And so it
turned out. For as soon as the armies were dismissed to their
winter quarters, he came to <placeName key="tgn,7008715">Tarraco</placeName>, accompanied by his
kinsfolk and friends; and there being admitted to an interview with Scipio, he said that "he thanked the gods heartily
that he was the first of the native princes to come to him; for
whereas the others were still sending ambassadors to the
Carthaginians and looking to them for support,&mdash;even while
stretching out their hands to the Romans,&mdash;he was come there
to offer not only himself, but his friends and kinsfolk also, to
the protection of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. If therefore he should have the
honour to be regarded by him as a friend and ally, he would
be able to render him important service both in the present
and the future. For as soon as the Iberians saw that he had
been admitted to Scipio's friendship, and had obtained what he
asked, they would all come in with a similar object, hoping to
have their relatives restored, and to enjoy the alliance of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.
Their affection being secured for the future by receiving such
a mark of honour and benevolence, he would have in them
sincere and ready coadjutors in all his future undertakings.
He therefore asked to have his wife and children restored to
him, and to be allowed to return home an acknowledged friend
of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; in order that he might have a reasonable pretext
<pb n="34"/>
for showing, to the best of his power, his own and his friends'
affection for Scipio himself and for the Roman cause."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c35" type="chapter" n="35">

<p>When Edeco had finished his speech, Scipio, who had

been ready to gratify him from the first,
and took the same view as to the policy of
the proceeding, delivered him his wife
and children, and granted the friendship which he asked.
More than this, his subtle intellect made an extraordinary
impression on the Iberian in the course of the interview; and
having held out splendid hopes to all his companions for the
future, he allowed him to return to his own country. This
affair having rapidly got wind, all the tribes living north of the
<placeName key="tgn,7007649">Ebro</placeName>, such as had not done so before, joined the Romans with
one consent.</p>
<p>Thus so far everything was going well with Scipio. After
the departure of these people, he broke up his naval force,
seeing that there was nothing to resist him at sea; and selecting the best of the crews, he distributed them among the
maniples, and thus augmented his land forces.</p>

as I have already narrated.<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b9c11" targOrder="U">9, 11</ref>.</note> And thinking that a convenient
opportunity had now come, they got together their own forces,
and, quitting the Carthaginian camp under cover of night,
occupied a position sufficiently strong to secure their safety.

Hasdrubal: having long been annoyed at the overbearing
conduct of the Carthaginians, and now seizing the first opportunity to manifest their feelings.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c36" type="chapter" n="36">
<head>Difficulty of Making Good Use of a Victory</head>
<p>This has often happened to people before. For though,
as I have many times remarked, success in a campaign and
victory over one's enemies are great things, it requires much
greater skill and caution to use such successes well. Accordingly,
<pb n="35"/>  you will find that those who have gained victories are
many times more numerous than those who have made good
use of them. The Carthaginians at this crisis are an instance
in point. After conquering the Roman armies, and slaying
both the generals, Publius and Gnaeus Scipio, imagining that
<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> was their own without dispute, they began treating the
natives tyrannically; and accordingly found enemies in their
subjects instead of allies and friends. And they were quite
rightly served, for imagining that the conduct necessary for
keeping power was something different from that necessary for
obtaining it; and for failing to understand that they keep
empire best, who best maintain the same principles in virtue of
which they gained it. And yet it is obvious enough, and has
been again and again demonstrated, that men gain power by
beneficent actions, and by holding out hopes of advantage to
those with whom they are dealing; but that, as soon as they
have got what they wanted, and begin to act wickedly and rule
despotically, it is but natural that, as their rulers have changed,
the feelings of the subjects should change too. So it was with
the Carthaginians.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c37" type="chapter" n="37">
<head>Hasdrubal Comes to a Decision</head>
<p>Surrounded by such difficulties Hasdrubal was agitated
by many conflicting emotions and anxieties. He was vexed
by the desertion of Andobales; vexed by the opposition and
feud between himself and the other commanders; and greatly
alarmed as to the arrival of Scipio, expecting that he would
immediately bring his forces to attack him. Perceiving therefore that he was being abandoned by the Iberians, and that
they were joining the Romans with one accord, he decided
upon the following plan of action. He resolved that he must
collect the best force he could, and give the enemy battle: if
fortune declared in his favour he could then consider his next
step in safety, but if the battle turned out unfavourably for
him, he would retreat with those that survived into <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>; and
collecting from that country as many of the natives as he could,
would go to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and take his share in the same fortune as his
brother Hannibal.</p>
<p>While Hasdrubal was arriving at this resolution, Publius<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Early in B. C. <date value="-208">208</date>, Scipio moves</note>
Scipio was rejoined by Gaius Laelius; and, being
informed by him of the orders of the Senate, he
<pb n="36"/>
collected his forces from their winter quarters
and began his advance: the Iberians joining
him on the march with great promptness and
hearty enthusiasm. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">southward to attack Hasdrubal in the valley of the Baetis. <bibl n="Liv. 27.18">Livy, 27, 18</bibl>-19.</note> Andobales had long been
in communication with Scipio: and, on the latter approaching
the district in which he was entrenched, he left his camp with
his friends and came to Scipio. In this interview he entered
upon a defence of himself in regard to his former friendship
with the Carthaginians, and spoke of the services he had done
them, and the fidelity which he had shown to them.
He then went on to narrate the injustice and tyranny
which he had experienced at their hands; and demanded that
Scipio himself should be the judge of his pleas. If he were
shown to be making ungrounded complaints against the
Carthaginians, he might justly conclude him incapable of
keeping faith with the Romans either: but if, on a review of
these numerous acts of injustice he were proved to have had no
other course than to desert the Carthaginians, Scipio might
confidently expect that, if he now elected to join the Romans,
he would be firm in his loyalty to them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c38" type="chapter" n="38">
<head>Hasdrubal and Scipio Prepare to Fight</head>
<p>Andobales added many more arguments before finishing his speech; and when he had done, Scipio
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Andobales joins Scipio.</note>
answered by saying that "he quite believed
what he had said; and that he had the strongest
reason for knowing about the insolent conduct of the Carthaginians, both from their treatment of the other Iberians, and
conspicuously from their licentious behaviour to their wives
and daughters, whom he had found occupying the position,
not of hostages, but of captives and slaves; and to whom he
had preserved such inviolable honour as could scarcely have
been equalled by their very fathers themselves." And upon
Andobales and his companions acknowledging that they were
quite aware of this, and falling at his feet and calling him
king, all present expressed approval. Whereupon Scipio with
emotion bade them "fear nothing, for they would experience
nothing but kindness at the hands of the Romans." He at
once handed over his daughters to Andobales; and next day
made the treaty with him, the chief provision of which was
that he should follow the Roman commanders and obey their
<pb n="37"/>
commands. This being settled, he returned to his camp;
brought over his army to Scipio; and, having joined camps
with the Romans, advanced with them against Hasdrubal.</p>
<p>Now the Carthaginian general was encamped at Baecula,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hasdrubal changes his position to one of superior strength.</note>
in the district of <placeName key="tgn,6001208">Castulo</placeName>, not far from the silver
mines. But when he learnt the approach of the
Romans, he shifted his quarters; and his rear
being secured by a river, and having a stretch
of tableland in front of his entrenchment of sufficient extent
for his troops to man&oelig;uvre, and bounded by a steep descent
sufficiently deep for security, he stayed quietly in position:
always taking care to post pickets on the brow of the descent.
As soon as he came within distance, Scipio was
eager to give him battle, but was baffled by the
strength of the enemy's position. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio arrives.</note> After waiting two days,
however, he became anxious, lest by the arrival of Mago and

<div2 id="b10c39" type="chapter" n="39">
<head>Scipio Attacks Hasdrubal</head>
<p>His whole army having been got ready for battle, he
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio successfully assaults Hasdrubal's position.</note>
confined the main body within his camp, but
sent out the velites and some picked men of
the infantry with orders to assault the brow of
the hill and attack the enemy's pickets. His
orders were carried out with great spirit. At first the Carthaginian commander watched what was happening without
stirring: but when he saw that, owing to the fury of the Roman
attack, his men were being hard pressed, he led out his army
and drew them up along the brow of the hill, trusting to the
strength of the position. Meanwhile Scipio despatched all his
light-armed troops with orders to support the advanced guard:
and the rest of his army being ready for action, he took half of
them under his own command, and going round the brow of
the hill to the enemy's left, began assaulting the Carthaginians;
while he entrusted the other half to Laelius, with orders to
make a similar attack on the right of the enemy. While this
was going on, Hasdrubal was still engaged in getting his troops
out of camp: for hitherto he had been waiting, because he
trusted in the strength of the position, and felt confident that
<pb n="38"/>
the enemy would never venture to attempt it. The attack,
therefore, took him by surprise, before he was able to get his
men on to the ground. As the Romans were now assaulting
the two wings of the position which the enemy had not yet
occupied, they not only mounted the brow of the hill in safety,
but actually advanced to the attack while their opponents were
still in all the confusion and bustle of falling in. Accordingly
they killed some of them on their exposed flank; while others,
who were actually in the act of falling in, they forced to turn
and flee. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hasdrubal retreats, and makes for the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName>.</note> Seeing his army

reaching the passes of the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName> and the Gauls in that

<p>Scipio did not think it advisable to pursue Hasdrubal at

pillage.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c40" type="chapter" n="40">
<head>Scipio Refuses the Title "King"</head>
<p>Next morning he collected the prisoners, amounting to
ten thousand foot and more than two thousand horse, and
busied himself in making arrangements about them. All the
Iberians of that district, who were in alliance at that time with
the Carthaginians, came in and submitted to the Roman
obedience, and in addressing Scipio called him "king." The
first to do this and to bow the knee before him
had been Edeco, and the next Andobales. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's self-restraint.</note> On
these occasions Scipio had passed the word over
without remark; but after the battle, when all alike addressed
him by that title, his attention was drawn to it; and he therefore summoned the Iberians to a meeting, and told them that
"he quite wished to be called a man of royal liberality by them
all, and to be so in the truest sense, but that he had no wish
to be a 'king,' nor to be called one by any one; they should
address him as general."</p>
<p>Even at this early period of his career, an observer might
have remarked the loftiness of Scipio's character. He was
<pb n="39"/>
still quite young. His good fortune had been so persistent,
that all who came under his rule were led naturally to think
and speak of him as a king. Yet he did not lose his selfcontrol; but deprecated this popular impulse and this show of
dignity. But this same loftiness of character was still more
admirable in the closing scenes of his life, when, in addition
to his achievements in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>, he crushed the Carthaginians;
reduced the largest and fairest districts of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, from the
Altars of Philaenus to the Pillars of Hercules, under the power
of his country; conquered <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and the kings of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>; made
the best and largest part of the world subject to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and
in doing so had numerous opportunities of acquiring regal
sway, in whatever parts of the world suited his purpose or
wish. For such achievements were enough to have kindled
pride, not merely in any human breast, but even, if I may say
so without irreverence, in that of a god. But Scipio's greatness of soul was so superior
to the common standard of mankind, that he again and again rejected what Fortune had put
within his grasp, that prize beyond which men's boldest
prayers do not go&mdash;the power of a king: and he steadily preferred his country and his duty to that royalty, which men
gaze at with such admiration and envy.</p>
<p>Scipio next proceeded to select from the captives the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio occupies the position evacuated by the Carthaginians.</note>
native Iberians, and all these he dismissed to
their homes without ransom; and bidding Andobales select three hundred of the horses, he distributed the remainder among those who had
none. For the rest, he at once occupied the entrenchment of
the Carthaginians, owing to its excellent situation; and there he
remained himself, waiting to see the movements of the other
Carthaginian generals; while he detached a body of men to
the passes of the <placeName key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName> to keep a look-out for

threatening all with an attack by land, while Attalus and Publius Sulpicius did the same by
sea. Wherefore Achaean legates arrived at the court of King Philip entreating his help: for it
was not the Aetolians alone of whom they were standing in dread, but Machanidas also, as he
was encamped with his army on the frontier of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. The Boeotians also, in fear of the
enemy's fleet, were demanding a leader and
help from the king. Most urgent of all, however, were the
Euboeans in their entreaties to him to take some precaution
against the enemy. A similar appeal was being made by the
Acarnanians; and there was an embassy even from the
Epirotes. News had arrived that both Scerdilaidas and
Pleuratus were leading out their armies: and, over and above
this, that the Thracian tribes on the frontier of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>,
especially the Maedi, were planning to invade <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, if

distance. Moreover the Aetolians were already securing the
pass of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> with trenches and stockades and a
formidable garrison, satisfied that they would thus out
Philip, and entirely prevent him from coming to the assistance
of his allies south of the pass. It appears to me that a crisis
of this sort is well worth the observation and attention of my
readers; for it affords a trial and test of the vigour of the
leader affected. As in the hunting-field the wild animals
never show their full courage and strength until surrounded
and brought to bay,&mdash;so it is with leaders. And no more
conspicuous instance could be found than this of Philip. He
dismissed the various embassies, promising each that he would
do his best: and then devoted his attention to the war which
surrounded him on all sides, watching to see in what direction,
and against which enemy, he had best direct his first attack.

<head>Fire signals</head>
<p>The method of signalling by fire, which is of the
highest utility in the operations of war, has never
before been clearly expounded; and I think I
shall be doing a service if I do not pass it over, but give an
account of it adequate to its importance. Now that opportuneness
is of the utmost moment in all undertakings, and pre-eminently
so in those of war, no one doubts; and of all the things which
contribute to enable us to hit the proper time nothing is more
efficacious than fire signals. For they convey intelligence
sometimes of what has just happened, sometimes of what is
actually going on; and by paying proper attention to them one
can get this information at three or four days' journey off, and
even more: so that it continually happens that the help
<pb n="42"/>
required may be unexpectedly given, thanks to a message
conveyed by fire signals. Now, formerly, as the art of signalling
by fire was confined to a single method, it proved in very
many cases unserviceable to those employing it. For as it
was necessary to employ certain definite signals which had
been agreed upon, and as possible occurrences are unlimited,
the greater number of them were beyond the competence
of the fire signals to convey. To take the present instance:
it was possible by means of the signals agreed upon to send
the information that a fleet had arrived at Oreus or Peparethos
or <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>; but it was impossible to express that "certain
citizens had gone over to the enemy," or "were betraying the
town," or that "a massacre had taken place," or any of those
things which often occur, but which cannot be all anticipated.
Yet it is precisely the unexpected occurrences which demand
instant consideration and succour. All such things then were
naturally beyond the competence of fire signalling, inasmuch
as it was impossible to adopt an arbitrary sign for things which
it was impossible to anticipate.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c44" type="chapter" n="44">
<head>Methods of Signalling</head>
<p>Aeneas, therefore, the writer of the treatise on tactics,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The improvement introduced by Aeneas Tactitus.</note>
wished to correct this defect, and did in fact
make some improvement; but his invention
still fell very far short of what was wanted,
as the following passage from his treatise will
show.<note anchored="yes">This passage does not occur in the extant treatise of Aeneas;
but is apparently referred to (<ref target="b10c7" targOrder="U">ch. 7, &sect; 4</ref>) as being contained in a preparatory treatise
(<foreign lang="greek">paraskeuastikh\ bi/blos</foreign>).</note> "Let those who wish," he says, "to communicate any
matter of pressing importance to each other by fire-signals
prepare two earthenware vessels of exactly equal size both as
to diameter and depth. Let the depth be three cubits, the
diameter one. Then prepare corks of a little shorter diameter
than that of the vessels: and in the middle of these corks fix
rods divided into equal portions of three fingers' breadth, and
let each of these portions be marked with a clearly distinguishable line: and in each let there be written one of the most
obvious and universal of those events which occur in war;
for instance in the first 'cavalry have entered the country,' in
the second 'hoplites,' in the third 'light-armed,' in the next
<pb n="43"/>
'infantry and cavalry,' in another 'ships,' in another 'corn,'
and so on, until all the portions have written on them the
events which may reasonably be expected to occur in the
particular war. Then carefully pierce both the vessels in such
a way that the taps shall be exactly equal and carry off the
same amount of water. Fill the vessels with water and lay the
corks with their rods upon its surface, and set both taps running
together. This being done, it is evident that if there is perfect
equality in every respect between them, both corks will sink
exactly in proportion as the water runs away, and both rods
will disappear to the same extent into the vessels. When they
have been tested, and the rate of the discharge of water has
been found to be exactly equal in both, then the vessels
should be taken respectively to the two places from which the
two parties intend to watch for fire signals. As soon as any
one of those eventualities which are inscribed upon the rods
takes place, raise a lighted torch, and wait until the signal is
answered by a torch from the others: this being raised, both
parties are to set the taps running together. When the cork
and rod on the signalling side has sunk low enough to bring
the ring containing the words which give the desired information on a level with the rim of the vessel, a torch is to be
raised again. Those on the receiving side are then at once
to stop the tap, and to look at the words in the ring of the rod
which is on a level with the rim of their vessel. This will be
the same as that on the signalling side, assuming everything to
be done at the same speed on both sides."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c45" type="chapter" n="45">
<head>An Improved Method</head>
<p>Now this method, though introducing a certain improvement in the system of fire signalling, is
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The drawbacks to this method.</note>
still wanting in definiteness: for it is evident
that it is neither possible to anticipate, or, if you
could anticipate, to write upon the rod every possible thing
that may happen: and therefore, when anything unexpected in
the chapter of accidents does occur, it is plainly impossible
to communicate it by this method. Besides, even such statements as are written on the rods are quite indefinite; for the
number of cavalry or infantry that have come, or the particular
point in the territory which they have entered, the number of
ships, or the amount of corn, cannot be expressed. For
<pb n="44"/>
what cannot be known before it happens cannot have an
arrangement made for expressing it. And this is the important point. For how is one to take proper measures for relief
without knowing the number or direction of the enemy?
Or how can the party to be relieved feel confidence or the
reverse, or indeed have any conception at all of the situation, if it does not know how many ships or how much corn
have been despatched by the allies?</p>
<p>But the last method which was hit upon by Cleoxenus and<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The improved method of Cleoxenus and Democlitus.</note>
Democlitus, and further elaborated by myself, is
above all things definite, and made capable of
indicating clearly whatever is needed at the
moment; but in its working it requires attention
and more than ordinarily close observation. It is as follows:
Divide the alphabet into five groups of five letters each (of
course the last group will be one letter short, but this will not
interfere with the working of the system). The parties about
to signal to each other must then prepare five tablets each, on
which the several groups of letters must be written. They
must then agree that the party signalling shall first raise two
torches, and wait until the other raises two also. The object
of this is to let each other know that they are attending.
These torches having been lowered, the signalling party raises
first torches on the left to indicate which of the tablets he
means: for instance, one if he means the first, two if he means
the second, and so on. He next raises torches on the right
showing in a similar manner by their number which of the
letters in the tablet he wishes to indicate to the recipient.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b10c46" type="chapter" n="46">
<head>Improvements In Signalling</head>
<p>This matter being agreed upon, the two parties must
go to their respective points of observation; and each must
have, to begin with, a stenoscope with two funnels, to enable
him to distinguish through one the right, through the other
the left position of the signaller opposite him. Near this
stenoscope the tablets must be fixed, and both points, to the
right and to the left, must be defended by a fence ten feet
long and about the height of a man, in order to make it clear
on which side the torches are raised, and to hide them entirely when they are lowered. These preparations completed
on both sides, when a man wishes, for instance, to send the
<pb n="45"/>
message "Some of our soldiers to the number of a hundred
have deserted to the enemy,"&mdash;the first thing to do is to select
words that may give the same information with the fewest
letters, for instance, "A hundred Cretans have deserted," for
thus the number of letters is diminished by more than a half
and the same information is given. This sentence having been
written on a tablet will be transmitted by five signals thus:
The first letter is <foreign lang="greek">k,</foreign> this comes in the second group of
letters and therefore on the second tablet; the signaller
therefore must raise two torches on the left to show the
recipient that he must look at the second tablet; then he will
raise five on the right, because <foreign lang="greek">k</foreign> is the fifth letter in the
group,<note anchored="yes"><p>The grouping of these letters will be as follows:&mdash;

<div2 id="b10c47" type="chapter" n="47">
<head>Importance of Practice</head>
<p>Now everything that happens can be definitely imparted by means of this invention; but the number of torches
employed is large, because each letter has to be indicated by
two series of them: still, if proper preparations are made, the
thing can be adequately carried out. But whichever method is
employed, those who use it must practise beforehand, in order that
when the actual occasion for putting it in use arises they may
be able to give each other the information without any hitch.
For there are plenty of instances to show what a wide difference
there is between the way an operation is carried out by men
who hear of it for the first time, and by men who have become
habituated to it. Many things which were considered not
only difficult, but impossible at first, are, after an interval of
time and practice, performed with the greatest ease. I could
give many illustrations of the truth of this remark, but the
clearest may be found in the art of reading. Put side by side
<pb n="46"/>
a man who has never learnt his letters, though otherwise acute,
and a child who has acquired the habit, and give the latter a
book, and bid him read it: the former will clearly not be induced to believe that the reader has first to attend to the look
of each of the letters, secondly to their sound-value, and
thirdly to their combinations with others, each of which
operation requires a certain time. Therefore when he sees
the boy, without a pause for thought, reading off seven or five
lines at a breath, he will not easily be induced to believe
that he has not read the book before; and certainly not, if he
is able also to observe the appropriate enunciation, the
proper separations of the words, and the correct use of the
rough and smooth breathings. The moral is, not to give up
any useful accomplishment on account of its apparent difficulties, but to persevere till it becomes a matter of habit,
which is the way mankind have obtained all good things. And
especially is this right when the matters in question are
such as are often of decisive importance to our safety.</p>
<p>I was led to say this much in connexion with my former
assertion that "all the arts had made such progress in our
age that most of them were reduced in a manner to exact
sciences." And therefore this too is a point in which history
properly written is of the highest utility. . . .</p>

stream against some precipitous rocks with a force raised to

the declivity down which it has descended, that it leaps from
the rocks to the plain below leaving an interval of more than a

The other account is more probable on the face of it. It is
said that, as the basin of the river has extensive flats into
which it descends with violence, the force of the stream makes
hollows in them, and opens chasms into which the water
descends deep below the surface, and so is carried on for a

was at Tapuria, and that a body of ten thousand horsemen were keeping guard at the
passage of the river Arius, he decided to
abandon the siege and attack these last. The
river was three days' march away. For two days
therefore he marched at a moderate speed; but on the third,
after dinner, he gave orders for the rest of his army to start
next day at daybreak; while he himself, with the cavalry and
light-armed troops and ten thousand peltasts, started in the
night and pushed on at a great rate. For he was informed
that the cavalry of the enemy kept guard by day on the bank
of the river, but at night retired to a city more than twenty
stades off. Having completed therefore the rest of the way
under cover of night, the plains being excellent for riding, he
got the greater part of his army across the river by daybreak,
before the enemy came back. When their scouts told them
what had happened, the horsemen of the Bactrians hastened to
the rescue, and fell in with their opponents while on the march.
Seeing that he must stand the first charge of the enemy, the king
summoned the two thousand horsemen who were accustomed
to fight round his own person; and issuing orders that the rest
were to form their companies and squadrons, and take up their
<pb n="48"/>
usual order on the ground on which they already were, he
advanced with the two thousand cavalry, and met the charge
of the advanced guard of the Bactrians. In this engagement
Antiochus is reputed to have shown the greatest gallantry of
any of his men. There was heavy loss on both sides: the
king's men conquered the first squadron, but when a second
and a third charged, they began to be hard pressed and to
suffer seriously. At that juncture, most of the cavalry being
by this time on the ground, Panaetolus ordered a general
advance; relieved the king and his squadrons; and, upon the
Bactrians charging in loose order, forced them to turn and
fly in confusion. They never drew rein before the charge of
Panaetolus, until they rejoined Euthydemus, with a loss of more
than half their number. The king's cavalry on the contrary
retired, after killing large numbers and taking a great many
prisoners, and bivouacked by the side of the river. In this
action the king had a horse killed under him, and lost some of
his teeth by a blow on the mouth; and his whole bearing obtained him a reputation for bravery of the highest description.

circumstances no longer admitted of delay. He
saw the enemy drawn out in battle array and
advancing; and he was obliged to get the
Iberians and the Gauls who were serving with
him into line. He therefore stationed his ten
elephants on the front, increased the depth of
his lines, and so had his whole army covering a somewhat
small ground. He took up a position himself in the centre of
the line, immediately behind the elephants, and commenced
an advance upon the Roman left, with a full resolution that in
this battle he must either conquer or die. Livius advanced to
meet the enemy with proud confidence, and having come to
close quarters with him was fighting with great gallantry, Meanwhile Claudius, who was stationed on the right wing,
found himself unable to advance and outflank the enemy, owing to the
rough ground in front of him, relying on which Hasdrubal
had directed his advance upon the Roman left: and being
embarrassed by his inability to strike a blow, he promptly
decided what the circumstances pointed out as the tactics to
pursue. He withdrew his men from the right wing, and
marched them on the rear of the field of battle; and, after
passing the left of the Roman line, fell upon the flank of the
Carthaginians who were fighting near the elephants. Up to
this point the victory had been doubtful; for both sides fought
with desperation, the Romans believing that all would be over
with them if they failed, and the Iberians and Carthaginians
holding exactly the same conviction for themselves. Moreover
the elephants were being of disservice to both sides alike; for
finding themselves between two forces, and exposed to a crossfire of javelins, they kept throwing both the Carthaginian and
Roman lines into confusion. But as soon as Claudius fell
upon the rear of the enemy the battle ceased to be equal: for
the Iberians found themselves attacked on front and rear at
once, which resulted in the greater part of them being cut
down on the ground. Six of the elephants were killed with
the men on them, four forced their way through the lines and
were afterwards captured, having been abandoned by their
Indian drivers.

his whole life, like a brave man, and died
fighting: and he deserves not to be passed over
without remark. I have already stated that
Hannibal was his brother, and on his departure to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>
entrusted the command in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> to him. I have also described

difficulties with which he had to struggle, caused by the generals
sent from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName>; and how in all these matters he
had supported these vicissitudes and reverses in a noble spirit
worthy of a son of Barcas. But I will now speak of his last
contest, and explain why he seems to me pre-eminently to
deserve respectful attention and imitation. Most generals and
kings, when entering upon decisive battles, place before their
eyes the glory and advantages to be obtained from victory, and
frequently consider and contrive what use they will make of
every success; but they do not go on to review the chances
of failure, nor contemplate the plan to be adopted, or the
action to be taken, in the case of reverse. Yet the former is
obvious, the latter requires foresight. Therefore it is that most
of them, though in many instances their soldiers have fought
nobly, by their own folly and imprudence in this respect have
added dishonour to defeat: have disgraced their previous
achievements, and rendered themselves, during the remainder
of their lives, objects of reproach and contempt. It is easy to
see that many leaders make this fatal mistake, and that the
difference between one man and another in these points is
most signal; for history is full of such instances. Hasdrubal,
on the contrary, as long as there was reasonable hope of being
able to accomplish anything worthy of his former achievements,
regarded his personal safety in battle as of the highest consequence; but when Fortune deprived him of all hopes for the
future, and reduced him to the last extremities, though
neglecting nothing either in his preparations or on the field
that might secure him the victory, nevertheless considered
how, in case of total overthrow, he might face his fate and
suffer nothing unworthy of his past career.</p>
<p>These remarks are meant for those engaged in active
operations, that they may neither dash the hopes of those who
<pb n="52"/>

unworthy clinging to life add disgrace and shame to the

<p>"Facts I imagine, Aetolians, have made it clear to you
that neither King Ptolemy nor the community of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>,
<placeName key="perseus,Byzantium">Byzantium</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, or <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>, regard a composition with you
as unimportant. For this is not the first or the second time
that we have introduced the subject of peace to your assembly;
but ever since you entered upon the war we have beset you
with entreaties, and have never desisted from warning you on this
subject; because we saw that its immediate result would be
the destruction of yourselves and of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and because
<pb n="53"/>
we foresaw in the future danger to our own countries and to that
of all other Greeks. For as, when a man has once set a fire
alight, the result is no longer dependent upon his choice, but
it spreads in whatever direction chance may direct, guided for
the most part by the wind and the combustible nature of the
material, and frequently attacks the first author of the conflagration himself: so too, war, when once it has been kindled by a
nation, sometimes devours the first those who kindled it; and
soon rushes along destroying everything that falls in its way,
continually gathering fresh strength, and blown into greater
heat by the folly of the people in its neighbourhood, as though
by the wind. Wherefore, men of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, considering that we,
as representatives of the whole body of the islanders and of the
Greek inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, are here to beseech you to put an
end to war and to choose peace, because the matter affects
us as well as you, show your wisdom by listening to us and
yielding to our entreaties. For if you were carrying on a war
which, though profitless (and most wars are that), was yet
glorious from the motive which prompted it, and the reputation likely to accrue from it, you might be pardoned perhaps
for a fixed determination to continue it; but if it is a war
of the most signal infamy, which can bring you nothing
but discredit and obloquy,&mdash;does not such an undertaking
claim considerable hesitation on your part? We will speak
our opinion frankly; and you, if you are wise, will give us a
quiet hearing. For it is much better to hear a disagreeable
truth now and thereby be preserved, than to listen to smooth
things now, and soon afterwards to be ruined yourselves, and to
ruin the rest of the Greeks with you.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Dangers of the Treaty With Rome</head>
<p>"Put then before your eyes your own folly. You
profess to be at war against Philip on behalf of the Greeks,
that they may escape from servitude to him; but your war is
really for the enslavement and ruin of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. That is the
tale told by your treaty with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, which formerly existed
only in written words, but is now seen in full operation.
Heretofore, though mere written words, it was a disgrace to
you: but now your execution of it has made that disgrace
palpable to the eyes of all the world. Moreover, Philip merely
lends his name and serves as a pretext for the war: he is not
<pb n="54"/>
exposed to any attack: it is against his allies,&mdash;the majority of
the Peloponnesian states, <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7010899">Locris</placeName>,

the Romans, their cities and their territory to
the Aetolians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cp. <ref target="b9c39" targOrder="U">9. 39</ref>.</note> And though personally, if you took a city, you
would not stoop to violate the freeborn, or to burn the buildings, because you look upon such conduct
as cruel and barbarous; yet you have made a treaty by which you have handed
over all other Greeks to the barbarians, to be exposed to the
most shameful violence and lawlessness. And all this was
hitherto kept a secret. But now the fate of the people of
Oreus, and of the miserable Aeginetans, has betrayed you to
every one,&mdash;Fortune having, as though of set purpose, suddenly
brought your infatuation before the scenes.</p>
<p>"So much for the origin of the war and its events up to
now. But as to its result,&mdash;supposing everything to go to

now that Hannibal has been confined to a narrow district in

professedly, indeed, in aid of the Boeotians against Philip, but
really with the view of reducing it entirely under their own
power. And if they design to treat it well when they have
conquered it, theirs will be the honour and glory; and if
badly, theirs too will be the plunder from the states they destroy,
and the power over those which they allow to survive: while
you will be calling upon the gods to witness your wrongs, when
no god will be any longer willing, nor any man be able to
help you. Now, perhaps, you ought to have foreseen all this
from the first, for that would have been your best course.
But since the future often escapes human foresight, now, at
any rate, that you have seen by actual experience what has
happened, it must be your duty to take better measures for the
future. In any case we have omitted nothing which it becomes
sincere friends to say or do. We have spoken our opinion

<p>This speaker having, as it seemed, made a considerable
impression, he was followed by the ambassadors of Philip, who,
without making a long speech, merely said that they were
commissioned to do one of two things,&mdash;if the Aetolians chose
peace, to accept it readily: if not, to call the gods and the
ambassadors from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> to witness that the Aetolians, and

<head>Faults of the Achaean Officers</head>
<p>There are three methods followed by those who wish to
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Defects of the Achaean officers.</note>
arrive at an intelligent knowledge of tactics.
The first is by the study of history, the second
by the use of scientific treatises composed by
specialists, the third by actual experience on the field. But
of all three of these methods the Achaean commanders were
equally ignorant. . . .</p>
<p>A very general fault in the men was an unfortunate rivalry,
engendered by the ostentation and bad taste of the others.
They were very particular about their attendants and their
dress; and there was a show of splendour in this, kept up by
the majority beyond their means. But to their arms they paid
no attention whatever. . . .

<p>"Brightness in the armour," he said," contributes much
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Philopoemen urging reform.</note>
to inspire dismay in the enemy; and care
bestowed on having it made to fit properly is
of great service in actual use. This will best
be secured if you give to your arms the attention which you
now bestow on your dress, and transfer to your dress the
neglect which you now show of your arms. By thus acting,
you will at once save your money, and be undoubtedly able to
maintain the interests of your country. Therefore the man
who is going to take part in man&oelig;uvres or a campaign ought,
when putting on his greaves, to see that they are bright and
well-fitting, much more than that his shoes and boots are; and
when he takes up his shield and helmet, to take care that they
are cleaner and more costly than his cloak and shirt: for
when men take greater care of what is for show, than of what
is for use, there can be no doubt of what will happen to them
on the field. I beg you to consider that elaboration in dress
is a woman's weakness, and a woman of no very high character
either; but costliness and splendour in armour are the characteristics of brave men who are resolved on saving themselves
and their country with glory."</p>
<p>The whole audience were so convinced by this speech and
so much struck with the wisdom of the advice, that, immediately
after leaving the council-chamber, they began pointing with scorn
at the over-dressed dandies, and forced some of them to quit
the market-place; and what is more, in future man&oelig;uvres and
campaigns they kept a stricter watch on each other in these
points.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c10" type="chapter" n="10">
<head>Philopoemen and Machanidas</head>
<p>So true it is that a single word spoken by a man of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philopoemen's own example.</note>
credit is often sufficient not only to turn men
from the worst courses, but even to incite
them to the noblest. But when such a
speaker can appeal to his own life as in harmony with his
words, then indeed his exhortation carries a weight which
nothing can exceed. And this was above all others the case
<pb n="57"/>
with Philopoemen. For in his dress and eating, as well as in
all that concerned his bodily wants, he was plain and simple;
in his manners to others without ceremony or pretence; and
throughout his life he made it his chief aim to be absolutely
sincere. Consequently a few unstudied words from him were
sufficient to raise a firm conviction in the minds of his hearers;
for as he could point to his own life as an example, they
wanted little more to convince them. Thus it happened on
several occasions, that the confidence he inspired, and the
consciousness of his achievements, enabled him in a few words
to overthrow long and, as his opponents thought, skilfully
argued speeches.</p>
<p>So on this occasion, as soon as the council of the league
separated, all returned to their cities deeply impressed both by
the words and the man himself, and convinced that no harm
could happen to them with him at their head. Immediately
afterwards Philopoemen set out on a visitation of the cities,
which he performed with great energy and speed. He then
summoned a levy of citizens and began forming them into
companies and drilling them; and at last, after
eight months of this preparation and training, he
mustered his forces at <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, prepared to
fight the tyrant Machanidas in behalf of the
freedom of all the Peloponnesians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">War against Machanidas, tyrant of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>. B. C. <dateRange from="-208" to="-207">208</dateRange>-<date value="-207">207</date>.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Arrangement of Forces at <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName></head>
<p>Machanidas had now acquired great confidence, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Battle of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, B. C. 207.</note>
looked upon the determination of the Achaeans
as extremely favourable to his plans. As soon
as he heard of their being in force at <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>,
he duly harangued his Lacedaemonians at <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>, and the very
next morning at daybreak advanced upon <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>. He led
the right wing of the phalanx himself; his mercenaries marched
in two parallel columns on each side of his front; and behind
them were carts carrying quantities of field artillery and bolts for
the catapults. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The road to <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName>. See <bibl n="Paus. 8.10">Paus, 8, 10 sq.</bibl></note> Meanwhile Philopoemen too had arranged his

the Illyrians and the men with body armour by the gate leading to the temple of Poseidon, and with them
all the rest of the foreign contingent and lightarmed troops; by the next gate, toward the west,
<pb n="58"/>
the phalanx; and by the next the Achaean cavalry. He sent
his light-armed men forward to occupy the hill, which rises
to a considerable height above the road called Xenis and the
above-mentioned temple: he stationed the men with body
armour next, resting on this hill to the south; next them the
Illyrians; next them, in the same straight line, the phalanx,
drawn up in companies, with an interval between each, along
the ditch which runs towards the temple of Poseidon, right
through the middle of the plain of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, until it touches
the range of mountains that forms the boundary of the
territory of the Elisphasii. Next to them, on the right wing,
he stationed the Achaean cavalry, under the command of
Aristaenetus of <placeName key="perseus,Dyme">Dyme</placeName>; while on the left wing he led the whole
of the foreign contingent, drawn up in lines one behind the
other.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Battle of <placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName></head>
<p>As soon as the enemy were well in sight, Philopoemen
went down the ranks of the phalanx, and addressed to them an
exhortation which, though short, clearly pointed out to them
the nature of the battle in which they were engaged. But
most of what he said was rendered inaudible by the answering
shouts of the troops. The affection and confidence of the
men rose to such a pitch of enthusiasm and zeal that they
seemed to be almost acting under a divine inspiration, as
they cried out to him to lead them on and fear nothing.
However he tried, when he could get the opportunity, to
make this much clear to them, that the battle on the one
side was to establish a shameful and ignominious servitude,
on the other to vindicate an ever-memorable and glorious
liberty.</p>
<p>Machanidas at first looked as though he meant to attack the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The attack of Machanidas.</note>
enemy's right wing in column; but when he got
within moderate distance he deployed into line
by the right, and by this extension movement
made his right wing cover the same amount of ground as the
left wing of the Achaeans, and fixed his catapults in front of
the whole force at intervals. Philopoemen understood that
the enemy's plan was, by pouring volleys from the catapults
into his phalanx, to throw the ranks into confusion: he therefore gave him no time or interval of repose, but opened the
<pb n="59"/>
engagement by a vigorous charge of his Tarentines<note anchored="yes">The "Tarentines" were horsemen armed with light skirmishing
javelins. See <ref target="b4c77" targOrder="U">4, 77</ref>; <ref target="b16c18" targOrder="U">16, 18</ref>; and cp. Arrian, <bibl n="Arr. Tact. 4.15"><title>Tact.</title> 4, &sect; 5</bibl>;

<div2 id="b11c13" type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Efficiency of Mercenaries</head>
<p>At first the struggle was confined to these two forces,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Defeat of the Achaean right wing.</note>
and was maintained with spirit. But the light-armed
troops coming gradually to the support of such of them as
were wavering, in a very short time the whole of the mercenaries on either side were engaged. They fought sometimes
in close order, sometimes in pairs: and for a long time so entirely without decisive result, that the rest of the two armies,
who were watching in which direction the cloud of dust inclined,
could come to no conclusion, because both sides maintained
for a long while exactly their original ground.
But after a time the mercenaries of the tyrant
began to get the better of the struggle, from
their numbers, and the superiority in skill obtained by long
practice. And this is the natural and usual result. The
citizens of a democracy no doubt bring more enthusiasm to
their battles than the subjects of a tyrant; but in the same
proportion the mercenaries of sovereigns are naturally superior
and more efficient than those of a democracy. For in the
former case one side is fighting for liberty, the other for a
condition of servitude; but in the case of mercenaries, those
of the tyrant are encouraged by the certain prospect of reward,
those of a democracy know that they must lose by victory:
for as soon as a democracy has crushed its assailants, it no
longer employs mercenaries to protect its liberties; while a
tyranny requires more mercenaries in proportion as its field
of ambition is extended: for as the persons injured by it are
more numerous, those who plot against it are more numerous
also; and the security of despots rests entirely on the
loyalty and power of mercenaries.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Machanidas Changes his Plan</head>
<p>Thus it came about that the mercenaries in the army
of Machanidas fought with such fury and violence, that even
<pb n="60"/>
the Illyrians and men with body armour, who formed the
reserve supporting the mercenaries of the Achaean army, were
unable to withstand their assault; but were all driven from
their position, and fled in confusion towards the city of
<placeName key="perseus,Mantinea">Mantinea</placeName>, which was about seven stades distant.</p>
<p>And now there occurred an undoubted instance of what
some doubt, namely, that the issues in war are for the most part
decided by the skill or want of skill of the commanders. For
though perhaps it is a great thing to be able to follow up a
first success properly, it is a greater thing still that, when the
first step has proved a failure, a man should retain his presence
of mind, keep a good look-out for any error of judgment on
the part of the victors, and avail himself of their mistakes.
At any rate one often sees the side, which imagines itself to
have obtained a clear victory, ultimately lose the day; while
those who seemed at first to have failed recover themselves
by presence of mind, and ultimately win an unexpected victory.
Both happened on this occasion to the respective leaders.</p>
<p>The whole of the Achaean mercenaries having been driven<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Machanidas pursues the fugitives,
and thus allows the Achaean hoplites to get between him and his quarters.</note>
from their ground, and their leftwing having been
thoroughly broken up, Machanidas abandoned
his original plan of winning the day by outflanking the enemy with some of his forces and
charging their front with others, and did neither;
but, quite losing his head, rushed forward heedlessly with all his mercenaries in pursuit of the fugitives, as
though the panic was not in itself sufficient to drive those who
had once given way up to the town gates.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Defeat of the Lacedaemonians</head>
<p>Meanwhile the Achaean general was doing all he could
to rally the mercenaries, addressing the officers by name, and
urging them to stand; but when he saw that they were hopelessly beaten, he did not run away in a panic nor give up the
battle in despair, but, withdrawing under cover of his phalanx,
waited until the enemy had passed him in their pursuit, and left
the ground on which the fighting had taken place empty, and
then immediately gave the word to the front companies of the
phalanx to wheel to the left, and advance at the double, without
breaking their ranks. He thus swiftly occupied the ground
abandoned by his mercenaries, and at once cut off the pursuers
<pb n="61"/>
from returning, and got on higher ground than the enemy's
right wing. He exhorted the men to keep up their courage,
and remain where they were, until he gave the word for a
general advance; and he ordered Polybius of <placeName key="perseus,Megalopolis">Megalopolis</placeName><note anchored="yes">See on <ref target="b27c4" targOrder="U">27, 4</ref>.</note> to
collect such of the Illyrians and body armour men and mercenaries as remained behind and had not taken part in the
flight, and form a reserve on the flank of the phalanx, to keep
a look-out against the return of the pursuers. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The fight at the dyke.</note>
Thereupon the Lacedaemonians, excited by the
victory gained by the light-armed contingent,
without waiting for the word of command, brought their sarissae
to the charge and rushed upon the enemy. But when in the
course of their advance they reached the edge of the dyke,
being unable at that point to change their purpose and retreat
when at such close quarters with the enemy, and partly because
they did not consider the dyke a serious obstacle, as the slope
down to it was very gradual, and it was entirely without water
or underwood growing in it, they continued their advance
through it without stopping to think.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Philopoemen Seizes an Opportunity</head>
<p>The opportunity for attack which Philopoemen had
long foreseen had now arrived. He at once ordered the
phalanx to bring their sarissae to the charge and advance. The
men obeyed with enthusiasm, and accompanied their charge
with a ringing cheer. The ranks of the Lacedaemonians had
been disorganised by the passage of the dyke, and as they
ascended the opposite bank they found the enemy above them
They lost courage and tried to fly; but the greater number
of them were killed in the ditch itself, partly by the Achaeans,
and partly by trampling on each other. Now this result was
not unpremeditated or accidental, but strictly owing to the
acuteness of the general. For Philopoemen originally took
ground behind the dyke, not to avoid fighting, as some
supposed, but from a very accurate and scientific calculation of strategical advantages. He reckoned either that
Machanidas when he arrived would advance without thinking of the dyke, and that then his phalanx would get
entangled, just as I have described their actually doing; or
that if he advanced with a full apprehension of the difficulty
<pb n="62"/>
presented by the dyke, and then changing his mind and
deciding to shrink from the attempt, were to retire in loose
order and a long straggling column,<note anchored="yes">The text is certainly corrupt here, and it is not clear what the general
sense of the passage is beyond this,&mdash;that Philopoemen calculated on defeating
the enemy, as he did, while struggling through the dyke: or on their exposing
themselves to attack if they retreated from the dyke without crossing it.</note> the victory would be his,
without a general engagement, and the defeat his adversary's.
For this has happened to many commanders, who having
drawn up their men for battle, and then concluded that they
were not strong enough to meet their opponents, either from
the nature of the ground, the disparity of their numbers, or for
other reasons, have drawn off in too long a line of march, and
hoped in the course of the retreat to win a victory, or at least get
safe away from the enemy, by means of their rear guard alone.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c17" type="chapter" n="17">
<head>Army of Machanidas Put to Flight</head>
<p>However, Philopoemen was not deceived in his prognostication of what would happen; for the Lacedaemonians
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Machanidas, returning from the pursuit, is killed while trying to recross the dyke.</note>
were thoroughly routed. Seeing therefore that his phalanx was
victorious and that he had gained a complete and brilliant
success, he set himself vigorously to secure the only thing
wanting to complete it, that is, to prevent the
escape of Machanidas. Seeing therefore that,
in the course of the pursuit, he was caught
between the dyke and the town with his
mercenaries, he waited for him to attempt a
return. But when Machanidas saw that his army
was in full retreat, with the enemy at their heels, he knew that
he had advanced too far, and had lost his chance of victory:
he therefore rallied the mercenaries that he had with him, and
tried to form close order, and cut his way through the enemy,
while they were still scattered and engaged in the pursuit.
Some of his men, understanding his plan and seeing no other
hope of safety, kept by him at first; but when they came upon
the ground, and saw the Achaeans guarding the bridge over the
dyke, they lost heart; and the whole company began falling
away from him, each doing the best he could to preserve his
own life. Thereupon the tyrant gave up all hope of making
his way over the bridge; and rode along the edge of the dyke,
trying with all his might to find a place which he could cross.
<pb n="63"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c18" type="chapter" n="18">
<head>Fall of Machanidas</head>
<p>Philopoemen recognised Machanidas by his purple

cloak and the trappings of his horse. He at
once left Anaxidamus, with orders to guard the
bridge with vigilance, and give no quarter to
any of the mercenaries; because they were the men on whom
the despots of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> always depended for supporting their
power. Then taking Polyaenus of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and Simias, who were
attending on him at the time, he rode along the edge of the
ditch opposite to that in which the tyrant and his attendants
were; for Machanidas had still two men with him, Arexidamus
and one of the mercenaries. As soon as Machanidas had found
a spot in the dyke which could be crossed, he put spurs to his
horse, and tried to force it to go on and get over. Then
Philopoemen turned suddenly round upon him and dealt him
a mortal wound with his spear, and a second with a stab from
the spike at the butt end of it, and thus killed the tyrant in a

did the same to Arexidamus; but the third man seeing their
fall gave up the idea of crossing the dyke and escaped. Simias
immediately stripped the bodies of the two who had fallen,
and with their armour carried off also the tyrant's head, and
then hurried off to overtake the pursuing party; being eager to
give the soldiers ocular evidence of the fall of the enemy's
commander, that they might continue the pursuit of their

<head>The Hannibalian War Continued</head>
<p>What profit is it to our readers to describe wars and

battles, the storming of cities and the enslavement of their
inhabitants, if they are to know nothing of the causes which
conduce to success and failure? The results of such operations
merely touch the fancy: it is the tracing of the designs of the

it is the following in detail of each step that can educate the

this great man's strategic skill, courage, and ability, when one
looks to the length of time during which he displayed those
qualities; and realises to one's self the pitched battles, the
skirmishes and sieges, the revolutions and counter-revolutions
of states, the vicissitudes of fortune, and in fact the course of
his design and its execution in its entirety? For sixteen continuous years Hannibal maintained the war with
<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, without once releasing his army
from service in the field, but keeping those vast numbers
under control, like a good pilot, without any sign of disaffection
towards himself or towards each other, though he had troops
in his service who, so far from being of the same tribe, were not
even of the same race. He had Libyans, Iberians, Ligurians,
Celts, Phoenicians, Italians, Greeks, who had naturally nothing
in common with each other, neither laws, nor customs, nor
language. Yet the skill of the commander was such, that
these differences, so manifold and so wide, did not disturb the
obedience to one word of command and to a single will. And yet
circumstances were not by any means unvarying: for though
the breeze of fortune often set strongly in his favour, it as often
also blew in exactly the opposite direction. There is therefore
good ground for admiring Hannibal's display of ability in
campaign; and there can be no fear in saying that, if he had
reserved his attack upon the Romans until he had first subdued
other parts of the world, there is not one of his projects which
would have eluded his grasp. As it was, he began with those
whom he should have attacked last, and accordingly began
and ended his career with them. . . .

towns in which they had wintered, advanced to
within a short distance of Ilipa and there encamped; forming his entrenchment at the
foot of the mountains, with a plain in front of
him well suited for a contest and battle. His
infantry amounted to seventy thousand, his
cavalry to four thousand, and his elephants to thirty-two.
On his part, Scipio sent M. Junius Silanus to
visit Colichas and take over from him the forces
that had been prepared by him. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio advances into <placeName key="tgn,7002758">Baetica</placeName>,</note> These
amounted to three thousand infantry and five hundred horse.
The other allies he received personally in the course of his
march up the country to his destination. When he approached
Castalo and Baecula, and had there been joined by Marcus
Junius and the troops from Colichas, he found himself in a
position of great perplexity. For without their allies the
Roman forces were not strong enough to risk a battle; yet
to do so, in dependence upon the allies for his hopes of ultimate
success, appeared to him to be dangerous and too venturesome.
In spite however of his perplexity, he was obliged to yield to
the force of circumstances so far as to employ the Iberians;
but he resolved to do so only to make a show of numbers to
the enemy, while he really fought the action
with his own legions. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">and encamps close to the Carthaginian forces.</note> With this purpose in his
mind he got his whole army on the march,
forty-five thousand infantry and three thousand
cavalry; and when he had come within the view of the
Carthaginians, he pitched his camp on some low hills exactly
opposite the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c21" type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Futile Attack by Mago</head>
<p>Mago thought that it would be an excellent moment
to attack the Romans while actually engaged
in making their camp; he therefore rode up
to the entrenchment with the greater part of his
own cavalry and Massanissa with the Numidians, persuaded
that he should catch Scipio off his guard. Scipio had however
<pb n="66"/>  all along foreseen this, and had placed some cavalry
equal in number to those of the Carthaginians under cover
of some hills. Upon these making an unexpected charge,
many of the enemy's horsemen at once took to flight at the
startling appearance, and began to make off; while the rest
closed with their opponents and fought with great gallantry.
But the Carthaginians were disconcerted by the agility of some
of the Roman horsemen in dismounting, and after a short
resistance they retreated with considerable loss. The retreat
was at first conducted in good order: but as the Romans
pressed them hard, they broke up their squadrons, and fled for
safety to their own camp. This affair gave the Romans
better spirits for engaging in a pitched battle, and had the
contrary effect on the Carthaginians. However, during the
next few days they both drew out on the intervening plain;
skirmished with their cavalry and light-armed troops; and, after
thus trying each other's mettle, were resolved to bring the matter
to the test of a general engagement.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c22" type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Defeat of Hasdrubal Son of Gesco</head>
<p>On this occasion Scipio appears to have employed a
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio resolves on a general engagement, and alters his disposition

two-fold stratagem. Hasdrubal had been accustomed to make
his demonstrations in force somewhat late in the day, with the
Libyans in his centre, and the elephants on either wing; while
his own practice had been to make his counter-movements somewhat later still, with the Roman soldiers on his centre opposite
the Libyans, and the Iberians on his two wings; but the day
on which he resolved upon a general engagement,
by reversing this arrangement, he greatly contributed to secure the victory for his own men, and
succeeded in putting the enemy at a considerable disadvantage. For directly it was light he
sent his aides with orders to the tribunes and
men to arm, as soon as they had got their
breakfasts, and parade outside the camp. The
order was obeyed with alacrity because the men
suspected what was going to take place. He then sent the
cavalry and light-armed forward, with orders to advance close
to the enemy's camp, and skirmish boldly up to it; while he
himself marched out with the infantry, just as the sun was
appearing above the horizon; and on reaching the middle of
<pb n="67"/>
the plain, made his dispositions in the reverse order to his
usual arrangement, placing the Iberians in the centre and the
Roman legionaries on the two wings.</p>
<p>The sudden approach of the cavalry to their camp, and the
simultaneous appearance of the rest of the army getting into
order, left the Carthaginians barely time to get under arms.
Hasdrubal was therefore obliged, without waiting for the men
to get breakfast, or making any preparations, to despatch his
cavalry and light-armed troops at once against the enemy's
cavalry on the plain, and to get his infantry into order on
some level ground not far from the skirts of the mountains, as
was their custom. For a time the Romans remained quiet;
but when the morning was getting on, and the engagement
between the light-armed troops still continued undecided,
because such of them as were forced from their ground retired on their own heavy infantry and then formed again for
attack, Scipio at length thought that the time was come. He
withdrew his skirmishers through the intervals of the maniples,
and then distributed them equally between the two wings on
rear of his line, first the velites and behind them the cavalry.
He then advanced, at first in line direct; but when he was
about a stade<note anchored="yes">Or, according to another reading "five stades."
<bibl n="Liv. 28.14">Livy, 28, 14</bibl>, says <quote lang="la">quingentos passus.</quote></note> from the enemy, he ordered the Iberians to
continue the advance in the same order, while he commanded
the maniples and squadrons on the right wing to turn outwards to the right, and those on the left wing to the left.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Scipio Outflanks the Enemy</head>
<p>Scipio with the three leading squadrons of cavalry from
the right wing, preceded by the usual number of velites and three
maniples (a combination of troops which the Romans call a
cohort), and Lucius Marcius and Marcus Junius with a similar
force from the left wing, turned the one to the left the other to
the right, and advanced at a great speed in column upon the
enemy, the troops in succession forming up and following in
column as they wheeled. When these troops were within a short
distance of the enemy,&mdash;the Iberians in the line direct being
still a considerable distance behind, because they were advancing at a deliberate pace,&mdash;they came into contact with the two
wings of the enemy simultaneously, the Roman forces being in
<pb n="68"/>
column, according to Scipio's original plan. The movements subsequent to this, which resulted in the troops
on the rear finding themselves in the same line as the
troops in front, and engaged like them with the enemy,
were exactly the converse of each other&mdash;taking the right
and left wings in general, and the cavalry and infantry in particular. For the cavalry and velites on the right wing
came into line on the right and tried to outflank the
enemy, while the heavy infantry came into line on the left;
but on the left wing the heavy infantry came into line by the
right, the cavalry and velites by the left. The result of this
movement was that, as far as the cavalry and light infantry
were concerned, their right became their left. Scipio cared little
for this, but was intent on something more important, namely,
the outflanking of the enemy. For while a general ought
to be quite alive to what is taking place, and rightly so, he
ought to use whatever movements suit the circumstances.</p></div2>

<p>When these troops were at close quarters the elephants
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The elephants.</note>
were severely handled, being wounded and
harassed on every side by the velites and
cavalry, and did as much harm to their friends as to their foes;
for they rushed about promiscuously and killed every one that
fell in their way on either side alike. As to the infantry,&mdash;
the Carthaginian wings began to be broken, but the centre
occupied by the Libyans, and which was the best part of the
army, was never engaged at all. It could not quit its ground
to go to the support of the wings for fear of the attack of the
Iberians, nor could it by maintaining its position do any actual
fighting, because the enemy in front of it did not come to close
quarters. However, for a certain time the two wings fought
gallantly, because it was for them, as for the enemy, a struggle
for life and death. But now the midday heat was become intense, and the Carthaginians began to feel faint, because the
unusual time at which they had been forced to come on the
field had prevented them from fortifying themselves with the
proper food; while the Romans had the advantage in physical
vigour as well as in cheerfulness, which was especially promoted
by the fact that the prudence of their general had secured his
best men being pitted against the weakest troops of the enemy.
<pb n="69"/>
Thus hard pressed Hasdrubal's centre began to retreat; at first
step by step; but soon the ranks were broken, and the men
rushed in confusion to the skirts of the mountain; and on the
Romans pressing in pursuit with still greater violence, they
began a headlong flight into their entrenchments. Had not
Providence interfered to save them, they would promptly have
been driven from their camp too; but a sudden storm
gathered in the air, and a violent and prolonged torrent of
rain descended, under which the Romans with difficulty
effected a return to their own camp. . . .</p>

in the Roman camp, Scipio, though he had
now had a very adequate experience of the
difficulties of administration, never felt himself more at a loss how to act or in greater
embarrassment. And naturally so. For as
in the case of the body, causes of mischief,
such as cold, heat, fatigue, or wounds, may be avoided
by precautions, or easily relieved when they occur; while those
which arise from within the body itself, such as tumours or
diseases, are difficult to foresee and difficult to relieve when
they do exist, so it is, we must believe, with political and
military administration. Against plots from without, and the
attacks of enemies, the precautions to be taken and the
measures for relief may readily be learned by those who pay
the requisite attention; but to decide on the right method of
resisting intestine factions, revolutions, and disturbances is
difficult, and requires great tact and extreme acuteness; and,
moreover, the observation of one maxim suitable in my
opinion to all armies, states, and bodies alike, which is this:
never in such cases to allow any lengthened idleness or repose,
and least of all at a time of success and when provisions are
abundant.</p>
<p>Being, then, as I have all along said, a man eminently
careful, acute, and prompt, Scipio summoned a meeting of the
military tribunes and proposed a solution of the existing
troubles as follows. He said that "he must promise the
soldiers the settlement of their pay; and, in order to create a
belief in his promise, he must now take public steps to exact
with all speed the contributions which had been already
imposed upon the cities for the support of the whole army,
with the distinct understanding that the object of that measure
was the settlement of the pay: and these same tribunes
should return to the army and urge and entreat the men
to abandon their rebellious spirit, and come to him to receive
their pay, either singly or, if they preferred it, in a body. And
<pb n="71"/>
when this was done he would consider, as circumstances arose,
what measures it was necessary to take."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c26" type="chapter" n="26">
<head>Scipio's Plan to Punish the Rebels</head>
<p>With this suggestion in their minds these officers
deliberated on the means of raising money; and having
communicated their decisions to Scipio, he said that he would
now consult them on the next necessary step. They accordingly resolved that they would name a day on which all were
to appear; and that then they would pardon the general body
of the men, but severely punish the instigators of the mutiny,
who were as many as thirty-five. The day having arrived, and
the mutineers having appeared to make terms and receive their
pay, Scipio gave secret instructions to the tribunes, who had
been sent on the mission to them, to meet them; and, each
of them selecting five of the ringleaders, to greet them with
politeness and invite them, if possible, to their own tent, or,
if they could not do that, to dinner or some such entertainment. But to the troops with him he sent round orders
to have provisions for a considerable period ready in three
days' time, because they were to march against the deserter
Andobales under Marcus Silanus. When they heard this
the mutineers were much emboldened, because they imagined that they would have everything in their own hands,
as the other troops would be gone by the time they joined
the general.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c27" type="chapter" n="27">
<head>Suppression of the Mutiny</head>
<p>Upon the approach of the mutineers, Scipio gave orders
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The mutiny suppressed and the ringleaders executed at New Carthage.</note>
to his army to march out the next morning at
daybreak with their baggage. But he instructed
the tribunes and praefects that, as soon as they
met the mutineers, they should order their men
to put down their baggage, and keep them
under arms at the city gate; and then, placing a detachment at
each of the gates, take good care that none of the mutineers
should leave the city. The officers who had been sent to
meet the men fell in with them on their arrival, and took the
ringleaders with every appearance of civility to their own tents,
in accordance with the arrangement that had been made. At
the same time orders had been given to them to arrest the
thirty-five immediately after dinner, and to keep them in fetters:
without allowing any one in the tent to go out, except the
<pb n="72"/>
messenger who was to inform the general from each of them
that this had been accomplished.</p>
<p>The tribunes having done as they were ordered, at daybreak next morning,
seeing that the new arrivals were collected<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's speech to the mutineers.</note>
in the market-place, the general gave the signal for the assembly of the army. The signal was as usual promptly obeyed
by all, for they were curious to see how the general would
demean himself in their presence, and what he would say to
them about the business in hand. As soon as they were come
together, Scipio sent word to the tribunes to bring their
soldiers under arms, and station them round the assembled
men. He then came forward himself. His first appearance
caused an immediate change of feeling. The
soldiers supposed that he was still unwell, and
when they suddenly saw him, contrary to all
expectations, with all the appearance of full health and strength,
they were struck with terror.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c28" type="chapter" n="28">
<head>Scipio Harangues the Mutinous Troops</head>
<p>He began his speech by saying that he wondered what
their grievances were, or what they looked for forward that
induced them to mutiny. For that there were three motives
only on which men usually venture to rebel against their
country and their commanders,&mdash;discontent and anger with
their officers; dissatisfaction with their present position; or,
lastly, hopes of something better and more glorious. "Now, I
ask you," he continued, "which of these can you allege? It is
with me, I presume, that you are dissatisfied, because I did not
pay you your wages. But this cannot be laid to my charge; for
while I was in office your pay was never short. The fault then
may lie with <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> that the accumulated arrears have not been
settled. Which was your proper course then in that case?
To have brought forward your complaint thus, as rebels and
enemies to the country that nurtured you, or to have come
personally to me and stated your case, and to have begged
your friends to support and help you? The latter would
have been the better plan in my opinion. In those who
serve others for pay it is sometimes pardonable to revolt
against their paymasters; but in the case of those who are
fighting for themselves, for their own wives and children, it
can in no circumstances be conceded. It is just as though, on
<pb n="73"/>
the plea of being wronged in money matters by his own father,
a man were to come in arms to slay him from whom he received his own life. Or perhaps you may allege that I
imposed greater hardships and dangers on you than on the
others, and gave the rest more than their share of profits and
booty. But you can neither venture to say this, nor, if you
did venture, could you prove it. What then is your grievance
against me at this moment, I should like to ask, that you have
mutinied? I believe that not one of you will be able to express
or even conceive it.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b11c29" type="chapter" n="29">
<head>Scipio's Speech Continued</head>
<p>"Nor again can it have been any dissatisfaction with
the position of affairs. For when was any prosperity greater?
When has <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> won more victories, when have her arms
had brighter prospects than now? But perhaps some faint-heart will say that
our enemies have more numerous advantages, fairer and more certain prospects than ourselves.
Which, pray, of these enemies? Is it Andobales and
Mandonius? But which of you is ignorant of the fact that
these men first betrayed the Carthaginians and joined us,
and now once more, in defiance of their oaths and pledges,
have come forward as our opponents? It is a fine thing
surely to become the enemies of your country in reliance on
such men as these! Nor again had you any prospect of becoming masters of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Iberia</placeName> by your own prowess: for you would not
have been strong enough, even in conjunction with Andobales,
to meet us in the field, to say nothing of doing so without
such aid. I should like then to ask,&mdash;what was it in which
you trusted? Surely not in the skill and valour of the leaders
whom you have now elected, or in the fasces and axes which
were borne in front of them,&mdash;men of whom I will not deign
to say even another word. All this, my men, is absolutely
futile; nor will you be able to allege even the smallest just
complaint against me or your country. Wherefore I will
undertake your defence to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and myself, by putting forward a plea which all the world will acknowledge to hold good.
And it is that, <emph>a crowd is ever easily misled and easily induced

which in its own nature is safe and quiet; but, when winds fall
violently upon it, assumes the character of the blasts which

lash it into fury: thus a multitude also is ever found to be
what its leaders and counsellors are. Acting on this consideration, I and all my fellow-officers hereby offer you pardon
and amnesty for the past: but to the guilty authors of the
mutiny we are resolved to show no mercy, but to punish them
as their misconduct to their country and to ourselves deserves."</p></div2>

<head>Execution of the Ringleaders</head>
<p>Just as he said these words, the soldiers, who were
posted under arms round the assembly, clashed their swords
against their shields; and at the same instant
the ringleaders of the mutiny were brought in,
stripped and in chains. But such terror was
inspired in the men by the threatening aspect of the surrounding troops, and by the dreadful spectacle before them, that,
while the ringleaders were being scourged and beheaded, they
neither changed countenance nor uttered a sound, but remained all staring open-mouthed and terrified at what was
going on. So the ringleaders of the mischief were scourged
and dragged off through the crowd dead; but the rest of the
men accepted with one consent the offer of an amnesty from
the general and officers; and then voluntarily came forward, one
by one, to take an oath to the tribunes that they would obey
the orders of their commanders and remain loyal to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>.</p>

of them all as a partner in the struggle, but I will undertake

day he turned some cattle that had accompanied his army into this valley, after giving Caius Laelius
instructions to have the cavalry ready, and some of the tribunes to prepare the velites. The Iberians having at once
made an onslaught upon the cattle, he despatched some of
the velites against them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A skirmish,</note> These two forces became engaged,
and reinforcements being sent to either party
from time to time, a severe infantry skirmishing
took place in the valley. The proper moment for attack being now come, Caius Laelius, having the cavalry prepared as
directed, charged the skirmishers of the enemy, getting between
them and the high ground, so that the greater number of
them were scattered about the valley and killed by the cavalry.
This event roused the barbarians to a furious desire to engage,
that they might not appear to be entirely reduced to despair
<pb n="76"/>
by their previous defeat; and accordingly by daybreak next
day they drew out their whole army for battle. Scipio was
quite ready to give them battle; but when he saw that the
Iberians had come down into the valley in an imprudent
manner, and were stationing, not only their cavalry, but their
infantry also on the level ground, he waited for a time, because
he wished as many of the enemy as possible to take up a
position like that. He felt confidence in his cavalry, and still
more in his infantry; because, in such deliberate and hand-tohand battles as this, his men were vastly superior to the Iberians
both in themselves and in their arms.</p></div2>

<p>When he thought the right time had come he drew

enemy who occupied the foot of the hills;
while against those who had descended
into the valley he led his main force from the camp in four
cohorts, and attacked the infantry. Caius Laelius at the
same time made a detour with the cavalry by the hills, which
stretched from the camp to the valley, and charged the enemy's
horse on the rear; and so kept them occupied with fighting
him. The enemy's infantry therefore, being thus deprived of
the support of the cavalry, on which they had relied in
descending into the valley, were distressed and overmatched
in the battle; while their cavalry was in much the same plight:
for, being surprised on ground of insufficient extent, they fell
into confusion, and lost more men by hurting each other than
by the hands of the enemy; for their own infantry was pressing
upon their flank, and the enemy's infantry on their front, while
his cavalry were attacking on their rear. The battle having
taken this course, the result was that nearly all those who
had descended into the valley lost their lives; while those who
had been stationed on the foot of the hills managed to escape.
These last were the light-armed troops, and formed about a
third of the whole army: with whom Andobales himself contrived to make good his escape to a certain stronghold of great
security. . . .

some who had been such, and so had obtained
the kingdom of Bactria." After adding more
arguments to the same effect, he urged Teleas to act as a
sincere mediator of peace, by urging Antiochus not to grudge
him the royal title and dignity, "for if he did not yield to
this demand, neither of them would be safe: seeing that great
hords of Nomads were close at hand, who were a danger to

<head>Timaeus Wrong about Libya</head>
<p>The excellence of the soil of Libya must excite our
<pb n="80"/>
admiration. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Misstatements of Timaeus about Libya,</note> But one would feel inclined to say of Timaeus,
not merely that he had never studied the
country, but that he was childish and entirely
unintelligent in his notions; completely enslaved to those old traditional stories of Libya being wholly
sandy, parched, and barren. The same too holds good about
its animals. The supply of horses, oxen, sheep, and goats
in it is beyond anything to be found in any other part of the
world; because many of the tribes in Libya do not use cultivated crops, but live on and with their flocks and herds.
Again what writer has failed to mention the vast number and
strength of its elephants, lions, and panthers, or the beauty of
its buffalos, or the size of its ostriches? Of these not one is
to be found in Europe, while Libya is full of them. But
Timaeus, by passing them over without a word, gives, as though
purposely, an impression exactly the reverse of the truth.</p>
<p>And just in the same random way in which he has spoken<note anchored="yes" place="marg">and Corsica,</note>
about Libya, he has also done about the island
called Cyrnus. For, when mentioning it in
his second book, he says that wild goats, sheep, wild oxen,
stags, hares, wolves, and some other animals are plentiful
in it; and that the inhabitants employ themselves in hunting
them, and in fact spend most of their time in that pursuit.
Whereas in this island there are not only no wild goats or wild
oxen, but not even hare, wolf, or stag, or any animal of the
sort, except some foxes, rabbits, and wild sheep. The rabbit
indeed at a distance looks like a small hare; but when taken
in the hand, it is found to be widely different both in appearance and in the taste of its flesh; and it also lives generally
underground.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>The Errors of Timaeus</head>
<p>The idea, however, of all the animals in the island
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">the reason of his mistake.</note>
being wild, has arisen in the following way:
The caretakers cannot keep up with their
animals, owing to the thick woods and rocky
broken nature of the country; but, whenever they wish to collect
them, they stand on some convenient spots and call the beasts
together by the sound of a trumpet; and all of them flock
without fail to their own trumpets. Now, when ships arrive at
the coast. and the sailors see goats or cattle grazing without
<pb n="81"/>
any one with them, and thereupon try to catch them, the
animals will not let them come near them, because they are not
used to them, but will scamper off. But as soon as the keeper
sees the men disembarking and sounds his trumpet, they all
set off running at full speed and collect round the trumpet.
This gives the appearance of wildness; and Timaeus, who
made only careless and perfunctory inquiries, committed himself to a random statement.</p>
<p>Now this obedience to the sound of a trumpet is<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Swine-keeping in Italy.</note>
nothing astonishing. For in Italy the swineherds manage the feeding of their pigs in the
same way. They do not follow close behind
the beasts, as in Greece, but keep some distance in front of
them, sounding their horn every now and then; and the animals follow behind and run together at the sound. Indeed,
the complete familiarity which the animals show with the
particular horn to which they belong seems at first astonishing
and almost incredible. For owing to the populousness and
wealth of the country, the droves of swine in Italy are exceedingly large, especially along the sea coast of the Tuscans
and Gauls: for one sow will bring up a thousand pigs, or sometimes even more. They therefore drive them out from their
night styes to feed, according to their litters and ages. Whence,
if several droves are taken to the same place, they cannot
preserve these distinction of litters; but they of course get
mixed up with each other, both as they are being driven out,
and as they feed, and as they are being brought home.
Accordingly the device of the horn-blowing has been invented
to separate them, when they have got mixed up together, without labour or trouble. For as they feed, one swineherd goes
in one direction sounding his horn, and another in another:
and thus the animals sort themselves of their own accord, and
follow their own horns with such eagerness that it is impossible
by any means to stop or hinder them. But in Greece, when
the swine get mixed up in the oak forests in their search for
the mast, the swineherd who has most assistants and the best
help at his disposal, when collecting his own animals, drives off
his neighbour's also. Sometimes too a thief lies in wait, and
drives them off without the swineherd knowing how he lost
<pb n="82"/>
them; because the beasts straggle a long way from their drivers,
in their eagerness to find acorns, when they are just beginning
to fall. . . .</p>
<div3 type="subsection" n="a">
<p>It is difficult to pardon such errors in Timaeus,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">False criticisms of Timaeus on Theopompus and Ephorus.</note>
considering how severe he is in criticising the
slips of others. For instance he finds fault with
Theopompus for stating that Dionysius sailed
from Sicily to Corinth in a merchant vessel,
whereas he really arrived in a ship of war. And again he falsely
charges Ephorus with contradicting himself, on the ground
that he asserts that Dionysius the Elder ascended the throne
at the age of twenty-three, reigned forty-two years, and died at
sixty-three. Now no one would say, I think, that this was a
blunder of the historian, but clearly one of the transcriber.
For either Ephorus must be more foolish than Coroebus and
Margites, if he were unable to calculate that forty-two added
to twenty-three make sixty-five; or, if that is incredible in the
case of a man like Ephorus, it must be a mere mistake of the
transcriber, and the carping and malevolent criticism of
Timaeus must be rejected.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="b">
<p>Again, in his history of Pyrrhus, he says that the Romans<note anchored="yes" place="marg">His false account of the October horse.</note>
still keep up the memory of the fall of Troy by
shooting to death with javelins a war-horse on
a certain fixed day, because the capture of Troy
was accomplished by means of the "Wooden Horse." This
is quite childish. On this principle, all non-Hellenic nations
must be put down as descendants of the Trojans; for nearly
all of them, or at any rate the majority, when about to
commence a war or a serious battle with an enemy, first kill
and sacrifice a horse. In making this sort of ill-founded
deduction, Timaeus seems to me to show not only want of
knowledge, but, what is worse, a trick of misapplying knowledge.
For, because the Romans sacrifice a horse, he immediately
concludes that they do it because Troy was taken by means of
a horse.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="c">
<p>These instances clearly show how worthless his account
of Libya, Sardinia, and, above all, of Italy is; and that, speaking
<pb n="83"/>  generally, he has entirely neglected the most important
element in historical investigation, namely, the
making personal inquiries. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The reason of his mistakes a want of care in making inquiries.</note> For as historical

as it is impossible for the same man to be in

of as many people as possible; and to believe those who are
worthy of credit; and to show critical sagacity in judging of

<p>And though Timaeus makes great professions on this<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Nor is he to be trusted even in matters that fell under his own observation.</note>
head, he appears to me to be very far from arriving
at the truth. Indeed, so far from making accurate
investigations of the truth through other people,
he does not tell us anything trustworthy even of
events of which he has been an eye-witness, or
of places he has personally visited. This will be made evident,
if we can convict him of being ignorant, even in his account
of Sicily, of the facts which he brings forward. For it will
require very little further proof of his inaccuracy, if he can be
shown to be ill-informed and misled about the localities in
which he was born and bred, and that too the most famous
of them. Now he asserts that the fountain Arethusa at
Syracuse has its source in the Peloponnese, from
the river Alpheus, which flows through Arcadia
and Olympia. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Arethusa.</note> For that this river sinks into the earth, and,
after being carried for four thousand stades under the Sicilian
Sea, comes to the surface again in Syracuse; and that this was
proved from the fact that on a certain occasion a storm of
rain having come on during the Olympic festival, and the
river having flooded the sacred enclosure, a quantity of dung
from the animals used for sacrifice at the festival was thrown
up by the fountain Arethusa; as well as a certain gold cup,
which was picked up and recognised as being one of the
ornaments used at the festival. . . .</p></div3></div2>

<head>Aristotle's Account of Locri is Correct</head>
<p>I happened to have visited the city of the Locrians on
<pb n="84"/>
several occasions, and to have been the means of doing them
important services. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The traditions of the colonisation of Locri Epizephyrii agree with
the account in Aristotle, rather than with that of Timaeus.</note> For it was I that secured
their exemption from the service in Iberia and
Dalmatia, which, in accordance with the treaty,
they were bound to supply to the Romans,
And being released thereby from considerable
hardship, danger, and expense, they rewarded
me with every mark of honour and kindness. I have therefore reason to speak well of the Locrians
rather than the reverse. Still I do not shrink from saying
and writing that the account of their colonisation given by
Aristotle is truer than that of Timaeus. For I know for
certain that the inhabitants themselves acknowledge that the
report of Aristotle, and not of Timaeus, is the one which they
have received from their ancestors. And they give the following proofs of this. In the first place, they stated that every
ancestral distinction existing among them is traced by the female
not the male side.<note anchored="yes">Cp. a similar custom of the Lycians, <bibl n="Hdt. 1.173">Herod. 1, 173</bibl>.</note> For instance, those are reckoned noble
among them who belong to "the hundred families"; and these
"hundred families" are those which were marked out by the
Locrians, before embarking upon their colonisation, as those
from which they were in accordance with the oracle to select the
virgins to be sent to Ilium. Further, that some of these women
joined the colony: and that it is their descendants who are
now reckoned noble, and called "the men of the hundred
families." Again, the following account of the "cup-bearing"
priestess had been received traditionally by them. When they
ejected the Sicels who occupied this part of Italy, finding that
it was a custom among them for the processions at their sacrifices to be led by a boy of the most illustrious and high-born
family obtainable, and not having any ancestral custom of their
own on the subject, they adopted this one, with no other improvement than that of substituting a girl
for one of their boys as cupbearer, because nobility with them went by the female line.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>The Epizephyrian Locrians</head>
<p>And as to a treaty, none ever existed, or was said
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The trick of the Locrians.</note>
to have existed, between them and the Locrians in Greece; but they all knew by
tradition of one with the Sicels: of which they give the following
<pb n="85"/>  account. When they first appeared, and found the Sicels
occupying the district in which they are themselves now
dwelling, these natives were in terror of them, and admitted
them through fear into the country; and the newcomers made
a sworn agreement with them that "they would be friendly
and share the country with them, as long as they stood upon
the ground they then stood upon, and kept heads upon their
shoulders." But, while the oaths were being taken, they say
that the Locrians put earth inside the soles of their shoes,
and heads of garlic concealed on their shoulders, before they
swore; and that then they shook the earth out of their shoes,
and threw the heads of garlic off their shoulders, and soon
afterwards expelled the Sicels from the country. This is the
story current at Locri. . . .</p>
<p>By an extraordinary oversight Timaeus of Tauromenium
commits himself to the statement that it was not customary
with the Greeks to possess slaves.<note anchored="yes">He may have been referring to pre-Homeric times,
cp. <cit><bibl n="Hdt. 6.137">Herod. 6, 137,</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ou) ga\r ei(=nai tou=ton to\n xro/non
sfi/si kw ou)de\ toi=si a)/lloisi *(/ellhsi oi)ke/tas.</quote></cit></note> . . .</p>
<p>These considerations would lead us to trust Aristotle rather<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Locri Epizephyrii colonised
by certain slaves who had obtained their freedom, and by some free born women.</note>
than Timaeus. His next statement is still more
strange. For to suppose, with Timaeus, that it
was unlikely that men, who had been the slaves
of the allies of the Lacedaemonians, would continue the kindly feelings and adopt the friendships
of their late masters is foolish. For when they
have had the good fortune to recover their freedom, and a
certain time has elapsed, men, who have been slaves, not only
endeavour to adopt the friendships of their late masters, but
also their ties of hospitality and blood: in fact, their aim is to
keep them up even more than the ties of nature, for the express
purpose of thereby wiping out the remembrance of their former
degradation and humble position; because they wish to pose as
the descendants of their masters rather than as their freedmen.
And this is what in all probability happened in the case of the
Locrians. They had removed to a great distance from all who
knew their secret; the lapse of time favoured their pretensions;
and they were not therefore so foolish as to maintain any
customs likely to revive the memory of their own degradation,
<pb n="86"/>
rather than such as would contribute to conceal it. Therefore they very naturally called their city by the name of that
from which the women came; and claimed a relationship with
those women: and, moreover, renewed the friendships which
were ancestral to the families of the women.</p>
<p>And this also indicates that there is no sign of Aristotle<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Locrians then were naturally friends of Sparta and enemies of Athens.</note>
being wrong in saying that the Athenians
ravaged their territory. For it being quite
natural, as I have shown, that the men who
started from Locri and landed in Italy, if they
were slaves ten times over, should adopt friendly
relations with Sparta, it becomes also natural that the
Athenians should be rendered hostile to them, not so much
from regard to their origin as to their policy.</p>
<p>It is not, again, likely that the Lacedaemonians should themselves send their young men
home from the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The reason of the women of Locris (in Greece) leaving their homes with the slaves.</note>
camp for the sake of begetting children, and
should refuse to allow the Locrians to do the
same. Two things in such a statement are not
only improbable but untrue. In the first place,
they were not likely to have prevented the
Locrians doing so, when they did the same themselves, for
that would be wholly inconsistent: nor were the Locrians, in
obedience to orders from them, likely to have adopted a
custom like theirs. (For in Sparta it is a traditional law, and a
matter of common custom, for three or four men to have one
wife, and even more if they are brothers; and when a man
has begotten enough children, it is quite proper and usual for
him to sell his wife to one of his friends.) The fact is, that
though the Locrians, not being bound by the same oath as
the Lacedaemonians, that they would not return home till they
had taken Messene, had a fair pretext for not taking part in
the common expedition;<note anchored="yes" resp="fww">lines 32 and 33: "had a fair pretext for not taking part in the common expedition" should
read "very naturally took no part in the general despatch of men home to their wives."</note>  yet, by returning home only one by
one, and at rare intervals, they gave their wives an opportunity
of becoming familiar with the slaves instead of their original
husbands, and still more so the unmarried women. And this
was the reason of the migration. . . .</p></div2>

<head>Timaeus and the Character of a Historian</head>
<p>Timaeus makes many untrue statements; and he appears
<pb n="87"/>
to have done so, not from ignorance, but because his view was

up his mind to blame or praise, he forgets everything else and outsteps all bounds of propriety.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Timaeus and Aristotle.</note>
So much for the nature of Aristotle's account of Locri, and the
grounds on which it rested. But this naturally leads me to
speak of Timaeus and his work as a whole, and generally of
what is the duty of a man who undertakes to write history.
Now I think that I have made it clear from what I have said,
first, that both of them were writing conjecturally; and,
secondly, that the balance of probability was on the side of
Aristotle. It is in fact impossible in such matters to be
positive and definite. But let us even admit that Timaeus gives
the more probable account. Are the maintainers of the less
probable theory, therefore, to be called by every possible term
of abuse and obloquy, and all but be put on trial for their lives?
Certainly not. Those who make untrue statements in their

deliberate intention that ought to be attacked without mercy.</p></div2>

that he "has audaciously slandered Locri by
affirming that the colony was formed by runaway
slaves, adulterers, and man-catchers." Further, he asserts that
Aristotle made this statement, "in order that men might believe
him to have been one of Alexander's generals, and to have lately
conquered the Persians at the Cilician Gates in
a pitched battle by his own ability; and not to
be a mere pedantic sophist, universally unpopular, who had a

he says that he "pushed his way into every palace and tent:"

<head>Timaeus's Statement of Method</head>
<p>Let us now, then, examine the method of Timaeus, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Timaeus's account of his investigations in the history of the colony of Locri.</note>
compare his account of this colony, that we may
learn which of the two better deserves such
vituperation. He says in the same book: "I
am not now proceeding on conjecture, but have
investigated the truth in the course of a personal
visit to the Locrians in Greece. The Locrians first of all showed
me a written treaty which began with the words, 'as parents
to children.' There are also existing decrees securing mutual
rights of citizenship to both. In fine, when they were told of
Aristotle's account of the colony, they were astonished at the
audacity of that writer. I then crossed to the Italian Locri
and found that the laws and customs there accorded with the
theory of a colony of free men, not with the licentiousness of
slaves. For among them there are penalties assigned to man-catchers, adulterers, and run-away slaves. And this would not
have been the case if they were conscious of having been such
themselves."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c10" type="chapter" n="10">
<head>The Investigations of Timaeus</head>
<p>Now the first point one would be inclined to raise is, as
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Criticism of the above statement of Timaeus.</note>
to what Locrians he visited and questioned on
these subjects. If it had been the case that the
Locrians in Greece all lived in one city, as
those in Italy do, this question would perhaps have been
unnecessary, and everything would have been plain. But as
there are two clans of Locrians, we may ask, Which of the two
did he visit? What cities of the one or the other? In whose
hands did he find the treaty? Yet we all know, I suppose,
that this is a speciality of Timaeus's, and that it is in this that
he has surpassed all other historians, and rests his chief claim
to credit,&mdash;I mean his parade of accuracy in studying chronology
and ancient monuments, and his care in that department of
research. Therefore we may well wonder how he came to
omit telling us the name of the city in which he found the
treaty, the place in which it was inscribed, or the magistrates
<pb n="89"/>
who showed him the inscription, and with whom he conversed:
to prevent all cavil, and, by defining the place and city, to
enable those who doubted to ascertain the truth. By omitting
these details he shows that he was conscious of having told a
deliberate falsehood. For that Timaeus, if he really had
obtained such proofs, would not have let them slip, but would
have fastened upon them with both hands, as the saying is, is
proved by the following considerations. Would a writer who
tried to establish his credit on that of Echecrates,&mdash;he mentioning him by name as the person with whom he had conversed,
and from whom he had obtained his facts about the Italian
Locri,&mdash;taking the trouble to add, by way of showing that he
had been told them by no ordinary person, that this man's
father had formerly been entrusted with an embassy by
Dionysius,&mdash;would such a writer have remained silent about it
if he had really got hold of a public record or an ancient
tablet?</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Timaeus's Use of Chronological Records</head>
<p>This is the man forsooth who drew out a comparative
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Timaeus and the Olympic registers.</note>
list of the Ephors and the kings of Sparta from
the earliest times; as well as one comparing the
Archons at Athens and priestesses in Argos with
the list of Olympic victors, and thereby convicted those cities
of being in error about those records, because there was a
discrepancy of three months between them! This again is
the man who discovered the engraved tablets in the inner
shrines, and the records of the guest-friendships on the doorposts of the temples. And we cannot believe that such a man
could have been ignorant of anything of this sort that existed,
or would have omitted to mention it if he had found it. Nor
can he on any ground expect pardon, if he has told an untruth
about it: for, as he has shown himself a bitter and uncompromising critic of others, he must naturally look for equally
uncompromising attacks from them.</p>
<p>Being then clearly convicted of falsehood in these points, he
goes to the Italian Locri: and, first of all, says that the two
Locrian peoples had a similar constitution and the same
ties of amity, and that Aristotle and Theophrastus have
maligned the city. Now I am fully aware that in going into
minute particulars and proofs on this point I shall be forced
<pb n="90"/>
to digress from the course of my history. It was for that reason
however that I postponed my criticism of Timaeus to a
single section of my work, that I might not be forced again
and again to omit other necessary matter. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Timaeus On Divination</head>
<p>Timaeus says that the greatest fault in history is want
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Timaeus condemned out of his own mouth.</note>
of truth; and he accordingly advises all, whom
he may have convicted of making false statements in their writings, to find some other
name for their books, and to call them anything they like
except history. . . .</p>
<p>For example, in the case of a carpenter's rule, though it
may be too short or too narrow for your purpose, yet if it have
the essential feature of a rule, that of straightness, you may
still call it a rule; but if it has not this quality, and deviates
from the straight line, you may call it anything you like except
a rule. "On the same principle," says he, "historical writings
may fail in style or treatment or other details; yet if they hold
fast to truth, such books may claim the title of history, but if
they swerve from that, they ought no longer to be called
history." Well, I quite agree that in such writings truth
should be the first consideration: and, in fact, somewhere
in the course of my work I have said "that as in a living
body, when the eyes are out, the whole is rendered useless, so
if you take truth from history what is left is
but an idle tale." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">See <ref target="b1c14" targOrder="U">1, 14</ref>.</note> I said again, however,
that "there were two sorts of falsehoods, the ignorant and
the intentional; and the former deserved indulgence, the
latter uncompromising severity." . . . These points being
agreed upon&mdash;the wide difference between the ignorant and
intentional lie, and the kindly correction due to the one and
the unbending denunciation to the other&mdash;it will be found
that it is to the latter charge that Timaeus more than any one
lays himself open. And the proof of his character in this
respect is clear. . . .</p>

<pb n="91"/>  "Locrians and a treaty." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The proverb <foreign lang="greek">*lokroi\ ta\s sunqh/kas.</foreign></note>
An explanation given of this, equally accepted by historians and the rest of
the world, is that, at the time of the invasion of
the Heracleidae, the Locrians agreed with the
Peloponnesians that, if the Heracleidae did not enter by way of
the isthmus, but crossed at Rhium, they would raise a war
beacon, that they might have early intelligence and make
provisions to oppose their entrance. The Locrians, however,
did not do this, but, on the contrary, raised a beacon of peace;
and therefore, when the Heracleidae arrived opposite Rhium,
they crossed without resistance; while the Peloponnesians,
having taken no precautions, found that they had allowed
their enemies to enter their country, because they had been
betrayed by the Locrians. . . .</p>

in which Timaeus stands. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Callisthenes.</note> He remarks that
"Callisthenes was a mere sycophant for writing
stuff of this sort; and acted in a manner utterly unworthy of
his philosophy in giving heed to ravens and inspired women;
and that he richly deserved the punishment which he met with
at the hands of Alexander, for having corrupted the mind of
that monarch as far as he could." On the other hand, he
commends Demosthenes, and the other orators who flourished
at that time, and says that "they were worthy of Greece for
speaking against the divine honours given to Alexander; while
this philosopher, for investing a mere mortal with the aegis and
thunderbolt, justly met the fate which befell him from the hands
of providence. . . ."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c13" type="chapter" n="13">
<head>Timaeus On Demochares and Agathocles</head>
<p>Timaeus asserts that Demochares was guilty of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Demochares.</note>
unnatural lust, and that his lips therefore were
unfit to blow the sacred fire; and that in morals
<pb n="92"/>
he went beyond any stories told by Botrys and Philaenis
and all other writers of indecent tales. Foul abuse and
shameless accusations of this sort are not only what no man of
cultivation would have uttered, they go beyond what you
might expect from the lowest brothels. It is, however, to get
credit for the foul and shameless accusations, which he is
always bringing, that he has maligned this man: supporting his
charge by dragging in an obscure comic poet. Now on what
grounds do I conjecture the falsity of the accusation? Well,
first, from the fact of the good birth and education of
Demochares; for he was a nephew of Demosthenes. And in
the second place, from the fact that he was thought worthy at
Athens, not only of being a general, but of the other offices
also; which he certainly would not have obtained, if he had
got into such troubles as these. Therefore it seems to me
that Timaeus is accusing the people of Athens more than
Demochares, if it is the fact that they committed the interests
of the country and their own lives to such a man. For if it
had been true, the comic poet Archedicus would not have
been the only one to have made this statement concerning
Demochares, as Timaeus alleges: it would have been repeated
by many of the partisans of Antipater, against whom he has
spoken with great freedom, and said many things calculated to
annoy, not only Antipater himself, but also his successors and
friends. It would have been repeated also by many of his political opponents: and among them, by Demetrius of Phalerum,
against whom Demochares has inveighed with extraordinary
bitterness in his History, alleging that "his conduct as a
prince, and the political measures on which he prided himself,
were such as a petty tax-gatherer might be proud of; for he
boasted that in his city things were abundant and cheap, and
every one had plenty to live upon." And he tells another
story of Demetrius, that "He was not ashamed to have a
procession in the theatre led by an artificial snail, worked by
some internal contrivance, and emitting slime as it crawled,
and behind it a string of asses; meaning by this to indicate
the slowness and stupidity of the Athenians, who had yielded
to others the honour of defending Greece, and were tamely
submissive to Cassander." Still, in spite of these taunts,
<pb n="93"/>
neither Demetrius nor any one else has ever brought such a
charge against Demochares.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>No Place in History for Abusive Language</head>
<p>Relying therefore on the testimony of his own countrymen, as safer ground than the virulence of Timaeus, I feel no
hesitation in declaring that the life of Demochares is not
chargeable with such enormities. But even supposing that
Demochares had ever so disgraced himself, what need was
there for Timaeus to insert this passage in his History? Men
of sense, when resolved to retaliate upon a personal enemy,
think first, not of what he deserves, but of what it is becoming
in them to do. So in the case of abusive language: the first
consideration should be, not what our enemies deserve to be
called, but what our self respect will allow us to call them.
But if men measure everything by their own ill temper and
jealousy, we are forced to be always suspicious of them, and
to be ever on our guard against their exaggeration. Wherefore, in the present instance, we may fairly reject the stories to
the discredit of Philochares told by Timaeus; for he has put
himself out of the pale of indulgence or belief, by so obviously
allowing his native virulence to carry him beyond all bounds
of propriety in his invectives.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>Timaeus Blinded by Personal Malignity</head>
<p>For my part I cannot feel satisfied with his abuse of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Agathocles defended against the aspersions of Timaeus.</note>
Agathocles either, even admitting him to have
been the worst of men. I refer to the passage
at the end of his History in which he asserts
that in his youth Agathocles was "a common
stale, extravagantly addicted to every unnatural vice," and
that "when he died, his wife in the course of her lamentations
exclaimed Ah, what have I not done for you I what have you
not done to me?" To such language one can only repeat
what has been already said in the case of Demochares, and
express one's astonishment at such extravagant virulence.
For that Agathocles must have had fine natural qualities is
evident from the narrative of Timaeus itself. That a man who
came as a runaway slave to Syracuse, from the potter's wheel
and smoke and clay, at the early age of eighteen, should have
within a short time advanced from that humble beginning to
be master of all Sicily, and after being a terror to the Carthaginians, should have grown old in office and died in enjoyment of
<pb n="94"/>
the royal title,&mdash;does not this prove that Agathocles had some
great and admirable qualities, and many endowments and talents
for administration? In view of these the historian ought not
to have recounted to posterity only what served to discredit
and defame this man, but those facts also which were to his
honour. For that is the proper function of history. Blinded,
however, by personal malignity, he has recorded for us with
bitterness and exaggeration all his defects; while his eminent
achievements he has passed over in entire silence: seeming
not to be aware that in history such silence is as mendacious
as misstatement. The part of his history, therefore, which was
added by him for the gratification of his personal spite I have
passed over, but not what was really germane to his
subject. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>The Laws of Zaleucus</head>
<p>Two young men had a dispute about the ownership of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The laws of Zaleucus, and an incident in their working
at Locri (for which he legislated, see <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1274a">Arist. <title>Pol.</title> 2, 12</bibl>).</note>
a slave. This slave had been in the possession
of one of them for a long time; but two days
before, as he was going to the farm without his
master, the other laid violent hands upon him
and dragged him to his house. When the first
young man heard of this, he came to the house,
seized the slave, and taking him before the magistrate asserted
his ownership and offered sureties. For the law of Zaleucus
ordained that the party from whom the abduction was made
should have possession of the property in dispute, pending the
decision of the suit. But the other man in accordance with
the same law, alleged that he was the party from whom the
abduction had been made, for the slave had been brought
before the magistrate from his house. The magistrates who
were trying the case were in doubt, and calling in the Cosmopolis<note anchored="yes">For this title see on <ref target="b22c19" targOrder="U">22, 19</ref>.
It is found in inscriptions in Thasos, Crete,
and Cibyra. C. I. G. 2163, c; 2583; 4380, b.</note> referred the point to him. He interpreted the law as
meaning that "the abduction was always from that party in whose
possession the property in dispute had last been for a certain
period unquestioned; but that if another abducted this
property from a holder, and then the original holder repossessed
himself of it from the abductor, this was not abduction in the
<pb n="95"/>
sense of the law." The young man, who thus lost his case,
was not satisfied, and alleged that such was not the intention
of the legislator. Thereupon the Cosmopolis summoned him
to discuss the interpretation in accordance with the law of
Zaleucus; that is, to argue on the interpretation of the law
with him before the court of the one thousand, and with a
halter round the neck of each: whichever should be shown
to be wrong in his interpretation was to lose his life in the sight
of the thousand. But the young man asserted that the
compact was not a fair one, for the Cosmopolis, who happened
to be nearly ninety, had only two or three years of life left,
while in all reasonable probability he had not yet lived half
his life. By this adroit rejoinder the young man turned off the
affair as a jest: but the magistrates adjudged the question
of abduction in accordance with the interpretation of the
Cosmopolis.</p></div2>

<head>A Criticism on Ephorus and Callisthenes</head>
<p>That I may not be thought to detract wantonly from
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Callisthenes and the battle of Issus, B.C. <date value="-333">333</date>.</note>
the credit of such great writers, I will mention
one battle, which is at once one of the most
famous ever fought, and not too remote in
point of time; and at which, above everything
else, Callisthenes was himself present. I mean the battle
between Alexander and Darius in Cilicia. He says that
"Alexander had already got through the pass called the
Cilician Gates: and that Darius, availing himself of that by the
Amanid Gates, made his way with his army into Cilicia; but on
learning from the natives that Alexander was on his way into
Syria, he followed him; and having arrived at the pass leading
to the south, pitched his camp on the bank of the river
Pinarus. The width of the ground from the foot of the
mountain to the sea was not more than fourteen stades,
through which this river ran diagonally. On first issuing from
the mountains its banks were broken, but in its course through
the level down to the sea it ran between precipitous and steep
hills." Starting with this description of the ground, he goes
on to say that "When Alexander's army faced about, and,
<pb n="96"/>
retracing its steps, was approaching to attack them, Darius
and his officers determined to draw up their whole phalanx on
the ground occupied by his encampment, as it then was, and to
defend his front by the river, which flowed right along his
camp." But he afterwards says that Darius "stationed his
cavalry close to the sea, his mercenaries next along the river,
and his peltasts next resting on the mountains."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c18" type="chapter" n="18">
<head>The Battle of Issus</head>
<p>Now it is difficult to understand how he could have
drawn up these troops in front of his phalanx, considering that
the river ran immediately under the camp:<note anchored="yes">Both Curtius and Arrian seem to have found in their authorities that
Darius crossed the Pinarus. Curt. 3, 8; <bibl n="Arr. An. 2.8">Arrian, 2, 8</bibl>.</note> especially as their
numbers were so great, amounting, on Callisthenes's own
showing, to thirty thousand cavalry and thirty thousand
mercenaries. Now it is easy to calculate how much ground
such a force would require. At the most cavalry in a regular
engagement is drawn up eight deep, and between each
squadron a clear space must be left in the line to enable
them to turn or face about. Therefore eight hundred will
cover a stade of front; eight thousand, ten stades;<note anchored="yes">Reckoning the stade at 600 feet (Greek).</note> three
thousand two hundred, four stades; and so eleven thousand
two hundred would cover the whole of fourteen stades. If
therefore he were to put his whole thirty thousand on the
ground, he would have to mass his cavalry alone nearly three
times the usual depth; and then what room is left for his
large force of mercenaries? None, indeed, unless on the
rear of the cavalry. But Callisthenes says this was not the
case, but that these latter engaged the Macedonians first.
We must therefore understand half the front, that nearest
the sea, to have been occupied by the cavalry; the other
half, that nearest the mountains, by the mercenaries. We
may by these data easily calculate the depth of the cavalry,
and the distance the river must have been from the camp to
allow of it.</p>
<p>Again, he says that "on the approach of the enemy Darius
himself, who was on the centre, ordered up the mercenaries
from the wing." It is difficult to see what he means by this:
for the point of junction of the mercenaries and the cavalry
<pb n="97"/>
must have been at the centre. Where and how then, and to
what point could Darius, who was himself actually among the
mercenaries, be said to "order them up"?</p>
<p>Lastly, he says that "the cavalry on the right wing charged
Alexander; and that his men stood the charge gallantly, and,
making a counter charge, kept up an obstinate fight." But he
quite forgets that there was a river between them, a river, too,
of the nature that he had just himself described.<note anchored="yes">See note to previous chapter.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c19" type="chapter" n="19">
<head>Callisthenes Vague on Alexander's Movements</head>
<p>His account of the movements of Alexander are
equally vague. He says that "he crossed into Asia with
forty thousand infantry and four thousand five hundred
cavalry; but that when he was about to enter Cilicia he was
joined by a reinforcement of five thousand infantry and eight
hundred cavalry." From these numbers, if one were to make
the liberal allowance of three thousand absentees from the
infantry and three hundred from the cavalry on various
services, there would still remain forty-two thousand infantry
and five thousand cavalry. Starting with these numbers, he
goes on to say "that Alexander heard of the entrance of
Darius into Cilicia when he was a hundred stades away from
him, having already marched through the pass:<note anchored="yes">The Cilician gates.</note> that he therefore retraced his steps through the pass, his phalanx on
the van, his cavalry next, and his baggage on the rear. But
that as soon as he had debouched upon the open country, he
gave general orders to form up into a phalanx, at first thirty-two
deep; then sixteen; and lastly, when they were nearing the
enemy, eight deep." Now this is a worse blunder than the
last. A stade, allowing for the distances which must be
kept on a march, and reckoning the depth at sixteen, admits
of one thousand six hundred men, each man covering six feet.
It is plain, therefore, that ten stades will admit of only sixteen
thousand men, and twenty twice that number. Hence, when
Alexander caused his men to form sixteen deep, he would
have wanted a width of ground of twenty stades; and even
then, the whole of the cavalry and ten thousand infantry
would have been unaccounted for.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c20" type="chapter" n="20">
<head>Inaccuracies about Tactics</head>
<p>Again, he says that Alexander was marching in line
<pb n="98"/>
when he was about forty stades from the enemy. A greater
blunder it is difficult to conceive. For where could one find
a ground, and especially in Cilicia, twenty stades broad by
forty deep, for a phalanx armed with sarissae to march in line?
It would not be easy to count all the impossibilities in the
way of such an arrangement and such a movement. One
that is mentioned by Callisthenes himself is sufficient to
establish the point. For he remarks that the winter torrents
which descend from the hills make so many gullies in the
plain, that, in the course of the flight, the chief part of the
Persians are said to have lost their lives in deep places of
that kind. But, it may be urged, Alexander wished to be ready
for battle as soon as the enemy were in sight. But what could
be less ready than a phalanx in a disordered and straggling
line? Is it not much easier to form up a phalanx from a
proper column of route, than to bring a disordered and
straggling line back into the same alignment, and get it into
order of battle on a broken and woody ground? It was,
therefore much better to march twice or four times the
ordinary depth of a phalanx<note anchored="yes">That is, sixteen or thirty-two deep.</note> in good order, for which sufficient
ground could possibly be found. And it was easy to deploy his
men quickly into the line of the phalanx, because he was able
by means of scouts to ascertain the presence of the enemy
in plenty of time. But in this case, beside other absurdities,
while bringing his men in line across the level, he did not
even (we are told) put the cavalry in front, but marched with
them in the same alignment.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c21" type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Worst Misstatement of Callisthenes</head>
<p>But the greatest blunder is still to come. "As soon
as Alexander," he says, "was within distance of the enemy
he caused his men to take up order eight deep," which would
have necessitated ground forty stades wide for the length of
the line; and even had they, to use the poet's expression,
"laid shield to shield and on each other leaned," still ground
twenty stades wide would have been wanted, while he himself
says that it was less than fourteen. [We have also to deduct
from these fourteen stades the space occupied by the two
divisions of the cavalry, one on the left next the sea, the other
on the right];<note anchored="yes"> The text here is in hopeless confusion.</note> and to allow for the fact that the whole force
<pb n="99"/>
was kept a considerable distance from the hills, to avoid being
exposed to the enemy occupying the skirts of the mountains;
for we know that Callisthenes represents the wing to have
been facing these, at an angle with the centre. We are also
leaving out of account the ten thousand foot, whom we showed
to be too many according to his own calculation.</p>
<p>The upshot is that eleven stades at most is left for the whole
length of the phalanx, even taking Callisthenes's own account,
in which thirty-two thousand men standing shield to shield must
necessarily be drawn up thirty deep; while he asserts that they
fought eight deep. Such blunders admit of no defence: for
the facts at once demonstrate the impossibility of the assertion.
We have only to compare the space occupied by each man,
the width of the whole ground, and the number of the men,
to prove its falsity.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c22" type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Further Absurdities</head>
<p>It would be tedious to mention all his other absurdities
in connexion with this battle. I must be content with a very few.
He says, for instance, that "Alexander took care in arranging
his order of battle to be himself personally opposed to Darius;
and that at first Darius was equally anxious to be opposite
Alexander, but afterwards altered his mind." But he does not
vouchsafe to tell us how these kings learnt at what part of their
respective forces they were each posted, or to what point in his
own line Darius re-transferred himself. Again, how could a
phalanx mount to the edge of the river bank, when it was precipitous and covered with brushwood? Such a piece of bad
generalship must not be attributed to Alexander, because he is
acknowledged by all to have been a skilful strategist and to
have studied the subject from childhood: we must rather
attribute it to the historian's want of ability to descern between
what is or is not practicable in such movements. So much
for Ephorus and Callisthenes. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Timaeus Exalts Timoleon To Excess</head>
<p>Timaeus attacks Ephorus with great severity, though he

in attacking others for faults of which he is himself guilty, and complete demoralisation, shown
by the opinions which he expresses in his memoirs, and which
he endeavours to implant in the minds of his readers. If we
are to lay it down that Callisthenes deserved his death, what
<pb n="100"/>
ought to happen to Timaeus? Surely there is much more
reason for Providence to be wroth with him than with Callisthenes. The latter wished to deify Alexander; but Timaeus
exalts Timoleon above the most venerable gods. The hero
of Callisthenes, again, was a man by universal consent of a
superhuman elevation of spirit; while Timoleon, far from
having accomplished any action of first-rate importance, never
even undertook one. The one expedition which he achieved
in the course of his life took him no farther than from Corinth
to Syracuse; and how paltry is such a distance when compared
with the extent of the world! I presume that Timaeus
believed that if Timoleon, by gaining glory in such a mere
saucer of a place as Sicily, should be thought comparable to
the most illustrious heroes, he too himself, as the historian of
only Italy and Sicily, might properly be considered on a par
with the writers of universal history. This will be sufficient
defence of Aristotle, Theophrastus, Callisthenes, Ephorus, and
Demochares against the attacks of Timaeus: and it is addressed
to those who believe that this historian is impartial and
truthful. . . .</p></div2>

Horace <cit><bibl n="Hor. Ep. 1.19.6">(<title>Ep.</title> 1, 19, 6)</bibl> <quote lang="la">Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus.</quote></cit></note>
by his fondness for banqueting scenes shows that he is a glutton; and in the
same way Aristotle, by frequently describing rich food in his
writings, betrays his love of dainty living and his greediness."
On the same principle he judges Dionysius the tyrant because
he "was always very particular in the ornamentation of his
dining-couches, and had hangings of exquisite make and
variegated colours." If we apply this principle to Timaeus,
we shall have abundant reason to think badly of him. In
attacking others he shows great acuteness and boldness; when
he comes to independent narrative he is full of dreams,
miracles, incredible myths,&mdash;in a word, of miserable superstition and old wives' tales. The truth is that Timaeus is a proof
<pb n="101"/>
of the fact, that at times, and in the case of many men, want
of skill and want of judgment so completely destroy the value
of their evidence, that though present at and eye-witnesses of
the facts which they record, they might just as well have
been absent or had no eyes. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b12c25" type="chapter" n="25">
<head>General Remarks on Timaeus as an Historian</head>
<p>The story of the brazen bull is this. It was made by
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The brazen bull of phalaris.</note>
Phalaris at Agrigentum; and he used to force
men to get into it, and then by way of punishment light a fire underneath. The metal becoming thus red hot, the man inside was roasted and scorched to
death; and when he screamed in his agony, the sound from
the machine was very like the bellowing of a bull. When the
Carthaginians conquered Sicily this bull was removed from
Agrigentum to Carthage. The trap door between the shoulders,
through which the victims used to be let down, still remains;
and no other reason for the construction of such a bull in Carthage can be discovered at all: yet Timaeus has undertaken to
upset the common story, and to refute the declarations of poets
and historians, by alleging that the bull at Carthage did not come
from Agrigentum, and that no such figure ever existed there;
and he has composed a lengthy treatise to prove this. . . .</p>
<p>What epithet ought one to apply to Timaeus, and what word
will properly characterise him? A man of his kind appears to me
to deserve the very bitterest of the terms which he has applied
to others. It has already been sufficiently proved that he is a
carping, false and impudent writer; and from what remains to
be said he will be shown to be unphilosophical, and, in short,
utterly uninstructed. For towards the end of his twenty-first
book, in the course of his "harangue of Timoleon," he remarks
that "the whole sublunary world being divided into three parts
&mdash;Asia, Libya, and Europe. . . ."<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b3c37" targOrder="U">3, 37</ref>. The point seems to be that the remark was too commonplace
to put into the mouth of a hero.</note> One could scarcely believe such a remark to have come, I don't say from Timaeus,
but even from the proverbial Margites. . . .
<pb n="102"/></p>
<div3 type="subsection" n="a">
<p>The proverb tells us that one drop from the largest
vessel is sufficient to show the whole contents. This is
applicable to the present case. When one or two false statements have been discovered in a history, and they have been
shown to be wilful, it is clear that nothing which such an
historian may say can be regarded as certain or trustworthy.
But in order to convince the more careful student, I must
speak on his method and practice in regard to public speeches,
military harangues, ambassador's orations, and all compositions
of that class; which are, as it were, a compendium of events and
an epitome of all history. Now that he has given these in his
writings with entire disregard of truth, and that of set purpose,
can any reader of Timaeus fail to be aware? He has not
written down the words actually used, nor the real drift of
these speeches; but imagining how they ought to have been
expressed, he enumerates all the arguments used, and makes the
words tally with the circumstances, like a school-boy declaiming on a set theme: as though his object were to display his own
ability, not to give a report of what was in reality said. . . .</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="b">
<p>The special province of history is, first, to ascertain what
the actual words used were; and secondly, to learn why it was
that a particular policy or argument failed or succeeded. For
a bare statement of an occurrence is interesting indeed, but not
instructive: but when this is supplemented by a statement of
cause, the study of history becomes fruitful. For it is by
applying analogies to our own circumstances that we get the
means and basis for calculating the future; and for learning
from the past when to act with caution, and when with greater
boldness, in the present. The historian therefore who omits
the words actually used, as well as all statement of the
determining circumstances, and gives us instead conjectures and
mere fancy compositions, destroys the special use of history.
In this respect Timaeus is an eminent offender, for we all
know that his books are full of such writing.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="c">
<p>But perhaps some one may raise the question as to how
it comes about that, being the sort of writer that I am showing
him to be, he has obtained acceptance and credit among
certain people. The reason is that his work abounds with
hostile criticism and invective against others: and he has been
<pb n="103"/>
judged, not by the positive merits of his own composition and
his independent narrative, but by his skill in refuting his
fellow historians; to which department he appears to me to
have brought great diligence and an extraordinary natural
aptitude. The case of the physicist Strato is almost precisely
similar. As long as this man is endeavouring to discredit
and refute the opinions of others, he is admirable: directly he
brings forward anything of his own, or expounds any of his
own doctrines, he at once seems to men of science to lose his
faculties and become stupid and unintelligent. And for my
part, I look upon this difference in writers as strictly analogous
to the facts of everyday life. In this too it is easy to criticise
our neighbours, but to be faultless ourselves is hard. One
might almost say that those who are most ready at finding
fault with others are most prone to errors in their own life.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="d">
<p>Besides these I may mention another error of Timaeus.
Having stayed quietly at Athens for about fifty years, during
which he devoted himself to the study of written history, he
imagined that he was in possession of the most important
means of writing it. To my mind this was a great mistake.
History and the science of medicine are alike in this respect,
that both may be divided broadly into three departments; and
therefore those who study either must approach them in three
ways. For instance the three departments of medicine are the
rhetorical, the dietetic, and the surgical and pharmaceutical.
[The second of these though important is discredited by some.]<note anchored="yes">The text is again hopeless.</note>
The first, which takes its rise from the school of Herophilus
and Callimachus of Alexandria, does indeed rightly claim a
certain position in medical science; but by its speciousness
and liberal promises acquires so much reputation that those
who are occupied with other branches of the art are supposed to
be completely ignorant. But just bring one of these professors to
an actual invalid: you will find that they are as completely
wanting in the necessary skill as men who have never read a
medical treatise. Nay, it has happened before now that certain
persons, who had really nothing serious the matter with them,
have been persuaded by their powerful arguments to commit
themselves to their treatment, and have thereby endangered
<pb n="104"/>
their lives: for they are like men trying to steer a ship out of
a book. Still such men go from city to city with great <foreign lang="fr">&eacute;cl&acirc;t,</foreign>
and get the common people together to listen to them. But
if, when this is done, they induce certain people to submit as a
specimen to their practical treatment; they only succeed in
reducing them to a state of extreme discomfort, and making
them a laughing stock to the audience.<note anchored="yes">The text is uncertain, and I am not at all sure of
the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">e)p' o)no/matos,</foreign> cp. 25 k, 27. These public harangues of doctors to attract patients
are noticed in Xenophon, <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 4.2.5"><title>Memorab.</title> 4, 2, 5</bibl>.</note> So completely does
a persuasive address frequently get the advantage over practical
experience. The third branch of the medical science, though
it involves genuine skill in the treatment of the several cases, is
not only rare in itself, but is also frequently cast into the shade,
thanks to the folly of popular judgment, by volubility and
impudence.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="e">
<p>In the same way the science of genuine history is
threefold: first, the dealing with written documents and the
arrangement of the material thus obtained; second, topography,
the appearance of cities and localities, the description of rivers
and harbours, and, speaking generally, the peculiar features of
seas and countries and their relative distances; thirdly, political
affairs. Now, as in the case of medicine, it is the last branch
that many attach themselves to, owing to their preconceived
opinions on the subject. And the majority of writers bring
to the undertaking no spirit of fairness at all: nothing but
dishonesty, impudence and unscrupulousness. Like vendors
of drugs, their aim is to catch popular credit and favour, and
to seize every opportunity of enriching themselves. About such
writers it is not worth while to say more.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="f">
<p>But some of those who have the reputation of
approaching history in a reasonable spirit are like the theoretical
physicians. They spend all their time in libraries, and acquire
generally all the learning which can be got from books, and
then persuade themselves that they are adequately equipped
for their task. . . . Yet in my opinion they are only partially
qualified for the production of genuine history. To inspect
ancient records indeed, with the view of ascertaining the notions
entertained by the ancients of certain places, nations, polities
<pb n="105"/>
and events, and of understanding the several circumstances and
contingencies experienced in former times, is useful; for the
history of the past directs our attention in a proper spirit to
the future, if a writer can be found to give a statement of facts
as they really occurred. But to persuade one's self, as Timaeus
does, that such ability in research is sufficient to enable a man
to describe subsequent transactions with success is quite
foolish. It is as though a man were to imagine that an
inspection of the works of the old masters would enable him
to become a painter and a master of the art himself.</p>
<p>This will be rendered still more evident from what
I have<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ephorus was fairly acquainted with naval, but not with military tactics.</note>
now to say, particularly from certain passages
in the history of Ephorus. This writer in his
history of war seems to me to have had some
idea of naval tactics, but to be quite unacquainted with fighting on shore. Accordingly, if one
turns one's attention to the naval battles at Cyprus and Cnidus,
in which the generals of the king were engaged against Evagoras
of Salamis<note anchored="yes">Tyrant of Salamis in Cyprus, B.C. <dateRange from="-404" to="-374">404</dateRange>-374. See Isocrates, <bibl n="Isoc. 10"><title>Orat.</title> x</bibl>.</note> and then
against the Lacedaemonians, one will be struck with admiration of the historian, and will learn many
useful lessons as to what to do in similar circumstances.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-371">371</date>. B.C. <date value="-362">362</date>.</note> But
when he tells the story of the battle of
Leuctra between the Thebans and Lacedaemonians, or again that of Mantinea between the same combatants, in which Epaminondas lost his
life, if in these one examines attentively and in detail the
arrangements and evolutions in the line of battle, the historian
will appear quite ridiculous, and betray his entire ignorance
and want of personal experience of such matters. The battle
of Leuctra indeed was simple, and confined to one division of
the forces engaged, and therefore does not make the writer's
lack of knowledge so very glaring: but that of Mantinea was
complicated and technical, and is accordingly unintelligible,
and indeed completely inconceivable, to the historian. This
will be rendered clear by first laying down a correct plan of
the ground, and then measuring the extent of the movements
as described by him. The same is the case with Theopompus,
and above all with Timaeus, the subject of this book. These
<pb n="106"/>
latter writers also can conceal their ignorance, so long as they
deal with generalities; but directly they attempt minute and
detailed description, they show that they are no better than
Ephorus. . . .</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="g">
<p>It is in fact as impossible to write well on the operations in a war, if a man has had no experience of actual service,
as it is to write well on politics without having been engaged
in political transactions and vicissitudes. And when history is
written by the book-learned, without technical knowledge, and
without clearness of detail, the work loses all its value. For
if you take from history its element of practical instruction,
what is left of it has nothing to attract and nothing to teach.
Again, in the topography of cities and localities, when such
men attempt to go into details, being entirely without personal
knowledge, they must in a similar manner necessarily pass
over many points of importance; while they waste words on
many that are not worth the trouble. And this is what his
failure to make personal inspection brings upon Timaeus. . . .</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="h">
<p>In his thirty-fourth book Timaeus says that "he<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Timaeus's want of practical knowledge.</note>
spent fifty continuous years at Athens as
an alien, and never took part in any military service, or went to inspect the localities."
Accordingly, when he comes upon any such matters in the
course of his history, he shows much ignorance and makes
many misstatements; and if he ever does come near the
truth, he is like one of those animal-painters who draw from
models of stuffed skins. Such artists sometimes preserve the
correct outline, but the vivid look and life-like portraiture of
the real animal, the chief charm of the painter's art, are quite
wanting. This is just the case with Timaeus, and in fact with
all who start with mere book-learning; there is nothing vivid
in their presentment of events, for that can only come from
the personal experience of the writers. And hence it is, that
those who have gone through no such course of actual experience produce no genuine enthusiasm in the minds of their
readers. Former historians showed their sense of the necessity
of making professions to this effect in their writings. For when
their subject was political, they were careful to state that the
writer had of course been engaged in politics, and had had
<pb n="107"/>
experience in matters of the sort; or if the subject was
military, that he had served a campaign and been actually
engaged; and again, when the matter was one of everyday life,
that he had brought up children and had been married; and
so on in every department of life, which we may expect to find
adequately treated by those writers alone who have had personal experience, and have accordingly made that branch of
history their own. It is difficult perhaps for a man to have
been actually and literally engaged in everything: but in the
most important actions and most frequently occurring he must
have been so.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="i">
<p>And that this is no impossibility, Homer is a convincing
instance; for in him you may see this quality of personal
knowledge frequently and conspicuously displayed. The
upshot of all this is that the study of documents is only one of
three elements in the preparation of an historian, and is only
third in importance. And no clearer proof of this could be
given than that furnished by the deliberative speeches, harangues of commanders, and orations of ambassadors as recorded
by Timaeus. For the truth is, that the occasions are rare
which admit of all possible arguments being set forth; as a
rule, the circumstances of the case confine them to narrow
limits. And of such speeches one sort are regarded with
favour by men of our time, another by those of an earlier age;
different styles again are popular with Aetolians, Peloponnesians, and Athenians. But to make digressions, in season and
out of season, for the purpose of setting forth every possible
speech that could be made, as Timaeus does by his trick of inventing words to suit every sort of occasion, is utterly
misleading, pedantic, and worthy of a schoolboy essayist. And this
practice has brought failure and discredit on many writers.
Of course to select from time to time the proper and appropriate language is a necessary part of our art: but as there is
no fixed rule to decide the quantity and quality of the words
to be used on a particular occasion, great care and training is
required if we are to instruct and not mislead our readers.
The exact nature of the situation is difficult to communicate
always; still it may be brought home to the mind by means of
systematic demonstration, founded on personal and habitual
<pb n="108"/>
experience. The best way of securing that this should be
realised is for historians, first, to state clearly the position, the
aims, and the circumstances of those deliberating; and then,
recording the real speeches made, to explain to us the causes
which contributed to the success or failure of the several
speakers. Thus we should obtain a true conception of the
situation. and by exercising our judgment upon it, and drawing
analogies from it, should be able to form a thoroughly sound
opinion upon the circumstances of the hour. But I suppose
that tracing causes is difficult, while stringing words together in
books is easy. Few again have the faculty of speaking briefly
to the point, and getting the necessary training for doing so;
while to produce a long and futile composition is within most
people's capacity and is common enough.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="k">
<p>To confirm the judgment I have expressed of Timaeus,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Timaeus on Sicilian history.</note>
on his wilful misstatements as well as his ignorance, I shall now quote certain short passages
from his acknowledged works as specimens. . . .
Of all the men who have exercised sovereignty in Sicily, since
the elder Gelo, tradition tells us that the most able have been
Hermocrates, Timoleon, and Pyrrhus of Epirus, who are the
last persons in the world on whom to father pedantic and
scholastic speeches. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-413">413</date>. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.42">Thucyd. 7, 42 <foreign lang="la">sqq.</foreign></bibl></note> Now Timaeus tells us in
his twenty-first book that on his arrival in Sicily
Eurymedon urged the cities there to undertake the war against
Syracuse; that subsequently the people of Gela becoming
tired of the war, sent an embassy to Camarina to make a
truce; that upon the latter gladly welcoming the proposal,
each state sent ambassadors to their respective allies begging
them to despatch men of credit to Gela to deliberate on a
pacification, and to secure the common interests. Upon the
arrival of these deputies in Gela and the opening of the
conference, he represents Hermocrates as speaking to the
following effect: "He praised the people of Gela and Camarina
first, for having made the truce; secondly, because they were
the cause of the assembling of this peace congress; and thirdly
because they had taken precautions to prevent the mass of the
citizens from taking part in the discussion, and had secured
that it should be confined to the leading men in the states, who
<pb n="109"/>
knew the difference between peace and war." Then after making
two or three practical suggestions, Hermocrates is represented
as expressing an opinion that "if they seriously consider the
matter they will learn the profound difference between peace
and war,"&mdash;although just before he had said that it was precisely this which moved his gratitude to the men of Gela, that
"the discussion did not take place in the mass assembly, but in
a congress of men who knew the difference between peace and
war." This is an instance in which Timaeus not only fails to
show the ability of an historian, but sinks below the level of a
school theme. For, I presume, it will be universally admitted
that what an audience requires is a demonstration of that
about which they are in ignorance or uncertainty; but to
exhaust one's ingenuity in finding arguments to prove what is
known already is the most futile waste of time. But besides
his cardinal mistake of directing the greater part of the speech
to points which stood in need of no arguments at all, Timaeus
also puts into the mouth of Hermocrates certain
sentences of which one could scarcely believe
that any commonplace youth would have been
capable, much less the colleague of the Lacedaemonians in the battle of Aegospotami, and the sole conqueror
of the Athenian armies and generals in Sicily.</p></div3></div2>

Then he goes on to allege that Euripides agrees with Homer
in the lines<note anchored="yes">Euripides, fr.</note>&mdash;
<quote><l>"O well of infinite riches!</l>

Next he remarks that "war is like disease, peace like
health; for that the latter restores those that are sick, while
in the former even the healthy perish. Moreover, in time of
peace, the old are buried by the young as nature directs, while
in war the case is reversed; and above all in war there is no
security even as far as the city walls, while in peace it extends
to the frontier of the territory"&mdash;and so on. I wonder what
other arguments would have been employed by a youth who
had just devoted himself to scholastic exercises and studies in
history; and who wished, according to the rules of the art, to
adapt his words to the supposed speakers? Just these I
think which Timaeus represents Hermocrates as using.</p>

when they are on the very point of coming

many times superior to them in number,
Timaeus represents him as saying, "Do not look to the

Libya is fully settled and abounds in inhabitants, yet
when we wish to express complete desolation we say 'more
desolate than Libya,' not meaning to refer to its emptiness, but

thousand land forces and two hundred decked

the congress of Greeks, sitting at Corinth, gave
Gelo's envoys a most spirited answer. They urged Gelo to come
to their aid with his forces, and observed that the logic of facts
would give the command to the bravest. This is not the language
of men depending for succour on the Syracusans, as a last
resource; but of men who felt confidence in themselves, and
challenged all comers to a rivalry of courage and for the crown
of valour. In spite of this, Timaeus spends such a wealth of
rhetoric and earnestness on these points, in his desire to exalt
the importance of Sicily above all the rest of Greece, to
represent its history as the most splendid and glorious of all
the world, its men as the wisest of all who have been great in
philosophy, and the Syracusans as the most consummate and
divine of statesmen, that he could scarcely be surpassed by
the cleverest schoolboy declaimers when undertaking to prove
such paradoxes as that "Thersites was an excellent man," or
"Penelope a bad wife," or other thesis of that description.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="c">
<p>However, the only effect of such extravagant exaggeration is to bring ridicule upon the men and the transactions
which it is his intention to champion; while he himself incurs
the same discredit as ill-trained disputants in the Academy;
some of whom, in their desire to embarrass their opponents on
all subjects, possible or impossible alike, carry their paradoxical
and sophistical arguments to such a length as to dispute
whether it is possible for people at Athens to smell eggs
cooking at Ephesus: and to offer to maintain that, while they
are discussing these points, they are lying on their couches at
home and carrying on a second discussion on other subjects.
This extravagance of paradox has brought the whole school
<pb n="112"/>
into such disrepute, that even reasonable discussions have lost
credit with the world. And apart from their own futility, these
persons have inspired our young men with so depraved a taste,
that they pay no attention whatever to questions of ethics and
politics, which bring benefit to those who study them; but
spend their lives in pursuit of an empty reputation for useless
and paradoxical verbiage.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="d">
<p>This is just the case with Timaeus and his imitators in
history. Paradoxical and tenacious, he has dazzled the
multitude by skill in words; and has forced attention to himself by a show of veracity, or has conciliated confidence by a
pretence of producing proof of his assertions. The most conspicuous instances of his success in inspiring this confidence are
those parts of his work which treat of colonies, founding of
cities, and the relationships of nations. In these points he
makes such a parade of minute accuracy, and inveighs so
bitterly when refuting others, that people came to imagine that
all other historians have been mere dreamers, and have spoken
at random in describing the world; and that he is the only
man who has made accurate investigations, and unravelled every
history with intelligence.</p></div3>
<div3 type="subsection" n="e">
<p>As a matter of fact, his books contain much that is sound,
but also much that is false. Those, however, who have spent
much time on his earlier books, in which the passages I have
alluded to occur, when the confidence which they have fully
given to his exaggerated professions is disturbed by some one
pointing out that Timaeus is obnoxious to the same reproaches
which he has brought with such bitterness against others (as,
for instance, in the misstatements as to the Locrians, and other
instances lately mentioned by me), become angry and obstinate
in controversy, and difficult to convince. And that, I might
almost say, is all the benefit which the most diligent students
of his history get from their reading. While those who devote
their attention to his speeches, and generally to the didactic
part of his work, become pedantic, sophistical, and wholly insensible to truth, for reasons which I have already stated.</p></div3></div2>

truth the real source of his errors. For whereas he is thought
to have possessed great and wide knowledge, a faculty for historical inquiry, and extraordinary industry in the execution of his
work, in certain cases he appears to have been the most ignorant
and indolent person that ever called himself an historian. And
the following considerations will prove it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cp. <bibl n="Hdt. 1.8">Herod. 1, 8</bibl>. <bibl n="Hor. Ars 180">Hor. A, P. 180</bibl>.</note> Nature
has bestowed on us two instruments of inquiry and research, hearing and sight.
Of these sight is, according to Heracleitus, by far
the truer; for eyes are surer witnesses than ears.
And of these channels of learning Timaeus has
chosen the pleasanter and the worse; for he entirely retrained
from looking at things with his own eyes, and devoted himself
to learning by hearsay. But even the ear may be instructed in
two ways, reading and answers to personal inquiries: and in
the latter of these he was very indolent, as I have already
shown. The reason of his preference for the other it is easy
to divine. Study of documents involves no danger or fatigue,
if one only takes care to lodge in a city rich in such records,
or to have a library in one's neighbourhood. You may then
investigate any question while reclining on your couch, and
compare the mistakes of former historians without any fatigue
to yourself. But personal investigation demands great exertion
and expense; though it is exceedingly advantageous, and in
fact is the very corner-stone of history. This is evident from
the writers of history themselves. Ephorus says, "if writers
could only be present at the actual transactions, it would be far
the best of all modes of learning." Theopompus says, "the best
military historian is he who has been present at the greatest
number of battles; the best speech maker is he who has been
engaged in most political contests." The same might be said
of the art of healing and of steering. Homer has spoken even
more emphatically than these writers on this point. For when
he wishes to describe what the man of light and leading should
be, he introduces Odysseus in these words&mdash;
<quote><l>"Tell me, oh Muse, the man of many shifts</l>
<l>Who wandered far and wide."</l></quote>
and then goes on&mdash;

and again<note anchored="yes">Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 1.1"><title>Odyss.</title> 1, 1-4</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.183">8, 183</bibl>.</note>&mdash;

<head>Mere Inquiry Is Insufficient</head>
<p>It is such a man that the dignity of history appears to
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Historians must be practical men.</note>
me to require. Plato says that "human affairs will not go well
until either philosophers become kings or kings
become philosophers."<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Rep. 473c"><title>Republic,</title> v. 473 C</bibl>. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 499b">vi. 499 B</bibl>.</note> So I should say that
history will never be properly written, until either
men of action undertake to write it (not as they do now, as a
matter of secondary importance; but, with the conviction that
it is their most necessary and honourable employment, shall
devote themselves through life exclusively to it), or historians
become convinced that practical experience is of the first importance for historical composition. Until that time arrives there
will always be abundance of blunders in the writings of historians.
Timaeus, however, quite disregarded all this. He spent his
life in one place, of which he was not even a citizen; and thus
deliberately renounced all active career either in war or politics,
and all personal exertion in travel and inspection of localities:
and yet, somehow or another, he has managed to obtain the
reputation of a master in the art of history. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Timaeus on ephorus.</note> To prove that
I have not misrepresented him, it is easy to bring the
evidence of Timaeus himself. In the preface
to his sixth book he says that "some people
suppose that more genius, industry, and
preparation are required for rhetorical than for historical
composition." And that "this opinion had been formerly
advanced against Ephorus." Then because this writer had
been unable to refute those who held it, he undertakes himself
to draw a comparison between history and rhetorical compositions: a most unnecessary proceeding altogether. In the first
place he misrepresents Ephorus. For in truth, admirable as
Ephorus is throughout his whole work, in style, treatment, and
argumentative acuteness, he is never more brilliant than in his
digressions and statements of his personal views: in fact, whenever he is adding anything in the shape of a commentary or a
<pb n="115"/>
note. And it so happens that his most elegant and convincing
digression is on this very subject of a comparison between
historians and speech-writers. But Timaeus is anxious not
to be thought to follow Ephorus. Therefore, in addition to
misrepresenting him and condemning the rest, he enters upon
a long, confused, and in every way inferior, discussion of what
had been already sufficiently handled by others; and expected
that no one living would detect him.</p>
<div3 type="subsection" n="a">
<p>However, he wished to exalt history; and, in order to
do so, he says that "history differs from rhetorical composition as much as real buildings differ from those represented
in scene-paintings." And again, that "to collect the necessary materials for writing history is by itself more laborious
than the whole process of producing rhetorical compositions."
He mentions, for instance, the expense and labour which he
underwent in collecting records from Assyria, and in studying
the customs of the Ligures, Celts, and Iberians. But he exaggerates these so much, that he could not have himself
expected to be believed. One would be glad to ask the
historian which of the two he thinks is the more expensive
and laborious,&mdash;to remain quietly at home and collect records
and study the customs of Ligures and Celts, or to obtain
personal experience of all the tribes possible, and see them
with his own eyes? To ask questions about man&oelig;uvres on
the field of battle and the sieges of cities and fights at sea
from those who were present, or to take personal part in the
dangers and vicissitudes of these operations as they occur?
For my part I do not think that real buildings differ so much
from those in stage - scenery, nor history from rhetorical
compositions, as a narrative drawn from actual and personal
experience differs from one derived from hearsay and the
report of others. But Timaeus had no such experience: and
he therefore naturally supposed that the part of an historian's
labour which is the least important and lightest, that namely
of collecting records and making inquiries from those who had
knowledge of the several events, was in reality the most
important and most difficult. And, indeed, in this particular
department of research, men who have had no personal experience must necessarily fall into grave errors. For how is a
<pb n="116"/>
man, who has no knowledge of such things, to put the right
questions as to man&oelig;uvering of troops, sieges of cities, and
fights at sea? And how can he understand the details of
what is told him? Indeed, the questioner is as important as
the narrator for getting a clear story. For in the case of men
who have had experience of real action, memory is a sufficient
guide from point to point of a narrative: but a man who has
had no such experience can neither put the right questions,
nor understand what is happening before his eyes. Though he
is on the spot, in fact, he is as good as absent.

<p>Philip now entered upon a course of treachery which no
one would venture to say was worthy of a king; but which
some would defend on the ground of its necessity in the conduct of public affairs, owing to the prevailing bad faith of the
time. For the ancients, so far from using a fraudulent policy
towards their friends, were scrupulous even as to using it to
conquer their enemies; because they did not regard a success
as either glorious or secure, which was not obtained by such a
victory in the open field as served to break the confidence of
their enemies. They therefore came to a mutual understanding not to use hidden weapons against each other, nor such as
could be projected from a distance; and held the opinion that
the only genuine decision was that arrived at by a battle fought
at close quarters, foot to foot with the enemy. It was for this
reason also that it was their custom mutually to proclaim their
wars, and give notice of battles, naming time and place at which
they meant to be in order of battle. But nowadays people
say that it is the mark of an inferior general to perform any
operation of war openly. Some slight trace, indeed, of the
old-fashioned morality still lingers among the Romans; for
they do proclaim their wars, and make sparing use of ambuscades, and fight their battles hand to hand and foot to foot.
So much for the unnecessary amount of artifice which it is the
fashion for commanders in our days to employ both in politics
and war.</p></div2>

his reign, ventured upon no undertaking of importance, owing
to the recent defeat of Machanidas by the

foundations of a long and grinding tyranny. He
destroyed the last remains of the old Spartan nobles; drove
into banishment all men eminent for wealth or ancestral glory;
and distributed their property and wives among the chief men
of those who remained, or among his own mercenary soldiers.
These last were composed of murderers, housebreakers, footpads, and burglars. For this was, generally speaking, the class
of men which he collected out of all parts of the world, whose
own country was closed to them owing to their crimes and
felonies. As he put himself forward as the patron and king of
such wretches, and employed them as attendants and bodyguards, there is evidently no cause for surprise that his impious
character and reign should have been long remembered. For,
besides this, he was not content with driving the citizens into
banishment, but took care no place should be secure, and no
refuge safe for the exiles. Some he caused to be pursued and
killed on the road, while others he dragged from their place of
retreat and murdered. Finally, in the cities where they were

wherever they might be, by means of agents who were not

breaches in the party walls, and through them, or through such

out the danger in which the city stood from the threatening

he was satisfied; but if they ever refused to comply with his
demand, he would say, "Perhaps I cannot persuade you, but I
think this lady Ap&eacute;ga will succeed in doing so." Ap&eacute;ga was
the name of his wife. Immediately on his saying these words,
the figure I have described was brought in. As soon as the
man offered his hand to the supposed lady to raise her from
her seat, the figure threw its arms round him and began drawing him by degrees towards its breasts. Now its arms, hands,
and breasts were full of iron spikes under its clothes. When
the tyrant pressed his hands on the back of the figure, and

tyrants found the horse and groom, and took them off without any one interfering. But they then laid hands on the
Boeotians, who at first demanded to be taken before the
magistrate; but as no attention was paid to the demand, one
of them shouted out "Help!" Upon a crowd of the people
of the place collecting and protesting that the men should be
taken before the magistrate, Nabis's party were obliged to let

were not far apart he kept sending messages to

Carthaginians, and of his alliance with the Punic people
generally; for the Numidians, he knew, were naturally quick
to feel satiety, and constant neither to gods nor men. Scipio's
mind, however, was distracted with various anxieties, and his
prospects were far from seeming secure to him; for he shrank
from an engagement in the open field on account of the
enemy's great superiority in numbers. He therefore seized an
opportunity which now presented itself. Some of his messengers to Syphax reported to him that the Carthaginians had
constructed their huts in their winter camp of various kinds of
wood and boughs without any earth; while the old army of the
Numidians made theirs of reeds, and the reinforcements which
were now coming in from the neighbouring townships constructed
theirs of boughs only, some of them inside the trench and palisade, but the greater number outside. Scipio therefore made up
his mind that the manner of attacking them, which would be
most unexpected by the enemy and most successful for himself,
would be by fire. He therefore turned his attention to
organising such an attack. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The proposal of Syphax.</note> Now, in his communications with
Scipio, Syphax was continually harping upon his
proposal that the Carthaginians should evacuate
Italy and the Romans Libya; and that the possessions held by either between these two countries should
remain in <foreign lang="la">statu quo.</foreign> Hitherto Scipio had refused to listen to
this suggestion, but he now gave Syphax a hint by the mouth
of his messengers that the course he wished to see followed
was not impossible. Greatly elated at this, Syphax became
much bolder than before in his communications with Scipio;
<pb n="125"/>
the numbers of the messengers sent backwards and forwards,
and the frequency of their visits, were redoubled; and they
sometimes even stayed several days in each other's camps
without any thought of precaution. On these occasions
Scipio always took care to send, with the envoys, some men of
tried experience or of military knowledge, dressed up as slaves
in rough and common clothes, that they might examine and
investigate in security the approaches and entrances to both
the entrenchments. For there were two camps, one that of
Hasdrubal, containing thirty thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry; and another about ten stades distant from it of the
Numidians, containing ten thousand cavalry and about fifty thousand infantry. The latter was the easier of approach, and its
huts were well calculated for being set on fire, because, as I
said before, the Numidians had not made theirs of timber and
earth, but used simply reeds and thatch in their construction.</p></div2>

<head>Scipio Prepares to Attack Utica by Sea</head>
<p>By the beginning of spring Scipio had completed the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Spring of B. C. <date value="-203">203</date>.</note>
reconnaissances necessary for this attempt upon
the enemy; and he began launching his ships,
and getting the engines on them into working
order, as though with the purpose of assaulting Utica by sea.
With his land forces he once more occupied the high ground
overlooking the town, and carefully fortified it and secured it
by trenches. He wished the enemy to believe that he was
doing this for the sake of carrying on the siege; but he really
meant it as a cover for his men, who were to be engaged in the
undertaking described above, to prevent the garrison sallying
out, when the legions were separated from their lines,
assaulting the palisade which was so near to them, and attacking the division left in charge of it. Whilst in the midst of
these preparations, he sent to Syphax inquiring whether, "in
case he agreed to his proposals, the Carthaginians would
assent, and not say again that they would deliberate on the
terms?" He ordered these legates at the same time not to
return to him, until they had received an answer on these
points. When the envoys arrived, the Numidian king was
convinced that Scipio was on the point of concluding the
agreement, partly from the fact that the ambassadors said that
they would not go away until they got his answer, and partly
<pb n="126"/>
because of the anxiety expressed as to the disposition of the
Carthaginians. He therefore sent immediately to Hasdrubal,
stating the facts and urging him to accept the peace. Meanwhile he neglected all precautions himself, and allowed the
Numidians, who were now joining, to pitch their tents where
they were, outside the lines. Scipio in appearance acted in
the same way, while in reality he was pushing on his preparations with the utmost care. When a message was returned
from the Carthaginians bidding Syphax complete the treaty of
peace, the Numidian king, in a state of great exaltation, communicated the news to the envoys; who immediately departed
to their own camp to inform Scipio from the king of what
had been done. As soon as he heard it, the Roman general
at once sent fresh envoys to inform Syphax that Scipio was
quite satisfied and was anxious for the peace; but that the
members of his council differed from him, and held that they
should remain as they were. The ambassadors duly arrived
and informed the Numidians of this. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's ruse to deceive Syphax.</note> Scipio sent this mission to
avoid the appearance of a breach of truce, if he
should perform any act of hostility while negotiations for peace were still going on between
the parties. He considered that, by making this statement, he
would be free to act in whatever way he chose without laying
himself open to blame.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b14c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Syphax and Hasdrubal Are Deluded</head>
<p>Syphax's annoyance at this message was great, in proportion to the hopes he had previously entertained of making
the peace. He had an interview with Hasdrubal, and told
him of the message he had received from the Romans; but
though they deliberated long and earnestly as to what they
ought to do, they neither had any idea or conjecture as to
what was really going to happen. For they had no anticipation whatever as to the need of taking precautions, or of any
danger threatening them, but were all eagerness and excitement to strike some blow, and thus provoke the enemy to
descend into the level ground. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio discloses his project.</note> Meanwhile Scipio allowed his
army generally, by the preparations he was making
and the orders he was issuing, to imagine that
his aim was the capture of Utica; but summoning the most able and trusty Tribunes at noon, he imparted
<pb n="127"/>  to them his design, and ordered them to cause their
men to get their supper early, and then to lead the legions
outside the camp as soon as the buglers gave the usual signal
by a simultaneous blast of their bugles. For it is a custom in
the Roman army for the trumpeters and buglers to sound a
call near the commander's tent at supper time, that the night
pickets may then take up their proper positions. Scipio next
summoned the spies whom he had sent at different times to
reconnoitre the enemy's quarters, and carefully compared and
studied the accounts they gave about the roads leading to the
hostile camps and the entrances to them, employing Massanissa
to criticise their words and assist him with his advice, because
he was acquainted with the locality.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b14c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>The Romans Burn the Enemy Camp</head>
<p>Everything being prepared for his expedition, Scipio
left a sufficiently strong guard in the camp, and got the rest of
the men on the march towards the end of the first watch, the
enemy being about sixty stades distant. Arrived in the neighbourhood of the enemy, about the end of the third watch, he
assigned to Gaius Laelius and Massanissa half his Roman
soldiers and all his Numidians, with orders to attack the camp
of Syphax, urging them to quit themselves like brave men and
do nothing carelessly; with the clear understanding that, as the
darkness hindered and prevented the use of the eyes, a night
attack required all the more the assistance of a cool head and
a firm heart. The rest of the army he took the command of
in person, and led against Hasdrubal. He had calculated on
not beginning his assault until Laelius's division had set fire to
the enemy's huts; he therefore proceeded slowly. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Destruction of the camp of Syphax by C. Laelius and Massanissa,</note>
The latter meanwhile advanced in two divisions,
which attacked the enemy simultaneously. The
construction of the huts being as though purposely contrived to be susceptible of a conflagration, as I have
already explained, as soon as the front rank men began to set
light to them, the fire caught all the first row of huts fiercely,
and soon got beyond all control, from the closeness of the huts
to each other, and the amount of combustible material which
they contained. Laelius remained in the rear as a reserve;
but Massanissa, knowing the localities through which those
who fled from the fire would be sure to retreat, stationed his
<pb n="128"/>
own soldiers at those spots. Not a single Numidian had any
suspicion of the true state of the case, not even Syphax
himself; but thinking that it was a mere accidental conflagration of the rampart, some of them started unsuspiciously
out of bed, others sprang out of their tents in the midst of a
carouse and with the cup actually at their lips. The result
was that numbers of them got trampled to death by their own
friends at the exits from the camp; many were caught by the
flames and burnt to death; while all those who escaped the
flame fell into the hands of the enemy, and were killed,
without knowing what was happening to them or what they
were doing.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b14c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Dreadful Scene In the Burning Camps</head>
<p>At the same time the Carthaginians, observing the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">and of Hasdrubal.</note>
proportions of the conflagration and the hugeness of the flame that was rising, imagined that
the Numidian camp had been accidentally
set on fire. Some of them therefore started at once to
render assistance, and all the rest hurried outside their own
camp unarmed, and stood there gazing in astonishment at
the spectacle. Everything having thus succeeded to his best
wishes, Scipio fell upon these men outside their camp, and
either put them to the sword, or, driving them back into
the camp, set fire to their huts. The disaster of the Punic
army was thus very like that which had just befallen the
Numidians, fire and sword in both cases combining to destroy
them. Hasdrubal immediately gave up all idea of combating
the fire, for he knew from the coincidence of the two that the
fire in the Numidian camp was not accidental, as he had
supposed, but had originated from some desperate design of
the enemy. He therefore turned his attention to saving his
own life, although there was now little hope left of doing so.
For the fire was spreading rapidly and was catching everywhere; while the camp gangways were full of horses, beasts of
burden, and men, some of them half dead and devoured by
the fire, and others in a state of such frantic terror and mad
excitement that they prevented any attempts at making a
defence, and by the utter tumult and confusion which they
created rendered all chance of escape hopeless. The case of
Syphax was the same as that of Hasdrubal, as it was also that
<pb n="129"/>
of the other officers. The two former, however, did manage
to escape, accompanied by a few horsemen: but all those
myriads of men, horses, and beasts of burden, either met a
miserable and pitiable death from the fire, or, if they escaped
the violence of that, some of the men perished ignominiously
at the hands of the enemy, cut down naked and defenceless, not
only without their arms, but without so much as their clothes
to cover them. The whole place was filled with yells of pain,
confused cries, terror, and unspeakable din, mingled with a
conflagration which spread rapidly and blazed with the utmost
fierceness. It was the combination and suddenness of these
horrors that made them so awful, any one of which by itself
would have been sufficient to strike terror into the hearts of
men. It is accordingly impossible for the imagination to
exaggerate the dreadful scene, so completely did it surpass
in horror everything hitherto recorded. Of all the brilliant
achievements of Scipio this appears to me to have been the
most brilliant and the most daring. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b14c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Anda Surrenders to Rome</head>
<p>When day broke, and he found the enemy either killed

or in headlong flight, Scipio exhorted his
Tribunes to activity, and at once started in pursuit. At first the Carthaginian general seemed
inclined to stand his ground, though told of Scipio's approach,
trusting in the strength of the town [of Anda]; but when he
saw that the inhabitants were in a mutinous state, he shrank
from meeting the attack of Scipio, and fled with the relics of his
army, which consisted of as many as five hundred cavalry and
about two thousand infantry. The inhabitants of the town
thereupon submitted unconditionally to the Romans, and were
spared by Scipio, who, however, gave up two neighbouring towns
to the legions to plunder. This being done he returned to his
original entrenchment. Baffled in the hopes which they had
entertained of the course which the campaign
would take, the Carthaginians were deeply depressed. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dismay at Carthage.</note> They had expected to shut up the
Romans on the promontory near Utica, which had been
the site of their winter quarters, and besiege them there
with their army and fleet both by sea and land. With this
view all their preparations had been made; and when they
<pb n="130"/>
saw, quite contrary to their calculations, that they were not
only driven from the open country by the enemy, but were
in hourly expectation of an attack upon themselves and their
city, they became completely disheartened and panic-stricken.
Their circumstances, however, admitted of no delay. They
were compelled at once to take precautions and adopt some
measures for the future. But the senate was filled with doubt
and varied and confused suggestions. Some said that they
ought to send for Hannibal and recall him from Italy, their
one hope of safety being now centred in that general and his
forces. Others were for an embassy to Scipio to obtain a truce
and discuss with him the terms of a pacification and treaty. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Senate, however, resolves to continue their resistance.</note>
Others again were for keeping up their courage
and collecting their forces, and sending a message to Syphax; who, they said, was at the neighbouring town of Abba, engaged in collecting
the remnants of his army. This last suggestion was the one
which ultimately prevailed. The Government of Carthage
accordingly set about collecting troops, and sent a despatch to
Syphax begging him to support them and abide by his original
policy, as a general with an army would presently join him.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b14c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Carthaginians Reinforced and Resolute</head>
<p>Meanwhile the Roman commander was pressing on the
seige of Utica. But when he heard that Syphax was still in
position, and that the Carthaginians were once more collecting
an army, he led out his forces and pitched his camp close
under the walls of Utica. At the same time he divided the
booty among the soldiers. . . .<note anchored="yes">Some words are lost from the text.</note> The merchants who purchased them from the soldiers went away with very profitable
bargains; for the recent victory inspired the soldiers with

<p>The Numidian king and his friends were at
first minded to continue their retreat to their own
land. But while deliberating on this, certain
Celtiberes, over four thousand in number, who
had been hired as soldiers by the Carthaginians,
arrived in the vicinity of Abba. Encouraged by this additional
<pb n="131"/>  strength the Numidians stopped on their retreat. And
when the young lady, who was daughter of Hasdrubal and
wife of Syphax, added her earnest entreaties that he would
remain and not abandon the Carthaginians at such a crisis, the
Numidian king gave way and consented to her prayer. The
approach of these Celtiberes did a great deal also to encourage
the hopes of the Carthaginians: for instead of four thousand,
it was reported at Carthage that they were ten thousand, and
that their bravery and the excellency of their arms made them
irresistible in the field. Excited by this rumour, and by the
boastful talk which was current among the common people,
the Carthaginians felt their resolution to once
more take the field redoubled. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Carthaginians again take the field.</note> And finally,
within thirty days, they pitched a camp in conjunction with the Numidians and Celtiberes on what are

than thirty thousand.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b14c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Scipio Determines to Attack</head>
<p>When news of these proceedings reached the Roman
camp Scipio immediately determined to attack. Leaving
orders, therefore, to the army and navy, which were besieging Utica, as to what they were to do, he started with all his
army in light marching order. On the fifth day he reached
the Great Plains, and during the first day after his arrival
encamped on a piece of rising ground about thirty stades from
the enemy. Next day he descended into the plain and drew up
his army<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">parene/balle,</foreign> which Schweig. translates <foreign lang="la">castra locavit:</foreign> but though the
word does sometimes bear that meaning, I cannot think that it does so here.

distant, and to have come down into the plain to offer battle each of the
three days. Hence the imperfect.</note> at a distance of seven stades from the enemy, with

position and drawn up in order of battle. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The battle on the Great Plains. 24th June, B. C. <date value="-203">203</date>.</note>
Scipio followed exactly the Roman system,
stationing the maniples of hastati in the front,
behind them the principes, and lastly the triarii in the rear.
Of his cavalry he stationed the Italians on the right wing, the
Numidians and Massanissa on the left. Syphax and Hasdrubal
<pb n="132"/>
stationed the Celtiberes in the centre opposite the Roman
cohorts, the Numidians on the left, and the Carthaginians on
the right. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman wings are both victorious.</note> At the very first charge the Numidians reeled
before the Italian cavalry, and the Carthaginians
before those under Massanissa; for their many
previous defeats had completely demoralised
them. But the Celtiberes fought gallantly, for they had no
hope of saving themselves by flight, being entirely unacquainted
with the country; nor any expectation of being spared if they
were taken prisoners on account of their perfidy to Scipio: for
they were regarded as having acted in defiance of justice and
of their treaty in coming to aid the Carthaginians against the
Romans, though they had never suffered any act of hostility at
Scipio's hands during the campaigns in Iberia. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Celtiberes, on the centre, are cut to pieces after a gallant resistance.</note>
When, however, the two wings gave way these men were surrounded by the principes and

effective service to the Carthaginians, not only during the
whole battle, but during the retreat also; for, if it had not
been for the hindrance caused by them, the Romans would
have pressed the fugitives closely, and very few of the enemy
would have escaped. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Syphax and Hasdrubal escape.</note> As it was, owing to the delay caused

<head>Scipio's Victory On the Great Plains</head>
<p>After making the necessary arrangements as to the booty

and prisoners, Scipio summoned a council of
war to consult as to what to do next. It was
resolved that Scipio himself and one part of the
army should stay in the country and visit the
various towns; while Laelius and Massanissa,
with the Numidians and the rest of the Roman legions,
should pursue Syphax and give him no time to deliberate or
make any preparations. This being settled the commanders
separated; the two latter going with their division in pursuit
of Syphax, Scipio on a round of the townships. Some of
these were terrified into a voluntary submission to the Romans,
<pb n="133"/>
others he promptly took by assault. The whole country was
ripe for a change, owing to the constant series of miseries and
contributions, under which it had been groaning from the protracted wars in Iberia.</p>
<p>In Carthage meanwhile, where the panic had been great<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A panic at Carthage.</note>
enough before, a still wilder state of excitement
prevailed, after this second disaster, and the disappointment of the hopes of success which they
had entertained. However, those of the counsellors who
claimed the highest character for courage urged that they
should go on board their ships and attack the besiegers of
Utica, try to raise the blockade, and engage the enemy at sea,
who were not in a forward state of preparation in that department; that they should recall Hannibal, and without delay
test to the utmost this one more chance: for both these
measures offered great and reasonable opportunities of securing their safety. Others declared that their circumstances no
longer admitted of these measures: what they had to do was
to fortify their town and prepare to stand a siege; for chance
would give them many occasions of striking a successful blow
if they only held together. At the same time they advised
that they should deliberate on coming to terms and making a
treaty, and see on what conditions and by what means they
might extricate themselves from the danger. After a long
debate, all these proposals were adopted together.</p></div2>

<head>Scipio Fears a Carthaginian Attack on the Fleet</head>
<p>Upon this decision being come to, those who were to

while the Navarch went to prepare the ships. The rest began
to take measures for securing the city, and remained in constant consultation on the measures necessary for the purpose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Scipio's camp was getting gorged with booty;
for he found no one to resist him, and everybody yielded to
his attacks. He therefore determined to despatch the greater
part of the booty to his original camp; while he advanced with
his army in light marching order to seize the entrenchment
near Tunes, and pitched his camp within the view of the inhabitants of Carthage, thinking that this would do more than
anything else to strike terror into their hearts and lower their
courage.
<pb n="134"/></p>
<p>The Carthaginians had in a few days manned and provisioned their ships, and were engaged in getting under
sail and carrying out their plan of operations, when Scipio

occupied the town, which is about a hundred stades from Carthage, of remarkable strength both natural and artificial, and
visible from nearly every point of Carthage.</p>
<p>Just as the Romans pitched their camp there, the Carthaginians were putting out to sea
on board their<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio recalled to Utica by the fear of an attack upon his fleet.</note>
ships to sail to Utica. Seeing the enemy thus
putting out, and fearing some misfortune to his
own fleet, Scipio was rendered exceedingly
anxious, because no one there was prepared for such an attack,
or had anything in readiness to meet the danger. He therefore broke up his camp and marched back in haste to support
his men. There he found his decked ships thoroughly well
fitted out for raising siege-engines and applying them to walls,
and generally for all purposes of an assault upon a town, but
not in the least in the trim for a sea-fight; while the enemy's
fleet had been under process of rigging for this purpose the
whole winter. He therefore gave up all idea of putting to sea
to meet the enemy and accepting battle there; but anchoring
his decked ships side by side he moored the transports round
them, three or four deep; and then, taking down the masts and
yard-arms, he lashed the vessels together firmly by means of
these, keeping a space between each sufficient to enable the
light craft to sail in and out. . . .</p></div2>

at the same time to announce that the Roman people had
ratified the treaty; for he had lately received a despatch from

<pb n="137"/>

acknowledged that they deserved every severity at the hands
of the Romans; but intreated to be spared the last severities,
from a regard to the vicissitudes of human fortune, for their
folly would be the means of displaying the generosity of the
Romans. Remembering all this, the general and the officers
then present in the council were at a loss to understand what
had encouraged them to forget what they then said, and to
venture to break their sworn articles of agreement. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal leaves Italy, 23d June, B.C. <date value="-203">203</date>.</note> Plainly it

that he and his army had been driven these two years past

<head>Treacherous Attempt on the Lives of the Roman Envoys</head>
<p>After delivering this' speech the envoys retired. Some
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Treacherous attempt on the lives of the Roman envoys.</note>
few of the citizens were against breaking the
treaty; but the majority, both of the politicians and the Senate, were much annoyed
by its terms, and irritated by the plain speaking of the envoys; and, moreover, could not make up their
minds to surrender the captured transports and the provisions
which were on board them. But their main motive was a confident hope that they might yet conquer by means of Hannibal.
The people therefore voted to dismiss the envoys without an
answer. Moreover, the political party, whose aim it was to
<pb n="138"/>
bring on the war at all hazards, held a meeting and arranged
the following act of treachery. They gave out that it was necessary to make provision for conducting the envoys back to their
camp in safety. They therefore at once caused two triremes
to be got ready to convoy them; but at the same time sent a
message to the Navarch Hasdrubal to have some vessels ready
at no great distance from the Roman camp, in order that, as
soon as the convoys had taken leave of the Roman envoys, he
might bear down upon their ships and sink them; for the
Carthaginian fleet was stationed at the time close under
Utica. Having made this arrangement with Hasdrubal, they
despatched the envoys, with instructions to the officers of the
convoys to leave them and return, as soon as they had passed
the mouth of the River Macara; for it was from this point that
the enemy's camp came into sight. Therefore, according to their
instructions, as soon as they had passed this point, the officers
of the convoys made signs of farewell to the Roman envoys
and returned. Lucius and his colleagues suspected no danger,
and felt no other annoyance at this proceeding than as regarding it as a mark of disrespect. But no sooner were they
left thus alone, than three Carthaginian vessels suddenly started
out to attack them, and came up with the Roman quinquereme.
They failed, indeed, to stave her in, because she evaded them;
nor did they succeed in boarding her, because the men resisted
them with great spirit. But they ran up alongside of the
vessel, and kept attacking her at various points, and managed
to wound the marines with their darts and kill a considerable
number of them; until at last the Romans, observing that their
forage parties along the shore were rushing down to the beach
to their assistance, ran their ships upon land. Most of the
marines were killed, but the envoys had the unexpected good

watching with conflicting feelings to see what would happen.
But meanwhile Hannibal, finding himself too
weak in cavalry, sent to a certain Numidian
named Tychaeus, who was a friend of Syphax,
and was reputed to possess the most warlike cavalry in Libya,
urging him "to lend his aid, and not let the present opportunity
slip; as he must be well aware that, if the Carthaginians won
the day, he would be able to maintain his rule; but if the Romans
proved victorious, his very life would be in danger, owing to the
ambition of Massanissa." This prince was convinced by these
arguments, and joined Hannibal with two thousand horsemen.</p></div2>

command of it in his place, while he himself went a round of the cities. This time
he did not admit to mercy those who voluntarily surrendered, but carried all the towns by
force, and enslaved the inhabitants, to show his
anger at the treachery of the Carthaginians. To
Massanissa he sent message after message, explaining to him
how the Punic government had broken the terms, and urging
him to collect the largest army he was able and join him with
all speed. For as soon as the treaty had been made, Massanissa, as I have said, had immediately departed with his own
army and ten Roman cohorts, infantry and cavalry, accompanied by some commissioners from Scipio, that he might not
only recover his own kingdom, but secure the addition of that
of Syphax also, by the assistance of the Romans. And this
purpose was eventually effected.</p>
<p>It happened that just at this time the envoys from Rome<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio orders the Carthaginian envoys to be released.</note>
arrived at the naval camp. Those of them
who had been sent by the Roman government,
Baebius at once caused to be escorted to
Scipio, while he retained those who were Carthaginians. The latter were much cast down, and regarded
<pb n="140"/>
their position as one of great danger; for when they were
informed of the impious outrage committed by their countrymen
on the persons of the Roman envoys, they thought there could
be no doubt that the vengeance for it would be wreaked upon
themselves. But when Scipio learnt from the recently-arrived
commissioners that the senate and people accepted with enthusiasm the treaty which he had made with the Carthaginians,
and were ready to grant everything he asked, he was highly
delighted, and ordered Baebius to send the envoys home with
all imaginable courtesy. And he was very well advised to do
so, in my opinion. For as he knew that his countrymen
made a great point of respecting the rights of ambassadors, he
considered in his own mind, not what the Carthaginians deserved to have done to them, but what it was becoming in
Romans to inflict. Therefore, though he did not relax his
own indignation and anger at what they had done, he yet
endeavoured, in the words of the proverb, "to maintain the
good traditions of his sires." The result was that, by this
superiority in his conduct, a very decided impression was
made upon the spirits of the Carthaginians and of Hannibal
himself.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Both Sides Prepare For Battle</head>
<p>When the people of Carthage saw the cities in their
territory being sacked, they sent a message to Hannibal begging him to act without delay, to come to close quarters with
the enemy, and bring the matter to the decision of battle.
He bade the messengers in answer "to confine their attention
to other matters, and to leave such things to him, for he
would choose the time for fighting himself." Some days
afterwards he broke up his quarters at Adrumetum, and
pitched his camp near ZAMA, a town about five
days' march to the west of Carthage. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal moves to Zama.</note> From
that place he sent spies to ascertain the place,
nature, and strength of the Roman general's encampment.
These spies were caught and brought to Scipio, who, so far
from inflicting upon them the usual punishment of spies,
appointed a tribune to show them everything in the camp
thoroughly and without reserve; and when this had been done,
he asked the men whether the appointed officer had been careful to point out everything to them. Upon their replying that
<pb n="141"/>
he had, he gave them provisions and an escort, and despatched
them with injunctions to be careful to tell Hannibal everything they had seen. On their return to his camp, Hannibal
was so much struck with the magnanimity and high courage
of Scipio, that he conceived a lively desire for a personal interview with him. With this purpose he sent a herald to say
that he was desirous of a parley to discuss the matters at issue.
When the herald had delivered his message, Scipio at once
expressed his consent, and said that he would himself send
him a message when it suited him to meet, naming the time
and place. The herald returned to Hannibal with this answer.
Next day Massanissa arrived with six thousand
infantry and about four thousand cavalry. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Arrival of Massanissa.</note> Scipio
received him with cordiality, and congratulated
him on having added to his sway all those who had previously
been subject to Syphax. Thus reinforced, he removed his
camp to Naragara: selecting it as a place which, among
other advantages, enabled him to get water within a javelin's
throw.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Meeting of Hannibal and Scipio</head>
<p>From this place he sent to the Carthaginian general,
informing him that he was ready to meet him, and discuss
matters with him. On hearing this, Hannibal moved his quarters to within thirty stades of Scipio, and pitched his camp on
a hill, which seemed a favourable position for his present purpose, except that water had to be fetched from a considerable
distance, which caused his soldiers great fatigue.</p>
<p>Next day both commanders advanced from their camps<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Meeting of Scipio and Hannibal.</note>

left these escorts and met in the intervening
space by themselves, each accompanied by an
interpreter. Hannibal was the first to speak, after the usual
salutation. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's speech.</note> He said that "He wished that the
Romans had never coveted any possession
outside Italy, nor the Carthaginians outside
Libya; for these were both noble empires, and were, so to
speak, marked out by nature. But since," he continued, "our
rival claims to Sicily first made us enemies, and then those
for Iberia; and since, finally, unwarned by the lessons of misfortune, we have gone so far that the one nation has endangered
<pb n="142"/>  the very soil of its native land, and the other is
now actually doing so, all that there remains for us to do is
to try our best to deprecate the wrath of the gods, and to put
an end, as far as in us lies, to these feelings of obstinate hostility. I personally am ready to do this, because I have learnt
by actual experience that Fortune is the most fickle thing in
the world, and inclines with decisive favour now to one side
and now to the other on the slightest pretext, treating mankind like young children.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Conclusion of Hannibal's Speech</head>
<p>"But it is about you that I am anxious, Scipio. For
you are still a young man, and everything has succeeded to
your wishes both in Iberia and Libya, and you have as yet
never experienced the ebb tide of Fortune; I fear, therefore,
that my words, true as they are, will not influence you. But
do look at the facts in the light of one story, and that not
connected with a former generation, but our own. Look at
me! I am that Hannibal who, after the battle of Cannae,
became master of nearly all Italy; and presently advancing to
Rome itself, and pitching my camp within forty stades of it,
deliberated as to what I should do with you and your country;
but now I am in Libya debating with you, a Roman, as to the
bare existence of myself and my countrymen. With such
a reverse as that before your eyes, I beg you not to entertain
high thoughts, but to deliberate with a due sense of human
weakness on the situation; and the way to do that is among
good things to choose the greatest, among evils the least.
What man of sense, then, would deliberately choose to incur
the risk which is now before you. If you conquer, you will
add nothing of importance to your glory or to that of your
country; while, if you are worsted, you will have been yourself the means of entirely cancelling all the honours and
glories you have already won. What then is the point that I
am seeking to establish by these arguments? It is that the
Romans should retain all the countries for which we have
hitherto contended&mdash;I mean Sicily, Sardinia, and Iberia; and
that the Carthaginians should engage never to go to war with
Rome for these; and also that all the islands lying between
Italy and Libya should belong to Rome. For I am persuaded that such a treaty will be at once safest for the
<pb n="143"/>
Carthaginians, and most glorious for you and the entire people
of Rome."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Scipio's reply</head>
<p>In reply to this speech of Hannibal, Scipio said "That
neither in the Sicilian nor Iberian war were the
Romans the aggressors, but notoriously the
Carthaginians, which no one knew better than Hannibal himself. That the gods themselves had confirmed this by giving
the victory, not to those who struck the first and unprovoked
blow, but to those who only acted in self-defence. That he
was as ready as any one to keep before his eyes the uncertainty
of Fortune, and tried his best to confine his efforts within the
range of human infirmity. But if," he continued, "you had
yourself quitted Italy before the Romans crossed to Libya
with the offer of these terms in your hands, I do not think
that you would have been disappointed in your expectation.
But now that your departure from Italy has been involuntary,
and we have crossed into Libya and conquered the country,
it is clear that matters stand on a very different footing. But
above all, consider the point which affairs have reached now.
Your countrymen have been beaten, and at their earnest
prayer we arranged a written treaty, in which, besides the
offer now made by you, it was provided that the Carthaginians
should restore prisoners without ransom, should surrender all
their decked vessels, pay five thousand talents, and give
hostages for their performance of these articles. These were
the terms which I and they mutually agreed upon; we both
despatched envoys to our respective Senates and people,&mdash;we
consenting to grant these terms, the Carthaginians begging to
have them granted. The Senate agreed: the people ratified
the treaty. But though they had got what they asked, the
Carthaginians annulled the compact by an act of perfidy
towards us. What course is left to me? Put yourself in my
place and say. To withdraw the severest clauses of the treaty?
Are we to do this, say you, not in order that by reaping the
reward of treachery they may learn in future to outrage their
benefactors, but in order that by getting what they ask for
they may be grateful to us? Why, only the other day, after
obtaining what they begged for as suppliants, because your
presence gave them a slender hope of success, they at once
<pb n="144"/>
treated us as hated foes and public enemies. In these circumstances, if a still severer clause were added to the conditions
imposed, it might be possible to refer the treaty back to the
people; but, if I were to withdraw any of these conditions, such
a reference does not admit even of discussion. What then is
the conclusion of my discourse? It is, that you must submit yourselves and your country to us unconditionally, or
conquer us in the field."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c9" type="chapter" n="9">
<head>Dispositions For the Battle of Zama</head>
<p>After these speeches Hannibal and Scipio parted without
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The momentous issues depending on the battle of Zama, B. C. <date value="-202">202</date>.</note>
coming to any terms; and next morning by
daybreak both generals drew out their forces
and engaged. To the Carthaginians it was a
struggle for their own lives and the sovereignty
of Libya; to the Romans for universal dominion and supremacy.
And could any one who grasped the situation fail to be moved
at the story? Armies more fitted for war than these, or
generals who had been more successful or more thoroughly
trained in all the operations of war, it would be impossible to
find, or any other occasion on which the prizes proposed by
destiny to the combatants were more momentous. For it was
not merely of Libya or Europe that the victors in this battle
were destined to become masters, but of all other parts of the
world known to history,&mdash;a destiny which had not to wait
long for its fulfilment.</p>
<p>Scipio placed his men on the field in the following order:<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's order of battle.</note>
the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> first, with an interval between their
maniples; behind them the <foreign lang="la">principes,</foreign> their
maniples not arranged to cover the intervals
between those of the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> as the Roman custom is, but
immediately behind them at some distance, because the enemy
was so strong in elephants. In the rear of these he stationed
the <foreign lang="la">triarii.</foreign> On his left wing he stationed Gaius Laelius with
the Italian cavalry, on the right Massanissa with all his
Numidians. The intervals between the front maniples he
filled up with maniples of <foreign lang="la">velites,</foreign> who were ordered to begin
the battle; but if they found themselves unable to stand the
charge of the elephants, to retire quickly either to the rear of
the whole army by the intervals between the maniples, which
went straight through the ranks, or, if they got entangled with
<pb n="145"/>
the elephants, to step aside into the lateral spaces between the
maniples.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c10" type="chapter" n="10">
<head>Scipio's Speech to his Men</head>
<p>These dispositions made, he went along the ranks
delivering an exhortation to the men, which,
though short, was much to the point in the
circumstances in which they were placed. He
called upon them, "Remembering their former victories, to
show themselves to be men of mettle and worthy their reputation and their country. To put before their eyes that the
effect of their victory would be not only to make them complete
masters of Libya, but to give them and their country the
supremacy and undisputed lordship of the world. But if the
result of the battle were unfavourable, those who fell fighting
gallantly would have the record of having died for their
country, while those that saved themselves by flight would
spend the rest of their days as objects of pitying contempt
and scorn. For there was no place in Libya which could
secure their safety if they fled; while, if they fell into the hands
of the Carthaginians, no one who looked facts in the face
could doubt what would happen to them. May none of you,"
he added, "learn that by experience! Since, then, Fortune
puts before us the most glorious of rewards, in whichever way
the battle is decided, should we not be at once the most
mean-spirited and foolish of mankind if we abandon the most
glorious alternative, and from a paltry clinging to life deliberately choose the worst of misfortunes? Charge the enemy
then with the steady resolve to do one of two things, to
conquer or to die! For it is men thus minded who invariably
conquer their opponents, since they enter the field with no
other hope of life."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Hannibal's Preparations and Speech</head>
<p>Such was Scipio's address to his men. Meanwhile
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's order of battle.</note>
Hannibal had put his men also into position. His
elephants, which numbered more than eighty, he
placed in the van of the whole army. Next his
mercenaries, amounting to twelve thousand, and consisting of
Ligurians, Celts, Baliarians, and Mauretani; behind them
the native Libyans and Carthaginians; and on the rear of the
whole the men whom he had brought from Italy, at a distance
of somewhat more than a stade. His wings he strengthened
<pb n="146"/>
with cavalry, stationing the Numidian allies on the left wing,
and the Carthaginian horsemen on the right. He ordered
each officer to address his own men, bidding them rest their
hopes of victory on him and the army he had brought with
him; while he bade their officers remind the Carthaginians
in plain terms what would happen to their wives and children
if the battle should be lost. While these orders were carried
out by the officers, Hannibal himself went along the lines of
his Italian army and urged them "to remember the seventeen
years during which they had been brothers-inarms, and the number of battles they had fought
with the Romans, in which they had never been
beaten or given the Romans even a hope of victory.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal's speech to the "army of Italy."</note> Above
all, putting aside minor engagements and their countless successes, let them place before their eyes the battle of the River
Trebia against the father of the present Roman commander;
and again the battle in Etruria against Flaminius; and
lastly that at Cannae against Aemilius, with none of which
was the present struggle to be compared, whether in regard
to the number or excellence of the enemy's men. Let
them only raise their eyes and look at the ranks of the
enemy; they would see that they were not merely fewer, but
many times fewer than those with whom they had fought
before, while, as to their soldierly qualities, there was no comparison. The former Roman armies had come to the struggle
with them untainted by memories of past defeats: while these
men were the sons or the remnants of those who had been
beaten in Italy, and fled before him again and again. They
ought not therefore," he said, "to undo the glory and fame
of their previous achievements, but to struggle with a firm and
brave resolve to maintain their reputation of invincibility."</p>
<p>Such were the addresses of the two commanders.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>The Battle of Zama Begins</head>
<p>All arrangements for the battle being complete, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A stampede of the elephants.</note>
the two opposing forces of Numidian cavalry
having been for some time engaged in skirmishing attacks upon each other, Hannibal gave the
word to the men on the elephants to charge the enemy. But
as they heard the horns and trumpets braying all round them,
some of the elephants became unmanageable and rushed back
<pb n="147"/>
upon the Numidian contingents of the Carthaginian army;
and this enabled Massanissa with great speed to deprive the
Carthaginian left wing of its cavalry support. The rest of the
elephants charged the Roman velites in the spaces between the
maniples of the line, and while inflicting much damage on the
enemy suffered severely themselves; until, becoming frightened,
some of them ran away down the vacant spaces, the Romans
letting them pass harmlessly along, according to Scipio's
orders, while others ran away to the right under a shower of
darts from the cavalry, until they were finally driven clear off
the field.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Flight of the Carthaginian cavalry.</note> It was just at the moment of this
stampede of the elephants, that Laelius forced
the Carthaginian cavalry into headlong flight,
and along with Massanissa pressed them with a vigorous
pursuit. While this was going on, the opposing lines of heavy
infantry were advancing to meet others with deliberate step and
proud confidence, except Hannibal's "army of Italy," which
remained in its original position. When they came within
distance the Roman soldiers charged the enemy, shouting as
usual their war-cry, and clashing their swords against their
shields: while the Carthaginian mercenaries uttered a strange
confusion of cries, the effect of which was indescribable, for, in
the words of the poet,<note anchored="yes">Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.437"><title>Iliad,</title> 4, 437</bibl>.</note> the

<p>The whole affair being now a trial of strength between
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The fight of the heavy infantry.</note>
man and man at close quarters, as the combatants used their swords and not their spears, the
superiority was at first on the side of the dexterity
and daring of the mercenaries, which enabled them to wound
a considerable number of the Romans. The latter, however,
trusting to the steadiness of their ranks and the excellence of
their arms, still kept gaining ground, their rear ranks keeping
close up with them and encouraging them to advance; while
the Carthaginians did not keep up with their mercenaries nor
support them, but showed a thoroughly cowardly spirit. The
result was that the foreign soldiers gave way: and, believing that
they had been shamelessly abandoned by their own side, fell
<pb n="148"/>
upon the men on their rear as they were retreating, and began
killing them; whereby many of the Carthaginians were compelled to meet a gallant death in spite of themselves. For as
they were being cut down by their mercenaries they had, much
against their inclination, to fight with their own men and the
Romans at the same time; and as they now fought with
desperation and fury they killed a good many both of their
own men and of the enemy also. Thus it came about that their
charge threw the maniples of the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> into confusion;
whereupon the officers of the <foreign lang="la">principes</foreign> caused their lines to advance
to oppose them. However, the greater part of the mercenaries

sword of the <foreign lang="la">hastati.</foreign> Those who survived and fled Hannibal
would not allow to enter the ranks of his army, but ordered

<head>Victory of Scipio and Flight of Hannibal</head>
<p>The space between the two armies that still remained

in position was full of blood, wounded men, and
dead corpses; and thus the rout of the enemy
proved an impediment of a perplexing nature to
the Roman general. Everything was calculated
to make an advance in order difficult,&mdash;the
ground slippery with gore, the corpses lying
piled up in bloody heaps, and with the corpses arms flung
about in every direction. However Scipio caused the wounded
to be carried to the rear, and the <foreign lang="la">hastati</foreign> to be recalled from
the pursuit by the sound of a bugle, and drew them up where
they were in advance of the ground on which the fighting had

<head>Hannibal Did All He Could</head>
<p>Such was the end of this battle, fought under these
famous commanders: a battle on which everything depended,
and which assigned universal dominion to Rome. After it had
come to an end, Scipio pushed on in pursuit as far as the
Carthaginian camp, and, after plundering that,
returned to his own. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Hannibal escapes to Adrumetum.</note> Hannibal, escaping with
a few horsemen, did not draw rein until he
arrived safely at Adrumetum. He had done in the battle all
that was to be expected of a good and experienced general.
First, he had tried by an interview with his opponent to see
what he could do to procure a pacification; and that was the
right course for a man, who, while fully conscious of his former
victories, yet mistrusts Fortune, and has an eye to all the possible
and unexpected contingencies of war. Next, having accepted
battle, the excellence of his dispositions for a contest with
the Romans, considering the identity of the arms on each side,
could not have been surpassed. For though the Roman line
is hard to break, yet each individual soldier and each company,
owing to the uniform tactic employed, can fight in any direction,
those companies, which happen to be in nearest contact with
the danger, wheeling round to the point required. Again, the
nature of their arms gives at once protection and confidence, for
their shield is large and their sword will not bend: the Romans
therefore are formidable on the field and hard to conquer.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Hannibal's Tactics Sound</head>
<p>Still Hannibal took his measures against each of these
difficulties in a manner that could not be surpassed. He provided himself with those numerous elephants, and put them in
the van, for the express purpose of throwing the enemy's ranks
into confusion and breaking their order. Again he stationed
the mercenaries in front and the Carthaginians behind them, in
<pb n="150"/>
order to wear out the bodies of the enemy with fatigue beforehand, and to blunt the edge of their swords by the numbers
that would be killed by them; and moreover to compel the
Carthaginians, by being in the middle of the army, to stay
where they were and fight, as the poet says<note anchored="yes">Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.300"><title>Iliad,</title> 4, 300</bibl>.</note>&mdash;
<quote><l>"That howsoe'er unwilling fight he must."</l></quote>
But the most warlike and steady part of his army he held in
reserve at some distance, in order that they might not see
what was happening too closely, but, with strength and spirit
unimpaired, might use their courage to the best advantage
when the moment arrived. And, if in spite of having done
everything that could be done, he who had never been beaten
before failed to secure the victory now, we must excuse him.
For there are times when chance thwarts the plans of the
brave; and there are others again, when a man
<quote><l>"Though great and brave has met a greater still."<note anchored="yes">A line of which the author is unknown; perhaps it was Theognis.</note></l></quote>

<p>Manifestations of emotion which go beyond what is

customary among a particular people, if they
are thought to be the result of genuine feeling

and we are all in a manner moved by the
novelty of the spectacle. But when such things
appear to be assumed for the purpose of taking in the spectators and producing a dramatic effect, they do not provoke
pity, but anger and dislike. And this was the case in regard
to the Carthaginian envoys. Scipio deigned to give a very
brief answer to their prayers, saying that "They, at any rate,
deserved no kindness at the hands of the Romans, since
they had themselves confessed that they were the aggressors in the war, by having,
contrary to their treaty obligations, taken Saguntum and enslaved its inhabitants, and had
recently been guilty of treachery and breaking the terms of a
treaty to which they had subscribed and sworn. It was from
<pb n="151"/>
a regard to their own dignity, to the vicissitudes of Fortune, and
to the dictates of humanity that the Romans had determined
to treat them with lenity and behave with magnanimity. And
of this they would be convinced if they would take a right
view of the case. For they ought not to consider it a hardship if they found themselves
charged to submit to any punishment, to follow a particular line of conduct, or to give up
this or that; they ought rather to regard it as an unexpected
favour that any kindness was conceded to them at all; since
Fortune, after depriving them of all right to pity and consideration, owing to their own unrighteous conduct, had put them in
the power of their enemies." After this preamble he mentioned the concessions to be made to them, and the penalties
to which they were to submit.</p></div2>

who hastened home and communicated its
terms to their countrymen. It was then that
the story goes that, upon a certain Senator
intending to speak against accepting the terms
and actually beginning to do so, Hannibal
came forward and pulled the man down from
the tribune; and when the other senators showed anger at
this breach of custom, Hannibal rose again and "owned that
he was ignorant of such things; but said that they must pardon
him if he acted in any way contrary to their customs, remembering that he had left the country when he was but fourteen,
and had only returned when now past forty-five. Therefore
he begged them not to consider whether he had committed
a breach of custom, but much rather whether he were genuinely
feeling for his country's misfortunes; for that was the real
reason for his having been guilty of this breach of manners.
For it appeared to him to be astonishing, and, indeed, quite
unaccountable, that any one calling himself a Carthaginian,
and being fully aware of the policy which they had individually
and collectively adopted against the Romans, should do otherwise than adore the kindness of Fortune for obtaining such
favourable terms, when in their power, as a few days ago no
one&mdash;considering the extraordinary provocation they had
given&mdash;would have ventured to mention, if they had been
asked what they expected would happen to their country, in
case of the Romans proving victorious. Therefore he called
upon them now not to debate, but unanimously to accept the
terms offered, and with sacrifices to the gods to pray with one
accord that the Roman people might confirm the treaty." His
advice being regarded as both sensible and timely, they resolved
to sign the treaty on the conditions specified; and the senate
at once despatched envoys to notify their consent. . . .</p>

<p>Is it not astonishing that while Ptolemy Philopator

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Shameless ambition of Philip and Antiochus.</note> were ready with offers of aid, but that as soon as he was dead,
leaving his heir a mere child, whose kingdom
they were bound by the ties of nature to have
defended, they then egged each other on to
adopt the policy of partitioning the boy's kingdom between
themselves, and getting rid entirely of the heir; and that too
without putting forward any decent pretext to cover their
iniquity, but acting so shamelessly, and so like beasts of prey,
that one can only compare their habits to those ascribed to
fishes, among which, though they may be of the same species,
the destruction of the smaller is the food and sustenance of
the larger. This treaty of theirs shows, as though in a mirror,
the impiety to heaven and cruelty to man of these two
kings, as well as their unbounded ambition. However, if a
man were disposed to find fault with Fortune for her administration of human affairs, he might fairly become reconciled to
her in this case; for she brought upon those monarchs the
punishment they so well deserved, and by the signal example
she made of them taught posterity a lesson in righteousness.
For while they were engaged in acts of treachery against each
other, and in dismembering the child's kingdom in their own
interests, she brought the Romans upon them, and the very
measures which they had lawlessly designed against another,
she justly and properly carried out against them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-197">197</date>. B. C. <date value="-191">191</date>.</note> For both of

destroyed them, or involved them in misfortunes which were
little short of that. . . .</p></div2>

assailing his neighbours. In the second place, that by involving
a Greek city without just cause in the most dreadful misfortunes,
he was sure to confirm the report, which had been widely

<head>The Rhodians Object to Philip's Treatment of Cius</head>
<p>For it happened that just when his ambassador was

defending his master before the Rhodians in
the theatre,&mdash;enlarging on "the magnanimity of
Philip," and announcing that "though already in
a manner master of Cius, he conceded its safety to the wishes
of the Rhodian people; and did so because he desired to
refute the calumnies of his enemies, and to establish the
honesty of his intentions in the eyes of Rhodes,"&mdash;just then a
man entered the Prytaneum who had newly arrived in the
island, and brought the news of the enslavement of the Cians
and the cruelty which Philip had exercised upon them. The
Prytanis coming into the theatre to announce this news, while
the ambassador was absolutely in the middle of his speech,
the Rhodians could scarcely make up their minds to believe
a report which involved such monstrous treachery.</p>
<p>He had then betrayed himself quite as grossly as the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">It causes a breach with the Aetolians.</note>
Cians; and so blind or misguided had he become as to the
principles of right and wrong, that he boasted of actions of
which he ought to have been most heartily ashamed, and
plumed himself upon them as though they were to his credit.
But the people of Rhodes from that day forth regarded
Philip as their enemy, and made their preparations with that
view. And no less by this course had he gained
the hatred of the Aetolians. He had but
lately made terms with, and held out the hand
of friendship to that nation: no excuse for a breach had
arisen; and the Lysimachians, Calchedonians, and Cianians
were friends and allies of the Aetolians. Nevertheless only a

short time before he had separated Lysimachia from the
Aetolian alliance, and induced it to submit to him: then he
had done the same to Calchedon: and lastly he had enslaved
the Cians, though there was an Aetolian officer actually in Cius
and conducting the government. Prusias, however, in so far
as his policy was accomplished, was delighted; but inasmuch
as another was in possession of the prizes of the operations,
while he himself got as his share nothing but the bare site
of a city, was extremely annoyed, but was yet unable to do
anything. . . .</p></div2>

accordingly find themselves deceived as to the honourable

has as yet had nothing to cast a damp upon his projects,
would it not seem the height of folly and madness to proclaim

having caused a platform to be erected in the
largest court of the palace Agathocles and
Sosibius summoned a meeting of the footguards and the household, as well as the
officers of the infantry and cavalry. The
assembly being formed, they mounted the platform, and first of all announced the deaths of the king and
queen, and proclaimed the customary period of mourning for
the people. After that they placed a diadem upon the head
of the child, Ptolemy Epiphanes, proclaimed him king,
and read a forged will, in which the late king nominated
Agathocles and Sosibius guardians of his son. They ended by
an exhortation to the officers to be loyal to the boy and maintain
his sovereignty. They next brought in two silver urns, one of
which they declared contained the ashes of the king, the other
those of Arsinoe. And in fact one of them did really contain
the king's ashes, the other was filled with spices. Having done
this they proceeded to complete the funeral ceremonies. It
was then that all the world at last learnt the truth about the
<pb n="158"/>
death of Arsinoe. For now that her death was clearly
established, the manner of it began to be a matter of speculation. Though rumours which turned out to be true had
found their way among the people, they had up to this time
been disputed; now there was no possibility of hiding the
truth, and it became deeply impressed in the minds of all.
Indeed there was great excitement among the populace: no one
thought about the king; it was the fate of Arsinoe that
moved them. Some recalled her orphanhood; others the
tyranny and insult she had endured from her earliest days;
and when her miserable death was added to these misfortunes,
it excited such a passion of pity and sorrow that the city was
filled with sighs, tears, and irrepressible lamentation. Yet it was
clear to the thoughtful observer that these were not so much
signs of affection for Arsinoe as of hatred towards Agathocles.</p>
<p>The first measure of this minister, after depositing the urns<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Agathocles propitiates the army and gets rid of rivals.</note>
in the royal mortuary, and giving orders for the
laying aside of mourning, was to gratify the
army with two months' pay; for he was convinced that the way to deaden the resentment
of the common soldiers was to appeal to their interests. He
then caused them to take the oath customary at the proclamation of a new king; and next took measures to get all
who were likely to be formidable out of the country.
Philammon, who had been employed in the murder of Arsinoe,
he sent out as governor of Cyrene, while he committed the
young king to the charge of Oenanthe and Agathocleia.
Next, Pelops the son of Pelops he despatched to the court of
Antiochus in Asia, to urge him to maintain his friendly
relations with the court of Alexandria, and not to violate the
treaty he had made with the young king's father. Ptolemy,
son of Sosibius, he sent to Philip to arrange for a treaty of
intermarriage between the two countries, and to ask for assistance in case Antiochus should make a serious attempt to play
them false in any matter of importance.</p>
<p>He also selected Ptolemy, son of Agesarchus, as ambassador to Rome: not with a view of his seriously prosecuting
the embassy, but because he thought that, if he once entered
Greece, he would find himself among friends and kinsfolk,
<pb n="159"/>
and would stay there; which would suit his policy of getting
rid of eminent men. Scopas the Aetolian also he sent to
Greece to recruit foreign mercenaries, giving him a large
sum in gold for bounties. He had two objects in view
in this measure: one was to use the soldiers so recruited
in the war with Antiochus; another was to get rid of the
mercenary troops already existing, by sending them on garrison
duty in the various forts and settlements about the country;
while he used the new recruits to fill up the numbers of the
household regiments with new men, as well as the pickets
immediately round the palace, and in other parts of the city.
For he believed that men who had been hired by himself, and
were taking his pay, would have no feelings in common with
the old soldiers, with whom they would be totally unacquainted;
but that, having all their hopes of safety and profit in him, he
would find them ready to co-operate with him and carry out
his orders.</p>
<p>Now all this took place before the intrigue of Philip, though
it was necessary for the sake of clearness to speak of that first,
and to describe the transactions which took place, both at the
audience and the dispatch of the ambassadors.</p>
<p> To return to Agathocles: when he had thus got rid of the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The debauchery of Agathocles.</note>
most eminent men, and had to a great degree
quieted the wrath of the common soldiers by his
present of pay, he returned quickly to his old
way of life. Drawing round him a body of friends, whom he
selected from the most frivolous and shameless of his personal
attendants or servants, he devoted the chief part of the day
and night to drunkenness and all the excesses which accompany
drunkenness, sparing neither matron, nor bride, nor virgin, and
doing all this with the most offensive ostentation. The result
was a widespread outburst of discontent; and when there
appeared no prospect of reforming this state of things, or of
obtaining protection against the violence, insolence and
debauchery of the court, which on the contrary grew daily
more outrageous, their old hatred blazed up once more in the
hearts of the common people, and all began again to recall the
misfortunes which the kingdom already owed to these very
men. But the absence of any one fit to take the lead, and
<pb n="160"/>
by whose means they could vent their wrath upon Agathocles
and Agathocleia, kept them quiet. Their one remaining hope
rested upon Tlepolemus, and on this they fixed their confidence.</p>
<p>As long as the late king was alive Tlepolemus remained in<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Tlepolemus, governor of Pelusium, determines to depose Agathocles, B. C. <dateRange from="-205" to="-204">205</dateRange>-204.</note>
retirement; but upon his death he quickly propitiated the common soldiers, and became once
more governor of Pelusium. At first he directed
all his actions with a view to the interest of the
king, believing that there would be some
council of regency to take charge of the boy and administer
the government. But when he saw that all those who were
fit for this charge were got out of the way, and that Agathocles
was boldly monopolising the supreme power, he quickly
changed his purpose; because he suspected the danger that
threatened him from the hatred which they mutually entertained. He therefore began to draw his troops together, and
bestir himself to collect money, that he might not be an easy
prey to any one of his enemies. At the same time he was not
without hope that the guardianship of the young king, and
the chief power in the state might devolve upon him; both
because, in his own private opinion, he was much more fit for
it in every respect than Agathocles, and because he was
informed that his own troops and those in Alexandria were
looking to him to put an end to the minister's outrageous
conduct. When such ideas were entertained by Tlepolemus,
it did not take long to make the quarrel grow, especially as the
partisans of both helped to inflame it. Being eager to secure
the adhesion of the generals of divisions and the captains of
companies, he frequently invited them to banquets; and at
these assemblies, instigated partly by the flattery of his guests
and partly by his own impulse (for he was a young man
and the conversation was over the wine), he used to throw
out sarcastic remarks against the family of Agathocles. At
first they were covert and enigmatic, then merely ambiguous,
and finally undisguised, and containing the bitterest reflections.
He proposed the health of the scribbler of pasquinades, the
sackbut-girl and waiting-woman; and spoke of his shameful
boyhood, when as cupbearer of the king he had submitted
<pb n="161"/>
to the foulest treatment. His guests were always ready to
laugh at his words and add their quota to the sum of vituperation. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Agathocles will anticipate him.</note>
It was not long before this reached the ears of
Agathocles: and the breach between the two
thus becoming an open one, Agathocles immediately began bringing charges against
Tlepolemus, declaring that he was a traitor to the king, and
was inviting Antiochus to come and seize the government.
And he brought many plausible proofs of this forward, some of
which he got by distorting facts that actually occurred, while
others were pure invention. His object in so doing was to
excite the wrath of the common people against Tlepolemus.
But the result was the reverse; for the populace had long fixed
their hopes on Tlepolemus, and were only too delighted to see
the quarrel growing hot between them. The actual popular
outbreak which did occur began from the following circumstances. Nicon, a relation of Agathocles, was in the lifetime of
the late king commander of the navy. . . .</p></div2>

For the letter ordering the murder of Arsinoe
had fallen into this man's hands, and he might have given
information about the plot and saved the Queen; but at the
time he chose rather to help Philammon, and so became the
cause of all the misfortunes which followed; while, after the
murder was committed, he was always recalling the circumstances, commiserating the unhappy woman, and expressing
repentance at having let such an opportunity slip: and this he
repeated in the hearing of many, so that Agathocles heard of
it, and he met with his just punishment in losing his life. . . .</p></div3></div2>

<p>The first step of Agathocles was to summon a meeting of the Macedonian guards. He entered the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Agathocles pretends a plot of Tlepolemus against the king, B. C. <date value="-202">202</date>.</note>
assembly accompanied by the young king and
his own sister Agathocleia. At first he feigned
not to be able to say what he wished for tears;
but after again and again wiping his eyes with his chlamys he
<pb n="162"/>
at length mastered his emotion, and, taking the young king in
his arms, spoke as follows: "Take this boy, whom his father
on his death-bed placed in this lady's arms" (pointing to his
sister) "and confided to your loyalty, men of Macedonia! That
lady's affection has but little influence in securing the child's
safety: it is on you that that safety now depends; his fortunes
are in your hands. It has long been evident to those who
had eyes to see, that Tlepolemus was aiming at something
higher than his natural rank; but now he has named the day
and hour on which he intends to assume the crown. Do not
let your belief of this depend upon my words; refer to those
who know the real truth and have but just come from the
very scene of his treason." With these words he brought
forward Critolaus, who deposed that he had seen with his own
eyes the altars being decked, and the victims being got ready
by the common soldiers for the ceremony of a coronation.</p>
<p>When the Macedonian guards had heard all this, far from<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Anger of the populace and soldiers against Agathocles.</note>
being moved by his appeal, they showed their
contempt by hooting and loud murmurs, and
drove him away under such a fire of derision
that he got out of the assembly without being
conscious how he did it. And similar scenes occurred among
other corps of the army at their meetings. Meanwhile great
crowds kept pouring into Alexandria from the up-country
stations, calling upon kinsmen or friends to help the movement, and not to submit to the unbridled tyranny of such
unworthy men. But what inflamed the populace against the
government more than anything else was the knowledge that,
as Tlepolemus had the absolute command of all the imports
into Alexandria, delay would be a cause of suffering to themselves.</p></div3></div2>
<div2 id="b15c27" type="chapter" n="27">
<head>Growing Hatred of Agathocles</head>
<p>Moreover, an action of Agathocles himself served to
heighten the anger of the multitude and of Tlepolemus. For
he took Danae, the latter's mother-in-law, from the temple of
Demeter, dragged her through the middle of the city unveiled,
and cast her into prison. His object in doing this was to
manifest his hostility to Tlepolemus; but its effect was to
loosen the tongues of the people. In their anger they no
longer confined themselves to secret murmurs: but some of
<pb n="163"/>
them in the night covered the walls in every part of the city
with pasquinades; while others in the day time collected in
groups and openly expressed their loathing for the government.</p>
<p>Seeing what was taking place, and beginning to fear the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Terror of Agathocles.</note>
worst, Agathocles at one time meditated making
his escape by secret flight; but as he had
nothing ready for such a measure, thanks to his
own imprudence, he had to give up that idea. At another
time he set himself to drawing out lists of men likely to assist
him in a bold <foreign lang="fr">coup d'&eacute;tat,</foreign> by which he should put to death
or arrest his enemies, and then possess himself of absolute
power. While still meditating these plans he received information that Moeragenes, one of the body-guard, was
betraying all the secrets of the palace to Tlepolemus, and was
co-operating with him on account of his relationship with
Adaeus, at that time the commander of Bubastus. Agathocles
immediately ordered his secretary Nicostratus
to arrest Moeragenes, and extract the truth
from him by every possible kind of torture. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Arrest of Moeragenes.</note>
Being promptly arrested by Nicostratus, and taken to a retired
part of the place, he was at first examined directly as to the
facts alleged; but, refusing to confess anything, he was stripped.
And now some of the torturers were preparing their instruments, and others with scourges in their hands were just
taking off their outer garments, when just at that very moment
a servant ran in, and, whispering something in the ear of
Nicostratus, hurried out again. Nicostratus followed close
behind him, without a word, frequently slapping his thigh with
his hand.</p></div2>

<p>The predicament of Moeragenes was now indescribably strange. There stood the executioners
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Moeragenes rouses the soldiers.</note>
by his side on the point of raising their
scourges, while others close to him were
getting ready their instruments of torture: but when Nicostratus withdrew they all stood silently staring at each other's
faces, expecting him every moment to return; but as time
went on they one by one slipped away, until Moeragenes was
left alone. Having made his way through the palace, after
this unhoped-for escape, he rushed in his half-clothed state
<pb n="164"/>
into a tent of the Macedonian guards which was situated
close to the palace. They chanced to be at breakfast, and
therefore a good many were collected together; and to them
he narrated the story of his wonderful escape. At first they
would not believe it, but ultimately were convinced by his
appearing without his clothes. Taking advantage of this
extraordinary occurrence, Moeragenes besought the Macedonian
guards with tears not only to help him to secure his own
safety, but the king's also, and above all their own. "For
certain destruction stared them in the face," he said, "unless
they seized the moment when the hatred of the populace was
at its height, and every one was ready to wreak vengeance on
Agathocles. That moment was <emph>now,</emph> and all that was wanted
was some one to begin."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c29" type="chapter" n="29">
<head>A Revolt Decided Upon By the Army</head>
<p>The passions of the Macedonians were roused by these
words, and they finally agreed to do as Moeragenes advised.
They at once went round to the tents, first those of their own
corps, and then those of the other soldiers; which were all
close together, facing the same quarter of the city. The wish
was one which had for a long time been formed in the minds
of the soldiery, wanting nothing but some one to call it forth,
and with courage to begin. No sooner, therefore, had a commencement been made than it blazed out like a fire: and
before four hours had elapsed every class, whether military or
civil, had agreed to make the attempt.</p>
<p>At this crisis, too, chance contributed a great deal to the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Agathocles despairs.</note>
final catastrophe. For a letter addressed by
Tlepolemus to the army as well as some of
his spies, had fallen into the hands of
Agathocles. The letter announced that he would be at
Alexandria shortly, and the spies informed Agathocles that
he was already there. This news so distracted Agathocles
that he gave up taking any measures at all or even thinking
about the dangers which surrounded him, but departed at his
usual hour to his wine, and kept up the carouse to the end
in his usual licentious fashion. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Oenanthe in the temple of Demeter.</note> But his
mother Oenanthe went in great distress to the
temple of Demeter and Persephone, which was
open on account of a certain annual sacrifice; and there first
<pb n="165"/>
of all she besought the aid of those goddesses with bendings of the knee and strange incantations, and then sat down
close to the altar and remained motionless. Most of
the women present, delighted to witness her dejection and
distress, kept silence: but the ladies of the family of Polycrates, and certain others of the nobility, being as yet unaware
of what was going on around them, approached Oenanthe and
tried to comfort her. But she cried out in a loud voice:
"Do not come near me, you monsters! I know you well!
Your hearts are always against us; and you pray the goddess
for all imaginable evil upon us. Still I trust and believe that,
God willing, you shall one day taste the flesh of your own
children." With these words she ordered her female
attendants to drive them away, and strike them with their
staves if they refused to go. The ladies availed themselves of
this excuse for quitting the temple in a body, raising their
hands and praying that she might herself have experience of
those very miseries with which she had threatened her
neighbours.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>A Mob Assembles</head>
<p>The men having by this time decided upon a revolution, now that in every house the anger of the women was
added to the general resentment, the popular
hatred blazed out with redoubled violence. As
soon as night fell the whole city was filled with tumult, torches,
and hurrying feet. Some were assembling with shouts in the
stadium; some were calling upon others to join them; some
were running backwards and forwards seeking to conceal themselves in houses and places least likely to be suspected. And
now the open spaces round the palace, the stadium, and the
street were filled with a motley crowd, as well as the area in
front of the Dionysian Theatre. Being informed of this,
Agathocles roused himself from a drunken lethargy,&mdash;for he had
just dismissed his drinking party,&mdash;and, accompanied by all his
family, with the exception of Philo, went to the king. After
a few words of lamentation over his misfortunes addressed to
the child, he took him by the hand, and proceeded to the
covered walk which runs between the Maeander garden and the
Palaestra, and leads to the entrance of the theatre. Having
securely fastened the two first doors through which he passed,
<pb n="166"/>
he entered the third with two or three bodyguards, his own
family, and the king. The doors, however, which were secured
by double bars, were only of lattice work and could therefore
be seen through.</p>
<p>By this time the mob had collected from every part of the
city in such numbers, that, not only was every foot of ground
occupied, but the doorsteps and roofs also were crammed with
human beings; and such a mingled storm of shouts and cries
arose, as might be expected from a crowd in which women and
children were mixed with men: for in Alexandria, as in Carthage, the children perform as conspicuous a part in such
commotions as the men.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c31" type="chapter" n="31">
<head>The King Surrendered To the Soldiers</head>
<p>Day now began to break and the uproar was still a
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cries for the king.</note>
confused babel of voices; but one cry made itself heard conspicuously above the rest, it was a call for THE
KING. The first thing actually done was by the
Macedonian guard: they left their quarters and seized the
vestibule which served as the audience hall of the palace; then,
after a brief pause, having ascertained whereabouts in the
palace the king was, they went round to the covered walk,
burst open the first doors, and, when they came to the next,
demanded with loud shouts that the young king should be
surrendered to them. Agathocles, recognising his danger,
begged his bodyguards to go in his name to the Macedonians,
to inform them that "he resigned the guardianship of the
king, and all offices, honours, or emoluments which he
possessed, and only asked that his life should be granted him
with a bare maintenance; that by sinking to his original situation in life he would be rendered incapable, even if he wished
it, of being henceforth oppressive to any one." All the bodyguards refused except Aristomenes, who afterwards obtained the
chief power in the state.</p>
<p>This man was an Acarnanian, and, though far advanced in<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aristomenes.</note>
life when he obtained supreme power, he is
thought to have made a most excellent and
blameless guardian of the king and kingdom. And as he was
distinguished in that capacity, so had he been remarkable
before for his adulation of Agathocles in the time of his prosperity. He was the first, when entertaining Agathocles at his
<pb n="167"/>
house, to distinguish him among his guests by the present of a
gold diadem, an honour reserved by custom to the kings alone;
he was the first too who ventured to wear his likeness on his
ring; and when a daughter was born to him he named her
Agathocleia.</p>
<p>But to return to my story. Aristomenes undertook the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The guards insist on the surrender of the king.</note>
mission, received his message, and made his
way through a certain wicket-gate to the
Macedonians. He stated his business in few
words: the first impulse of the Macedonians was to stab
him to death on the spot; but some of them held up their
hands to protect him, and successfully begged his life.
He accordingly returned with orders to bring the king or to
come no more himself. Having dismissed Aristomenes with
these words, the Macedonians proceeded to burst open the
second door also. When convinced by their proceedings, no
less than by the answers they had returned, of the fierce purpose of the Macedonians, the first idea of Agathocles was to
thrust his hand through the latticed door,&mdash;while Agathocleia
did the same with her breasts which she said had suckled the
king,&mdash;and by every kind of entreaty to beg that the
Macedonians would grant him bare life.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c32" type="chapter" n="32">
<head>The King Conducted to the Stadium</head>
<p>But finding that his long and piteous appeals produced
no effect, at last he sent out the young king with the bodyguards.
As soon as they had got the king, the Macedonians placed him on a horse and
conducted him to the stadium. His appearance being greeted with loud shouts and clapping of
hands, they stopped the horse, and dismounting the child,
ushered him to the royal stall and seated him there. But
the feelings of the crowd were divided: they were delighted that the young king had been brought, but they
were dissatisfied that the guilty persons had not been arrested
and met with the punishment they deserved. Accordingly,
they continued with loud cries to demand that the authors of all
the mischief should be brought out and made an example. The
day was wearing away, and yet the crowd had found no one
on whom to wreak their vengeance, when Sosibius, who, though
a son of the elder Sosibius, was at that time a member of the
<pb n="168"/>
bodyguard, and as such had a special eye to the safety of the
king and the State,&mdash;seeing that the furious desire of the
multitude was implacable, and that the child was frightened at
the unaccustomed faces that surrounded him and the uproar
of the crowd, asked the king whether he would "surrender to
the populace those who had injured him or his mother." The
boy having nodded assent, Sosibius bade some of the bodyguard announce the king's decision, while he raised the young
child from his seat and took him to his own house which
was close by to receive proper attention and refreshment.
When the message from the king was declared, the whole
place broke out into a storm of cheering and clapping of
hands. But meanwhile Agathocles and Agathocleia had
separated and gone each to their own lodgings. Without loss
of time soldiers, some voluntarily and others under pressure
from the crowd, started in search of them.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c33" type="chapter" n="33">
<head>The Massacre of Agathocles and Family</head>
<p>The beginning of actual bloodshed, however, was
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of Agathocles, his sister, and Oenanthe.</note>
this. One of the servants and flatterers of Agathocles, whose
name was Philo, came out to the stadium still flustered with
wine. Seeing the fury of the multitude, he said to some bystanders that they would have cause to repent it again, as they
had only the other day, if Agathocles were to come there. Of
those who heard him some began to abuse him, while others
pushed him about; and on his attempting to defend himself,
some tore his cloak off his back, while others thrust their
spears into him and wounded him mortally. He was dragged
into the middle of the crowd breathing his last gasp; and, having
thus tasted blood, the multitude began to look impatiently for
the coming of the other victims. They had not
to wait long. First appeared Agathocles dragged
along bound hand and foot. No sooner had
he entered than some soldiers rushed at him
and struck him dead. And in doing so they were his friends
rather than enemies, for they saved him from the horrible
death which he deserved. Nicon was brought next, and after
him Agathocleia stripped naked, with her two sisters; and
following them the whole family. Last of all some men came
bringing Oenanthe, whom they had torn from the temple of
Demeter and Persephone, riding stripped naked upon a horse.
<pb n="169"/>
They were all given up to the populace, who bit, and stabbed
them, and knocked out their eyes, and, as soon as any one
of them fell, tore him limb from limb, until they had utterly
annihilated them all: for the savagery of the Egyptians when
their passions are roused is indeed terrible. At the same
time some young girls who had been brought up with Arsinoe,
having learnt that Philammon, the chief agent in the murder of
that Queen, had arrived three days before from Cyrene, rushed
to his house; forced their way in; killed Philammon with
stones and sticks; strangled his infant son; and, not content
with this, dragged his wife naked into the street and put her
to death.</p>
<p>Such was the end of Agathocles and Agathocleia and their
kinsfolk.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c34" type="chapter" n="34">
<head>Why Agathocles Died As He Did</head>
<p>I am quite aware of the miraculous occurrences and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The contemptible character of Agathocles.</note>
embellishments which the chroniclers of this
event have added to their narrative with a view
of producing a striking effect upon their hearers,
making more of their comments on the story than of the story
itself and the main incidents. Some ascribe it entirely to
Fortune, and take the opportunity of expatiating on her fickleness and the difficulty of being on one's guard against her.
Others dwell upon the unexpectedness of the event, and
try to assign its causes and probabilities. It was not my purpose, however, to treat this episode in this way,
because Agathocles was not a man of conspicuous courage or ability as a
soldier; nor particularly successful or worth imitating as a
statesman; nor, lastly, eminent for his acuteness as a courtier
or cunning as an intriguer, by which latter accomplishments
Sosibius and many others have managed to keep one king
after another under their influence to the last day of their
lives. The very opposite of all this may be said of this man.
For though he obtained high promotion owing to Philopator's
feebleness as a king; and though after his death he had the
most favourable opportunity of consolidating his power, he yet
soon fell into contempt, and lost his position and his life at
once, thanks to his own want of courage and vigour.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c35" type="chapter" n="35">
<head>Agathocles Not a Good Example of Mutability of Fortune</head>
<p>To such a story then no such dissertation is required, as
was in place, for instance, in the case of the Sicilian monarchs,
<pb n="170"/>
Agathocles and Dionysius, and certain others who have administered
governments with reputation. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">See <ref target="b12c15" targOrder="U">12. 15</ref>.</note> For the
former of these, starting from a plebeian and
humble position&mdash;having been, as Timaeus sneeringly remarks,
a potter&mdash;came from the wheel, clay, and smoke, quite a young
man to Syracuse. And, to begin with, both these men in their respective generations became tyrants of Syracuse, a city that had
obtained at that time the greatest reputation and the greatest
wealth of any in the world; and afterwards were regarded
as suzerains of all Sicily, and lords of certain districts in Italy.
While, for his part, Agathocles not only made an attempt
upon Africa, but eventually died in possession of the greatness
he had acquired. It is on this account that the story is told
of Publius Scipio, the first conqueror of the Carthaginians,
that being asked whom he considered to have been the most
skilful administrators and most distinguished for boldness combined with prudence, he replied, "the Sicilians Agathocles
and Dionysius." Now, in the case of such men as these, it is
certainly right to try to arrest the attention of our readers, and,
I suppose, to speak of Fortune and the mutability of human
affairs, and in fact to point a moral: but in the case of such
men as we have been speaking of, it is quite out of place to
do so.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b15c36" type="chapter" n="36">
<head>Agathocles Was Not An Important Person</head>
<p>For these reasons I have rejected all idea of making
too much of the story of Agathocles. But another and the
strongest reason was that all such wonderful and striking
catastrophes are only worth listening to once; not only are
subsequent exhibitions of them unprofitable to ear and eye, but
elaborate harping upon soon becomes simply troublesome.
For those who are engaged on representing anything either to
eye or ear can have only two objects to aim at,&mdash;pleasure and
profit; and in history, more than in anything else, excessive
prolixity on events of tragic interest fails of both these objects.
For, in the first place, who would wish to emulate extraordinary
catastrophes? And next, no one likes to be continually seeing
and hearing things that are unnatural and beyond the ordinary
conceptions of mankind. We are, indeed, eager to see and
hear such things once and for the first time, because we want
to know that a thing is possible which was supposed to be impossible:
<pb n="171"/>  but when once convinced on that point no one is
pleased at lingering on the Unnatural; but in fact would
rather not come across it at all oftener than need be. In fact,
the dwelling upon misfortunes which exceed the ordinary
limits is more suitable to tragedy than to history. But perhaps we ought to make allowances for men who have studied
neither nature nor universal history. They think, I presume,
that the most important and astonishing events in all history are
those which they happen to have come across themselves or to
have heard from others, and they therefore give their attention
exclusively to those. They accordingly do not perceive that
they are making a mistake in expatiating on events which are
neither novel,&mdash;for they have been narrated by others before,&mdash;
nor capable of giving instruction or pleasure. So much on
this point. . . .</p></div2>

being prevented by the precautions taken by Attalus from
getting booty from the country, he directed his anger against
the seats of the gods and the sacred enclosures; in which, as
it appears to me, he did not wrong Attalus so much as himself.
He threw down the temples and the altars, and even had their
stones broken to pieces that none of the buildings he had
destroyed might be rebuilt. After spoiling the Nicephorium,
cutting down its grove, and demolishing its ring wall, and
levelling with the ground many costly fanes, he first directed
his attack upon Thyatira, and thence marched into the plain
of Thebe, thinking that this district would supply him with the

<head>Great Sea-fight Off Chios Between Philip and the Allied Fleets of Attalus and Rhodes, B. C. <date value="-201">201</date></head>
<p>As the siege was not going on favourably for him, and

the enemy were blockading him with an increasing number of decked vessels, he felt
uncertain and uneasy as to the result. But
as the state of affairs left him no choice, he suddenly put to
sea quite unexpectedly to the enemy; for Attalus expected that
he would persist in pushing on the mines he had commenced.
But Philip was especially keen to make his putting to sea a
surprise, because he thought that he would thus be able to outstrip the enemy, and complete the rest of his passage along
the coast to Samos in security. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Attalus and Theophiliscus follow him.</note> But he was much
disappointed in his calculations; for Attalus and
Theophiliscus (of Rhodes), directly they saw him
putting to sea, lost no time in taking action. And although,
from their previous conviction that Philip meant to stay where
he was, they were not in a position to put to sea quite simultaneously, still by a vigorous use of their oars they managed to
overtake him, and attacked,&mdash;Attalus the enemy's right wing,
which was his leading squadron, and Theophiliscus his left. Thus
intercepted and surrounded, Philip gave the signal to the ships
of his right wing, ordering them to turn their prows towards
the enemy and engage them boldly; while he himself retreated
under cover of the smaller islands, which lay in the way, with
some light galleys, and thence watched the result of the battle.
The whole number of ships engaged were, on Philip's side, fiftythree decked, accompanied by some undecked vessels, and galleys
and beaked ships to the number of one hundred and fifty; for
he had not been able to fit out all his ships in Samos. On
the side of the enemy there were sixty-five decked vessels,
besides those which came from Byzantium, and along with
them nine <foreign lang="la">triemioliae</foreign> (light-decked vessels), and three triremes.</p></div2>

<pb n="174"/>
a prolonged struggle between the combatants on the decks, at
length succeeded in sinking it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Loss of Philip's flagship and admiral.</note>
Philip's tenbanked ship, which, moreover, was the admiral's, was captured by the enemy in an
extraordinary manner. For one of the <foreign lang="la">triemioliae,</foreign> having run
close under her, she struck against her violently amidships, just
beneath the thole of the topmost bank of oars, and got fast
jammed on to her, the steersman being unable to check the way
of his ship. The result was that, by this craft hanging suspended to her, she became unmanageable and unable to turn
one way or another. While in this plight, two quinqueremes
charged her on both sides at once, and destroyed the vessel itself and the fighting men on her deck,
among whom fell Democrates, Philip's admiral. At the same time Dionysodorus and
Deinocrates, who were brothers and joint-admirals of the fleet of
Attalus, charged, the one upon a seven-banked, the other upon an
eight-banked ship of the enemy, and had a most extraordinary
adventure in the battle. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Deinocrates.</note> Deinocrates, in the
first place, came into collision with an eightbanked ship, and had his ship struck above the water-line; for
the enemy's ship had its prow built high; but he struck the

and at first could not get himself clear, though he tried again and again to back water;
and, accordingly, when the Macedonian boarded him and fought
with great gallantry, he was brought into the most imminent
danger. Presently, upon Attalus coming to his aid, and by a
vigorous charge separating the two ships, Deinocrates unexpectedly found himself free, and the enemy's boarders were all
killed after a gallant resistance, while their own vessel being
left without men was captured by Attalus. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dionysodorus.</note> In

lost all the oars on his right side, and had the timbers supporting his towers smashed to pieces,

and great confusion, all the rest of his marines perished along
with the ship, but he himself with two others managed to

<head>The Sea-Battle Undecided</head>
<p>The fight between the rest of the fleet, however, was an
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The skill of the Rhodian sailors.</note>
undecided one; for the superiority in the numbers of Philip's galleys was compensated for by
Attalus's superiority in the number of his decked
ships. Thus on the right wing of Philip's fleet the state of
things was that the ultimate result was doubtful, but that, of
the two, Attalus had the better hope of victory. As for the
Rhodians, they were, at first starting, as I have said, far behind
the enemy, but being much their superiors in speed they managed
to come up with the rear of the Macedonians. At first they
charged the vessels on the stern as they were retiring, and broke
off their oars; but upon Philip's ships swinging round and
beginning to bring help to those in danger, while those of the
Rhodians who had started later than the rest reached the
squadron of Theophiliscus, both parties turned their ships in line
prow to prow and charged gallantly, inciting each other to fresh
exertions by the sound of trumpets and loud cheers. Had
not the Macedonians placed their galleys between the opposing
lines of decked ships, the battle would have been quickly decided; but, as it was, these proved a hindrance to the Rhodians
in various ways. For as soon as the first charge had disturbed
the original order of the ships, they became all mixed up with
each other in complete confusion, which made it difficult to
sail through the enemy's line or to avail themselves of the
points in which they were superior, because the galleys kept
running sometimes against the blades of their oars so as to
hinder the rowing, and sometimes upon their prows, or again
upon their sterns, thus hampering the service of steerers and
rowers alike. In the direct charges, however, the Rhodians
employed a particular man&oelig;uvre. By depressing their bows
they received the blows of the enemy above the water-line,
while by staving in the enemy's ships below the water-line they
rendered the blows fatal. Still it was rarely that they succeeded
in doing this, for, as a rule, they avoided collisions, because the
Macedonians fought gallantly from their decks when they came
to close quarters. Their most frequent man&oelig;uvre was to row
through the Macedonian line, and disable the enemy's ships by
<pb n="176"/>
breaking off their oars, and then, rowing round into position,
again charge the enemy on the stern, or catch them broadside
as they were in the act of turning; and thus they either stove
them in or broke away some necessary part of their rigging.
By this manner of fighting they destroyed a great number of
the enemy's ships.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b16c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Attalus Barely Escapes Capture</head>
<p>But the most brilliant and hazardous exploits were those
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Further incidents in the fight on the left wing. The Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus mortally wounded.</note>
of three quinqueremes: the flagship on which
Theophiliscus sailed, then that commanded by
Philostratus, and lastly the one steered by
Autolycus, and on board of which was Nicostratus. This last charged an enemy's ship,
and left its beak sticking in it. The ship thus
struck sank with all hands; but Autolycus and his comrades,
as the sea poured into his vessel through the prow, was surrounded by the enemy. For a time they defended themselves
gallantly, but at last Autolycus himself was wounded, and fell
overboard in his armour, while the rest of the marines were
killed fighting bravely. While this was going on, Theophiliscus
came to the rescue with three quinqueremes, and though he
could not save the ship, because it was now full of water, he
yet stove in three hostile vessels, and forced their marines
overboard. Being quickly surrounded by a number of galleys
and decked ships, he lost the greater number of his marines
after a gallant struggle on their part; and after receiving three
wounds himself, and performing prodigies of valour, just
managed to get his own ship safely off with the assistance
of Philostratus, who came to his aid and bravely took his share
of the danger. Having thus rejoined his own squadron, he
darted out once more and ran in upon the enemy, utterly
prostrated in body by his wounds, but more dashing and
vehement in spirit than before.</p>
<p>So that there were really two sea-fights going on at a considerable distance from each other. For the right wing of
Philip's fleet, continually making for land in accordance with
his original plan, was not far from the Asiatic coast; while
the left wing, having to veer round to support the ships on
the rear, were engaged with the Rhodians at no great distance
from Chios.

which Philip was moored watching the result

quadriremes. The enemy's ship turning to flight, and making
for the shore, he pursued it somewhat too eagerly in his
ardent desire to effect its capture. Thereupon Philip, observing that Attalus had become detached a considerable distance
from his own fleet, took four quinqueremes and three <foreign lang="la">hemioliae,</foreign>
as well as all the galleys within reach, and darting out got between Attalus and his ships, and forced him in the utmost
terror to run his three ships ashore. After this mishap the

Philip captured his vessels and the royal equipage on board
them. For in this emergency Attalus had employed an artifice. He caused the most splendid articles of the royal
equipage to be spread out on the deck of his ship; the consequence of which was that the first Macedonians who arrived on
the galleys, seeing a quantity of flagons and purple robes and
such like things, abandoned the pursuit, and turned their attention to plundering these. Thus it came about that Attalus
got safe away to Erythrae; while Philip, though he had distinctly got the worst of it in the general engagement, was so
elated at the unexpected reverse which had befallen Attalus,
that he put to sea again and exerted himself strenuously in
collecting his ships and restoring the spirits of his men by
assuring them that they were the victors. For when they
saw Philip put to sea towing off the royal ship, they very
naturally thought that Attalus had perished. But Dionysodorus, conjecturing what had really happened to the king, set
about collecting his own ships by raising a signal; and this
being speedily done, he sailed away unmolested
to their station in Asia. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Victory of the Rhodians.</note> Meanwhile those

<head>Philip Vainly Claims the Victory At Chios</head>
<p>Such was the end of the battle of Chios; in which
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip vainly pretends that he won the battle.</note>
Philip claimed the victory on two pretexts.
First, because he had driven Attalus ashore and
had captured his ship; and secondly, because,
as he had anchored at the promontory of Argennum, he had
the credit of having taken up his anchorage where the wrecks
were floating. He acted in accordance with this assertion
next day by collecting the wrecks, and causing the corpses
which could be recognised to be picked up for burial, all for
the sake of strengthening this pretence. For that he did not
himself believe that he had won was shortly afterwards proved
by the Rhodians and Dionysodorus. For on that very next
day, while he was actually engaged on these operations, after
communication with each other they sailed out to attack him,
but, on nobody putting out to meet them, they returned to
Chios. Philip indeed had never before lost so many men
either by land or sea at one time, and was extremely mortified
at what had happened and had lost much of his spirit for the
enterprise. To the outside world, however, he tried to conceal his real sentiments: though this was forbidden by facts.
<pb n="179"/>
Besides everything else, what happened after the battle impressed all who saw it too strongly. For the slaughter and
destruction was so great that, on the day of battle itself the
whole strait was filled with corpses, blood, arms, and
wrecks; while on the subsequent days the strands might be
seen piled up with all these together in wild confusion.
Hence the extreme consternation of the king could not be
confined to himself, but was shared by all his Macedonians.</p></div2>

<p>Theophiliscus survived for one day; and then having

shown great valour in the engagement, and his far-sighted policy
deserves to be remembered. If it had not been for his boldness in attacking Philip in time, all the allies would have let
the opportunity pass, in terror at Philip's audacity. But by
beginning the war as he did he forced his countrymen to seize
the opportunity, and compelled Attalus not to lose time in
mere preparatory measures for war, but to go to war energetically and grapple with the danger.
The Rhodians, therefore, were quite right to pay him, even after his death, such
honours as were incentives, not only to men living at the time,
but to future generations also, to prompt service in their
country's cause.</p></div2>

The Iassians boast of being originally colonists from Argos,

to their losses in the war with the Carians. The size of the

appears to me that such tales are only fit to amuse children,
when they transgress not only the limits of probability but even
those of possibility. For instance, to say that certain bodies
when placed in full light cast no shadow argues a state of quite
deplorable folly. But Theopompus has done this; for he
says that those who enter the holy precinct of Zeus in Arcadia
cast no shadow, which is on a par with the statements to
which I have just referred. Now, in so far as such tales tend
to preserve the reverence of the vulgar for religion, a certain
allowance may be made for some historians when they record
these miraculous legends. But they must not be allowed to go
too far. Perhaps it is difficult to assign a limit in such a
matter; still it is not impossible. Therefore, in my judgment,
such displays of ignorance and delusion should be pardoned
if they do not go very far, but anything like extravagance in

<head>Digression on the Merits of the Historians Zeno and Antisthenes of Rhodes</head>
<p>As some episodical historians have written on the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The necessity of discussing the histories of Zeno and Antisthenes.</note>
period which embraces the affair at Messene and the sea-fights
already described, it is my intention to discuss them briefly.
I will not however speak of them all, but only those whom I
suppose to be worthy of commemoration and full discussion.
These are the Rhodian writers Zeno and Antisthenes, whom I judge to deserve this distinction,
for more than one reason. They were contemporary with the events, and were engaged in
practical politics; and, lastly, they composed their histories
with no view to gain, but for the sake of fame, and as part of
the business of politicians. Since then they write of the same
events as myself, I cannot omit mentioning them; lest, from
the reputation of their country, and the idea that naval affairs
are peculiarly the province of Rhodians, some students may
prefer their authority to mine where I differ from them.</p>
<p>Now both these writers, to begin with, describe the
battle of<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Their description of the battle of Lade. See <ref target="b16c10" targOrder="U">ch. 10</ref>.</note>
Lade as not less severe than that of Chios, but
more fiercely and daringly contested, both in
detail and as a whole, and finally assert that the
victory was with the Rhodians. For my part I should be
inclined to allow that historians must show some partiality to
their own countries; not however that they should state what
is exactly opposite to the facts regarding them. There are
quite enough mistakes which writers make from ignorance,
and which it is difficult for poor human nature to avoid: but
if we deliberately write what is false for the sake of country,
friends, or favour, how do we differ from those who do the
same to get a living? For as the latter, by measuring everything by the standard of private gain, ruin the credit of their
works, so your politicians often fall into the same discredit by
yielding to the influence of hatred or affection. Therefore
readers ought to be jealously watchful on this head; while
writers ought to be on their guard for their own sakes.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b16c15" type="chapter" n="15">
<head>The Battle of Lade According to Zeno and Antisthenes</head>
<p>The present matter is an example. When coming to details
<pb n="183"/>  of the battle of Lade, these writers confess that in it "two
quinqueremes of Rhodes were captured by the enemy; and that
upon one ship raising its studding-sail to escape from the conflict,
owing to its having being staved in and shipping sea, many of
the vessels near it did the same and made for the open sea; and
that at last the admiral, being left with only a few vessels, was
forced to follow their example. That for the present they were
forced by unfavourable winds to drop anchor on the territory of
Myndus, but next day put to sea and crossed to Cos; while the
enemy, having secured the quinqueremes, landed at Lade and
took up their quarters in the Rhodian camp: that, moreover,
the Milesians, deeply impressed by what had taken place, presented not only Philip, but Heracleides also, with a garland
of victory on his entrance to their territory." And yet, though
they give all these particulars, which all evidently indicate the
losing side, they still declare the Rhodians to have been victorious both in particular combats and in the whole battle; and
that too in spite of the fact that the original despatch from the
admiral concerning the battle, sent to the Senate and Prytanies,
still exists in their Prytaneium, which testifies to the truth, not
of the statements of Antisthenes and Zeno, but of mine.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b16c16" type="chapter" n="16">
<head>Zeno's Account of the Attack on Messene</head>
<p>Next as to their account of the treacherous attempt
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Zeno's account of the attack of Nabis upon Messene. See <ref target="b16c13" targOrder="U">ch. 13</ref>.</note>
upon Messene. Zeno says that "Nabis started
from Sparta, crossed the Eurotas near the tributary called the Hoplites, and advanced along
the narrow road past Poliasium until he arrived
at Sallasia, thence past Pharae to Thalamae, and
so to the river Pamisus." About which I do not know what to
say. It is just as if one were to say that a man started from
Corinth and marched through the Isthmus and arrived at the
Scironean way, and then came straight to the Contoporian road,
and journeyed past Mycenae to Argos. For such a statement
would not be merely slightly wrong but wholly contradictory.
For the Isthmus and the Scironian rocks are east of Corinth,
while the Contoporian road and Mycenae are nearly due
south-west; so that it is completely impossible to go by way
of the former to the latter. The same may be said about
Lacedaemon; for the Eurotas and Sallasia are to the northeast of Sparta, while Thalamae, Pharae, and the Pamisus are
<pb n="184"/>
to the south-west. Therefore it is not possible to go to
Sallasia, nor necessary to cross the Eurotas, if a man means to
go to Messenia by way of Thalamae.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b16c17" type="chapter" n="17">
<head>Some of Zeno's Mistakes Due to Ignorance</head>
<p>Besides these mistakes, he says that Nabis started on
his return from Messenia by the gate on the road to Tegea.
This is another absurdity; for Megalopolis is between Tegea
and Messene, so that it is impossible that a gate at Messene
should be called the "Gate to Tegea." The fact is that there
is a gate there called the "Tegean Gate," by which Nabis
commenced his return; and this led Zeno into the mistake of
supposing that Tegea was near Messene, which is not the
fact: for the Laconian territory, as well as that of Megalopolis,
lies between that of Messene and Tegea. Lastly, he says
that the Alpheus flows underground from its source for a
considerable distance, and comes up near Lycoa, in Arcadia.
The truth is that this river does go down underground not far
from its source, and, after remaining hidden for about ten
stades, comes up again, and then flows through the territory
of Megalopolis, at first with a gentle stream, and then gaining
volume, and watering that whole district in a splendid manner
for two hundred stades, at length reaches Lycoa, swollen by
the tributary stream of the Lusius, and become unfordable
and deep. . . .</p>
<p>However, I think that the points I have mentioned,
though all of them blunders, admit of some palliation and
excuse; for the latter arose from mere ignorance, those connected with the sea-fight from patriotic affection. But is it
not then a fault in Zeno, that he does not bestow as much
pains on investigating the truth and thoroughly mastering his
subject, as upon the ornaments of style; and shows on many
occasions that he particularly plumes himself on this, as many
other famous writers do? To my mind it is quite right to take
great care and pay great attention to the presentation of one's
facts in correct and adequate language, for this contributes in
no small degree to the effectiveness of history; still I do not
think that serious writers should regard it as their primary
and most important object. Far from it. Quite other are the
parts of his history on which a practical politician should
rather pride himself.

<head>Zeno's Account of the Battle of Panium</head>
<p>The best illustration of what I mean will be the

following. This same writer, in his account of the siege of

in Coele-Syria, at Mount Panium,<note anchored="yes">Called Panion or Paneion. See Josephus <cit><bibl n="J. BJ 3.10.7"><title>B. Jud.</title> 3, 10, 7,</bibl>
<quote lang="greek">*iorda/nou ph/gh to\ *pa/neion.</quote></cit> The town near it was called Paneas, and afterwards Paneas
Caesarea, and later still Caesarea Philippi. Scopas, the Aetolian, was now
serving Ptolemy Epiphanes; see <ref target="b13c2" targOrder="U">13, 2</ref>; <ref target="b18c53" targOrder="U">18, 53</ref>.</note> showed such
extreme anxiety about ornaments of style, that
he made it quite impossible even for professional
rhetoricians or mob-orators to outstrip him in
theatrical effect; while he showed such a contempt of facts,
as once more amounted to unsurpassable carelessness and inaccuracy. For, intending to describe the first
position in the field taken up by Scopas, he says that
"the right extremity of his line, together with a few cavalry,
rested on the slope of the mountain; while its left with
all the cavalry belonging to this wing, was in the plains
below. That Antiochus, just before the morning watch,
despatched his elder son Antiochus with a division of his army
to occupy the high ground which commanded the enemy;
and that at daybreak he led the rest of his army across the
river which flowed between the two camps, and drew them up
on the plain: arranging his heavy-armed infantry in one line,
facing the enemy's centre, and his cavalry, some on the right
and the rest on the left wing of the phalanx, among which
were the heavy-armed horsemen, under the sole command of
the younger of the king's sons Antiochus. That in advance
of this line he stationed the elephants at certain intervals, and
the Tarentines<note anchored="yes">See on <ref target="b4c77" targOrder="U">4, 77</ref>; <ref target="b13c1" targOrder="U">13, 1</ref>.</note> commanded by Antipater; while he filled up
the spaces between the elephants with archers and slingers.
And finally, that he took up his own station on the rear of the
elephants with a squadron of household cavalry and bodyguards." After this preliminary description he continues: "The
younger Antiochus"&mdash;whom he had described as being on the
level ground with the heavy-armed cavalry&mdash;"charged down
from the high ground and put to flight and pursued the cavalry
under Ptolemy, son of Aeropus, who was in command of the
Aetolians in the plain on the left wing; but the two lines,
<pb n="186"/>
when they met, maintained a stubborn fight." But he fails to
observe that, as the elephants, cavalry, and light-armed infantry
were in front, the two lines could not possibly meet at all.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b16c19" type="chapter" n="19">
<head>Zeno's Description Implausible</head>
<p>Next he says that "the phalanx, outmatched in
agility and forced backwards by the Aetolians, retired step
by step, while the elephants received the retreating line, and
did great service in charging the enemy." But how the
elephants got on the rear of the phalanx it is not easy to
understand, or how, if they had got there, they could have
done good service. For as soon as the two lines were once
at close quarters, the animals would no longer have been able
to distinguish friend from foe among those that came in their
way. Again, he says that "the Aetolian cavalry were thrown
into a panic during the engagement, because they were unaccustomed to the look of the elephants." But, by his own
account, the cavalry which was originally stationed on the
right wing remained unbroken; while the other division of
the cavalry, that on the right wing, had all fled before the
successful attack of Antiochus. What portion of the cavalry
was it, then, that was on the centre of the phalanx, and was
terrified by the elephants? And where was the king, or what
part did he take in the battle, seeing that he had with him
the very flower of the infantry and cavalry? For not a word
has been told us about these. And where was the elder
of the young Antiochi, who, with a division of the troops, occupied the high ground? For this prince is not represented even
as returning to his quarters after the battle. And very naturally so. For Zeno started by assuming two sons of the king
named Antiochus, whereas there was only one in the army
on that occasion. How comes it, again, that according to
him, Scopas returned first and also last from the field? For
he says: "when he saw the younger Antiochus, after returning from the pursuit, on the rear of his phalanx,
and accordingly gave up all hopes of victory, he retired." But afterwards
he says that "he sustained the most imminent peril when his
phalanx got surrounded by the elephants and cavalry, and
was the last man to retire from the field."</p></div2>

<head>Zeno Acknowledges His Error</head>
<p>These and similar blunders appear to me to reflect
very great discredit upon writers. It is necessary, therefore,
<pb n="187"/>
to endeavour to make one's self master of all departments of
history alike. That is the ideal; but if that is impossible, one
ought at least to be excessively careful on the most essential
and important points in it. I have been induced to say this
because I have observed that in history, as in other arts and
sciences, there is a tendency to neglect the true and essential,
while the ostentatious and the showy secure praise and emulation as something great and admirable. The fact being that
in history, as in other departments of literature, these latter
qualities require less trouble and gain a cheaper reputation.
As to his ignorance of the topography of
Laconia, considering that his error was an important one, I did not hesitate to write to Zeno
personally. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Polybius wrote to Zeno on his geographical mistakes.</note> For I thought it a point of honour
not to look upon the mistakes of others as personal triumphs,
as is the way with some writers; but to do the best I could to
secure correctness, not only of my own historical writings, but
of those of others also, for the benefit of the world at large.
When Zeno received my letter and found that it was impossible
to make the correction, because his history was already published,
he was much vexed, but could do nothing. He, however, put the
most friendly interpretation on my proceeding; and, in regard
to this point, I would beg my own readers, whether of my
own or future generations, if I am ever detected in making a
deliberate misstatement, and disregarding truth in any part of
my history, to criticise me unmercifully; but if I do so from
lack of information, to make allowances: and I ask it for
myself more than others, owing to the size of my history and
the extent of ground covered by its transactions. . . .</p></div2>

Egypt, was a young man, but one who had
spent all his life in the camp, and with reputation. By nature aspiring and ambitious, he had
done much that was glorious in the service of his country,
but much that was evil also. As a general in a campaign, and
as an administrator of military expeditions, he was a man of
<pb n="188"/>
great ability, high natural courage, and extremely well fitted to
deal personally with soldiers. But on the other hand, for the
management of complicated affairs, he was deficient in diligence
and sobriety, and had the least faculty in the world for the
keeping of money or the economical administration of finance.
And it was this that before long not only caused his own fall,
but seriously damaged the kingdom as well. For though he
had complete control of the exchequer, he spent the greater
part of the day in playing ball and in matches in martial
exercises with the young men; and directly he left these
sports he collected drinking parties, and spent the greater part
of his life in these amusements and with these associates.
But that part of his day which he devoted to business, he
employed in distributing, or, I might rather say, in throwing
away the royal treasures among the envoys from Greece
and the Dionysian actors, and, more than all, among
the officers and soldiers of the palace guard. He was utterly
incapable of saying no, and bestowed anything there was at
hand on any one who said anything to please him. The evil
which he himself thus began continually increased. For
every one who had received a favour expressed his gratitude
in extravagant language, both for the sake of what he had got
and of what he hoped to get in the future. And thus being
informed of the universal praise which was bestowed on him,
of the toasts proposed in his honour at banquets, of complimentary inscriptions, and songs sung in his praise by the
public singers all through the town, he became entirely befooled, and grew daily more and more puffed up with conceit,
and more reckless in squandering favours upon foreigners and
soldiers.</p></div2>

<head>Intrigues At Alexandria</head>
<p>These proceedings were very offensive to the other

members of the court; and, therefore, they
watched everything he did with a jealous eye,
and conceived a detestation for his insolence,
which they began to compare unfavourably with
the character of Sosibius. For the latter was considered to
show more wisdom in his guardianship of the king than his age
gave reason to expect; and, in his dealings with other persons,
to maintain the dignity proper to his high trust, which was the
<pb n="189"/>
royal seal and person. Just at this time, Ptolemy, the son of
Sosibius, returned from his mission to Philip. Before he left
Alexandria on his voyage, he had been full of foolish pride,
partly from his own natural disposition and partly from his
father's success. But upon landing in Macedonia, and mixing with the young men at court, he conceived the notion
that the virtue of the Macedonians consisted in the better
fashion of their boots and clothes; he therefore came home
got up in imitation of all these peculiarities, and fully persuaded that his foreign tour and association with Macedonians
had made a man of him. He therefore immediately began
showing jealousy of Tlepolemus, and inveighing against him;
and as all the courtiers joined him, on the ground that
Tlepolemus was treating the business and revenue of the
state as though he were its heir and not its guardian, the
quarrel quickly grew. Meanwhile Tlepolemus, being informed of certain unfriendly speeches, originating in the
jealous observation and malignity of the courtiers, at first
turned a deaf ear to them and affected to despise them; but
when at length they ventured to hold a meeting and openly
express their disapproval of him in his absence, on the ground
of his maladministration of the government of the kingdom,
he grew angry; and, summoning the council, came forward
and said that "they brought their accusations against him
secretly and in private, but he judged it right to accuse them
in public and face to face." . . .</p>

observed that the Rhodians and Attalus, far

cause, indeed, for uneasiness: he was afraid of
sailing from Bargylia, and foresaw that he would
have to encounter danger at sea; and at the same time he

therefore was unwilling on any consideration to spend the

overwhelming perplexity; but he was compelled for the

use the common expression: for he robbed and stole from
some, and used force to others, while he did
violence to his nature by fawning on others, because his army was suffering from famine; and
by these means managed sometimes to get meat to eat, sometimes figs, and sometimes nothing but a very short allowance
of corn. Some of these provisions were supplied to him by
<pb n="192"/>
Zeuxis, and some by the people of Mylae, Alabanda, and
Magnesia, whom he flattered whenever they gave him anything, and barked at and plotted against when they did not.
Finally, he made a plot to seize Mylae by the agency of
Philocles, but failed from the clumsiness with which the
scheme was contrived. The territory of Alabanda he harried

The Athenian people, being informed of his coming, passed very
liberal votes as to the reception and general entertainment of the
king. Arrived at the Peiraeus, Attalus spent the first day in
transacting business with the Roman ambassadors, and was extremely delighted to find that they were fully mindful of their
ancient alliance with him, and quite prepared for the war with
Philip. Next morning, in company with the Romans and the
Athenian magistrates, he began his progress to the city in
great state. For he was met, not only by all the magistrates
and the knights, but by all the citizens with their children and
wives. And when the two processions met, the warmth of the
welcome given by the populace to the Romans, and still more
to Attalus, could not have been exceeded. At his entrance
into the city by the gate Dipylum the priests and priestesses
lined the street on both sides: all the temples were then
thrown open; victims were placed ready at all the altars; and
the king was requested to offer sacrifice. Finally they voted
<pb n="193"/>
him such high honours as they had never without great hesitation voted to any of their former benefactors: for, in addition

<head>Athens Votes for War Against Philip</head>
<p>They next summoned an ecclesia and invited the king

to address them. But upon his excusing himself, on the plea that it would be ill-bred for him
to appear before the people and recount his
own good services in the presence of those on whom they had
been bestowed, they gave up asking for his personal appearance; but begged him to give them a written statement as to
what he thought was the best thing to do in view of the existing circumstances. On his consenting to do this, and writing
the document, the magistrates produced the despatch to the
ecclesia. The contents of this written communication were
briefly these: he recalled the good services he had done the
people in the past; enumerated the things he had accomplished in the existing war against Philip; and lastly exhorted
them to activity in this war, and protested that, if they did not
determine resolutely to adopt this policy of hostility to Philip
in common with the Rhodians, Romans, and himself, and yet
afterwards wished to share in the benefits which had been
secured by others, they would miss securing the true interests
of their country. As soon as this despatch had been read, the
people, influenced both by its contents and by their warm
feeling towards Attalus, were prepared to vote the war: and
when the Rhodians also entered and argued at great length
to the same effect, the Athenians at once decreed the
war against Philip. They gave the Rhodians also a magnificent reception, honoured their state with a crown of
valour, and voted all Rhodians equal rights of citizenship at
Athens, on the ground of their having, besides other things,
restored the Athenian ships which had been captured with
the men on board them. After concluding this arrangement,
the Rhodian ambassadors sailed to Ceos with their fleet to
visit the islands. . . .</p></div2>

submit to an arbitration before a fair tribunal as to the injuries
he had inflicted upon Attalus: that, if he did this, he might
have peace with Rome, but, if he refused to obey, the opposite

Nicanor retired. Then the Romans sailed along the coast of
Epirus and delivered a similar announcement in regard to
Philip in the town of Phoenice; also to Amynandrus in the
district of Athamania; also to the Aetolians in Naupactus, and
the Achaeans in Aegium. And having thus by the mouth of

themselves sailed away to visit Antiochus and Ptolemy with a

<div2 id="b16c28" type="chapter" n="28">
<head>Activity and Energy of Philip</head>
<p>It appears to me that to make a good beginning, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The firmness and vigour of Philip in meeting the danger.</note>
even to maintain enthusiasm long enough to
secure a considerable measure of success, is an
achievement of which many have been found
capable; but to carry a purpose through to its
end, and, even though fortune be adverse, to make up by cool
reason for the deficiency of enthusiasm is within the power of
few. From this point of view one cannot but disparage the
inactivity of Attalus and the Rhodians, while regarding with
admiration the royal and lofty spirit displayed by Philip, and
his constancy to his purpose,&mdash;not meaning to speak in praise
of his character as a whole, but simply commending the
vigour with which he acted on this occasion. I make this
distinction to prevent any one supposing that I contradict
myself, because I recently praised Attalus and the Rhodians
and found fault with Philip, whereas I am now doing
the reverse. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">1, 14.</note> This is just such a case as I
referred to at the beginning of my history, when
I said that it was necessary sometimes to praise, and sometimes to blame the same persons, since it frequently happens
that changes of circumstances for the worse and calamities alter
men's original dispositions, and frequently also changes for the
better; and sometimes too it is the case that from natural
<pb n="195"/>
temperament men are at one time inclined to what is right, at
another to the reverse. And it is a variation of this sort that
I think occurred to Philip in this instance. For, irritated by
his defeats, and influenced in a great degree by anger and
passion, he addressed himself with a kind of insane or inspired
eagerness to meet the dangers of the hour; and it was in this
spirit that he rose to the attack upon the Rhodians and king
Attalus, and gained the successes which followed. I was induced
to make these remarks, because I observe that some men, like
bad runners in the stadium, abandon their purposes when close
to the goal; while it is at that particular point, more than at any
other, that others secure the victory over their rivals. . . .</p></div2>

the situation of those towns it would, I think,
be waste of time for me to state in great detail,
because the singularity of those sites has made
them familiar to all persons of intelligence. Still
I imagine that it will not be otherwise than useful to remind
my readers briefly of the facts, by way of attracting their attention. A man would best realise the advantages of these cities,
not by regarding their sites by themselves, but by comparing
and contrasting them with those about to be mentioned. For
just as it is impossible to sail from the Ocean,&mdash;or as some
call it the Atlantic,&mdash;into our sea, except by passing between
the Pillars of Heracles, so is it impossible to sail from our sea
into the Propontis and the Pontus except through the channel
separating Sestos and Abydos. But as though Fortune had
designed these two straits to counterbalance each other, the
passage between the Pillars of Heracles is many times as broad
as that of the Hellespont,&mdash;the former being sixty, the latter two
stades; the reason being, as far as one may conjecture, the
great superiority in size of the external Ocean to our sea: while
the channel at Abydos is more convenient than that at the
Pillars of Heracles. For the former being lined on both sides
<pb n="196"/>
by human habitations is of the nature of a gate admitting
mutual intercourse, sometimes being bridged over by those
who determine to cross on foot, and at all times admitting a
passage by sea. But the channel at the Pillars of Heracles is
seldom used, and by very few persons, owing to the lack of
intercourse between the tribes inhabiting those remote parts of
Libya and Europe, and owing to the scantiness of our knowledge of the external Ocean. The city of Abydos itself is
enclosed on both sides by two European promontories, and
possesses a harbour capable of sheltering ships anchoring in it
from every wind; while there is no possibility of anchoring at
any point near the city outside the harbour mouth, owing to the
rapidity and violence of the current setting through the strait.</p></div2>

<head>The Siege of Abydos</head>
<p>Having then invested Abydos partly by a palisade and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Siege of Abydos.</note>
partly by an earthwork, Philip began blockading
it by land and sea together. This siege was not
at all remarkable for the extent of the machinery employed,
or the ingenuity displayed in those works on which besiegers
and besieged are wont to exhaust all their invention and skill
against each other; but still it deserves, if any ever did, to be
remembered and recorded for the noble spirit and extraordinary
gallantry exhibited by the besieged. At first, feeling full
confidence in themselves, the inhabitants of Abydos maintained
a courageous resistance to the attempts of Philip; struck and
dislodged some of his engines, which he brought against their
walls by sea, with stones from their catapults, and destroyed
others by fire, and with such fierceness, that the enemy were
barely able to drag their ships out of danger. Against the
siege operations on land, too, up to a certain point they offered
an undaunted resistance, not at all despairing of ultimately
overpowering the enemy. But when their outer wall was
undermined and fell, and when moreover the Macedonians by
means of these same mines were approaching the inner wall,
which had been erected by the besieged to cover the breach:
then at length they send Iphiades and Pantacnotus as ambassadors, with an offer to Philip that he should take over the
city, on condition of letting the soldiers from Rhodes and
Attalus depart under a truce; and of permitting all free persons
to depart as they could, and wherever each might choose, with
<pb n="197"/>
the clothes that each was wearing. But on Philip bidding
them "surrender at discretion or fight like men," the ambassadors returned to the town.</p></div2>

<p>On being informed of the message the people of Abydos

utter despair deliberated upon their position.
They thereupon resolved, first to liberate the
slaves, that they might secure their sincere interest and
loyalty; next, to collect all the women into the temple
of Artemis, and the children with their nurses into the
gymnasium; and finally to bring together their silver and
gold into the market-place, as well as collect their clothes
which were of any value into the quadrireme of the
Rhodians and the trireme of the Cyzicenes. Having formed
these resolutions and acted on the decree with unanimity, they
again assembled in public meeting, and elected fifty of the
older and most trusted men, who at the same time were possessed of sufficient bodily vigour to enable them to carry out
what had been determined upon; and these they bound on
oath in the presence of the whole of the citizens, that "whenever they saw the inner wall being captured by the enemy, they
would kill the children and women, and would burn the abovementioned ships, and, in accordance with the curses that had
been invoked, would throw the silver and gold into the sea."
After this they brought the priests forward, and all the citizens
swore that they would conquer the enemy or die fighting for
their country. To crown all, they slew victims and compelled
the priests and priestesses to dictate the words of this imprecation over the burnt offerings. Having bound themselves
by this solemn agreement, they left off attempting to countermine the enemy, and resolved that, directly the interior wall fell,
they would fight to the last in the breach with the enemy's
storming party and there die.</p></div2>

the mere prospect of an Aetolian invasion, adopted a like
resolution; the details of which I have already narrated. But
the Abydenians, at a time when they were closely invested and
in all but complete despair of being saved, elected by a
unanimous resolution to meet their fate along with their children and wives, rather than to live any longer with the knowledge
that their children and wives would fall into the power of the
enemy. Therefore one might justly complain of Fortune for
having, in the former cases, given victory and safety to those
who despaired of them, while she adopted the opposite decision
in regard to the Abydenians. For the men were killed, and the
city was taken, but the children with their mothers fell into
the hands of the enemy.</p></div2>

<p>As soon as the interior wall had fallen, the men,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">How the city was surrendered and the women and children saved after all.</note>
according to their oaths, sprang upon the ruins
and fought the enemy with such desperate
courage, that Philip, though he had kept sending
the Macedonians to the front in relays till
nightfall, at last abandoned the contest in despair of accomplishing the capture at all. For not only did
the Abydenian forlorn hope take their stand upon the dead
bodies of the fallen enemies, and maintain the battle with
fury; nor was it only that they fought gallantly with mere
swords and spears; but when any of these weapons had been
rendered useless, or had been knocked out of their hands, they
grappled with the Macedonians, and either hurled them to the
ground arms and all, or broke their sarissae, and stabbing their
faces and exposed parts of their bodies with the broken ends,
threw them into a complete panic. But the fight being interrupted by nightfall, most of the citizens having now fallen in
the breach, and the rest being utterly exhausted by fatigue and
wounds, Glaucides and Theognetus collected a few of the
older men together, and, instigated by hopes of personal safety,
lowered the special eminence and unique glory which their
fellow-citizens had acquired. For they resolved to save the
<pb n="199"/>
children and women alive, and at daybreak to send the priests

and surrender the city to him.</p></div2>

<head>The Abydenians Carry Out Their Resolution</head>
<p>While this was going on, king Attalus, having heard
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A Roman envoy arrives to warn Philip to desist.</note>
that Abydos was being besieged, sailed through
the Aegean to Tenedos; and similarly the
youngest of the Roman ambassadors, Marcus
Aemilius, arrived on board ship at Abydos itself. For
the Roman ambassadors, having learnt at Rhodes the fact
of the siege of Abydos, and wishing in accordance with their
commission to deliver their message to Philip personally, put
off their purpose of visiting the two kings, and despatched
this man to him. Having found the king outside Abydos, he
explained to him that "The Senate had resolved to order him
not to wage war with any Greek state; nor to interfere in the
dominions of Ptolemy; and to submit the injuries inflicted on
Attalus and the Rhodians to arbitration; and that if he did
so he might have peace, but if he refused to obey he would
promptly have war with Rome." Upon Philip endeavouring
to show that the Rhodians had been the first to lay hands on
him, Marcus interrupted him by saying: "But what about the
Athenians? And what about the Cianians? And what
about the Abydenians at this moment? Did any one of them
also lay hands on you first?" The king, at a loss for a reply,
said: "I pardon the offensive haughtiness of your manners for
three reasons: first, because you are a young man and inexperienced in affairs; secondly, because you are the handsomest
man of your time" (this was true); "and thirdly, because you
are a Roman. But for my part, my first demand to the
Romans is that they should not break their treaties or go to
war with me; but if they do, I shall defend myself as
courageously as I can, appealing to the gods to defend my
cause." With these words they separated. On becoming
master of Abydos, Philip found all the property
of the citizens collected by themselves ready to
his hand. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The voluntary death of the Abydenians.</note>But when he saw the numbers and

announcing, that "he gave three days' grace to those who
wished to hang or stab themselves." The Abydenians, already
bent on executing their original decree, and looking upon
themselves as traitors to those who had fought and died for
their country, could not endure remaining alive on any terms;
and, accordingly, with the exception of those who had previously
been put in chains or some similar restraint, they all without

them, and sent them to the most distant cities,
so dividing them that each city that was
farthest on a particular road should get, not
only the one addressed to itself, but those also of the other
cities on the same road. The contents of these first despatches
addressed to the chief magistrate were as follows: "As soon
as ye receive this despatch, forthwith cause all the men of

days, to assemble immediately in the market-place. And as
soon as they are thus collected, march them out and lead them
to the next city. As soon as ye have arrived there, deliver the

contained exactly the same words as the former, except of
course that the name of the next town was changed to which
<pb n="201"/>
they were to march. By this arrangement being repeated
right along the road, in the first place no one knew for what
purpose or undertaking the expedition was directed; and in
the next place, every one was absolutely ignorant where he was
going, beyond the name of the next town, but all marched
forward in a state of complete mystification, taking on the successive contingents as they went. But as of course the most
remote towns were not equally distant from Tegea, the letters
were not delivered to them all at the same time, but to each
in proportion to its distance. By which arrangement, without

might pass the night near Sellasia and at daybreak begin a raid
on Laconia. They had orders that, in case the mercenaries of
Nabis left their quarters and attacked them, they were to retire
on Scotita, and in other respects follow the directions of
Didascalondas of Crete; for Philopoemen had given his confidence to this officer,
and full directions as to the whole expedition. These men therefore set out in good spirits to the
task assigned to them. Philopoemen himself having issued
orders to the Achaeans to sup early, led out his army from
Tegea, and after a rapid night's march halted it about the time
of the morning watch in the neighbourhood of Scotita, which
is between Tegea and Lacedaemon. When day broke the
mercenaries in Pellene, being informed by their scouts of the
raid which the enemy were making, started at once to the
rescue, as was their custom, and bore down upon them; and
when the Achaeans, in accordance with their instructions, retired, they followed, harassing them with bold and daring
assaults. But as soon as they came to the place where
Philopoemen lay in ambush, the Achaeans sprang up and cut

five galleys and one beaked war-ship (pristis),
on the latter of which he himself was sailing.
There met him the Macedonian secretaries
Apollodorus and Demosthenes, Brachylles from
Boeotia, and the Achaean Cycliadas, who had
been driven from the Peloponnese for the
reasons I have already described. With Flamininus came king Amynandras, and Dionysodorus,
legate of king Attalus.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cycliadas expelled for favouring Philip.
See <bibl n="Liv. 32.19">Livy, 32, 19</bibl>.</note> The commissioners from cities and nations were
Aristaenus and Xenophon from the Achaeans; Acesimbrotus
the navarch from the Rhodians; Phaeneas their Strategus
from the Aetolians, and several others of their statesmen with
him. Approaching the sea near Nicaea, Flamininus and those
with him took their stand upon the very edge of the beach,
while Philip, bringing his ship close to shore, remained afloat.
Upon Flamininus bidding him disembark, he stood up on
board and refused to leave his ship. Flamininus again asked
him what he feared, he said that he feared no one but the
gods, but he distrusted most of those who were there, especially
the Aetolians. Upon the Roman expressing his surprise, and
remarking that the danger was the same to all and the risk
common, Philip retorted that "He was mistaken in saying that:
<pb n="204"/>
for that, if anything happened to Phaeneas, there were many
who would act as Strategi for the Aetolians; but if Philip were
to perish at the present juncture, there was no one to be king of
the Macedonians." Though all thought this an unconciliatory
way of opening the discussion, Flamininus nevertheless bade
him speak on the matters he had come to consider. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman demand.</note> Philip
however said that "The word was not with himself but with
Flamininus; and therefore begged that he would
state clearly what he was to do in order to have
peace." The Roman consul replied that" What
he had to say was simple and obvious: it was to bid him
evacuate Greece entirely; restore the prisoners and deserters
in his hands to their several states; hand over to the Romans
those parts of Illyricum of which he had become possessed since
the peace of Epirus; and, similarly, to restore to
Ptolemy all the cities which he had taken from
him since the death of Ptolemy Philopator. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Peace of Epirus, B.C. <date value="-205">205</date>. See <foreign lang="la">supra</foreign> <ref target="b11c5" targOrder="U">11, 5-7</ref>.</note></p></div2>

<p>Having said this Flamininus refrained from any further
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Demands of Attalus,</note>
speech of his own; but turning to the others he bade them deliver
what they had been severally charged to say by those who sent
them. And first Dionysodorus, the envoy of
Attalus, took up the discourse by declaring that
"Philip ought to restore the king's ships which
had been captured in the battle at Chios and their crews with
them; and to restore also the temple of Aphrodite to its
original state, as well as the Nicephorium, both of which he had
destroyed." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">of the Rhodians,</note> He was followed by the Rhodian
navarch Acesimbrotus, who demanded "That
Philip should evacuate Peraea, which he had taken from them;
withdraw his garrisons from Iasus, Bargylia, and Euromus;
restore the Perinthians to their political union with Byzantium;
and evacuate Sestos, Abydos, and all commercial ports and
harbours in Asia." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">of the Achaeans.</note> Following the Rhodians the
Achaeans demanded "The restoration of Corinth
and Argos uninjuired." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">and of the Aetolians.</note> Then came the Aetolians, who first demanded, like the Romans, that "Philip should
entirely evacuate Greece; and, secondly, that
he should restore to them uninjured all cities

<div2 id="b18c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Speech of Alexander Isius</head>
<p>When Phaeneas the Aetolian strategus had delivered this
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Alexander Isius.</note>
demand, a man called Alexander Isius, who
had the reputation of being an able politician
and good speaker, said that "Philip was neither
sincere at the present moment in proposing terms, nor bold in
his manner of making war, when he had to do that. In conferences and colloquies he was always setting ambushes and
lying in wait, and using all the practices of war, but in actual
war itself took up a position at once unjust and ignoble: for
he avoided meeting his enemies face to face, and, as he fled
before them, employed himself in burning and plundering the
cities; and by this policy, though himself beaten, he spoilt the
value of the victor's reward. Yet former kings of Macedonia
had not adopted this plan, but one exactly the reverse: for
they were continually fighting with each other in the open
field, but rarely destroyed and ruined cities. This was shown
clearly by Alexander's war in Asia against king Darius;
and again in the contentions between his successors, when
they combined to fight Antigonus for the possession of Asia.
So too had the successors of these kings followed the same policy
down to the time of Pyrrhus: they had been prompt to war
against each other in the open field, and to do everything they
could to conquer each other in arms, but had spared the cities,
that they might rule them if they conquered, and be honoured
by their subjects. But that a man should abandon war, and
yet destroy that for which the war was undertaken, seemed an
act of madness, and madness of a very violent sort. And this
was just what Philip was doing at that moment; for he had
destroyed more cities in Thessaly, on his rapid march from the
pass of Epirus, though he was a friend and ally of that country,
than any one who had ever been at war with the Thessalians."</p>
<p>After a good deal more to the same effect he ended by
asking Philip, "On what grounds he was holding the town of
Lysimacheia with a garrison, having expelled the strategus sent
by the Aetolian league, of which it was a member? Also
on what grounds he had enslaved the Ciani who were also in
alliance with the Aetolians? Lastly, on what plea he was in
actual occupation of Echinus, Phthiotid Thebes, Pharsalus,
and Larisa?"
<pb n="206"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Philip's Response</head>
<p>When Alexander had concluded his speech, Philip came
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The rejoinder of Philip.</note>
somewhat nearer to the shore than he was
before, and, rising on board his ship, said that
"Alexander had composed and delivered a
speech in the true Aetolian and theatrical style. For every one
knew quite well that nobody willingly destroys his own allies,
but that, at times of special danger, military commanders are
compelled to do many things contrary to their natural feelings."
While the king was still speaking, Phaeneas, who was very
short-sighted, interrupted him by saying, "You are trifling with
us; you must either fight and conquer, or obey the commands
of the stronger." Philip, in spite of the unfortunate position of
his affairs, could not refrain from his habitual humour:
turning towards Phaeneas he said, "Even a blind man could
see that." Such a knack had he of cutting repartee. Then he
turned to Alexander again and said, "You ask me, Alexander,
why I took possession of Lysimacheia. I reply, in order that it
might not by your neglect be devastated by Thracians, as it has
now actually been; because I was compelled by this war to remove my soldiers, who indeed were no hostile garrison, as you
say, but were there for its protection. As for the Ciani, I did
not go to war with them, but only assisted Prusias to take them
who was at war with them. And of this you yourselves were the
cause. For though I sent envoy after envoy to you desiring
that you would repeal the law which allows you the privilege of
taking 'spoil from spoil,' you replied that rather than abolish
this law you would remove Aetolia from Aetolia."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Philip Retorts On His Accusers</head>
<p>When Flamininus expressed some wonder at what he
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip explains the peculiar law of the Aetolians.</note>
meant by this, the king tried to explain it to him
by saying that "The Aetolian custom was this.
They not only plundered those with whom
they were at war, and harried their country; but, if certain
other nations were at war with each other, even though both
were friends and allies of the Aetolians, none the less the
Aetolians might, without a formal decree of the people, take
part with both combatants and plunder the territory of both.
The result was that in the eyes of the Aetolians there were no
defined limits of friendship or enmity, but they were ready to
be the enemies and assailers of all who had a dispute on anything.
<pb n="207"/>  "How then," he added, "have they any right to blame
me if, while on terms of friendship with the Aetolians, I did
anything against the Ciani in support of my own allies? But
the most outrageous part of their conduct is that they try to
rival Rome, and bid me entirely evacuate Greece! The
demand in itself is sufficiently haughty and dictatorial: still, in
the mouths of Romans, it is tolerable, but in that of Aetolians
quite intolerable. What is this Greece, pray, from which ye
bid me depart? How do you define it? Why, most of the
Aetolians themselves are not Greeks; for neither the Agrai,
nor the Apodoti, nor the Amphilochi are counted as Greek.
Do you then give up those tribes to me?"</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Philip's Answer to the Rhodians and Attalus</head>
<p>Upon Flamininus laughing at these words, Philip proceeded: "Well, enough said to the Aetolians!
But to the Rhodians and Attalus I have to say
that, in the eyes of a fair judge, it would be held
more just that they should restore to me the ships captured,
than I to them. For I did not begin the attack upon Attalus
and the Rhodians, but they upon me, as everybody acknowledges. However, at your instance, Titus, I restore Peraea to
the Rhodians, and to Attalus his ships and as many of the
men as are still alive. As for the destruction of the Nicephorium and the grove of Aphrodite, I am not able to do
anything else towards their restoration, but I will send plants
and gardeners to attend to the place and the growth of the
trees that have been cut down." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">and the Achaeans,</note> Flamininus once more
laughing at the king's sarcastic tone, Philip
turned to the Achaeans, and first went through
the list of benefactions received by them from Antigonus and
himself; then quoted the extraordinary honours Antigonus and
he had received from them; and concluded by reading their
decree for abandoning him and joining Rome. Taking this for
his text, he expatiated at great length on the fickleness and ingratitude of the Achaeans. Still he said he would restore Argos
to them, and as to Corinth would consult with Flamininus.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>A Retort of Flamininus</head>
<p>Having thus concluded his conversation with the other
envoys, he asked Flamininus, observing that
the discussion was really confined to himself
and the Romans, "Whether he considered that
<pb n="208"/>
he was bound to evacuate only those places in Greece which
he had himself acquired, or those also which he had inherited
from his ancestors?" On Flamininus making no answer,
Aristaenus for the Achaeans, and Phaeneas for the Aetolians,
were on the point of replying. But as the day was closing in,
time prevented them from doing so; and Philip demanded
that they should all hand into him a written statement of the
terms on which peace was to be granted: for being there
alone he had no one with whom to consult; and therefore
wished to turn their demands over in his own mind. Now
Flamininus was much amused at Philip's sarcastic banter; but
not wishing the others to think so, he retaliated on him by a
sarcasm also, saying: "Of course you are alone, Philip: for
you have killed all the friends likely to give you the best
advice! "The king smiled sardonically, but said nothing.
And for the present, all having handed in the written statements of their demands as aforesaid, the conference broke up,
after appointing to meet again next day at Nicaea. But next
morning, though Flamininus came to the appointed place and
found the others there, Philip did not arrive.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>The Dispute Referred To the Senate</head>
<p>When the day, however, had nearly come to an end,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Second day's conference, Philip comes late.</note>
and Titus and the others had almost given him
up, Philip appeared accompanied as before,
and excused himself by saying that he had
spent the whole day in perplexity and doubt, caused by the
severity of the demands made upon him. But every one else
thought that he had acted thus from a wish to prevent, by the
lateness of the hour, the delivery of invectives by the Achaeans
and Aetolians: for he saw, as he was going away on the previous
evening, that both were ready to attack him and state grievances.
Therefore, as soon as he approached the meeting this time,
he demanded that "The Roman Consul should discuss the
matter with him in private; that they might not have a mere
war of words on both sides, but that a definite settlement
should be come to on the points in dispute." On his several
times repeating this request and pressing it strongly, Flamininus asked those present what he ought to do. On their
bidding him meet the king and hear what he had to say, he
took with him Appius Claudius, at that time a military Tribune,
<pb n="209"/>
and telling the others to retire a short way from the sea and
remain there, he himself bade Philip disembark. Accordingly
the king, attended by Apollodorus and Demosthenes, left his
ship, and, joining Flamininus, conversed with him for a considerable time. What was said by the one and the other on
that occasion it is not easy to state. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip's final offers.</note> However,
when Philip and he had parted, Flamininus,
in explaining the king's views to the others,
said that he consented to restore Pharsalus and Larisa to the
Aetolians, but not Thebes: and that to the Rhodians he
surrendered Peraea, but not Iasus and Bargylia: to the
Achaeans he gave up Corinth and Argos: to the Romans he
promised that he would surrender Illyricum and all prisoners:
and to Attalus the ships, and as many of the men captured in
the sea-fights as survived.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c9" type="chapter" n="9">
<head>They Agree to Send Envoys to the Roman Senate</head>
<p>All present expressed their dissatisfaction at these terms,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dissatisfaction of the Congress.</note>
and alleged that it was necessary before all that
he should perform the general injunction, that,
namely, of evacuating all Greece: otherwise
these particular concessions were vain and useless. Observing
that there was an animated discussion going on among them,
and fearing at the same time that they would indulge in
accusations against himself, Philip requested Flamininus to
adjourn the conference till next day, as the evening was
closing in; and promised that he would then either persuade
them to accept his terms or submit to theirs. Flamininus
consenting, they separated, after appointing to meet next day
on the beach near Thronium.</p>
<p>Next day all came to the appointed place in good time.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Third day's conference. A reference to the Senate agreed on.</note>
Philip in a short speech called on all, and
especially on Flamininus, "Not to break off the
negotiation for peace now that by far the
greater number were inclined to come to some
arrangement; but, if possible, to come to an understanding by
themselves on the points in dispute; or, if that could not be,
to send envoys to the Senate, and either convince it as to this
controversy, or submit to whatever it enjoined."</p>
<p>On this proposition of the king, all the others declared that
they preferred war to such a demand. But the Roman Consul
<pb n="210"/>
said that "He was quite aware that it was improbable that
Philip would submit to any of their demands, yet, as it did
not in the least stand in the way of such action as they
chose to take to grant the favour demanded by the king, he
would concede it. For not one of the proposals actually made at
present could be confirmed without the authority of the Senate;
and besides the season now coming on was a favourable one
for ascertaining its opinion; for, even as things were, the
armies could do nothing owing to the winter: it was therefore
against no one's interests, but, on the contrary, very convenient
for them all, to devote this time to a reference to the Senate
on the present state of affairs."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c10" type="chapter" n="10">
<head>Pleadings Before the Senate</head>
<p>Seeing that Flamininus was not averse to referring the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The embassies to Rome.</note>
matter to the Senate, all the others presently
consented, and voted to allow Philip to send
envoys to Rome, and that they too should
severally send envoys of their own to plead their cause before
the Senate, and state their grievances against Philip.</p>
<p>The business of the conference having thus been concluded
in accordance with his views and the opinions he had originally expressed, Flamininus at once set about carefully securing
his own position, and preventing Philip from taking any
undue advantage. For though he granted him three months'
suspension of hostilities, he stipulated that he should complete
his embassy to Rome within that time, and insisted on his
immediately removing his garrisons from Phocis and Locris.
He was also very careful to insist on behalf of the Roman
allies, that no act of hostility should be committed against
them during this period by the Macedonians. Having made
these terms in writing with Philip, he immediately took the
necessary steps himself to carry out his own policy. First, he
sent Amynandrus to Rome at once, knowing that he was a
man of pliable character, and would be easily persuaded by
his own friends in the city to take any course they might
propose; and at the same time would carry with him a certain
prestige, and rouse men's curiosity and interest by his title of
royalty. Next to him he sent as personal envoys his wife's
nephew Quintus Fabius, Quintus Fulvius, and Appius Claudius
Nero. From the Aetolians went Alexander Isius, Damocritus
<pb n="211"/>
of Calydon, Dicaearchus of Trichonium, Polemarchus of
Arsinoe, Lamius of Ambracia, Nicomachus of Acarnania,&mdash;
one of those who had fled from Thurium and settled in
Ambracia,&mdash;and Theodotus of Pherae, an exile from Thessaly
who settled in Stratus: from the Achaeans Xenophon of
Aegium: from King Attalus only Alexander: and from the
Athenian people Cephisodorus and his colleagues.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>The Greeks Ask for Help Against Philip</head>
<p>Now these envoys arrived in Rome before the Senate

had settled the provinces of the Consuls appointed for this year, and whether it would be
necessary to send both to Gaul, or one of them
against Philip. But the friends of Flamininus having assured themselves that both Consuls would remain in Italy
owing to the threat of an attack from the Celts, all the
ambassadors appeared and bluntly stated their grievances
against Philip. The bulk of their accusations was to the
same effect as what they had before stated to the king himself;
but they also endeavoured carefully to instil this idea in the
minds of the Senators, "That so long as Chalcis, Corinth, and
Demetrias were subject to Macedonia, it was impossible for the
Greeks to think of liberty; for Philip himself had spoken the
exact truth when he called these places the 'fetters of Greece.'
For neither could the Peloponnese breathe while a royal garrison was stationed in Cornith, nor the Locrians, Boeotians,
and Phocians feel any confidence while Philip was in occupation of Chalcis and the rest of Euboea; nor indeed could the
Thessalians or Magnesians raise a spark of liberty<note anchored="yes">The reading <foreign lang="greek">e)nau/sasqai,</foreign> which I attempt to represent, is doubtful.
Schweig. suggests <foreign lang="greek">e)ggeu/sasqai</foreign> "to taste."</note> while
Philip and the Macedonians held Demetrias. That, therefore,
Philip's offer to evacuate the other places was a mere pretence
in order to escape the immediate danger; and that on the
very first day he chose he would with ease reduce the Greeks
again under his power, if he were in possession of these places."
They accordingly urged the Senate "either to force Philip to
evacuate the cities they had named, or to stand by the policy
they had begun, and vigorously prosecute the war against
him. For in truth the most difficult part of the war was
already accomplished, the Macedonians having already been
<pb n="212"/>
twice defeated, and most of their resources on land already
expended."</p>
<p>They concluded by beseeching the Senate "not to beguile
the Greeks of their hopes of liberty, nor deprive themselves
of the most glorious renown." Such, or nearly so, were the
arguments advanced by the Greek envoys. Philip's envoys
were prepared to make a long speech in reply: but they were
stopped at the threshold. For being asked whether they were
prepared to evacuate Chalcis, Corinth, and Demetrias, they
declared that they had not any instructions as to those towns.
They were accordingly rebuked by the Senate and obliged to
discontinue their speech.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Greece Assigned to Flamininus</head>

to both the consuls as their province, and
ordered that the war against Philip should go
on, assigning to Titus Flamininus the entire
control of Greek affairs. These decrees
having been quickly made known in Greece, Flamininus
found everything settled to his mind, partly no doubt by the
assistance of chance, but for the most part by his own foresight in the management of the whole business. For he
was exceedingly acute, if ever Roman was. The skill and
good sense with which he conducted public business and
private negotiations could not be surpassed, and yet he was
quite a young man, not yet more than thirty, and the first
Roman who had crossed to Greece with an army.</p></div2>

<head>Wise Patriots or Traitors?</head>
<p>It has often and in many cases occurred to me to
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Was Aristaenus a traitor or a wise Opportunist?</note>
wonder at the mistakes men make; but none
seems to me so surprising as that of traitors.
I wish, therefore, to say a word in season on
the subject. I know very well that it is one which does not
admit of easy treatment or definition. For it is not at all
easy to say whom we ought to regard as a real traitor. Plainly
all those, who at a time of tranquillity make compacts with
kings or princes, cannot be reckoned such off hand; nor, again,
those who in the midst of dangers transfer their country from
existing friendships and alliances to others. Far from it.
For such men have again and again been the authors of manifold advantages to their own countries. But not to go any
<pb n="213"/>
further for example, my meaning can be made clear by the
circumstances of the present case. For, if Aristaenus had not
at this time opportunely caused the Achaeans to leave their
alliance with Philip and join that of Rome, it is clear that the
whole league would have been utterly ruined. But as it was,
this man and this policy were confessedly the sources, not only
of security to individual Achaeans at the time, but of the
aggrandisement of the whole league. Therefore he was not
looked upon as a traitor, but universally honoured as a benefactor and saviour of the country. The same principle will
hold good in the case of all others who regulate their policy
and measures by the necessities of the hour.</p></div2>

with Demosthenes, admirable as he is in
many respects, for having rashly and indiscriminately launched an exceedingly bitter
charge at the most illustrious Greeks. For he
asserted that in Arcadia, Cercidas, Hieronymus,
and Eucampidas were traitors to Greece for
making an alliance with Philip; in Messene
the sons of Philiades, Neon and Thraylochus;
in Argos, Mystis, Teledamus, one Mnaseas; in Thessaly,
Daochus and Cineas; in Boeotia, Theogeiton and Timolas:
and many more besides he has included in the same category,
naming them city by city; and yet all these men have a

<pb n="214"/>
on Philip and the Macedonians, but to do all they could to
promote his reputation and honour. Now, if they had been
doing all this, or if they had admitted a garrison from Philip
into their native cities, or had abolished their constitutions
and deprived their fellow-citizens of liberty and freedom of
speech, for the sake of their own private advantage or power,
they would have deserved this name of traitor. But if, while
carefully maintaining their duty to their countries, they yet
differed in their judgment of politics, and did not consider
that their interests were the same as those of the Athenians,
it is not, I think, fair that they should have been called traitors
on that account by Demosthenes. The man who measures
everything by the interests of his own particular state, and
imagines that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed
upon Athens, on the pain of being styled traitors, seems to me
to be ill-informed and to be labouring under a strange delusion, especially as the course which events in Greece took at
that time has borne witness to the wisdom, not of Demosthenes,
but of Eucampidas, Hieronymus, Cercidas, and the sons of
Philiades.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-338">338</date>.</note> For what did the Athenians eventually get by their
opposition to Philip? Why, the crowning disaster of the defeat at Chaeronea. And had it not
been for the king's magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks
to the policy of Demosthenes. Whereas, owing to the men I
have mentioned, security and relief from attacks of the Lacedaemonians were obtained for Arcadia and Messenia generally,
and many advantages accrued to their states separately.</p></div2>

<head>The Fate of Traitors</head>
<p>It is not easy then to define to whom one may properly
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The true traitor is the man who acts with personal objects or from party spirit.</note>
apply this name. The nearest approach to truth
would be to assign it to those who in times of
public danger, either for the sake of personal
security or advantage, or to retaliate upon political opponents, put their cities into the hands
of the enemy: or indeed to those who, by admitting a foreign
garrison, and employing external assistance to carry out private
<pb n="215"/>
aims and views, bring their country under the direction of a
superior power.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The reward of treason.</note> All such men as these one might include in
the category of traitors with perfect reasonableness. Such men,
indeed, gain neither profit nor honour, but the reverse, as
every one acknowledges. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The reward of treason.</note> And this brings me
back to my original observation, that it is difficult
to understand with what object, and supported
by what reasoning, men rush upon such a disastrous position.
For no one ever yet betrayed his city or camp or fort without
being detected; but even if a man here and there managed
to conceal it at the moment of his crime, yet all have been
detected in the course of time. Nor when known has any
such ever had a happy life; but, as a rule, they meet with the
punishment they deserve from the very persons in whose
favour they act. <note anchored="yes" place="marg"><bibl n="Dem. 18.47">Demosth. <title>de Corona,</title> &sect; 47</bibl>.</note> For, indeed, though generals and princes
constantly employ traitors for their own purposes; yet when
they have got all they can out of them, they
treat them thenceforth as traitors, as Demosthenes says; very naturally considering that
those, who have put their country and original friends into the
hands of their enemies, are never likely to be really loyal or
to keep faith with themselves. Nay, even though they escape
violence at the hands of these, yet they do not easily avoid
the vengeance of those whom they betrayed. Or if, finally,
they manage to evade the designs of both the one and the
other, yet all over the world fame dogs their footsteps with
vengeance to their lives' end, suggesting to their imaginations
night and day numberless terrors, false and true; helping and
hounding on all who design any evil against them; and, finally,
refusing to allow them even in sleep to forget their crimes, but
forcing them to dream of every kind of plot and disaster,
because they are aware of the universal loathing and hatred
which attend them. Yet, though all this is true, nobody who
wanted one was ever at a loss for a traitor, except in the rarest
cases. From which one might say with some plausibility that
man, reputed the most cunning of animals, gives considerable
grounds for being regarded as the stupidest. For the other
animals, which obey their bodily appetites alone, can be
deceived by these alone; while man, though he has reason
<pb n="216"/>
to guide him, is led into error by the failure of that reason no
less than by his physical appetites. . . .</p></div2>

were encamped, but yet being clearly informed
that they had entered Thessaly, gave orders
to all his men to cut stakes to carry with them,
ready for use at any moment. This seems impossible
<pb n="217"/>  to Greek habits, but to those of Rome it is easy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The methods of forming palisades among the Greeks and Romans.</note> For
the Greeks find it difficult to hold even their
sarissae on the march, and can scarcely bear
the fatigue of them; but the Romans strap
their shields to their shoulders with leathern
thongs, and, having nothing but their javelins in their hands,
can stand the additional burden of a stake. There is also
a great difference between the stakes employed by the two
peoples. The Greeks hold that the best stake is that which
has the largest and most numerous shoots growing round the
stem; but the Roman stakes have only two or three side shoots,
or at most four; and those are selected which have these
shoots on one side only. The result is that their porterage is
very easy (for each man carries three or four packed together),
and they make an exceedingly secure palisade when put
into use. For the Greek palisading, when set in the front of
the camp, in the first place can easily be pulled down; for
since the part that is firm and tightly fixed in the ground is
single, while the projecting arms of it are many and large, two
or three men can get hold of the same stake by its projecting
arms, and easily pull it up; and directly that is done, its
breadth is so great that a regular gateway is made: and because
in such a palisade the stakes are not closely interlaced or
interwoven with each other, when one is pulled up the part
next to it is made insecure. With the Romans it is quite
different. For as soon as they fix their stakes, they interlace
them in such a manner that it is not easy to know to which of
the stems fixed in the ground the branches belong, nor on
which of these branches the smaller shoots are growing.
Moreover, it is impossible to insert the hand and grasp them,
owing to the closeness of the interlacing of the branches and
the way they lie one upon another, and because the main
branches are also carefully cut so as to have sharp ends. Nor,
if one is got hold of, is it easy to pull up: because, in the first
place, all the stakes are sufficiently tightly secured in the
ground to be self-supporting; and, in the second place, because
the man who pulls away one branch must, owing to the close
interlacing, be able to move several others in its train; and it is
quite unlikely that two or three men should happen to get hold
<pb n="218"/>
of the same stake. But even if, by the exertion of enormous
force, a man has succeeded in pulling one or another up, the
gap is scarcely perceptible. Considering, therefore, the vast
superiority of this method, both in the readiness with which
such stakes are found, the ease with which they are carried,
and the security and durability of the palisade made with
them, it is plain, in my opinion, that if any military operation
of the Romans deserves to be admired and imitated, it is this.</p></div2>

the morning watch, sent out some reconnoitring
parties to see whether they could get any opportunity of discovering the position and movements of the

both parties broke up their camps next day.
Philip directed his march towards Scotusa, because he desired to supply himself with provisions from that town, and thus, with all his
preparations complete, to find a district more
suitable to his army: while Flamininus,
divining his intention, got his army on the march at the
same time as Philip, in great haste to anticipate him in
securing the corn in the territory of Scotusa. A range
of hills intervening between their two lines of march, the
Romans could not see in what direction the Macedonians were
marching, nor the Macedonians the Romans. Both armies,
however, continued their march during this day, Flamininus to
Eretria in Phthiotis, and Philip to the river Onchestus; and
there they respectively pitched their camps. Next day they
advanced again, and again encamped: Philip at Melambium
in the territory of Scotusa, and Flamininus at the temple of
Thetis in that of Pharsalus, being still ignorant of each other's
whereabouts. A violent storm of rain and thunder coming
on next day, the whole atmosphere descended from the clouds
to the earth about the time of the morning watch, so that the
darkness was too dense to see even those who were quite
close. In spite of this, Philip was so eager to accomplish his
object, that he started with his whole army; but finding himself
much embarrassed on the march by the mist, after accomplishing a very small distance he again encamped; but he sent
his reserve back, with instructions to halt upon the summit of
the intervening hills.<note anchored="yes">That is of Cynoscephalae. <cit><quote lang="la">Supergressi tumulos qui Cynoscephalae

both despatched messengers to their respective chiefs to give
information of what had occurred; and when the Roman
began to get the worst of it in the encounter, and to suffer
heavily at the hands of the Macedonian reserve, they sent to
their camp begging for supports. Flamininus accordingly
despatched the Aetolians under Archedamus and Eupolemus,
as well as two of his own tribunes, with a force altogether of
five hundred cavalry and two thousand infantry, after properly
exhorting them to do their duty. On their arrival to the
support of the skirmishing party already engaged, the aspect of
affairs was promptly changed. For the Romans, inspired by
the hope which this reinforcement gave, renewed the contest
with redoubled spirit; while the Macedonians, though offering
a gallant defence, were now in their turn hard pressed, and
being forced to make a general retreat, retired to the highest
points in the hills, and despatched messengers to the king for
help.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c22" type="chapter" n="22">
<head>Skirmishes Before the Main Battle</head>
<p>But Philip, who had not expected, for reasons indicated above, that a general engagement would

take place on that day, happened to have sent
a considerable part of his troops out of camp
foraging. But when informed of what was taking place by
these messengers, the mist at the same time beginning to lift,
he despatched, with due exhortation, Heracleides of Gyrton,
the commander of his Thessalian cavalry; Leon, the general
of his Macedonian horse; and Athenagoras, with all the mercenaries except those from Thrace. The reserve being joined
by these troops, and the Macedonian force having thus become
a formidable one, they advanced against the enemy, and in
their turn drove the Romans back from the heights. But what
prevented them, more than anything else, from entirely routing
<pb n="221"/>
the enemy was the gallantry of the Aetolian cavalry, which
fought with desperate fury and reckless valour. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Valour of the Aetolian cavalry.</note>
For the Aetolians are as superior to the rest of
the Greeks in cavalry for fighting in skirmishing
order, troop to troop, or man to man, as they are inferior
to them both in the arms and tactics of their infantry for the
purpose of a general engagement. The enemy being held in
check therefore by these troops, the Roman were not forced
back again quite on to the level ground, but, after retiring to a
short distance, faced round and halted. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cynoscephalae. Flamininus offers battle, which Philip, against his better judgment, accepts.</note> But
when Flamininus saw that not only had the
cavalry and light infantry retired, but that,

them into order of battle close to the hills. Meanwhile one
man after another of the Macedonian reserve ran towards
Philip shouting out, "King, the enemy are flying: do not let
slip the opportunity. The barbarians cannot stand before us:
now is the day for you to strike: now is your opportunity!"
The result was that he was induced to fight in spite of his dissatisfaction with the ground. For these hills, which are
called Cynoscephalae, are rough, precipitous, and of considerable height; and it was because he foresaw
the disadvantages of such a ground, that he was originally disinclined to
accept battle there; but, being excited now by the extravagantly sanguine reports of these messengers, he gave the order
for his army to be drawn out of camp.</p></div2>

his attention at the same time to relieving his
advanced guard, and to going along the ranks
to encourage his men. His exhortation was
short, but clear and intelligible to the hearers:
for, pointing to the enemy with his hand, he said to his soldiers: "Are not these the Macedonians, my men, whom, when
occupying in their own country the pass to Eordaea, you routed
in open battle, under the command of Sulpicius, and drove to
take refuge on the hills with the loss of many of their comrades? Are not these the Macedonians whom, when defended
by what seemed an impassable country in Epirus, you dislodged
<pb n="222"/>  by sheer valour, and forced to throw away their shields
and fly right into Macedonia? Why then should you feel any
hesitation when you are to fight the same men on equal
ground? Why look anxiously to the past, rather than let that
past minister courage to you for the present? Therefore, my
men, rouse each other by mutual exhortations, and hasten in
your might to the struggle! For, with God's will, I am persuaded that this battle will quickly have the same issue as the
contests in the past." With these words he ordered his right
wing to remain where they were, and the elephants in front of
them; while with his left, supported by the
light infantry, he advanced in gallant style to
attack the enemy. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The advanced guard are encouraged.</note> And the Roman troops

<head>The Battle of Cynoscephalae</head>
<p>Meanwhile, when he had seen the main part of his
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip also advances and occupies the hills.</note>
army in position outside the camp, Philip himself advanced with his peltasts and the right
wing of his phalanx, commencing the ascent of
the hills with great rapidity, and having left instructions with
Nicanor, surnamed the Elephant, to see that the rest of the
army followed at once. As soon as his first files reached the
summit, he deployed his men into line by the left, and occupied
the range of high ground: for the Macedonians who had
been sent in advance had forced the Romans a considerable
distance down the other side of the hills, and therefore he
found the ridges unoccupied by the enemy. But while he
was still engaged in getting the right wing of his army into line,
his mercenaries came on the ground, having been decisively
repulsed by the enemy. For when the Roman light infantry
found themselves supported by the heavy, as I said just now,
with their assistance, which they regarded as turning the scale
in their favour, they made a furious charge on the enemy, and
killed a large number of them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip's advanced guard defeated.</note> When the king first came on
the ground, and saw that the fighting between
the light armed was going on near the enemy's

<pb n="223"/>
support, he was compelled to give it, and allow the necessities
of the moment to decide the fortunes of the whole day, in
spite of the fact that the greater part of his phalanx was still
on the march and engaged in mounting the hills. Receiving
therefore the men who had been already engaged, he massed
them all upon his right wing, both infantry and cavalry;
while he ordered the peltasts and heavy armed to double their
depth and close up to the right. By the time this was effected
the enemy were close at hand; and, accordingly, the word was
given to the phalanx to lower spears and charge; to the light
infantry to cover their flank. At the same time Flamininus
also, having received his advanced party into the intervals between his maniples, charged the enemy.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c25" type="chapter" n="25">
<head>The Battle</head>
<p>The charge was made with great violence and loud
shouting on both sides: for both advancing

were not actually engaged shouted encouragement to those
that were; and the result was a scene of the wildest excitement,
terrible in the last degree. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Philip's right wing repulse the Roman left.</note> Philip's right
wing came off brilliantly in the encounter, for

<pb n="224"/>
keeping the elephants in front he led the maniples of his right
against the enemy. The Macedonians having no one to give
them orders, and unable to form a proper phalanx, owing to
the inequalities of the ground and to the fact that, being
engaged in trying to come up with the actual combatants, they
were still in column of march, did not even wait for the Romans
to come to close quarters: but, thrown into confusion by the
mere charge of the elephants, their ranks were disordered and
they broke into flight.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c26" type="chapter" n="26">
<head>Philip's Defeat and Flight</head>
<p>The main body of the Roman right followed and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Macedonian phalanx outflanked.</note>
slaughtered the flying Macedonians. But one
of the tribunes, with about twenty maniples,
having made up his mind on his own account
what ought to be done next, contributed by his action very
greatly to the general victory. He saw that the division
which was personally commanded by Philip was much farther
forward than the rest of the enemy, and was pressing hard
upon the Roman left by its superior weight; he therefore left
the right, which was by this time clearly victorious, and directing his march towards the part of the field where a struggle
was still going on, he managed to get behind the Macedonians
and charge them on the rear. The nature of the phalanx is
such that the men cannot face round singly and defend themselves: this tribune, therefore, charged them and killed all he
could get at; until, being unable to defend themselves, they
were forced to throw down their shields and fly; whereupon
the Romans in their front, who had begun to yield, faced round
again and charged them too.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The king quits the field and flies.</note> At first, as I have said, Philip,
judging from the success of his own division, felt certain of a
complete victory; but when he saw his Macedonians all on a
sudden throwing away their shields, and the enemy close upon
their rear, he withdrew with a small body of foot
and horse a short distance from the field and
took a general survey of the whole battle: and
when he observed that the Romans in their pursuit of his left
wing were already approaching the tops of the hills, he rallied as
many Thracians and Macedonians as he could at the moment,
<pb n="225"/>
and fled. As Flamininus was pursuing the fugitives he came
upon the lines of the Macedonian left, just as they were scaling
the ridge in their attempt to cross the hills, and at first halted
in some surprise because the enemy held their spears straight
up, as is the custom of the Macedonians when surrendering
themselves or intending to pass over to the enemy. Presently,
having had the reason of this movement explained to him, he
held his men back, thinking it best to spare the lives of those
whom fear had induced to surrender. But whilst he was still
reflecting on this matter, some of the advanced guard rushed
upon these men from some higher ground and put most of
them to the sword, while the few survivors threw away their
shields and escaped by flight.</p></div2>

while the majority hurried to the plunder of the

Aetolians had been beforehand with them; and
thinking, therefore, that they were deprived of
their fair share of the booty, they began grumbling at the
Aetolians and protesting to their general that "he imposed the
dangers upon them, but yielded the spoil to others." For the
present, however, they returned to their own camp, and passed
the night in their old quarters: but next morning they employed themselves in collecting the prisoners and the remainder

<head>The Macedonian Phalanx</head>
<p>In my sixth book I made a promise, still unfulfilled, of
taking a fitting opportunity of drawing a comparison between
the arms of the Romans and Macedonians, and their respective system of tactics, and pointing out how they differ
for better or worse from each other. I will now endeavour by
a reference to actual facts to fulfil that promise. For since in
former times the Macedonian tactics proved themselves by
experience capable of conquering those of Asia and Greece;
while the Roman tactics sufficed to conquer the nations of
Africa and all those of Western Europe; and since in our
own day there have been numerous opportunities of comparing the men as well as their tactics,&mdash;it will be, I think, a
useful and worthy task to investigate their differences, and discover why it is that the Romans conquer and carry off the
palm from their enemies in the operations of war: that we may
not put it all down to Fortune, and congratulate them on their
good luck, as the thoughtless of mankind do; but, from a
knowledge of the true causes, may give their leaders the tribute
of praise and admiration which they deserve.</p>

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman defeats in the Punic wars were not from inferior tactics, but owing to the genius of Hannibal.</note>

two facts. First, by the conclusion of the war:
for as soon as the Romans got a general of ability comparable with that of Hannibal, victory was not long in following
their banners. Secondly, Hannibal himself, being dissatisfied
with the original arms of his men, and having immediately after
his first victory furnished his troops with the arms of the
Romans, continued to employ them thenceforth to the end.<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b3c87" targOrder="U">3, 87</ref>.</note>
Pyrrhus, again, availed himself not only of the arms, but also
of the troops of Italy, placing a maniple of Italians and a
company of his own phalanx alternately, in his battles against
the Romans. Yet even this did not enable him to win; the
battles were somehow or another always indecisive.
<pb n="227"/></p>
<p>It was necessary to speak first on these points, to anticipate
any instances which might seem to make against my theory.
I will now return to my comparison.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c29" type="chapter" n="29">
<head>A Well-Formed Phalanx is Irresistible</head>
<p>Many considerations may easily convince us that, if
only the phalanx has its proper formation and strength, nothing
can resist it face to face or withstand its charge. For as a man
in close order of battle occupies a space of three feet; and as
the length of the sarissae is sixteen cubits according to the
original design, which has been reduced in practice to fourteen;
and as of these fourteen four must be deducted, to allow for
the distance between the two hands holding it, and to balance
the weight in front; it follows clearly that each hoplite will have
ten cubits of his sarissae projecting beyond his body, when he
lowers it with both hands, as he advances against the enemy:
hence, too, though the men of the second, third, and fourth
rank will have their sarissae projecting farther beyond the front
rank than the men of the fifth, yet even these last will have two
cubits of their sarissae beyond the front rank; if only the
phalanx is properly formed and the men close up properly both
flank and rear, like the description in Homer<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.131"><title>Iliad,</title> 13, 131</bibl>.</note>&mdash;
<quote><l>"So buckler pressed on buckler; helm on helm;</l>
<l>And man on man: and waving horse-hair plumes</l>
<l>In polished head-piece mingled, as they swayed</l>
<l>In order: in such serried rank they stood."</l></quote>
And if my description is true and exact, it is clear that in front
of each man of the front rank there will be five sarissae projecting
to distances varying by a descending scale of two cubits.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>Roman Soldiers in More Open Order</head>
<p>With this point in our minds, it will not be difficult to
imagine what the appearance and strength of the whole phalanx
is likely to be, when, with lowered sarissae, it advances to the
charge sixteen deep. Of these sixteen ranks, all above the fifth
are unable to reach with their sarissae far enough to take actual
part in the fighting. They, therefore, do not lower them, but
hold them with the points inclined upwards over the shoulders
of the ranks in front of them, to shield the heads of the whole
phalanx; for the sarissae are so closely serried, that they repel
missiles which have carried over the front ranks and might fall
upon the heads of those in the rear. These rear ranks, however,
<pb n="228"/>  during an advance, press forward those in front by the
weight of their bodies; and thus make the charge very forcible,
and at the same time render it impossible for the front ranks
to face about.</p>
<p>Such is the arrangement, general and detailed, of the<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman more open order compared with the phalanx.</note>
phalanx. It remains now to compare with it
the peculiarities and distinctive features of the
Roman arms and tactics. Now, a Roman
soldier in full armour also requires a space of
three square feet. But as their method of fighting admits of
individual motion for each man&mdash;because he defends his body
with a shield, which he moves about to any point from which
a blow is coming, and because he uses his sword both for
cutting and stabbing,&mdash;it is evident that each man must have
a clear space, and an interval of at least three feet both on
flank and rear, if he is to do his duty with any effect. The
result of this will be that each Roman soldier will face two of
the front rank of a phalanx, so that he has to encounter and
fight against ten spears, which one man cannot find time even
to cut away, when once the two lines are engaged, nor force
his way through easily&mdash;seeing that the Roman front ranks are
not supported by the rear ranks, either by way of adding weight
to their charge, or vigour to the use of their swords. Therefore
it may readily be understood that, as I said before, it is impossible to confront a charge of the phalanx, so long as it
retains its proper formation and strength.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c31" type="chapter" n="31">
<head>Cumbrous Nature of the Phalanx</head>
<p>Why is it then that the Romans conquer? And what is
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Why the phalanx fails.</note>
it that brings disaster on those who employ the
phalanx? Why, just because war is full of uncertainties both as to time and place; whereas
there is but one time and one kind of ground in which a
phalanx can fully work. If, then, there were anything to compel the enemy to accommodate himself to the time and place
of the phalanx, when about to fight a general engagement, it
would be but natural to expect that those who employed the
phalanx would always carry off the victory. But if the enemy
finds it possible, and even easy, to avoid its attack, what
becomes of its formidable character? Again, no one denies
that for its employment it is indispensable to have a country
<pb n="229"/>
flat, bare, and without such impediments as ditches, cavities,
depressions, steep banks, or beds of rivers: for all such
obstacles are sufficient to hinder and dislocate this particular
formation. And that it is, I may say, impossible, or at any rate
exceedingly rare to find a piece of country of twenty stades, or
sometimes of even greater extent, without any such obstacles,
every one will also admit. However, let us suppose that such
a district has been found. If the enemy decline to come
down into it, but traverse the country sacking the towns and
territories of the allies, what use will the phalanx be? For if
it remains on the ground suited to itself, it will not only fail
to benefit its friends, but will be incapable even of preserving
itself; for the carriage of provisions will be easily stopped by
the enemy, seeing that they are in undisputed possession of
the country: while if it quits its proper ground, from the wish
to strike a blow, it will be an easy prey to the enemy. Nay,
if a general does descend into the plain, and yet does not risk
his whole army upon one charge of the phalanx or upon
one chance, but man&oelig;uvres for a time to avoid coming to
close quarters in the engagement, it is easy to learn what will
be the result from what the Romans are now actually doing.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c32" type="chapter" n="32">
<head>How the Romans Fight Against a Phalanx</head>
<p>For no speculation is any longer required to test the
accuracy of what I am now saying: that can be done by referring to accomplished facts.</p>
<p>The Romans do not, then, attempt to extend their front to
equal that of a phalanx, and then charge directly upon it with
their whole force: but some of their divisions are kept in reserve, while others join battle with the enemy at close quarters.
Now, whether the phalanx in its charge drives its opponents
from their ground, or is itself driven back, in either case its
peculiar order is dislocated; for whether in following the
retiring, or flying from the advancing enemy, they quit the
rest of their forces: and when this takes place, the enemy's
reserves can occupy the space thus left, and the ground which
the phalanx had just before been holding, and so no longer
charge them face to face, but fall upon them on their flank
and rear. If, then, it is easy to take precautions against the
opportunities and peculiar advantages of the phalanx, but impossible to do so in the case of its disadvantages, must it not
<pb n="230"/>
follow that in practice the difference between these two systems is
enormous? Of course those generals who employ the phalanx
must march over ground of every description, must pitch
camps, occupy points of advantage, besiege, and be besieged,
and meet with unexpected appearances of the enemy: for all
these are part and parcel of war, and have an important and
sometimes decisive influence on the ultimate victory. And
in all these cases the Macedonian phalanx is difficult, and
sometimes impossible to handle, because the men cannot act
either in squads or separately. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Flexibility of the Roman order.</note> The Roman order on the
other hand is flexible: for every Roman, once
armed and on the field, is equally well equipped
for every place, time, or appearance of the
enemy. He is, moreover, quite ready and needs to make no
change, whether he is required to fight in the main body, or
in a detachment, or in a single maniple, or even by himself.
Therefore, as the individual members of the Roman force are
so much more serviceable, their plans are also much more
often attended by success than those of others.</p>
<p>I thought it necessary to discuss this subject at some
length, because at the actual time of the occurrence many
Greeks supposed when the Macedonians were beaten that it
was incredible; and many will afterwards be at a loss to
account for the inferiority of the phalanx to the Roman
system of arming.</p></div2>

<head>Philip's Conduct After the Battle</head>
<p>Philip having thus done all he could in the battle,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Prudent conduct of Philip.</note>
but having been decisively beaten, after taking
up as many of the survivors as he could, proceeded through Tempe into Macedonia. On
the night previous to his start he sent one of his guard to
Larisa, with orders to destroy and burn the king's correspondence. And it was an act worthy of a king to retain, even in
the midst of disaster, a recollection of a necessary duty. For
he knew well enough that, if these papers came into the possession of the Romans, they would give many handles to the
enemy both against himself and his friends. It has, perhaps,
been the case with others that in prosperity they could not use
power with the moderation which becomes mortal men, while in
disaster they displayed caution and good sense; but certainly
<pb n="231"/>
this was the case with Philip. And this will be made manifest
by what I shall subsequently relate. For as I showed without
reserve the justice of his measures at the beginning of his
reign, and the change for the worse which they subsequently
underwent; and showed when and why and how this took
place, with a detailed description of the actions in this part of
his career;<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b4c77" targOrder="U">4, 77</ref>; <ref target="b7c12" targOrder="U">7, 12</ref>; <ref target="b10c26" targOrder="U">10, 26</ref>.</note>
in the same way am I bound to set forth his
repentance, and the dexterity with which he changed with his
change of fortune, and may be said to have shown the highest
prudence in meeting this crisis in his affairs.</p>
<p>As for Flamininus, having after the battle taken the
necessary measures as to the captives and the rest of the
spoils, he proceeded to Larisa. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c34" type="chapter" n="34">
<head>Flamininus and the Aetolians At Odds</head>
<p>Flamininus was much annoyed at the selfishness displayed by the Aetolians in regard to the spoils;
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Estrangement of Aetolians.</note>
and had no idea of leaving them to be masters
of Greece after he had deprived Philip of his
supremacy there. He was irritated also by their braggadocio,
when he saw that they claimed all the credit of the victory,
and were filling Greece with the report of their valour.
Wherefore, wherever he met them he behaved with hauteur,
and never said a word on public business, but carried out all
his measures independently or by the agency of his own
friends. While the relations between these two were in this
strained state, some few days after the battle
Demosthenes, Cycliadas, and Limnaeus came
on a mission from Philip; and, after considerable discussion with them, Flamininus granted an immediate
armistice of fifteen days, and agreed to have a personal interview also with Philip in the course of them to discuss the state of
affairs. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Flamininus grants fifteen days' truce to Philip.</note> And this interview being conducted in a courteous and
friendly manner, the suspicions entertained of Flamininus by the
Aetolians blazed forth with double fury. For as corruption, and
the habit of never doing anything without a bribe, had long been
a common feature in Greek politics, and as this was the acknowledged characteristic of the Aetolians, they could not believe
that Flamininus could so change in his relations with Philip
without a bribe. They did not know the habits and principles
<pb n="232"/>
of the Romans on this subject; but judging from themselves
they concluded that there was every probability of Philip in
his present position offering a large sum of money, and of
Flamininus being unable to resist the temptation.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c35" type="chapter" n="35">
<head>Comparative Incorruptibility of Romans</head>
<p>If I had been speaking of an earlier period, and expressing what was generally true, I should have had
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The disinterestedness of the Romans generally as to money.</note>
no hesitation in asserting of the Romans as a
nation that they would not be likely to do such
a thing,&mdash;I mean in the period before they engaged in wars beyond the sea, and while they retained their
own habits and principles uncontaminated.<note anchored="yes">See <ref target="b6c56" targOrder="U">6, 56</ref>; <ref target="b32c11" targOrder="U">32, 11</ref>.</note> But in
the present times I should not venture to say this of them all; still,
as individuals, I should be bold to say of the majority of the
men of Rome that they are capable of preserving their honesty
in this particular: and as evidence that I am making no impossible assertion, I would quote two names which will command
general assent,&mdash;I mean first, Lucius Aemilius
who conquered Perseus, and won the kingdom of
Macedonia.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Lucius Aemilius Paulus.</note> In that kingdom, besides all the
other splendour and wealth, there was found in the treasury
more than six thousand talents of gold and silver: yet he was
so far from coveting any of this, that he even refused to see it,
and administered it by the hands of others; though he was far
from being superfluously wealthy himself, but, on the contrary,
was very badly off. At least, I know that on his death, which
occurred shortly after the war, when his own sons Publius
Scipio and Quintus Maximus wished to pay his wife her dowry,
amounting to twenty-five talents, they were reduced to such
straits that they would have been quite unable to do so if they
had not sold the household furniture and slaves, and some of
the landed property besides. And if what I say shall appear
incredible to any one, he may easily convince himself on the
subject: for though there are many controversies at Rome,
and especially on this particular point, arising from the antagonistic parties among them, yet he will find
that what I have just said about Aemilius is
acknowledged by every one.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Publius Cornelius, Scipio Africanus Minor.</note> Again, Publius
Scipio, son by blood of this Aemilius, and son by adoption
<pb n="233"/>
of Publius called the Great, when he got possession of Carthage, reckoned the wealthiest city in the world,
took absolutely nothing from it for his own private use, either by purchase or by any other manner of acquisition whatever, although
he was by no means a very rich man, but very moderately so
for a Roman. But he not only abstained from the wealth of
Carthage itself, but refused to allow anything from Africa at
all to be mixed up with his private property. Therefore, in
regard to this man once more, any one who chooses to inquire
will find that his reputation in this particular is absolutely
undisputed at Rome. I shall, however, take a more suitable
opportunity of treating this subject at greater length.</p></div2>

afterwards came himself to the pass of Tempe at the appointed

the Roman imperator rose and bade each say on what terms
they ought to make peace with Philip.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of King Amynandros.</note> King Amynandros
then delivered a short and moderate speech,
merely asking that "they would all have some

anger upon him; for the Athamanes were always an easy prey
to the Macedonians, because of their weakness and the close
contiguity of their territory."<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Alexander the Aetolian.</note>
When he had finished, Alexander the Aetolian rose and complimented Flamininus for "having assembled the allies in that
congress to discuss the terms of peace; and,
above all, for having on the present occasion called on each
to express his opinion. But he was deluded and mistaken,"
he added, "if he believed that by making terms with Philip
he would secure the Romans peace or the Greeks freedom. For
neither of these was possible. But if he desired to accomplish both the design of his own government and his own
promises, which he had given to all the Greeks, there was one
way, and one only, of making terms with Macedonia, and that
was to eject Philip from his throne; and this could easily be
done if he did not let slip the present opportunity."
<pb n="234"/></p>
<p>After some further arguments in support of this view he sat down.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c37" type="chapter" n="37">
<head>Debate In the Congress At Tempe</head>
<p>Flamininus here took up the argument, and said that
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Reply of Flamininus.</note>
"Alexander was mistaken not only as to the policy
of Rome, but also as to the object which he proposed to himself, and above all as to the true
interests of Greece. For it was not the Roman way to utterly
destroy those with whom they had been at open war. A proof of
his assertion might be found in the war with Hannibal and the
Carthaginians; for though the Romans had received the severest provocation at their hands, and afterwards had it in their
power to do absolutely what they pleased to them, yet they
had adopted no extreme measures against the Carthaginians.
For his part, moreover, he had never entertained the idea that
it was necessary to wage an inexpiable war with Philip; but on
the contrary had been prepared before the battle to come to
terms with him, if he would have submitted to the Roman
demands. He was surprised, therefore, that those who had
taken part in the former peace conference should now adopt a
tone of such irreconcilable hostility. Have we not conquered?
(say they). Yes, but this is the most senseless of arguments. For
brave men, when actually at war, should be terrible and full of
fire; when beaten, undaunted and courageous; when victorious, on the other hand, moderate, placable, and humane. But
your present advice is the reverse of all this. Yet, in truth, to
the Greeks themselves it is greatly to their interest that Macedonia should be humbled, but not at all so that she should
be destroyed. For it might chance thereby that they would
experience the barbarity of Thracians and Gauls, as has been
the case more than once already." He then added that" the
final decision of himself and Roman colleagues was, that, if
Philip would consent to fulfil all the conditions formerly enjoined by the allies, they would grant him peace, subject, of
course, to the approval of the Senate: and that the Aetolians
were free to take what measures they chose for themselves."
Upon Phaeneas attempting to reply that "Everything done
hitherto went for nothing; for if Philip managed to extricate himself from his present difficulties, he would at once
find some other occasion for hostilities,"&mdash;Flamininus sprang
<pb n="235"/>
at once from his seat, and said, with some heat, "Cease this
trifling, Phaeneas! For I will so settle the terms of the peace
that Philip will be unable, even if he wished it, to molest the
Greeks."</p></div2>

<p>After this they separated for that day. On the next the

king arrived: and on the third, when all the
delegates were met for discussion, Philip entered, and with great skill and tact diverted
the anger which they all entertained against him. For he
said that "He conceded the demands made on the former
occasion by the Romans and the allies, and remitted the decision on the remaining points to the Senate." But Phaeneas,
one of the Aetolians present, said: "Why then, Philip, do
not you restore to us Larisa Cremaste, Pharsalus, Phthiotid
Thebes, and Echinus?" Whereupon Philip bade them take
them over.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Aetolians checkmated by Flamininus.</note> But Flamininus here interposed,
and forbade the Aetolians to take over any of
the towns except Phthiotid Thebes; "for upon
his approaching this town with his army, and summoning it to
submit to the Roman protection, the Thebans had refused;
and, as it had now come into his hands in the course of war,
he had the right of taking any measures he chose regarding it."
Phaeneas and his colleagues indignantly protested at this, and
asserted that it was their clear right to recover the towns previously members of their league, "first on the ground that
they had taken part in the recent war; and secondly in virtue
of their original treaty of alliance, according to which the movable property of the conquered belonged to the Romans, the
towns to the Aetolians." To which Flamininus answered that
"they were mistaken in both points; for their treaty with
Rome had been annulled when they abandoned the Romans,
and made terms with Philip: and, even supposing that treaty
to be still in force, they had no right to recover or take over
such cities as had voluntarily put themselves under the protection of Rome, as the whole of the cities in Thessaly had done,
but only such as were taken by force.<note anchored="yes">Livy <bibl n="Liv. 33.13">(33, 13)</bibl> has mistaken the meaning of Polybius in this passage,

at this speech of Flamininus. But the Aetolians listened with indignation; and what proved
to be the beginning of serious evils was
engendered. For this quarrel was the spark
from which, not long afterwards, both the war with the Aetolians and that with Antiochus flamed out. The principal
motive of Flamininus in being thus forward in coming to
terms was the information he had received that Anticchus
had started from Syria with an army, with the intention of
crossing over into Europe. Therefore he was anxious lest
Philip, catching at this chance, should determine to defend
the towns and protract the war; and lest meanwhile he should
himself be superseded by another commander from home, on
whom the honour of all that he had achieved would be
diverted. Therefore the terms which the king asked were
granted: namely, that he should have four months' suspension
of hostilities, paying Flamininus at once the two hundred
talents; delivering his son Demetrius and some others of his
friends as hostages; and sending to Rome to submit the
decision on the whole pacification to the Senate. Flamininus
and Philip then separated, after interchanging mutual pledges
of fidelity, on the understanding that, if the treaty were not
confirmed, Flamininus was to restore to Philip the two hundred
talents and the hostages. All the parties then sent ambassadors to Rome, some to support and others to oppose the

to be well disposed to the royal house of Macedonia.

also sent an embassy to Philip to thank him for the return
of the young men, thus derogating from the favour done them
by Flamininus,&mdash;a measure highly disquieting
to Zeuxippus and Peisistratus, and all who were
regarded as partisans of Rome; because they
foresaw what would happen to themselves and
their families, knowing quite well that if the
Romans quitted Greece, and Philip remained
closely supporting the political party opposed to themselves, it
would be unsafe for them to remain citizens of Boeotia. They
therefore agreed among themselves to send an embassy to
Flamininus in Elateia: and having obtained an interview
with him, they made a lengthy and elaborate statement on
this subject, describing the state of popular feeling which was
now adverse to themselves, and discanting on the untrustworthiness of democratic assemblies. And finally, they
ventured to say that "Unless they could overawe the common
people by getting rid of Brachylles, there could be no security
for the party in favour of Rome as soon as the legions departed."
After listening to these arguments Flamininus replied that
"He would not personally take any part in such a measure,
but he would not hinder those who wished to do so." Finally,
he bade them speak to Alexamenus the Strategus of the
Aetolians. Zeuxippus and his colleagues accepted the suggestion,
and communicated with Alexamenus, who at once consented; and agreeing to carry out their proposal sent three
Aetolians and three Italians, all young men, to assassinate
Brachylles. . . .</p>

the Senate on the peace with Philip. The

at present under his authority, and all towns in which he had
a garrison, before the Isthmian games; and restore Eur&omacr;mus,
Pedasa, Bargylia, Iasus, Abydos, Thasus, Marinus, and Perinthus to freedom, and remove his garrisons from them. That
Flamininus should write to Prusias commanding him to
liberate Cius, in accordance with the decree of the Senate.
That Philip should restore to the Romans within the same
period all captives and deserters; and likewise all decked

should pay a thousand talents, half at once, and half by

<div2 id="b18c45" type="chapter" n="45">
<head>The Freedom of Greece</head>
<p>Upon this decree being published in Greece, it created
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Objections of the Aetolians.</note>
a feeling of confidence and gratification in all
the communities except the Aetolians. These
last were annoyed at not getting all they expected, and attempted to run down the decree by saying that
it was mere words, without anything practical in it; and they
based upon the clauses of the decree itself some such arguments as follow, by way of disquieting those who would listen
to them. They said "That there were two distinct clauses in
the decree relating to the cities garrisoned by Philip: one
ordering him to remove those garrisons and to hand over the
cities to the Romans; the other bidding him withdraw his
garrisons and set the cities free. Those that were to be set
free were definitely named, and they were towns in Asia; and
it was plain, therefore, that those which were to be handed
over to the Romans were those in Europe, namely, Oreus,
Eretria, Chalcis, Demetrias, and Corinth. Hence it was
plain that the Romans were receiving the 'fetters of Greece'
from the hands of Philip, and that the Greeks were getting,
not freedom, but a change of masters."</p>
<p>These arguments of the Aetolians were repeated <foreign lang="la">ad

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The commissioners sit at Corinth, and declare all Greek cities free, except the Acrocorinthus, Demetrias, and Chalcis.</note>
ten commissioners, and having crossed to Anticyra, sailed
straight to Corinth, and there sat in council with the commissioners, and considered the whole settlement to be made.
But as the adverse comments of the Aetolians
obtained wide currency, and were accepted by
<pb n="241"/>
some, Flamininus was forced to enter upon
many elaborate arguments in the meetings of
the commission, trying to convince the commissioners that if they wished to acquire unalloyed praise from the Greeks, and to establish
firmly in the minds of all that they had originally come into
the country not to gain any advantage for Rome, but simply
to secure the freedom of Greece, they must abandon every
district and free all the cities now garrisoned by Philip.  But
this was just the point in dispute among the commissioners;
for, as to all other cities, a decision had been definitely arrived
at in Rome, and the ten commissioners had express instructions; but about Chalcis, Corinth, and Demetrias they had
been allowed a discretion on account of Antiochus, in order
that they might take such measures as they thought best from
a view of actual events. For it was notorious that this king
had for some time past been meditating an interference in
Europe. However, as far as Corinth was concerned, Flamininus prevailed on the commissioners to free it at once and
restore it to the Achaean league, from respect to the terms of
the original agreement; but he retained the Acrocorinthus,
Demetrias, and Chalcis.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b18c46" type="chapter" n="46">
<head>Proclamation At the Isthmian Games</head>
<p>When these decisions had been come to, the time for
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Isthmian games, July B. C. <date value="-196">196</date>.</note>
the celebration of the Isthmian games arrived.
The expectation of what would happen there
drew the men of highest rank from nearly every
quarter of the world; and there was a great deal of talk on the
subject from one end of the assembled multitude to the
other, and expressed in varied language. Some said that
from certain of the places and towns it was impossible that
the Romans could withdraw; while others asserted that they
would withdraw from those considered most important, but
would retain others that were less prominent, though capable
of being quite as serviceable. And such persons even took
upon themselves in their ingenuity to designate the precise
places which would be thus treated. While people were still
in this state of uncertainty, all the world being assembled on
the stadium to watch the games, the herald came forward,
and having proclaimed silence by the sound of a trumpet,
<pb n="242"/>
delivered the following proclamation: "The senate of Rome
and Titus Quintus, proconsul and imperator,
having conquered King Philip and the Macedonians in war, declare the following peoples
free, without garrison, or tribute, in full enjoyment of the laws
of their respective countries: namely, Corinthians, Phocians,
Locrians, Euboeans, Achaeans of Phiotis, Magnesians, Thessalians, Perrhaebians."<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Proclamation of the freedom of the Greek cities.</note></p>
<p>Now as the first words of the proclamation were the signal<note anchored="yes" place="marg">An exciting scene.</note>
for a tremendous outburst of clapping, some of
the people could not hear it at all, and some
wanted to hear it again; but the majority feeling incredulous,
and thinking that they heard the words in a kind of dream, so
utterly unexpected was it, another impulse induced every one
to shout to the herald and trumpeter to come into the middle
of the stadium and repeat the words: I suppose because the
people wished not only to hear but to see the speaker, in their
inability to credit the announcement. But when the herald,
having advanced into the middle of the crowd, once more, by
his trumpeter, hushed the clamour, and repeated exactly the
same proclamation as before, there was such an outbreak of clapping as is difficult to convey to the imagination of my readers
at this time. When at length the clapping ceased, no one paid
any attention whatever to the athletes, but all were talking to
themselves or each other, and seemed like people bereft of
their senses. Nay, after the games were over, in the extravagance of their joy,
they nearly killed Flamininus by the exhibition of their gratitude. Some wanted to look him in
the face and call him their preserver; others were eager
to touch his hand; most threw garlands and fillets upon him;
until between them they nearly crushed him to death. But
though this expression of popular gratitude was thought to
have been extravagant, one might say with confidence that it fell
short of the importance of the actual event. For that the Romans
and their leader Flamininus should have deliberately incurred
unlimited expense and danger, for the sole purpose of freeing
Greece, deserved their admiration; and it was also a great thing
that their power was equal to their intention. But the greatest
thing of all is that Fortune foiled their attempt by none of her
<pb n="243"/>
usual caprices, but that every single thing came to a successful issue at the same time: so that all Greeks, Asiatic and
European alike, were by a single proclamation become "free,
without garrison or tribute, and enjoying their own laws."</p></div2>

<p>The Isthmian festival having come to an end, the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Answer of commissioners to King Antiochus.</note>
first persons with whom the commissioners
dealt were the ambassadors from Antiochus.
They instructed them that "Their master must
abstain from attacking those cities in Asia which were autonomous, and go to war with none of them; and must evacuate
those that had been subject to Ptolemy or Philip. In addition to this they forbade him to cross over into Europe with
an army; for no Greek henceforth was to be attacked in war
or to be enslaved to any one. Finally, they said that some of
their own number would go to visit Antiochus." With this
answer Hegesianax and Lysias returned to Antiochus. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Final arrangements.</note> They
next summoned the representatives of all the
nations and cities, and declared to them the
decisions of the commissioners. The Macedonian tribe of the Orestae, on the ground of their having
joined Rome during the war, they declared autonomous; the
Perrhaebians, Dolopes, and Magnesians they declared to be free.
To the Thessalians, in addition to their freedom, they assigned
the Phiotid Achaeans, with the exception, however, of Phthiotid
Thebes and Pharsalus: for the Aetolians made such a point
of their claim to Pharsalus, as also to Leucas, on the ground
of the rights secured them by the original treaty, that the
commissioners referred the consideration of their demand in
regard to these places back again to the Senate, but allowed
them to retain Phocis and Locris as members of their league,
as they had been before. Corinth, Triphylia, and Heraea
they handed over to the Achaeans. Oreus and Eretria the
majority wished to give to King Eumenes, but on the instance
of Flamininus this design was not confirmed; and, accordingly,
a short time afterwards these towns, with Carystus, were declared free by the Senate. To Pleuratus they assigned Lychnis
and Parthus in Illyria, towns which had been subject to
Philip; and Amynandros they allowed to retain all such strongholds as he had taken from Philip during the war.

announced to Antiochus, they all assembled within the next
few days at Lysimacheia; and it so happened that Hegesianax
and Lysias, who had been on the mission to Flamininus,
arrived about the same time. The private intercourse between
the king and the Romans was informal and friendly; but when
presently they met in conference to discuss public affairs,
things took quite another aspect. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Lucius Cornelius.</note> Lucius Cornelius demanded that Antiochus should
evacuate all the cities subject to Ptolemy which
he had taken in Asia; while he warned him in solemn and
emphatic language that he must do so also to the cities subject

and take the prizes of the war which Rome had waged with
Philip." He also admonished him to abstain from attacking
autonomous cities, and added that "He was at a loss to conjecture with what view Antiochus had crossed over to Europe
with such a powerful army and fleet; for if it were not with
the intention of attacking the Romans, there was no explanation left that any reasonable person could accept."

Asia. They were the last people in the world
who had any claim to do so." Next he claimed that "They
should refrain entirely from interfering in the affairs of Asia,
seeing that he never in the least degree interposed in those of
Italy. He had crossed into Europe with his army to recover
his possessions in the Chersonese and the cities in Thrace;
his right to the government of these places being superior to
that of any one in the world. For this was originally the

It was no injury to the Romans that he should now be

people of Lysimacheia who had been expelled by an unexpected
raid of the Thracians. He was doing this, not from any intention of attacking the Romans, but to prepare a place of
residence for his son Seleucus. As for the autonomous cities
of Asia, they must acquire their freedom by his free grace, not
by an injunction from Rome. As for Ptolemy, he was about
to settle matters amicably with him: for it was his intention

Yet Scopas had much fairer opportunities for a
<pb n="247"/>
hazardous and bold career than Cleomenes.
For the latter, though circumvented by his
enemies, and reduced to depend upon such forces as his
servants and friends could supply, yet left no chance untried,
and tested every one to the best of his ability, valuing an
honourable death more highly than a life of disgrace. But
Scopas, with all the advantages of a formidable body of
soldiers and of the excellent opportunity afforded by the youth
of the king, by his own delays and halting counsels allowed
himself to be circumvented. For having ascertained that he
was holding a meeting of his partisans at his own house, and
was consulting with them, Aristomenes sent some of the royal
bodyguards and summoned him to the king's council.
Whereupon Scopas was so infatuated that he was neither bold
enough to carry out his designs, nor able to make up his mind
to obey the king's summons,&mdash;which is in itself the most
extreme step,&mdash;until Aristomenes, understanding the blunder
he had made, caused soldiers and elephants to surround his
house, and sent Ptolemy son of Eumenes in with some young
men, with orders to bring him quietly if he would come, but, if
not, by force. When Ptolemy entered the house and informed Scopas that the king summoned him, he refused at
first to obey, but remained looking fixedly at Ptolemy, and for
a long while preserved a threatening attitude as though he
wondered at his audacity; and when Ptolemy came boldly
up to him and took hold of his chlamys, he called on the bystanders to help him. But seeing that the number of young
men who had accompanied Ptolemy into the house was large,
and being informed by some one of the military array surrounding it outside, he yielded to circumstances,
and went, accompanied by his friends, in obedience to the summons.</p></div2>

<head>Scopas and Dicaearchus Punished</head>
<p>On his entering the council chamber the king was the first

to state the accusation against him, which he did
briefly. He was followed by Polycrates lately
arrived from Cyprus; and he again by Aristomenes. The charges made by them all were much to the
same effect as what I have just stated; but there was now
added to them the seditious meeting with his friends, and his
refusal to obey the summons of the king. On these charges
<pb n="248"/>
he was unanimously condemned, not only by the members of
the council, but also by the envoys of foreign nations who
were present. And when Aristomenes was about to commence
his accusation he brought in a large number of other Greeks
of rank also to support him, as well as the Aetolian ambassadors who had come to negotiate a peace, among whom
was Dorimachus son of Nicostratus. When these speeches
had been delivered, Scopas endeavoured to put forward certain
pleas in his defence: but gaining no attention from any one,
owing to the senseless nature of his proceedings, he was taken
along with his friends to prison. There after nightfall Aristomenes caused Scopas and his family to be put to death by poison;
but did not allow Dicaearchus to die until he had had him
racked and scourged, thus inflicting on him a punishment which
he thoroughly deserved in the name of all Greece. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of Dicaearchus.</note> For this was

only thought that he was doing nothing wrong, but in the
extravagance of his infatuation imagined that he would strike
terror into the gods as well as man. For wherever he
anchored he used to build two altars, to Impiety and Lawlessness, and, offering sacrifice upon these altars, worshipped them
as his gods. Therefore in my opinion he met with a just
retribution both from gods and men: for as his life had been
spent in defiance to the laws of nature, his end was properly
also one of unnatural horror. All the other Aetolians who

age was not indeed yet so far advanced as to
make this necessary; but they thought that the kingdom
would gain a certain degree of firmness and a fresh impulse
towards prosperity, if it were known that the king had assumed
the independent direction of the government. They then made
the preparations for the ceremony with great splendour, and
carried it out in a manner worthy of the greatness of the
kingdom, Polycrates being considered to have contributed very
largely to the accomplishment of their efforts. For this man
had enjoyed even during his youth, in the reign of the late
king, a reputation second to no one in the court for fidelity
and practical ability; and this reputation he had maintained
during the present reign also. For having been entrusted with
the management of Cyprus and its revenues, when its affairs
were in a critical and complicate state, he not only preserved
the island for the young king, but collected a very considerable
sum of money, with which he had just arrived and had paid to the
king, after handing over the government of Cyprus to Ptolemy
of Megalopolis. But though he obtained great applause by
this, and a large fortune immediately afterwards, yet, as he
grew older, he drifted into extravagant debauchery and
scandalous indulgence. Nor was the reputation of Ptolemy,
son of Agesarchus very different in the later part of his life.
But in regard to these men, when we come to the proper time,
I shall not shrink from stating the circumstances which disgraced their official life. . . .

<p>Flamininus's imperium is extended for this year, because of the danger
from Antiochus and Nabis. The Aetolians, still discontented, push their
demand for Pharsalus and Leucas, and are referred by the Senate back to
Flamininus. The latter summons a conference of Greek states at Corinth,
and a war is decreed against Nabis, the Aetolians still expressing their dislike of Roman interference. The levies are collected; Argos is freed
from Nabis; Sparta all but taken; and Nabis forced to submit to most
humiliating terms: the Aetolians again objecting to his being allowed to
remain at Sparta on any terms at all. In this year also legates from
Antiochus visit Flamininus, but are referred to the Senate.</p></div3>

free the Asiatic Greek cities from him. Roman legates, P. Sulpicius, P.
Villius, P. Aelius, are sent to him. Hannibal arrives at the court of

and the Aetolians on the point of joining him. Therefore Baebius is
ordered to transport his army to Apollonia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nabis takes advantage of the alarm caused by Antiochus
to move. He besieges Gythium, and ravages the Achaean territory.
The league, under Philopoemen, proclaim war against him, and, after
losing an unimportant naval battle, decisively defeat him on land and shut
him up in Sparta.</p>
<p>The Aetolians now formally vote to call in Antiochus, "to liberate
Greece and arbitrate between them and Rome." They occupy Demetrias;
and kill Nabis by a stratagem. Whereupon Philopoemen annexes Sparta
to the Achaean league. Later in the year Antiochus meets the assembly
of the Aetolians at Lamia in Thessaly, is proclaimed "Strategus"; and
after a vain attempt to conciliate the Achaeans seizes Chalcis, where he
winters, and marries a young wife.</p></div3>

They had acquired great glory as well as great

by some means or another from that time forward they steadily diminished both the one
and the other under the leadership of Amaeocritus; and subsequently not only diminished them, but underwent a complete
change of character, and did all that was possible to wipe out
their previous reputation. For having been incited by the
Achaeans to go to war with the Aetolians, they adopted the
policy of the former and made an alliance with them, and
thenceforth maintained a steady war with the
Aetolians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-245">245</date>. See Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. Arat. 16"><title>Arat.</title> 16</bibl>.</note> But on the Aetolians invading

Achaeans, who had mustered their men and were on the
point of marching to their assistance, they attacked the
Aetolians; and being worsted in the battle were so completely
demoralised, that, from the time of that campaign, they never
plucked up spirit to claim any position of honour whatever,
and never shared in any enterprise or contest undertaken by
the common consent of the Greeks. They devoted themselves entirely to eating and drinking, and thus became effeminate in their souls as well as in their bodies.</p></div2>

the narrative seems to point rather to an alliance.</note> But on
the latter presently going to war with Philip's
father Demetrius, they once more abandoned
the Aetolians; and upon Demetrius entering
Boeotia with an army, without attempting resistance they
submitted completely to the Macedonians. But as a spark of
<pb n="254"/>
their ancestral glory still survived, there were found some
who disliked the existing settlement and the complete
subservience to Macedonia: and they accordingly maintained a violent opposition to the policy of Ascondas and
Neon, the ancestors of Brachylles, who were the
most prominent in the party which favoured
Macedonia. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The rise of the house of Neon.</note> However, the party of Ascondas
eventually prevailed, owing to the following circumstance. Antigonus (Doson), who, after the death of Demetrius, was Philip's
guardian, happened to be sailing on some business along the
coast of Boeotia; when off Larymna he was surprised by a
sudden ebb of the tide, and his ships were left high and dry.
Now just at that time a rumour had been spread that Antigonus meant to make a raid upon the country; and therefore
Neon, who was Hipparch at the time, was patrolling the
country at the head of all the Boeotian cavalry to protect it,
and came upon Antigonus in this helpless and embarrassed position: and having it thus in his power to inflict a serious blow
upon the Macedonians, much to their surprise he resolved to
spare them. His conduct in so doing was approved by the other
Boeotians, but was not at all pleasing to the Thebans. Antigonus, however, when the tide flowed again and his ships
floated, proceeded to complete the voyage to Asia on which
he was bound, with deep gratitude to Neon for having
abstained from attacking him in his awkward position. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-222">222</date>.</note>
Accordingly, when at a subsequent period
he conquered the Spartan Cleomenes and
became master of Lacedaemon, he left Brachylles in
charge of the town, by way of paying him for the kindness
done him by his father Neon. This proved to be the beginning of a great rise in importance of the family of Brachylles.
But this was not all that Antigonus did for him: from that
time forward either he personally, or king Philip, continually
supported him with money and influence; so that before long
this family entirely overpowered the political party opposed to
them in Thebes, and forced all the citizens, with very few exceptions, to join the party of Macedonia. Such was the origin
of the political adherence to Macedonia of the family of Neon,
and of its rise to prosperity.
<pb n="255"/></p></div2>
<div2 id="b20c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Disorganised State of Boeotia</head>
<p>But Boeotia as a nation had come to such a low pitch,
that for nearly twenty-five years the administration of justice had been suspended in private
and public suits alike. Their magistrates were
engaged in despatching bodies of men to guard the country
or in proclaiming national expeditions, and thus continually
postponed their attendance at courts of law. Some of the
Strategi also dispensed allowances to the needy from the public
treasury; whereby the common people learnt to support and
invest with office those who would help them to escape the
penalties of their crimes and undischarged liabilities, and to
be enriched from time to time with some portion of the public
property obtained by official favour. No one contributed to
this lamentable state of things more than Opheltas, who was
always inventing some plan calculated to benefit the masses for
the moment, while perfectly certain to ruin them in the future.
To these evils was added another unfortunate fashion. It
became the practice for those who died childless not to leave
their property to the members of their family, as had been
the custom of the country formerly, but to assign it for the
maintenance of feasts and convivial entertainments to be shared
in by the testator's friends in common; and even many who
did possess children left the larger part of their property to the
members of their own club. The result was that there were
many Boeotians who had more feasts to attend in the month
than there were days in it. The people of Megara therefore,
disliking this habit, and remembering their old connexion with
the Achaean league, were inclined once more to renew their
political alliance with it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antigonus Gonatas, <foreign lang="la">ob.</foreign> B. C. <date value="-239">239</date>.</note> For the Megarians had been

time of which we are now speaking, becoming
dissatisfied with the Boeotian constitution, they
again joined the Achaeans. The Boeotians, incensed at what
they considered acts of contempt, sallied out in full force to
attack Megara; and on the Megarians declining to listen to
<pb n="256"/>
them, they determined in their anger to besiege and assault
their city. But being attacked by a panic, on a report spreading that Philopoemen was at hand at the head of a force of
Achaeans, they left their scaling ladders against the walls
and fled back precipitately to their own country.</p></div2>

Aetolian Strategus, in view of the danger
threatening Aetolia, and seeing what would
happen to the other towns, determined to send
an embassy to Manius Acilius to demand a
truce and treaty of peace. With this purpose
he despatched Archidamus, Pantaleon and
Chalesus, who on meeting the Roman consul were intending
to enter upon a long argument, but were interrupted in the
middle of their speech and prevented from finishing it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Embassy of the Aetolians.</note> For
Acilius remarked that "For the present he had
no leisure to attend to them, being much engaged
with the distribution of the spoils of Heracleia:
he would, however, grant a ten days' truce and send Lucius
Valerius Flaccus with them, with instructions as to what he
was to say." The truce being thus made, and Valerius having
come to Hypata, a lengthened discussion took place on the
state of affairs. The Aetolians sought to establish their case
by referring to their previous services to Rome. But Valerius
cut this line of argument short by saying that "Such justification did not apply to the present circumstances; for as these
old friendly relations had been broken off by them, and the
existing hostility was owing entirely to the Aetolians themselves,
the services of the past could be of no assistance to them in
the present. They must therefore abandon all idea of justification, and adopt a tone of supplication, and beseech the consul's
pardon for their transgressions." After a long discussion on
various details, the Aetolians eventually decided to leave the
whole matter to Acilius, and commit themselves without reserve
to the good faith of the Romans. They had no comprehension
of what this really involved; but they were misled by the
word "faith" into supposing that the Romans would thereby
be more inclined to grant them terms. But with the Romans
for a man "to commit himself to their good faith" is held to
be equivalent to "surrendering unconditionally."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b20c10" type="chapter" n="10">
<head>The Aetolians Do Not Confirm the Terms</head>
<p>Having come to this resolution, Phaeneas despatched
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aetolian embassy to Acilius.</note>
legates with Valerius to announce the decision
of the Aetolians to Acilius. On being admitted
to the presence of the Consul, these legates, after
<pb n="258"/>
once more entering upon a plea of self-justification, ended by
announcing that the Aetolians had decided to commit themselves to the good faith of the Romans. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Roman terms.</note> Hereupon Acilius
interrupted them by saying, "Is this really the case, men of
Aetolia?" And upon their answering in the affirmative, he
said: "Well then, the first condition is that
none of you, individually or collectively, must
cross to Asia; the second is that you must surrender Menestratus the Epirote" (who happened at that time to be at
Naupactus, where he had come to the assistance of the
Aetolians), "and also King Amynander, with such of the
Athamanians as accompanied him in his desertion to your side."
Here Phaeneas interrupted him by saying: "But it is neither
just nor consonant with Greek customs, O Consul, to do what
you order." To which Acilius replied,&mdash;not so much because
he was angry, as because he wished to show him the dangerous
position in which he stood, and to thoroughly frighten him,&mdash;
"Do you still presume to talk to me about Greek customs,
and about honour and duty, after having committed yourselves to my good faith? Why, I might if I chose put
you all in chains and commit you to prison!" With these
words he ordered his men to bring a chain and an iron
collar and put it on the neck of each of them. Thereupon
Phaeneas and his companions stood in speechless amazement, as though bereft of all power of thought or motion, at
this unexpected turn of affairs. But Valerius and some
others who were present besought Acilius not to inflict any
severity upon the Aetolians then before him, as they were in
the position of ambassadors. And on his yielding to these
representations, Phaeneas broke silence by saying that "He and
the Apocleti were ready to obey the injunctions, but they must
consult the general assembly if they were to be confirmed."
Upon Acilius agreeing to this, he demanded a truce of ten days
to be granted. This also having been conceded, they departed
with these terms, and on arrival at Hypata told the Apocleti
what had been done and the speeches that had been made.
This report was the first thing which made their error, and the
compulsion under which they were placed, clear to the Aetolians.
It was therefore decided to write round to the various cities
<pb n="259"/>
and call the Aetolians together, to consult on the injunctions
imposed upon them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Aetolians fail to ratify the peace.</note> When the news of the
reception Phaeneas had met with was noised
abroad, the Aetolian people were so infuriated
that no one would even attend the meeting to discuss the matter
at all. It was thus impossible to hold the discussion. They
were further encouraged by the arrival of Nicander, who just
at that time sailed into Phalara, on the Malian gulf, from
Asia, bringing news of the warm reception given him by
Antiochus, and the promises for the future which the king had
made; they therefore became quite indifferent as to the noncompletion of the peace. Thus when the days of the truce had
elapsed the Aetolians found themselves still at war with Rome.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b20c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>The Fate of Nicander</head>
<p>But I ought not to omit to describe the subsequent career
and fate of Nicander. He arrived back at Phalara
on the twelfth day after leaving Ephesus, and
found the Romans still engaged in Heracleia, and
the Macedonians having already evacuated Lamia, but encamped
at no great distance from the town: he thereupon conveyed
his money unexpectedly into Lamia, and attempted himself to
make his way between the two camps into Hypata. But,
falling into the hands of the Macedonian pickets, he was
taken to Philip, while his evening party was still at the midst
of their entertainment, greatly alarmed lest he should meet
with rough treatment from having incurred Philip's resentment, or should be handed over to the Romans. But when
the matter was reported to the king, he at once gave orders
that the proper officers should offer Nicander refreshments, and
show him every politeness and attention. After a time he got
up from table and went personally to visit him; and after
enlarging at great length on "the folly of the Aetolians, for
having first brought the Romans into Greece, and afterwards
Antiochus," he still, even at this hour, urged that "they should
forget their past, adhere to their loyalty to himself, and not
show a disposition to take advantage of each other's difficulties."
He bade Nicander convey this message to the leaders of the
Aetolians, and exhorting him personally to remember the favours
which he had received at his hands, he despatched him with
a sufficient escort, which he ordered to see him safe into Hypata.
<pb n="260"/>
This result was far beyond Nicander's hopes or expectations.
He was restored in due course to his friends, and from the
moment of this adventure remained devoted to the royal
family of Macedonia. Thus, in the subsequent period of the
war with Perseus, the obligations which this favour had imposed
upon him caused him to offer such an unwilling and lukewarm opposition to the designs of Perseus, that he exposed
himself to suspicion and denunciation, and at last was summoned to Rome and died there. . . .</p></div2>

willing to address Philopoemen on this subject.
To men who for the most part undertake work for
what they can get by it there are plenty of people
to offer such rewards, and to regard them as the
means of founding and consolidating friendship:
but in the case of Philipoemen no one could be
found willing to convey this offer to him at all.
Finally, being completely at a loss, they elected
Timolaus to do it, as being his ancestral guest-friend and very
intimate with him. Timolaus twice journeyed to Megalopolis
for this express purpose, without daring to say a word to
Philopoemen about it. But having goaded himself to making
a third attempt, he at length plucked up courage to mention
the proposed gifts. Much to his surprise Philopoemen
received the suggestion with courtesy; and Timolaus was
overjoyed by the belief that he had attained his object.
Philopoemen, however, remarked that he would come to
Sparta himself in the course of the next few days; for he
wished to offer all the magistrates his thanks for this favour.
He accordingly came, and, being invited to attend the Senate, he
said: "He had long been aware of the kindness with which the
Lacedaemonians regarded him; but was more convinced than
ever by the compliments and extraordinary mark of honour
they now offered him. But while gratefully accepting their
intention, he disliked the particular manner of its exhibition.

business for the present, and cross to Asia: for he was well
aware that the ultimate object of the war and of the entire
expedition was not to reduce the Aetolian nation to obedience,
but to conquer Antiochus and take possession of Asia.
Therefore, directly the Athenians mentioned the pacification,
he accepted their suggestion with eagerness, and bade them
sound the Aetolians also. Accordingly, Echedemus and his
colleagues, having sent a preliminary deputation to Hypata,
presently followed in person, and entered into a discussion
with the Aetolian magistrates on the subject of
a pacification. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aetolian envoys visit the consuls.</note> They, too, readily acquiesced
in the suggestion, and certain envoys were appointed to meet the Romans. They found Publius and the army
encamped sixty stades from Amphissa, and there discoursed
at great length on their previous services to Rome. Publius
Scipio adopted in reply a still milder and more conciliatory
style, quoting his own conduct in Iberia and Libya, and
explaining how he had treated all who in those countries had
<pb n="264"/>
confided to his honour: and finally expressing an opinion that
they had better put themselves in his hands. At first, all who
were present felt very sanguine that the pacification was about
to be accomplished. But when, in answer to the Aetolian
demand to know on what terms they were to make the peace,
Lucius Scipio explained that they had two alternatives&mdash;to
submit their entire case unconditionally to the arbitrament of
Rome, or to pay a thousand talents down and to make an
offensive and defensive alliance with her&mdash;the Aetolians
present were thrown into the state of the most painful perplexity at the inconsistency of this announcement with the
previous talk: but finally they said that they would consult
the Aetolians on the terms imposed.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Truce With the Aetolians</head>
<p>On the return of the Aetolian envoys for the purpose of
consulting their countrymen, Echedemus and his colleagues
joined the council of the <foreign lang="la">apocleti</foreign> in their deliberations on
this subject. One of the alternatives was impossible owing to
the amount of money demanded, and the other was rendered
alarming in their eyes by the deception they had experienced
before, when, after submitting to the surrender,
they had narrowly escaped being thrown into
chains. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">See <ref target="b20c10" targOrder="U">bk. 20, ch. 10</ref>.</note> Being then much perplexed and quite unable to
decide, they sent the same envoys back to beg the Scipios that
they would either abate part of the money, so as to be within
their power to pay, or except from the surrender the persons
of citizens, men and women. But upon their arrival in the
Roman camp and delivering their message, Lucius Scipio merely
replied that "The only terms on which he was commissioned
by the Senate to treat were those which he had recently
stated." They therefore returned once more, and were followed
by Echedemus and his colleagues to Hypata, who advised the
Aetolians that "Since there was at present a hitch in the
negotiations for peace, they should ask for a truce; and,
having thus at least delayed the evils threatening them, should
send an embassy to the Senate. If they obtained their
request, all would be well; but, if they did not, they must trust
to the chapter of accidents: for their position could not be
worse than it was now, but for many reasons might not impossibly be better." The advice of Echedemus was thought
<pb n="265"/>
sound, and the Aetolians accordingly voted to send envoys
to obtain a truce; who, upon reaching Lucius
Scipio, begged that for the present a truce
of six months might be granted them, that
they might send an embassy to the Senate. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A six months' truce with the Aetolians.</note> Publius Scipio,
who had for some time past been anxious to begin the

to Lucius Scipio, and returned with his military tribunes to

<p>King Antiochus had already penetrated into the territory of Pergamum; but when he heard that
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antiochus proposes peace with Rome, Eumenes, and Rhodes.</note>
king Eumenes was close at hand, and saw that
the land forces as well as the fleet were ready
to attack him, he began to consider the propriety of proposing a pacification with the Romans, Eumenes,
and the Rhodians at once. He therefore removed with his
whole army to Elaea, and having seized a hill facing that
town, he encamped his infantry upon it, while he entrenched
his cavalry, amounting to over six thousand, close under the
walls of the town. He took up his own position between these
two, and proceeded to send messengers to Lucius Aemilius
in the town, proposing a peace. The Roman imperator
thereupon called Eumenes and the Rhodians to a meeting,
and desired them to give their opinions on the proposal.
Eudemus and Pamphilidas were not averse to making terms;
but the king said that "To make peace at the present
moment was neither honourable nor possible. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Eumenes opposes the peace, on the grounds of honour and prudence.</note>
How could it be an honourable conclusion of
the war that they should make terms while
confined within the walls of a town? And
how was it possible to give validity to those
terms without waiting for the Consul and obtaining his
consent? Besides, even if they did give any indication of
coming to an agreement with Antiochus, neither the naval nor
military forces could of course return home until the Senate
and people had ratified the terms of it. All that would be
left for them to do would be to spend the winter where they
were, waiting idly for the decision from home, doing nothing,
and exhausting the wealth and resources of their allies. And
then, if the Senate withheld its approval of the terms, they
would have to begin the war all over again, having let the
opportunity pass, which, with God's help, would have enabled
them to put a period to the whole war." Such was the speech
<pb n="268"/>
of king Eumenes. Lucius Aemilius accepted the advice, and
answered the envoys of Antiochus that the peace could not
possibly be made until the Proconsul arrived. On hearing
this Antiochus immediately began devastating the territory of
Elaea; and subsequently, while Seleucus remained in occupation of that district, Antiochus continued his march through
the country as far as the plain of Thebe, and having there
entered upon an exceedingly fertile and wealthy district, he
gorged his army with spoil of every description. . . .</p></div2>

<head>Prusias Refuses To Help Antiochus</head>
<p>On his arrival at Sardis after this expedition, Antiochus
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Prusias, king of Bithynia.</note>
at once sent to Prusias to urge him to an alliance.
Now in former times Prusias had by no means
been disinclined to join Antiochus, because he
was much alarmed lest the Romans should cross over to Asia
for the purpose of putting down all crowned heads. But the
perusal of a letter received from Lucius and Publius Scipio
had served to a great extent to relieve his anxiety, and give
him a tolerably correct forecast of the result of the war. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Letter of the Scipios to Prusias.</note> For
the Scipios had put the case with great clearness
in their letter, and had supported their assertions
by numerous proofs. They entered not only
upon a defence of the policy adopted by themselves, but of that
also of the Roman people generally; by which they showed
that, so far from depriving any of the existing kings of their
sovereignties, they had themselves been the authors in some
cases of their establishment, in others of the extension of their
powers and the large increase of their dominions. To prove this
they quoted the instances of Andobales and Colichas in Iberia,
of Massanissa in Libya, and of Pleuratus in Illyria, all of whom
they said they had raised from petty and insignificant princes
to the position of undisputed royalty. They further mentioned
the cases of Philip and Nabis in Greece. As to Philip, they had
conquered him in war and reduced him to the necessity of
giving hostages and paying tribute: yet, after receiving a slight
proof of his good disposition, they had restored his son and
the young men who were hostages with him, had remitted the
tribute, and given him back several of the towns that had been
taken in the course of war. While as for Nabis, though they
might have utterly destroyed him, they had not done so, but
<pb n="269"/>
had spared him, tyrant as he was, on receiving the usual
security for his good faith. With these facts before his eyes
they urged Prusias in their letter not to be in any fear for his
kingdom, but to adopt the Roman alliance without misgiving,
for he would never have reason to regret his choice. This
letter worked an entire change in the feelings of Prusias; and
when, besides, Caius Livius and the other legates arrived at his
court, after conversation with them, he entirely relinquished
all ideas of looking for support from Antiochus. Foiled,
therefore, of hope in this quarter, Antiochus retired to Ephesus:
and being convinced on reflection that the only way of preventing the transport of the enemy's army, and in fact of
repelling an invasion of Asia at all, was to keep
a firm mastery of the sea, he determined to
fight a naval battle and leave the issue of the
struggle to be decided by his success in that. . . .</p></div2>

<p>After sustaining this defeat at sea, Antiochus remained

in Sardis, neglecting to avail himself of such
opportunities as he had left, and taking no
steps whatever to prosecute the war; and when
he learnt that the enemy had crossed into
Asia he lost all heart, and determined in despair
to send an envoy to Lucius and Publius Scipio
to treat of peace. He selected Heracleides of Byzantium for
this purpose, and despatched him with instructions to offer to
surrender the territories of Lampsacus and Smyrna as well as
Alexandria (Troas), which were the original cause of the war,
and any other cities in Aeolis and Ionia of which they might
wish to deprive him, as having embraced their side in the
war; and in addition to this to promise an indemnity of half
the expenses they had incurred in their quarrel with him. Such
were the offers which the envoy was instructed to make in his
<pb n="270"/>
public audience; but, besides these, there were others to be
committed to Publius Scipio's private ear, of which I will speak
in detail later on. On his arrival at the Hellespont the envoy
found the Romans still occupying the camp which they had
constructed immediately after crossing. At first he was much
cheered by this fact, for he thought it would materially aid his
negotiation that the enemy were exactly where they were at
first, and had not as yet taken any further action. But when
he learnt that Publius Scipio was still on the other side of the
water he was much disturbed, because the turn which his
negotiations were to take depended principally on Scipio's view
of the matter. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The laws relating to the Salii or priests of Mars.</note> The reason of the army being still in their
first camp, and of Publius Scipio's absence
from the army, was that he was one of the Salii.
These are, as I have before stated, one of the
three colleges of priests by whom the most important sacrifices
to the gods are offered at Rome. And it is the law that, at
the time of these sacrifices, they must not quit the spot for
thirty days in which it happens to find them.<note anchored="yes"><cit><quote lang="la">Dies forte, quibus Ancilia moventur,

been very far out.</note> This was the
case at the present time with Publius Scipio; for just as the
army was on the point of crossing this season arrived, and
prevented him from changing his place of abode. Thus it
came about that he was separated from the legions and remained in Europe, while, though the army crossed, it remained
encamped, and could take no further step, because they were
waiting for him.</p></div2>

<p>However, Publius arrived a few days afterwards, and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Heracleides.</note>
Heracleides being summoned to attend the
Council, delivered the message with which
he was charged, announcing that Antiochus
abandoned Lampsacus, Smyrna, and Alexandria; and also all
such towns in Aeolis and Ionia as had sided with Rome; and
that he offered, further, an indemnity of half their expenses in
the present war. He added many arguments besides, urging
the Romans "Not to tempt fortune too far, as they were but
<pb n="271"/>
men; nor to extend their empire indefinitely, but rather to keep
it within limits, if possible those of Europe,&mdash;for even then
they would have an enormous and unprecedented dominion,
such as no nation before them had attained;&mdash;but if they were
determined at all hazards to grasp parts of Asia also, let them
say definitely what parts those were, for the king would go to
the utmost stretch of his power to meet their wishes." After
the delivery of this speech the council decided that the
Consul should answer that "It was only fair
that Antiochus should pay, not the half, but
the whole expense of the war, seeing that he,
and not they, had originally begun it; and as to the cities, he
must not only liberate those in Aeolis and Ionia, but must
surrender his whole dominion on this side of Mount Taurus."
On receiving this answer from the council, conveying demands which went far beyond his instructions, the envoy,
without answering a word, abstained from a public audience
thenceforth, but exerted himself to conciliate Publius Scipio.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Consul's answer.</note></p></div2>

<head>Scipio Scorns Antiochus's Secret Proposal</head>
<p>Having at length got a suitable opportunity, he disclosed
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The secret offers of Antiochus to Publius Scipio.</note>
to him the offers with which he was charged.
These were that the king would first restore his

prisoner in the early part of the war; and was prepared, secondly,
to pay him any sum of money he might name, and thenceforth
share with him the wealth of his kingdom, if he would
only support the acceptance of the terms offered by the king.
Publius replied that the promise as to his son
he accepted, and would feel under an obligation
to the king if he fulfilled it; but as to the rest he assured him
that the king, among his other delusions, was under a complete
mistake as to the course demanded by his own interests.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's reply.</note>
"For if he had made these offers while still master of Lysimacheia and the entrance into the Chersonese, he would at once
have got what he asked: and so too, even after evacuating
these places, if he had appeared with his army at the Hellespont and shown that he meant to prevent our crossing, and
then had sent his envoys, he might even thus have obtained
his demands. But when he comes with his proposals of
equitable terms, after allowing our troops to set foot in Asia,
<pb n="272"/>
and having so not only submitted to the bridle, but allowed
the rider to mount, he must expect to fail and be disappointed
of his hopes. Therefore, I advise him to adopt wiser measures,
and look at the facts in their true light. In return for his
promise in regard to my son, I will give him a hint which is well
worth the favour he offers me: make any concession, do anything, rather than fight with the Romans." With this answer
Heracleides returned and told the king everything. And
Antiochus, considering that no severer terms could be imposed
on him if he were beaten in the field, abandoned all idea of
negotiation, and began making preparations of all sorts and in
every direction for the battle. . . .</p>

safe conduct should be given them. This was granted and the
herald returned; and some days after, Zeuxis, formerly Satrap
of Lydia, and Antipater, his nephew, came as ambassadors

Eumenes, because they feared that his old quarrel would cause
him to be only too ready to do them a bad turn. But when
they found him, contrary to their expectation, disposed to
moderate and gentle methods, they at once addressed themselves to meeting the council. Being summoned to attend it
they made a lengthy speech, among other things exhorting the
Romans to use their victory with mildness and generosity;
and alleging that such a course was still more to the interest
of the Romans than of Antiochus, since Fortune had committed to them the empire and lordship of the world. Finally,
they asked "What they were to do to obtain peace and the
friendship of Rome?" The members of the council had

evacuate Europe and all Asia this side Taurus: must pay the
Romans fifteen thousand Euboic talents as an indemnity for
the expenses of the war, five hundred at once, two thousand
five hundred on the ratification of the treaty by the people,
and the rest in twelve yearly instalments of a thousand talents.
Further, Antiochus must pay Eumenes the four hundred
talents owing to him, and the balance of the corn due in
accordance with the treaty made with his father Attalus. He
must at the same time deliver Hannibal the Carthaginian,
Thoas the Aetolian, Mnasilochus the Acarnanian, and Philo
and Eubulides the Chalcidians. As security for the fulfilment
of these terms, Antiochus must at once give twenty hostages
named in the treaty." Such was the decision
announced by Publius Scipio in the name of
the whole Council. Antipater and Zeuxis having
expressed their consent to them, it was agreed
by all to send envoys to Rome to appeal to the Senate and
people to confirm the treaty. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The terms are accepted, and missions sent to Rome.</note> The ambassadors of Antiochus

When the time for the audiences came, they first
called in the king and bade him say freely what
he wished to obtain at the hands of the Senate.
But Eumenes at first evaded the task by saying:
"If I had been desirous of obtaining any favour from others,
I should have looked to the Romans for advice, that I might
neither desire anything that was wrong nor ask anything unfair;
but seeing that I am here to prefer my request to the Romans
themselves, I think it better to leave the interests of myself and
my brothers unreservedly in their hands." And though one
of the Senators rose and begged him to have no apprehension,
but to speak his mind, he still adhered to this view. And so
after a certain time had elapsed the king withdrew; and the
Senate, remaining in the curia, debated what was to be done.
Eventually it was decreed to call upon Eumenes to declare
with his own mouth the objects of his visit without reserve,
on the ground that he knew best what his own kingdom required,
and what was the state of things in Asia. He was then called
in; and, one of the Senators having informed him of the vote,
he was compelled to speak on the business.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c19" type="chapter" n="19">
<head>King Eumenes In the Senate</head>
<p>He said therefore that "He would not say another
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Eumenes.</note>
word on his own concerns, but would adhere
strictly to his resolution of leaving the decision
as to them entirely in the hands of the Romans.
But there was one subject on which he felt anxiety, namely,
the policy of Rhodes; and it was this that induced him to
address the Senate on the present occasion. These Rhodians
had come to Rome to further the interests of their own
country, and their own prosperity, quite as much as he had
come to promote those of his own kingdom at that moment;
<pb n="275"/>
but their professions were entirely at variance with their real
purpose. And it was easy to satisfy one's self of this: for, when
they enter the Senate house, they will say that they come
neither to ask anything for themselves nor to thwart Eumenes
in any way whatever; but are ambassadors for the liberty of
the Greek inhabitants of Asia. 'To secure this,' they will say,
'is not so much a favour to themselves as an act incumbent
on the Romans, and in consonance with their former achievements.' Such will be their specious professions; but the real
truth of the case will be wholly different. For if these cities
are once set free, the result will be that their dominion will
be many times increased, while his own would be in a manner
entirely broken up. For the attractive name of liberty and
autonomy would draw from his rule not only the cities to be
freed at present, but those also which had been under his rule
from of old, directly it is made apparent that the Senate has
adopted that policy, and would add them to the dominion of
Rhodes. That was the natural course for things to take.
Imagining that they owed their freedom to Rhodes, those
cities would become in name its allies, but in reality entirely
subservient, owing to the heavy obligation under which they will
find themselves. He begged the Senators, therefore, to be on
their guard on that point: lest they should find that they had
unwittingly aggrandised one friendly nation too much, and disproportionately weakened another; or even that they were
benefiting men who had once been their foes, to the neglect
and contempt of their genuine friends."</p></div2>

<p>"For myself," he continued, "though in every other
point I would yield, if it were necessary, to my neighbours,
yet in the matter of your friendship and of my goodwill
towards you I will never, if I can help it, yield to any one alive.
And I think that my father, if he had been living, would have
said the same: for as he was the first to become your friend
and ally, so of all the inhabitants of Asia and Greece he was the
most nobly loyal to you to the last day of his life, not only in
heart but in deed. For he took his part in all your wars in
Greece, and furnished the largest contingents of men and
ships of all your allies; contributed the largest share of supplies; and faced the most serious dangers: and to sum up all,
<pb n="276"/>
ended his life actually engaged in the war with Philip, while
employed in urging the Boeotians to join your alliance. I,
too, when I succeeded to his kingdom, while fully maintaining
my father's views, for it was impossible to do more, have yet
gone even beyond him in actual achievements: for the state
of the times brought me to a more fiery test than they did
him. Antiochus offered me his daughter and a share in his
whole kingdom: offered me immediate restoration of all the
cities that had been before wrested from me: and finally
promised me any price I chose if I would join him in his
war with you. But so far from accepting any one of these
offers, I joined you in your struggle against Antiochus with
the largest military and naval contingents of any of your allies;
contributed the largest share of supplies at the time of your
utmost need; and exposed myself unreservedly to every
danger along with your generals. Finally, I submitted to
being invested in Pergamos itself, and risked my life as well
as my crown in my loyalty to your people.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c21" type="chapter" n="21">
<head>Conclusion of Eumenes' Speech</head>
<p>"Therefore, men of Rome, as many of you have been
eye-witnesses of the truth of my words, and all of you know it,
it is but just that you should have a corresponding regard for
my interests. You have made Massanissa king of the greater
part of Libya, though he had once been your enemy and at
last deserted to your side accompanied only by a few horsemen, only because he kept faith with you in one war: you
have raised Pleuratus to the first position among the princes
of Illyria, though he had done absolutely nothing for you
beyond keeping loyal; it would be the height of inconsistency
if you should neglect me and my family, who from generation to
generation have co-operated in your most important and glorious
undertakings. What is it, then, that I am asking you to do, and
what do I claim at your hands? I will tell you openly, since
you have called upon me to speak my mind to you. If you
decide, then, to continue holding certain parts of Asia which
are on this side Taurus, and were formerly subject to Antiochus,
that is what I should wish to see best of all: for I consider
that the security of my realm would best be secured by having
you for neighbours, and especially by my sharing in your
prestige. But if you decide not to do this, but to evacuate
<pb n="277"/>
Asia entirely, there is no one to whom you may with greater
justice surrender the prizes you have won in the field than to
me. But it may be said, it is a more honourable thing still
to set the enslaved free. Yes! if they had not ventured to
join Antiochus in the war against you. But since they had
the hardihood to do so, it is a much more honourable course
to make a proper return to your sincere friends, than to
benefit those who have shown themselves your enemies."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c22" type="chapter" n="22">
<head>The Rhodians Address the Senate</head>
<p>After the delivery of this effective speech Eumenes
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The legates from Smyrna.</note>
retired. The Senate received both the king himself and the
speech with every mark of favour, and were enthusiastic for
doing everything in their power to gratify him.
They wished to call in the Rhodians next after
him; but one of the Rhodian ambassadors not
being there in time, they called in those from Smyrna, who
delivered a long disquisition on the goodwill and zeal which
they had displayed towards Rome during the late war. But
as there are no two opinions about the fact of their having
been, of all the autonomous states in Asia, the most strenuous
in the cause, I do not think it necessary to set forth their
speech in detail.</p>
<p>But next to them came in the Rhodians: who, after a short<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of the Rhodians.</note>
preamble as to their services to the Romans,
quickly came to the discussion of the position
of their own country. They said that "It was
a very great embarrassment to them, in the discharge of their
ambassadorial duties, to find themselves placed by the necessities
of the case in opposition to a sovereign with whom their
public and private relations were of the most friendly description. It was the opinion of their countrymen that the most
honourable course, and the one which above all others would
redound to the credit of Rome, was, that the Greeks in Asia
should be set free, and should recover that possession dearest
to all mankind&mdash;autonomy: but this was the last thing to suit
Eumenes and his brothers. It was the nature of monarchy
to hate equality, and to endeavour to have everybody, or at
least as many as possible, subject and obedient. But though
that was the case now, still they felt convinced that they should
gain their object, not because they had greater influence with
<pb n="278"/>
the Romans than Eumenes, but because they would be shown
to be suggesting a course more just in itself and more indisputably advantageous to all concerned. If, indeed, the
only way the Romans could requite Eumenes was by handing
over to him the autonomous towns, they might reasonably be
at a loss to determine what to do; for they would have had
to decide between neglecting a sincere friend and disregarding their own honour and duty, and thus entirely obscuring
and degrading the glory of their great achievements. But if,
on the other hand, it were possible adequately to consult for
both these objects at the same time, who could doubt about
the matter any longer? Yet the fact was that, as in a costly
banquet, there was enough and to spare for all. Lycaonia,
Phrygia on the Hellespont, and Pisidia, the Chersonese also
and the districts bordering on it, were at the disposal of the
Romans to give to whom they chose; only a few of which
added to the kingdom of Eumenes would double its present
extent, while if all, or even the great part were assigned to him,
it would become second to that of no other prince in Asia.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c23" type="chapter" n="23">
<head>Conclusion of the Rhodians' Speech</head>
<p>"It was therefore in the power of the Romans to
strengthen their friends very materially without destroying the
glory of their own policy. For the end which they proposed to themselves in their war was not the same as that of
other nations, but widely different. The rest of the world all
entered upon war with the view of conquering and seizing
cities, wealth, or ships: but heaven had ordained that they
should want none of these things, by having put everything
in the whole world under their rule. What was it, then, that
they had still occasion to wish for, and to take the securest
means to obtain? Plainly praise and glory among mankind;
which it was difficult indeed to gain, but most difficult of
all to preserve when gained. Their war with Philip might
show them their meaning. That war they had, as they
professed, undertaken with the sole object of liberating
Greece; and that was in fact the only prize they gained in it,
and no other whatever: yet the glory they got by it was
greater than that which the tribute of the Carthaginians had
brought them. And justly so: for money is a possession
common to all mankind, but honour and praise and glory are
<pb n="279"/>
attributes of the gods and of those men who approach nearest
to them. Therefore, the most glorious of all their achievements was the liberation of Greece;
and if they now completed that work their fame would receive its consummation:
but if they neglected to do so, even what they had already
accomplished would lose its lustre." They finally wound up
by saying, "As for us, gentlemen, having once deliberately
adopted this policy and joined with you in the severest battles
and in genuine dangers, we do not now propose to abandon the
part of friends; but have not hesitated to say openly what we
believe to be for your honour and your interests alike, with no
ulterior design whatever, and with a single eye to our duty as
the highest earthly object."</p></div2>

<head>The Decision of the Senate</head>
<p>This speech of the Rhodians was universally regarded
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Treaty with Antiochus confirmed.</note>
as temperate and fair. The Senate next
caused Antipater and Zeuxis, the ambassadors of Antiochus, to be introduced: and
on their speaking in a tone of entreaty and supplication,
an approval of the agreement made by him with Scipio in
Asia was voted. A few days later the people also ratified it,
and oaths were accordingly interchanged with Antipater and
his colleague. This done, the other ambassadors from Asia
were introduced into the Senate: but a very brief hearing was
given to each, and the same answer was returned to all; namely,
that ten commissioners would be sent to decide on all points
of dispute between the cities.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Settlement of Asia, B. C. <date value="-189">189</date>.</note>The Senate
then appointed ten commissioners, to whom
they gave the entire settlement of particulars;
while as a general principle they decided that of Asia
this side Taurus such inhabitants as had been subject to
Antiochus were to be assigned to Eumenes, except Lycia and
Caria up to the Maeander, which were to belong to the
Rhodians; while of the Greek cities, such of them as had
been accustomed to pay tribute to Attalus were to pay the
same to Eumenes; and only those who had done so to
Antiochus were to be relieved of tribute altogether. Having
given the ten commissioners these outlines of the general
settlement, they sent them out to join the consul, Cnaeus
Manlius Vulso, in Asia.
<pb n="280"/></p>
<p>After these arrangements had been completed, the Rhodian<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Soli in Cilicia.</note>
envoys came to the Senate again with a request
in regard to Soli in Cilicia, alleging that they
were called upon by ties of kindred to think of the interests
of that city; for the people of Soli were, like the Rhodians,
colonists from Argos. Having listened to what they had to
say, the Senate invited the attendance of the ambassadors
from Antiochus, and at first were inclined to order Antiochus
to evacuate the whole of Cilicia; but upon these ambassadors
resisting this order, on the ground of its being contrary to the
treaty, they once more discussed the case of Soli by itself.
The king's ambassadors still vehemently maintaining their
rights, the Senate dismissed them and called in the Rhodians.
Having informed them of the opposition raised by Antipater,
they added that they were ready to go any length in the
matter, if the Rhodians, on a review of the whole case, determined to push their claim. The Rhodian envoys, however,
were much gratified by the spirit shown by the Senate, and
said that they would ask nothing more.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Summer B. C. <date value="-189">189</date>.</note>This question, therefore, was left as it was; and just as the ten commissioners

Asia, for they were still in the neighbourhood

secured his recall by the help of the Aetolians, but chiefly to
entreat that he might be received again into the Roman

good opportunity of once more annexing Amphilochia and
Aperantia, determined on an expedition against those countries; and when Nicander their Strategus had mustered the
league army, they invaded Amphilochia. Finding most of the
people willing to join them, they advanced into Aperantia;
and the Aperantians also willingly yielding to them, they continued their expedition into Dolopia. The Dolopians for a
time made a show of resistance, and of keeping loyal to,
Philip; but on considering what had happened to the Athamanes, and the check which Philip had received there, they
quickly changed their minds and gave in their adhesion to
the Aetolians. After this successful issue of his expedition
Nicander led his army home, believing that Aetolia was
secured by the subjection of these tribes and places, against
the possibility of any one injuring its territory. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Late autumn of B. C. <date value="-190">190</date>.</note> But immediately after these events, and when the Aetolians were

a state of complete despair; and not knowing
how to meet the danger which was impending over them,
they resolved to send to Rhodes and Athens, begging them to
despatch envoys to Rome to intercede in their behalf, and, by
softening the anger of the Romans, to find some means of
averting the evils that threatened Aetolia. They also sent
ambassadors of their own to Rome once more, Alexander,
Isius, and Phaeneas, accompanied by Callippus of Ambracia
and Lycopus.</p></div2>

<head>Fulvius Aims to Fight at Ambracia</head>
<p>Some envoys from Epirus having visited the Roman
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">M. Fulvius Nobilior at Apollonia.</note>
Consul, he consulted with them as to the best
way of attacking the Aetolians. They advised
that he should begin by attacking Ambracia,
which was at that time a member of the Aetolian league. They
gave as their reasons that, if the Aetolians ventured to give
<pb n="282"/>
battle, the neighbourhood of Ambracia was very favourable for
the legions to fight in; and that if, on the other hand, the
Aetolians avoided an engagement, the town was an excellent one
to besiege; for the district round it would supply abundant timber
for the construction of siege artillery; and the river Arachthus,
which flowed right under the walls, would be of great use in conveying supplies to the army in the summer season, and serve
as a protection to their works. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fulvius advances upon Ambracia.</note> Fulvius thought
the advice good, and accordingly marched
through Epirus to attack Ambracia. On his
arrival there, as the Aetolians did not venture to meet him,
he reconnoitred the city, and set vigorously to work on the
siege. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Aetolian envoys intercepted.</note> Meanwhile the Aetolian envoys that
had been sent to Rome were caught off
Cephallenia by Sibyrtus, son of Petraeus, and
brought into Charadrus. The Epirotes first resolved to place
these men at Buchetus and keep them under strict guard.
But a few days afterwards they demanded a ransom of them
on the ground that they were at war with the Aetolians. It
happened that one of them, Alexander, was the richest man
in Greece, while the others were badly off, and far inferior to
Alexander in the amount of their property. At first the
Epirotes demanded five talents from each. The others did
not absolutely refuse this, but were willing to pay if they
could, because they cared above everything to secure their
own safety. But Alexander refused to consent, for it seemed
a large sum of money, and he lay awake at night bewailing
himself at the idea of being obliged to pay five talents. The
Epirotes, however, foresaw what would happen, and were
extremely alarmed lest the Romans should hear that they had
detained men who were on a mission to themselves, and
should send a despatch ordering their release; they, therefore,
lowered their demand to three talents a-piece. The others
gladly accepted the offer, gave security, and departed: but
Alexander said that he would not pay more than a talent, and
that was too much; and at last, giving up all thought of saving
himself, remained in custody, though he was an old man, and
possessed property worth more than two hundred talents;
and I think he would have died rather than pay the three
<pb n="283"/>
talents. So extraordinarily strong in some men is the passion
for accumulating money. But on this occasion Fortune so
favoured his greed, that the result secured all men's praise and
approval for his infatuation. For, a few days afterwards, a
despatch arrived from Rome ordering the release of the
ambassadors; and, accordingly, he was the only one of them
that was set free without ransom. When the Aetolians learnt
what had happened to him, they elected Damoteles as their
ambassador to Rome; who, however, when as far as Leucas
on his voyage, was informed that Marcus Fulvius was marching through Epirus upon Ambracia, and, therefore, gave up
the mission as useless, and returned back to Aetolia. . . .</p></div2>

<p>The Aetolians being besieged by the consul Marcus

Fulvius, offered a gallant resistance to the assault of the siege
artillery and battering rams. Marcus having
first strongly secured his camp began the siege
on an extensive scale; he opened three separate
parallel works across the plain against the
Pyrrheium, and a fourth opposite the temple of Asclepius, and
a fifth directed against the Acropolis. And the attack being
pushed on energetically at all these points at once, the besieged
became terribly alarmed at the prospect before them. Still, as
the rams vigorously battered the walls, and the long poles with
their iron sickles tore off the battlements, they tried to invent
machines to baffle them, letting down huge masses of lead and
stones and oak logs by means of levers upon the battering
rams; and putting iron hooks upon the sickles and hauling
them inside the walls, so that the poles to which they were
fastened broke against the battlements, and the sickles fell into
their hands. Moreover they made frequent sallies, in which
they fought with great courage: sometimes making a descent
by night upon the pickets quartered at the works, and at others
attacking in broad daylight the day-parties of the besiegers:
and by these means they managed to protract the siege. . . .</p>
<p>Nicander was outside the city, and sent five hundred horse
into it. They carried the intervening entrenchment of the
enemy and forced their way into the town. With these he
had fixed on a day on which they were to sally out, and he was
to be ready to support them. They accordingly made the sally
<pb n="284"/>
with great courage and fought gallantly; but either from fear of
the danger, or because he conceived that what he was engaged
upon at the time could not be neglected, Nicander failed to
come up to time, and accordingly the attempt failed. . . .<note anchored="yes">The text of this fragment is much dislocated.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c28" type="chapter" n="28">
<head>Smoking Out the Enemy</head>
<p>By assiduously working the battering rams the Romans
were always breaking down this or that part of the wall. But
yet they could not succeed in storming any of these breaches,
because the besieged were energetic in raising counter walls,
and the Aetolians fought with determined gallantry on the
debris. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans begin mining operations.</note> They, therefore, in despair had recourse to mines and
underground tunnels. Having safely secured
the central one of their three works, and carefully
concealed the shaft with wattle screens, they
erected in front of it a covered walk or stoa about two hundred
feet long, parallel with the wall; and beginning their digging
from that, they carried it on unceasingly day and night, working
in relays. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Counter-mines by the besieged.</note> For a considerable number of days the besieged
did not discover them carrying the earth away through the
shaft; but when the heap of earth thus brought out became
too high to be concealed from those inside the
city, the commanders of the besieged garrison
set to work vigorously digging a trench inside,
parallel to the wall and to the stoa which faced the towers.
When the trench was made to the required depth, they next placed
in a row along the side of the trench nearest the wall a number
of brazen vessels made very thin; and, as they walked along the
bottom of the trench past these, they listened for the noise of
the digging outside. Having marked the spot indicated by
any of these brazen vessels, which were extraordinarily sensitive
and vibrated to the sound outside, they began digging from
within, at right angles to the trench, another underground
tunnel leading under the wall, so calculated as to exactly hit
the enemy's tunnel. This was soon accomplished, for the
Romans had not only brought their mine up to the wall, but
had under-pinned a considerable length of it on either side of
their mine; and thus the two parties found themselves face to
face. At first they conducted this underground fighting with
their spears: but as neither side could do much good, because
<pb n="285"/>
both parties protected themselves with shields and wattles,
some one suggested another plan to the defenders. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans smoked out.</note> Putting in
front of them an earthenware jar, made to the width of the
mine, they bored a hole in its bottom, and, inserting an iron funnel of the same length as the
depth of the vessel, they filled the jar itself with
fine feathers, and putting a little fire in it close to the mouth
of the jar, they clapped on an iron lid pierced full of holes.
They carried this without accident through the mine with its
mouth towards the enemy. When they got near the besiegers
they stopped up the space all round the rim of the jar, leaving
only two holes on each side through which they thrust spears
to prevent the enemy coming near the jar. They then took a
pair of bellows such as blacksmiths use, and, having attached
them to the orifice of the funnel, they vigorously blew up the
fire placed on the feathers near the mouth of the jar, continually withdrawing the funnel in proportion as the feathers
became ignited lower down. The plan was successfully executed; the volume of smoke created was very great, and, from
the peculiar nature of feathers, exceedingly pungent, and was
all carried into the faces of the enemy. The Romans, therefore, found themselves in a very distressing and embarrassing
position, as they could neither stop nor endure the smoke in
the mines.<note anchored="yes">Smoking out an enemy in a mine was one of the regular man&oelig;uvres.
See Aen. Tact. 37. It was perhaps suggested by the illegal means taken by
workmen in the silver mines to annoy a rival; for we find an Athenian law
directed against it. See Demosth. <bibl n="Dem. 37.36"><title>in Pantaen.</title> &sect; 36</bibl>.</note> The siege being thus still further protracted the

<head>Athens, Rhodes, and Athamania Intercede</head>
<p>About this time the ambassadors from Athens and

Rhodes came to the Roman camp for the purpose of furthering, if they could, the conclusion
of a peace. The Athamanian king, Amynandrus, also arrived, very eager to relieve the
Ambraciots from their miserable position, and having received
a safe conduct from Marcus Fulvius in consideration of the
urgent nature of the business: For he had a very friendly
feeling towards the Ambraciots, from having passed most of the

time of his exile in that town.<note anchored="yes">Nothing seems to be known of this exile of Fulvius, who had been

against him.</note> A few days afterwards also
some Acarnanians arrived, bringing Damoteles and his fellow
envoys. For Marcus Fulvius, having been informed of their
misfortunes, had written to the people of Thyreum to bring the
men to him. All these various persons, therefore, having
assembled, the negotiations for peace were pushed on energetically. For his part, Amynandrus was urgent in his advice to
the Ambraciots to save themselves from the destruction which
would not be long in coming to them unless they adopted
wiser counsels. On his coming again and again up to the wall
and conversing with them on this subject, the Ambraciots
decided to invite him inside the town. The consul having
given the king leave to enter the walls, he went in and discussed
the situation with the inhabitants. Meanwhile the Athenian
and Rhodian envoys got hold oof the consul and tried by ingenious arguments
to mollify his anger. Some one also suggested to Damoteles and Phaeneas to apply to Caius Valerius and
endeavour to win him over. He was the son of that Marcus
Valerius Laevinus who made the first alliance with the Aetolians;
and half brother, by the mother's side, of the consul Marcus
Fulvius, and being a young man of vigorous character enjoyed
the greatest confidence of the consul. Being appealed to by
Damoteles, and thinking that in a way he had a family interest
in the matter, and was bound to undertake the patronage of
the Aetolians, he exerted himself with the greatest zeal and
enthusiasm to rescue that people from their perilous position.
The matter then being vigorously pushed forward on all sides at
once was at length accomplished. For the Ambraciots, by the
persuasion of the king, surrendered to the consul unreservedly
as far as they themselves were concerned, and gave up the
town, on the one condition that the Aetolian garrison should
march out under truce. This primary exception they made
that they might keep faith with their allies.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c30" type="chapter" n="30">
<head>End of the Aetolian War</head>
<p>So the consul agreed to grant the Aetolians peace on

three hundred in six yearly instalments of fifty: of the
restoration to the Romans of all prisoners and

<p>Such was the sketch in outline of the main points of the treaty.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Aetolian people confirm the treaty.</note>
But it required first the consent of the Aetolians,
and then to be referred to Rome: and meanwhile
the Athenian and Rhodian envoys remained
where they were, waiting for the decision of the Aetolians. On
being informed by Damoteles and his colleagues on their
return of the nature of the terms that had been granted them,
the Aetolians consented to the general principle&mdash;for they
were in fact much better than they had expected,&mdash;but in regard
to the towns formerly included in their league they hesitated for
some time; finally, however, they acquiesced. Marcus Fulvius
accordingly took over Ambracia, and allowed the Aetolian
garrison to depart under terms; but removed from the town
the statues and pictures, of which there was a great number,
owing to the fact of Ambracia having been a royal residence

one hundred and fifty talents. After this settlement of affairs
he directed his march into the interior of Aetolia, feeling
surprised at meeting with no communication from the Aetolians.
But on arriving at Amphilochian Argos, a hundred and eighty
stades from Ambracia, he pitched his camp; and being there
met by Damoteles and his colleagues with the information
that the Aetolians had resolved to ratify the treaty which they
had concluded, they went their several ways, the Aetolians back
to their own country, and Marcus to Ambracia, where he
busied himself about getting his army across to Cephallenia;
while the Aetolians appointed Phaeneas and Nicander ambassadors to go to Rome about the peace: for not a single line of

<head>The Treaty With the Aetolians</head>
<p>While these envoys, accompanied by those from Rhodes
and Athens, were on their voyage with this object, Marcus
Fulvius sent Caius Valerius also, and some others of his friends
to Rome to secure the ratification of the treaty. But when
they arrived at Rome they found that a fresh cause of anger
with the Aetolians had arisen by the instrumentality of king
Philip; who, looking upon himself as wronged by the Aetolians
having taken Athamania and Dolopia from him, had sent to
some of his friends at Rome, urging them to share his displeasure and secure
the rejection of the pacification. Accordingly, on the first arrival of the Aetolians, the Senate would not
listen to them; but afterwards, at the intercession of the
Rhodians and Athenians, changed its mind and consented to
their request: for Damis,<note anchored="yes">Hultsch's text, supported by the MSS., has <foreign lang="greek">*da/mis o( kixhsi/wn,</foreign> from which
no sense seems obtainable. According to Suidas, Damis was a philosopher
from Nineveh who had settled in Athens. Livy <bibl n="Liv. 38.10">(38, 10)</bibl>, has <quote lang="la">Leon Hicesiae
filius.</quote> He must therefore have found the name Leon in his copy, which could
hardly have been substituted for <foreign lang="greek">*da=mis</foreign> by mistake, though <foreign lang="greek">*(i*k*e*si/ou</foreign> may have
become <foreign lang="greek">kixhsi/wn.</foreign></note> besides other excellences displayed in his speech, was thought to have introduced a very
apt simile, extremely applicable to the case in hand. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Damis.</note> He said
"The Romans had good cause for anger with
the Aetolians; for, instead of being grateful for
the many kindnesses received at their hands, they had brought
the Roman Empire into great danger by causing the war with
Antiochus to break out. But the Senate were wrong in one
point, namely in directing their anger against the masses. For
in states the common people were like the sea, which left to
its own nature was ever calm and unmoved, and not in the
least likely ever to trouble any of those who approached or
used it; but directly violent winds blew upon and disturbed
it, and forced it against its nature to become agitated, then
indeed nothing could be more dreadful or formidable than the
sea. This was just the case with the Aetolians. As long
as they were left to themselves, no people in Greece were
more loyal to you or more staunch in supporting your active
measures. But when Thoas and Dicaearchus brought a
storm from Asia, and Mnestas and Damocritus from Europe,
and, disturbing the calm of the Aetolian masses, compelled
<pb n="289"/>
them to become reckless of what they said or did,&mdash;then
indeed their good disposition gave way to bad, and while intending to do mischief to you they really inflicted damage
upon themselves. It is against these mischief-makers therefore that you should be implacable; while you should take
pity on the masses and make peace with them: with the assurance that, if once more left to themselves, with the additional
feeling of having owed their safety on the present occasion to
you, their attachment to you will be the warmest in Greece."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b21c32" type="chapter" n="32">
<head>Terms of the Treaty</head>
<p>By these arguments the Athenian envoy persuaded the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Treaty with Aetolia, B. C. <date value="-189">189</date>.</note>
Senate to make peace with the Aetolians. The
decree therefore having been passed and confirmed by a vote of the people, the treaty was
formally ratified, of which the text was as follows: "The
people of the Aetolians shall in good faith maintain the
empire and majesty of the people of Rome.</p>
<p>"They shall not allow hostile forces to pass through their
territory or cities against the Romans, their allies or friends;
nor grant them any supplies from the public fund.</p>
<p>"They shall have the same enemies as the people of Rome;
and if the Roman people go to war with any, the Aetolian
people shall do so also.</p>
<p>"The Aetolians shall surrender to the praefectus in Corcyra,
within a hundred days from the completion of the treaty,
runaway slaves, and prisoners of the Romans and their allies,
except such as having been taken during the war have returned to their own land and been subsequently captured;
and except such as were in arms against Rome during the
time that the Aetolians were fighting on the side of the
Romans.</p>
<p>"If there should be any not found within that time, they
shall hand them over as soon as they are forthcoming, without
deceit or fraud. And such persons, after the completion of
the treaty, shall not be allowed to return to Aetolia.</p>
<p>"The Aetolians shall pay the consul in Greece at once two
hundred Euboic talents of silver, of a standard not inferior to
the Attic. In place of one third of this silver, they may, if
they so choose, pay gold, at the rate of a mina of gold to ten
minae of silver. They shall pay the money in the six years
<pb n="290"/>
next following the completion of the treaty in yearly instalments of fifty talents; and shall deliver the money in Rome.</p>
<p>"The Aetolians shall give the Consul forty hostages, not
less than ten or more than forty years old, to remain for the
six years; they shall be selected by the Romans freely, excepting only the Strategus, Hipparch, public secretary, and such as
have already been hostages at Rome.</p>
<p>"The Aetolians shall deliver such hostages in Rome; and
if any one of them die, they shall give another in his place.</p>
<p>"Cephallenia shall not be included in this treaty.</p>
<p>"Of such territories, cities, and men as once belonged<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-192">192</date>.</note>
to the Aetolians, and, in the consulship of Titus
Quinctius and Cnaeus Domitius, or subsequently,

their friendship, the Aetolians shall not annex any, whether
city or men therein.</p>
<p>"The city and territory of Oeniadae shall belong to the
Acarnanians."</p>
<p>The treaty having been solemnly sworn, peace was concluded, and the war in Aetolia, as is in the rest of Greece,
thus came to an end. . . .</p></div2>

<p>While the negotiations for peace with Antiochus, and

brought to a conclusion, the account of which I am now about

a friend of Rome, and ready to do anything

time, he offered Helvius a compliment of fifteen

talents. In answer to this, Helvius said that he would refrain
from damaging the territory; but that as to the general question
Moag&ebreve;tes must communicate with the Consul, for he was
close behind with his army. Moag&ebreve;tes accordingly sent ambassadors to Cnaeus, his own brother being one of them.
When the Consul met them in the road, he addressed them
in threatening and reproachful terms, asserting that "Not only
had Moag&ebreve;tes shown himself the most determined enemy of
Rome, of all the princes in Asia, but had done his very best
to overthrow their empire, and deserved punishment rather
than friendship."<note anchored="yes">The Greek text is corrupt. The sense is given

with which they were charged, and merely begged him to have
an interview with Moag&ebreve;tes: and when Cnaeus consented they
returned to Cibyra. Next morning the Tyrant came out of
the town accompanied by his friends, displaying his humility
by a mean dress and absence of all pomp; and, in conducting
his defence, descanted in melancholy terms on his own helplessness
and the poverty of the towns under his rule (which consisted of Cibyra, Syleium, and the town in the Marsh), and
entreated Cnaeus to accept the fifteen talents. Astonished at
his assurance, Cnaeus made no answer, except that, "If he did
not pay five hundred talents, and be thankful that he was
allowed to do so, he would not loot the country, but he would
storm and sack the city." In abject terror Moag&ebreve;tes begged
him not to do anything of the sort; and kept adding to his
offer little by little, until at last he persuaded Cnaeus to take
one hundred talents, and one thousand medimni of corn, and
admit him to friendship.<note anchored="yes">The dynasty lasted until the time of the Mithridatic wars. The last

<head>Pacification of Pamphylia</head>
<p>When Cnaeus Manlius was crossing the River Colobatus, ambassadors came to him from the town
of Sinda (in Pisidia) begging for help, because
the people of Termessus had called in the aid of
the people of Philomelus, and had depopulated their territory
and sacked their town; and were at that very moment besieging
<pb n="292"/>  its citadel, into which all the citizens, with wives and children, had retreated. On hearing this, Cnaeus immediately
promised them aid with the greatest readiness; and thinking
the affair was a stroke of luck for himself, directed his march
towards Pamphylia. On his arrival in the neighbourhood of
Termessus, he admitted the Termessians to friendship on the
payment of fifty talents. He did the same with the Aspendians:
and having received the ambassadors of the other towns in
Pamphylia, he impressed on them in these interviews the conviction mentioned above,<note anchored="yes">That is probably "of the necessity of submitting to Rome" but the

<p>After taking the town of Cyrmasa (in Pisidia), and a

advance. And as he was marching along the
marsh, envoys came from Lysinoe, offering an
unconditional surrender. After accepting this, Cnaeus entered
the territory of Sagalassus, and having driven off a vast quantity
of spoil waited to see what the Sagalassians were prepared
to do. When their ambassadors arrived he received them;
and accepting a compliment of fifty talents, twenty thousand

Eposognatus in his turn sent envoys to Cnaeus
begging him not to move his quarters or attack
the Tolistobogian Gauls; and assuring him that he would send
embassies to the kings, and propose peace to them, and felt
quite certain that he would be able to bring them to a proper
view of affairs in all respects. . . .</p>
<p>In the course of his march through the country Cnaeus
made a bridge over the River Sangorius, which was extremely
deep and difficult to cross. And having encamped on the bank

one of them by a nod to strike the Roman as he was in the

man obeyed, and cut off the centurion's head, which she
picked up and drove off with, wrapped in the folds of her
dress: On reaching her husband she threw the head at his
feet; and when he expressed astonishment and said: "Wife to
keep faith is a good thing," she replied: "Yes; but it is a

Romans were encamped at Ancyra, and Cnaeus
was on the point of continuing his advance,
ambassadors came from the Tectosages asking
that Cnaeus would leave his troops in their
quarters, and advance himself in the course of
the next day into the space between the two
camps; and promising that their kings would come to meet
him, and discuss the terms of a peace. But when Cnaeus
consented, and duly arrived at the appointed place with five
hundred horse, the kings did not appear. After his return
to the camp, however, the ambassadors came again, and, offering
some excuses for the kings, begged him to come once more,
as they would send some of their chief men to discuss the
whole question. Cnaeus consented; but, without leaving the
camp himself, sent Attalus and some tribunes with three
hundred horse. The envoys of the Gauls duly appeared and
discussed the business: but finally said that it was impossible
for them to conclude the matter or ratify anything they agreed
upon; but they engaged that the kings would come next day
to agree on the terms, and finally settle the treaty, if the
Consul would also come to them. Attalus promised that
Cnaeus would come, and they separated for that day. But
the Gauls were deliberately contriving these postponements,
and amusing the Romans, because they wanted to get some
part of their families and property beyond the river Halys;
and, first of all, to get the Roman Consul into their hands if
they could, but if not, at any rate to kill him. With this
purpose they watched next day for the coming of the Romans,
with a thousand horse ready to fall upon him. When Cnaeus
heard the result of Attalus's interview, believing that the kings
would come, he left the camp, attended as usual by five
hundred horse. Now it happened that, on the days of the
previous interviews, the foraging parties which went out
<pb n="295"/>
from the Roman camp to fetch wood and hay had gone in
the same direction, in order to have the protection of the
squadron which went to the parley. A numerous foraging party
acted in the same way on this third occasion, and the tribunes
ordered them to proceed in the same direction, with the usual
number of horsemen to protect them as they advanced. And
their being out on this duty proved accidentally to be the
salvation of their comrades in the danger which threatened
them. . . .</p></div2>

bringing complimentary crowns to him for his

rejoiced at the prospect given them by Antiochus's defeat of being relieved from tribute, garrisons, or
other royal exactions, as at the removal of all fear of the
barbarians, and at their escape from their insolence and lawlessness.
Among the rest Musaeus came from Antiochus,
and some envoys from the Gauls, desiring to ascertain the terms
upon which friendship would be granted them; and also from
Ariarathes, the king of Cappadocia. For this latter prince,
having attached himself to the fortunes of Antiochus, and having
taken part in his battle with the Romans, had become alarmed
and dismayed for his own fate, and therefore was endeavouring
by frequent embassies to ascertain what he would have to pay or
do to get pardon for his error. The Consul complimented the
ambassadors from the cities, and dismissed them after a very
favourable reception; but he replied to the Gauls that he would
not make a treaty with them until king Eumenes, whom he
expected, had arrived. To the envoys from Ariarathes he said
that they might have peace on the payment of six hundred
talents. With the ambassador of Antiochus he arranged that he
would come with his army to the frontier of Pamphylia, to receive
the two thousand five hundred talents, and the corn with which
the king had undertaken to furnish the Roman soldiers before
his treaty with Lucius Scipio. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Spring of B. C. <date value="-188">188</date>.</note> This business being thus
settled, he solemnly purified his army; and, as the season for
military operations was now beginning, he broke
up his quarters, and, taking Attalus with him,

three days. On the fourth he continued his advance; and,
pushing on at great speed, arrived on the third day at the
rendezvous with Antiochus, and there pitched his camp. Here
he was visited by Musaeus, who begged him to wait, as the
carts and cattle that were bringing the corn and money were
late. He consented to wait: and, when the supply arrived, he

money to one of his tribunes, with orders to convey it to

came within a short distance of the place he was met by
the captain of the garrison, who begged Cnaeus not to condemn him unheard. "He had received the city from
Antiochus in trust, and was holding it until he should be
instructed what to do by the sovereign who had entrusted it
to him." And he therefore begged for thirty days' respite, to
enable him to send and ask the king for instructions.
Observing that Antiochus was behaving straightforwardly in
other particulars, Cnaeus consented to allow him to send and
ask the king the question. After some days the officer
accordingly received an answer, and surrendered the city.</p>

as a forcible hint that they must pay the money owing, in accordance with the terms agreed on; while he himself marched his

after listening to all who appealed to them,
assigned in the case of disputed claims to territory, money, or anything else, certain cities in
which the parties might have their claims settled
by arbitration. The general scheme which they
drew out was as follows: Those of the autonomous cities
which, having formerly paid tribute to Antiochus, had remained
faithful to Rome, they relieved from tribute altogether.
Those that had been tributary to Attalus they ordered to pay
the same tribute to his successor Eumenes. Such as had
abandoned the Roman friendship and joined Antiochus in the
war, they ordered to pay Eumenes the amount of tribute imposed on them by Antiochus. The people of Colophon,
Notium, Cymae, and Mylae, they freed from tribute. To
the Clazomenians, besides this relief, they gave the Island
Drymussa. To the Ephesians they restored the sacred district
which they had been obliged by the enemy to evacuate. . . .<note anchored="yes">See <bibl n="Liv. 38.39">Livy, 38, 39</bibl>. Some words are lost referring to grants to the people

To the people of Chios, Smyrna, and Erythrae, besides other
marks of honour, they assigned the territory which they
severally expressed a wish to have at the time, and alleged
was their right, from regard for their loyalty and zeal which
they had shown to Rome during the war. To the Phocaeans
they restored their ancestral city and the territory which they
possessed of old. They next transacted business with the
Rhodians, giving them Lycia and Caria up to the river
Maeander, except Telmissus. As to king Eumenes and his
brothers, not content with the liberal provision made for them
in their treaty with Antiochus, they now assigned him in
addition the Chersonese, Lysimacheia, and the castles on the
borders of these districts, and such country as had been subject to Antiochus in Europe; and in Asia, Phrygia on the
<pb n="301"/>
Hellespont, Great Phrygia, so much of Mysia as he had before
subjugated, Lycaonia, Milyas, Lydia, Tralles, Ephesus, and
Telmissus: all these they gave to Eumenes. As to Pamphylia, Eumenes alleged that it was on this side Taurus, the
ambassadors of Antiochus on the other; and the commissioners
feeling unable to decide, referred the question to the Senate.
Having thus decided the largest number and most important
of the matters brought before them, they started on the road
towards the Hellespont, intending on their journey to still
further secure the settlement arrived at with the Gauls. . . .

to the Achaeans from Marcus Lepidus, the
consul of the year, and afterwards Pontifex

Rome and Antiochus, the hopes of the whole
revolutionary party were destroyed. Politics
therefore began to assume a new aspect; and
whereas the administration of justice among
them had been postponed for nearly the last twenty years,
voices began to make themselves heard in the cities to the
<pb n="304"/>
effect that "there ought to be an end and settlement of their
mutual disputes." But after considerable controversy on this

had for some time past been zealously working in Rome to
secure the restoration of Zeuxippus to Boeotia,
because he had found him serviceable on many
occasions during the wars with Antiochus and
Philip. And just at this time he had induced the Senate to
send a despatch to the Boeotians ordering them to recall
Zeuxippus and his fellow exiles. When this despatch arrived,
the Boeotians, fearing that, if these men were restored, they
would become detached from their good understanding with
Macedonia, determined that the legal sentence upon
Zeuxippus and the rest should be publicly proclaimed,<note anchored="yes">Some words are lost from the text describing their method of procedure.</note>
which they had formerly drawn up against them. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">See <ref target="b18c43" targOrder="U">18, 43</ref>. <bibl n="Liv. 33.28">Livy 33, 28</bibl>.</note> Thus they
condemned them on two charges, first, of sacrilege for
having stripped off the silver from the plated table of Zeus,
and, secondly, of murder for having killed
Brachylles. Having made this arrangement,
they assumed that they need pay no further attention to the
despatch of the Senate, but contented themselves with sending
Callicritus and others to Rome with the message that they
were unable to rescind what had been settled by their laws.
Zeuxippus having sent an embassy to the Senate at the same
time, the Romans wrote to the Aetolians and Achaeans an
account of the attitude assumed by the Boeotians, and ordered
them to restore Zeuxippus to his country. The Achaeans refrained from invading the country with an army, but selected
some ambassadors to go and persuade the Boeotians to obey
the orders from Rome; and also to settle the legal disputes
existing between them and the Achaeans, on the same principles as they conducted the administration of justice at home:
for it happened that there were some controversies between
the two nations that had been dragging on for a long time.
On receiving this message the Boeotians, whose Strategus was
then Hippias, promised at the moment that they would do
<pb n="305"/>
what was demanded of them, but shortly afterwards neglected
it at every point. Therefore, when Hippias had laid down his
office and Alcetas had succeeded him, Philopoemen gave all
who chose license to make reprisals on the territories of the
Boeotians; which proved the beginning of a serious quarrel
between the two nations. For on the cattle of Myrrichus and
Simon being driven off,<note anchored="yes">Some words are lost in the text which would more fully explain the

transaction, the contest soon ceased to be political, and became the beginning and prelude of open war. If indeed the
Senate had persisted in carrying out the restoration of
Zeuxippus, war would quickly have been kindled; but as it
maintained silence on the subject, the Megareans were induced
by an embassy proposing terms to stop the reprisals. . . .<note anchored="yes">Some words are lost in the text which would more fully explain the

<head>Quarrel Between Lycians and Rhodians</head>
<p>A quarrel arose between the Lycians and Rhodians from
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Rhodes and the Lycians.</note>
the following causes. When the ten commissioners were employed in the settlement of Asia,
they were visited by Theaetetus and Philophron on a mission from Rhodes, demanding that Lycia and
Caria should be given to them in return for the goodwill
and zeal displayed by them in the war with Antiochus. At
the same time Hipparchus and Satyrus came from Ilium
begging, on the ground of their kindred with the Lycians, that
the latter should receive pardon for their transgressions. The
commissioners listened to these pleadings, and tried to do what
they could to satisfy both. For the sake of the people of
Ilium, they inflicted no severity on the Lycians, but gratified
the Rhodians by presenting them with the sovereignty over
that people. This decision was the origin of a serious division
and controversy between the Lycians and Rhodians. For the
envoys of Ilium visited the Lycian cities, giving out that they
had succeeded in pacifying the Roman anger, and that they
owed their liberty to them; while Theaetetus and his colleague
took back word to their countrymen that Lycia and all Caria
south of the Maeander had been given as a free gift by the
Romans to Rhodes. Presently an embassy came from Lycia to
Rhodes desiring an alliance; while the Rhodians on their part
had elected certain of their citizens to go to Lycia and give
<pb n="306"/>
orders to the several cities as to what they were to do. They
were thus entirely at cross purposes, and for some time the
cause of the misunderstanding was not generally intelligible.
But when the Lycian ambassadors appeared in the assembly
and began talking about an alliance, and Pothion the Prytanis
rose after them and explained the different ideas which the two
people entertained on the subject, and moreover, sternly rebuked the Lycian envoys,<note anchored="yes">Something is lost in the text.</note> the latter declared that they would

royal house of Macedonia. I am aware that
some historians of the war between Rome and
Perseus, when they wish to set forth the causes
of the quarrel for our information, assign as the primary one
the expulsion of Abrupolis from his principality,
on the ground of having made a raid upon the
mines at Pangaeum after the death of Philip,
which Perseus repulsed, finally expelling him
entirely out of his own dominions.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Abrupolis, a Thracian prince

most decisive advantage, both to historians and their readers,
to know the causes from which the several events are born and
spring. Most historians confound these, because they do not
keep a firm hold upon the distinction between a pretext and
a cause, or again between a pretext and a beginning of a war.
And since events at the present time recall this distinction
I feel compelled to renew my discussion of this subject.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">See <ref target="b3c6" targOrder="U">bk. 3, ch. 6</ref>.</note> For
instance, of the events just referred to, the first
three are pretexts; the last two&mdash;the plot against
Eumenes, the murder of the ambassadors, and other similar
things that happened during the same period&mdash;are clear <emph>beginnings</emph> of the war between Rome and Perseus, and of the final
overthrow of the Macedonian kingdom; but not one of them
is a <emph>cause</emph> of these things. I will illustrate by examples. Just
as we say that Philip son of Amyntas contemplated and
determined upon accomplishing the war with Persia, while
Alexander put into execution what he had projected, so in the
present instance we say that Philip son of Demetrius first projected
<pb n="308"/>  the last war against Rome, and had all his preparations
ready for the execution of his design, but that after his death
Perseus became the agent in carrying out the undertaking
itself. If this be true, the following also is clear: it is impossible that the causes
of the war should have been subsequent to the death of him who resolved upon and projected it;
which would be the case if we accepted the account of these
historians; for the events alleged by them as its causes were
subsequent to the death of Philip. . . .</p></div2>

the answer of the Senate; which was to the
effect that the Senate disapproved of the destruction of the walls, and of the execution of the

did not rescind any arrangement made. No

to pass.</p>
<p>Next came the ambassadors from Eumenes, who renewed<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The offer of Eumenes.</note>

<head>Apollonidas and Cassander Urge Rejection of Eumenes' Gifts</head>
<p>After they had finished their speech, Apollonidas of Sicyon
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Answer of Apollonidas.</note>
rose and said that: "As far as the amount of the
money was concerned, it was a present worthy
of the Achaeans. But if they looked to the
intention of the donor, or the purpose to which the gift was to
be applied, none could well be more insulting and more unconstitutional. The laws prohibited any one, whether a private
individual or magistrate, from accepting presents from a king
on any pretence whatever; but if they took this money they
<pb n="310"/>
would every one of them be plainly accepting a present, which
was at once the gravest possible breach of the law, and confessedly the deepest possible personal disgrace. For that the
council should take a great wage from Eumenes, and meet to
deliberate on the interests of the league after swallowing such a
bait, was manifestly disgraceful and injurious. It was Eumenes
that offered money now; presently it would be Prusias;
and then Seleucus. But as the interests of democracies and of
kings are quite opposite to each other, and as our most frequent
and most important deliberations concern the points of controversy arising between us and the kings, one of two things must
necessarily happen; either the interests of the king will have
precedence over our own, or we must incur the reproach of
ingratitude for opposing our paymasters." He therefore urged
the Achaeans not only to decline the offer, but to hold
Eumenes in detestation for thinking of making it.</p>
<p>Next rose Cassander of Aegina and reminded the Achaeans<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Cassander of Aegina.</note>
of "The misfortunes which the Aeginetans had
met with through being members of the Achaean
league; when Publius Sulpicius sailed against
them with the Roman fleet, and sold all the unhappy Aeginetans
into slavery." In regard to this subject I have already related
how the Aetolians, having got possession of Aegina in virtue of
their treaty with Rome, sold it to Attalus for thirty talents.
Cassander therefore drew the attention of the Achaeans to
these facts; and demanded that Eumenes should not seek to
gain the affection of the Achaeans by offering them money, but
that he should establish an incontestable claim to every sign of
devotion by giving back Aegina. He urged the Achaeans not
to accept presents which would place them in the position of
being the destroyers of the hopes of Aeginetan restoration for
all time.</p>
<p>After these speeches had been delivered, the people showed<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The present of Eumenes is refused.</note>
such signs of enthusiastic approval that no one
ventured to speak on the side of the king; but
the whole assembly rejected the offer by acclamation, though its amount certainly made it exceedingly tempting.</p></div2>

<head>Offers of Eumenes and Seleucus Declined</head>
<p>The next subject introduced for debate was that of
king Ptolemy. The ambassadors who had been on the mission

to Ptolemy were called forward, and Lycortas, acting as spokesman, began by stating how they had interchanged
oaths of alliance with the king; and next announced that they brought a present from the
king to the Achaean league of six thousand stands of arms for
peltasts, and two thousand talents in bronze coinage. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ptolemy. The speech of Lycortas.</note>He

Lycortas and his colleagues in the embassy to
Ptolemy "which alliance it was that he had thus renewed?"</p>
<p>No one answering the question, but all the assembly
beginning to converse with each other, the Council chamber
was filled with confusion. The cause of this absurd state
of things was this. There had been several treaties of
alliance formed between the Achaeans and Ptolemy's
kingdom, as widely different in their provision as in the
circumstances which gave rise to them: but neither had
Ptolemy's envoy made any distinction when arranging for the
renewal, merely speaking in general terms on the matter, nor had
the ambassadors sent from Achaia; but they had interchanged
the oaths on the assumption of there being but one treaty.
The result was, that, on the Strategus quoting all the treaties,
and pointing out in detail the differences between them, which
turned out to be important, the assembly demanded to know
which it was that it was renewing. And when no one was able
to explain, not even Philopoemen himself, who had been in office
when the renewal was made, nor Lycortas and his colleagues
who had been on the mission to Alexandria, these men all
began to be regarded as careless in conducting the business of
the league; while Aristaenus acquired great reputation as being
the only man who knew what he was talking about; and finally,
the assembly refused to allow the ratification, voting on account
of this blunder that the business should be postponed.</p>
<p>Then the ambassadors from Seleucus entered with their<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Offer of Seleucus.</note>
proposal. The Achaeans, however, voted to
renew the friendship with Seleucus, but to
decline for the present the gift of the ships.

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Winter of B. C. <date value="-185">185</date>.</note>
broke up and the people separated to their
several cities. But subsequently, while the
(Nemean) games were in course of celebration,
Quintus Caecilius arrived from Macedonia, on his way back
from the embassy which he had been conducting to Philip.
Aristaenus having called a meeting of the league magistrates in
Argos, Quintus attended and upbraided them for having exceeded justice in the harshness and severity with which they had
treated the Lacedaemonians, and urged them strongly to repair
the error. Aristaenus said not a word, showing clearly by his
silence that he disapproved of what had been done and agreed
with the words of Caecilius. But Diophanes of Megalopolis,
who was more of a soldier than a statesman, stood up to speak,
and so far from offering any defence of the Achaeans, suggested
to Caecilius, from hostility to Philopoemen, another charge that
might be brought against them. For he said that "the Lacedaemonians were not the only people who had been badly treated;
the Messenians had been so also." There were as a fact some
controversies going on among the Messenians, in regard to the
decree of Flamininus concerning the exiles, and the execution of it by Philopoemen: and Caecilius, thinking that he
now had a party among the Achaeans themselves of the same
opinion as himself, expressed still greater anger at the hesitation on the part of the assembled magistrates in obeying his
orders. However, when Philopoemen, Lycortas, and Archon
argued long and elaborately to prove that what had been done
at Sparta was right, and advantageous to the Lacedaemonians
themselves more than to any one else, and that it was impossible
to disturb any existing arrangements without violating justice
to man and piety to the gods, they came to the decision that
they would maintain them, and give an answer to that
effect to the Roman legate. Seeing what the disposition of
the magistrates was, Caecilius demanded that the public
assembly should be summoned, to which the Achaean magistrates demanded to see the instructions which he had from the
Senate on these points: and when he gave no answer to this
demand, they said that they would not summon the assembly
for him, as their laws forbade them to do so unless a man
<pb n="313"/>
brought written instructions from the Senate, stating the subject
on which they were to summon it. Caecilius was so angry at
this uncompromising opposition to his orders, that he refused
to receive his answer from the magistrates, and so departed
without any answer at all. The Achaeans laid the blame
both of the former visit of Marcus Fulvius and the present
one of Caecilius on Aristaenus and Diophanes, on the ground
that they had invited them on account of their political opposition to Philopoemen; and accordingly the general public felt
a certain suspicion of these two men. Such was the state of
the&mdash;Peloponnese. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b22c14" type="chapter" n="14">
<head>Philopoemen on Archon</head>
<p>Philopoemen had a sharp difference in debate with
Archon the Strategus. In course of time, however, Philopoemen was convinced by Archon's
arguments, and, changing his mind, spoke in
warm commendation of Archon as having managed his business
with skill and address. But when I heard the speech at the
time it did not seem to me right to praise a man and yet do
him an injury, nor do I think so now in my maturer years. For
I think that there is as wide a distinction in point of morality
between practical ability and success secured by absence of
scruples, as there is between skill and mere cunning. The former
are in a manner the highest attainments possible, the latter the
reverse. But owing to the lack of discernment so general in
our day, these qualities, which have little in common, excite
the same amount of commendation and emulation in the
world. . . .</p></div2>

report to the Senate concerning Macedonia and
the Peloponnese, the ambassadors who had
come to Rome on these matters were introduced into the Senate. First came those from
Philip and Eumenes, as well as the exiles from
Aenus and Maroneia; and on their saying
much the same as they had said before Caecilius
and his colleagues at Thessalonica, the Senate voted to send
another deputation to Philip, to see first of all whether he
had evacuated the cities in Perrhaebia in conformity with the
answer he gave to Caecilius: and secondly, to order him to
<pb n="314"/>
remove his garrison from Aenus and Maroneia; and in a word,
to abandon all fortresses, positions, and towns on the sea-board
of Thrace.</p>
<p>After these the ambassadors from the Peloponnese were<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Achaean ambassadors make their defence.</note>
introduced. For the Achaeans on their part
had sent Apollonidas of Sicyon, and others, to
justify themselves to Caecilius for his having
received no answer, and generally to inform the
Senate on the question of Sparta; and at the same time Areus
and Alcibiades had come from Sparta as ambassadors,&mdash;two
of the old exiles recently restored by Philopoemen and the
Achaeans. And this was a circumstance that particularly roused
the anger of the Achaeans; because they thought it the height of
ingratitude on the part of the exiles, after receiving so important
and recent a service at their hands, to be now sending a
hostile embassy, and accusing to the sovereign people those
who had been the authors of their unlooked&mdash;for preservation
and restoration to their country.</p></div2>

<head>Another Commission For Greece</head>
<p>Both parties were heard in their defence in each

other's presence. Apollonidas of Sicyon and his colleagues
tried to convince the Senate that the affairs of
Sparta could not have been better managed
than they were managed by Philopoemen.
Areus and his colleagues attempted to establish the reverse:
alleging, first of all, that the power of the city was entirely
destroyed by the violent withdrawal of so large a number;
and, in the second place, that even those that were left were
so few that their position was insecure, now that the walls
were pulled down; and that their freedom of speech was
entirely destroyed by the fact that they were not only amenable
to the general decrees of the Achaean league, but were also
made specially subject to the magistrates set over them from
time to time. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The decision.</note> After hearing these envoys also, the Senate
decided to give, the same legates instructions
regarding them as well as the others, and appointed Appius Claudius and his colleagues commissioners for
Greece.</p>
<p>But the ambassadors from the Achaeans offered an explanation also to Caecilius in the Senate, on behalf of the
<pb n="315"/>
magistrates, asserting that "They did not act wrongly or deserve
blame for refusing to summon the assembly,

or a war, or unless some one brought a letter

Caecilius rose and made an attack on Philopoemen and
Lycortas, and the Achaeans generally, and on the policy they
had pursued towards the city of Sparta. After listening to
the arguments, the Senate answered the Achaeans by saying
that they would send commissioners to investigate the matter
of Sparta; and they accompanied this answer by an admonition to them to pay attention to the ambassadors sent by them
from time to time, and show them proper respect, as the
Romans did to ambassadors who came to them. . . .</p></div2>

ambassadors at Rome, that he would he obliged
to evacuate the cities in Thrace, he was extremely annoyed, because he regarded his
kingdom as being now curtailed on every side;
and he vented his wrath upon the unhappy people
of Maroneia. He sent for Onomastus, his governor in Thrace,
and communicated with him on the subject. And Onomastus
on his return sent Cassander to Maroneia, who, from long
residence there, was familiar with the inhabitants,&mdash;for Philip's
practice had long been to place members of his court in these
cities, and accustom the people to their residence among
them. Some few days after his arrival, the Thracians having
been prepared for what they had to do, and having obtained
entrance to the city by night through the instrumentality of
Cassander, a great massacre took place, and many of the
Maronites were killed. Having wreaked this vengeance on
those who opposed him, and satisfied his own anger, Philip
waited for the arrival of the Roman legates, persuaded that no
one would venture for fear of him to denounce his crime.
Nut when Appius and his colleagues presently arrived, they
<pb n="316"/>
were promptly informed of what had happened at Maroneia,
and expostulated in severe terms with Philip for
it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">He attempts to evade responsibility for it.</note> The king attempted to defend himself by

accuse him. He said this from a conviction that no one
would venture to do so; because they would consider that
Philip's vengeance upon those who opposed him would be
near at hand, while assistance from Rome would have a long
way to come. But when Appius and his colleagues said that
"they required to hear no defence, for they were well aware of
what had happened, and who was the cause of it," Philip
became much confused.</p></div2>

to say; but at last he said that he would send Cassander, who
was the actual author of the business, that the Senate might
learn the truth from him; but he tried to get Onomastus
excused, both in this and subsequent interviews with the
legates, alleging as a reason that not only had Onomastus not
been in Maroneia at the time of the massacre, but not even
in any part of the country in its neighbourhood. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Another crime.</note> His real

<p>The king, thus relieved of the presence of the legates, after<note anchored="yes" place="marg">King Philip meditates a breach with Rome.</note>
consulting with his friends Apelles and Philocles
became clearly conscious that his quarrel with
Rome had now become serious, and that it
could no longer be concealed, but was become notorious to
most people in the world. He was therefore now wholly bent
on measures of self-defence and retaliation. But as he was as
yet unprepared for some of the plans which he had in his
mind, he cast about to find some means of putting matters off,
and gaining time for making his preparations for war. He
accordingly resolved to send his youngest son
Demetrius to Rome: partly to make his defence

also to beg pardon for any error which he

of his own friends destined to accompany him on his mission.
At the same time he promised the Byzantines to give them
help: not so much because he cared for them, as from a wish
under cover of their name to strike terror into the princes of
the Thracians living beyond the Propontis, as a step towards
the fulfilment of his main purpose. . .</p></div2>

almost ever seen before. For as Philip was
compelled by treaty to submit disputes with
his neighbours to arbitration, and as it was known that the
Romans were willing to receive accusations against Philip,
and would secure the safety of those who had
controversies with him, all who lived near the
frontier of Macedonia came to Rome, some in
their private capacity, some from cities, others
from whole tribes, with complaints against Philip. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Coss. P. Claudius Pulcher, L. Porcius Licinus, B.C. 184.</note> At the
same time also came ambassadors from Eumenes, accompanied by his brother Athenaeus, to accuse Philip in regard
to the Thracian cities and the aid sent to Prusias. Philip's
son, Demetrius, also came to make answer to all these various
envoys, accompanied by Apelles and Philocles, who were at
that time considered the king's first friends. Ambassadors
also came from Sparta, representatives of each faction of the
citizens.</p>
<p>The first summoned to the Senate was Athenaeus, from whom<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B.C. <date value="-183">183</date>, Coss. M. Claudius Marcellus Q. Fabius Labeo.</note>
the Senate accepted the compliments of fifteen
thousand gold pieces, and passed a decree highly
extolling Eumenes and his brothers for their
answer, and exhorting them to continue in the
same mind. Next the praetors called upon all the accusers
of Philip, and brought them forward by one embassy at a
time. But as they were numerous, and their entry occupied
three days, the Senate became embarrassed as to the settlement to be made in each case. For from Thessaly there
were ambassadors from the whole nation, and also from each
<pb n="321"/>
city separately; so also from the Perrhaebians, Athamanians,
Epirotes, and Illyrians. And of these some brought cases of
dispute as to territory, slaves, or cattle; and some about contracts or injuries sustained by themselves. Some alleged that
they could not get their rights in accordance with the treaty,
because Philip prevented the administration of justice; while
others impeached the justice of the decisions given, on the
ground that Philip had corrupted the arbitrators. And, in
fact, there was an inextricable confusion and multiplicity of
charges.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b23c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Demetrius in the Senate</head>
<p>In such a state of things the Senate felt unable to come
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Demetrius in the Senate. <bibl n="Liv. 39.47">Livy, 39, 47</bibl>.</note>
to a clear decision itself, and did not think it
fair that Demetrius should have to answer each
of the several indictments; for it regarded him
with great favour, and saw at the same time that his extreme
youth unfitted him to cope with business of such intricacy and
complexity. Besides, what it desired most was not to hear
speeches of Demetrius, but to ascertain with certainty the disposition of Philip. Excusing him therefore from pleading
his cause, the Senate asked the young man and his friends
whether they were the bearers of any written memoir from
the king; and upon Demetrius answering that he was, and
holding out a paper of no great size, the Senate bade him
give a summary of what the paper contained in answer to
the accusations alleged. It amounted to this, that on each
point Philip asserted that he had carried out the injunctions of the Senate, or, if he had not done so, laid the
blame upon his accusers; while to the greater number of his
declarations he had added the words, "though the commissioners with Caecilius were unfair to me in this point," or
again, "though I am unjustly treated in this respect." Such
being Philip's mind, as expressed in the several clauses of the
paper, the Senate, after hearing the ambassadors who were
come to Rome, comprehended them all under one measure.
By the mouth of the praetor it offered an honourable and cordial reception to Demetrius, expressed in ample and emphatic
language, and answered his speech by saying that "The Senate
fully believe that on all the points mentioned by Demetrius, or
read by him from his paper of instructions, full justice was
<pb n="322"/>
already done or would be done. But, in order that Philip
might be made aware that the Senate paid this honour to
Demetrius, ambassadors. would be sent to see that everything
was being done in accordance with the will of the Senate, and
at the same time to inform the king that he owed this grace
to his son Demetrius." Such was the arrangement come to
on this part of the business.</p></div2>

<head>Philip's Jealousy Roused</head>
<p>The next to enter the Senate were the ambassadors of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The ambassadors of Eumenes complain that Philip has not evacuated Thrace.</note>
king Eumenes, who denounced Philip on
account of the assistance sent to Prusias, and
concerning his actions in Thrace, alleging that
even at that moment he had not withdrawn his
garrisons from the cities. But upon Philocles
showing his wish to offer a defence on these points, as having
been formerly charged with a mission to Prusias, and being
now sent to the Senate to represent Philip on this business,
the Senate, without listening very long to his speech, answered
that "With regard to Thrace, unless the legates found everything there settled in accordance with its will, and all the
cities restored to the entire control of Eumenes, the Senate
would be unable any longer to allow it to pass, or to submit to
being continually disobeyed."</p>
<p>Though the ill-feeling between the Romans and Philip<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The high honour paid to Demetrius at Rome, and its fatal result.</note>
was becoming serious, a check was put to it for
the time by the presence of Demetrius. And yet
this young prince's mission to Rome proved
eventually no slight link in the chain of events
which led to the final ruin of his house. For the Senate, by
thus making much of Demetrius, somewhat turned the young
man's head, and at the same time gravely annoyed Perseus
and the king, by making them feel that the kindness they
received from the Romans was not for their own sakes, but
for that of Demetrius. And T. Quintius Flamininus contributed not a little to the same result by taking the young
prince aside and communicating with him in confidence.
For he flattered him by suggesting that the Romans meant
before long to invest him with the kingdom; while he irritated
Philip and Perseus by sending a letter ordering the king to
send Demetrius to Rome again, with as many friends of the
<pb n="323"/>
highest character as possible. It was, in fact, by taking advantage of these circumstances that Perseus shortly afterwards
induced his father to consent to the death of Demetrius.

to have back the possessions from which they

these matters, namely Titus Flamininus, Q. Caecilius, and

to include the Achaeans in the agreement, called in Xenarchus
and his colleagues, who were at that time on a mission from
the Achaeans, to renew their alliance with Rome, and at the
same time to give an eye to their controversy with the Lacedaemonians. These men, being unexpectedly asked whether
they consented to the terms contained in the written document, were somewhat at a loss what to answer. For they did
not approve of the restoration of the exiles and the condemned persons, as being contrary to the decree of the league,
and the contents of the tablet on which that decree was engraved; and yet they approved of the document as a whole,
because it contained the clause providing that Sparta should
remain a member of the league. Finally, however, partly
from this difficulty, and partly from awe of the Roman commissioners, they affixed their seal. The Senate, therefore,

to go as ambassador to Prusias and Seleucus.
For having been very intimate with Titus during the Lacedaemonian war, he thought that this friendship, combined with
his disagreements with Philopoemen, would induce him on

statesmanship. His parts, however, were showy rather than
solid. In war his fertility of resource and boldness were
beyond the common run; and he shone in feats of personal
bravery. Nor were these his only accomplishments: he was
attractive and ready in conversation, versatile and courteous
in society. But at the same time he was devoted to licentious
intrigue, and in public affairs and questions of policy was quite
incapable of sustained attention or far-sighted views, of fortifying
<pb n="325"/>  himself with well-considered arguments, or putting them
before the public. On this occasion, for instance, though he
had really given the initiative to grave misfortunes, he did not
think that he was doing anything of importance; but followed
his usual manner of life, quite regardless of the future, indulging day after day in amours, wine, and song. Flamininus,
however, did once force him to catch a glimpse of the seriousness of his position. For seeing him on a certain occasion in
a party of revellers dancing in long robes, he said nothing at
the time; but next morning, being visited by him with some
request in behalf of his country, he said: "I will do my best,
Deinocrates; but it does astonish me that you can drink and
dance after having given the start to such serious troubles for
Greece." He appears, indeed, at that to have a little recovered
his soberer senses, and to have understood what an improper
display he had been making of his tastes and habits. However,
he arrived at this period in Greece in company with Flamininus, fully persuaded that the affairs of Messene would be
settled at a blow in accordance with his views. But Philopoemen and his party were fully aware that Flamininus had no
commission from the Senate in regard to affairs in Greece;
they therefore awaited his arrival without taking any step of any
sort. Having landed at Naupactus, Flamininus addressed a
despatch to the Strategus and Demiurgi<note anchored="yes">The ten federal magistrates of the league, who formed a council to act

the Achaeans to an assembly; to which they wrote back that
"they would do so, if he would write them word what the
subjects were on which he wished to confer with the Achaeans;
for the laws enjoined that limitation on the magistrates." As
Flamininus did not venture to write this, the hopes of Deinocrates and the so-called "old exiles," but who had at that time
been recently banished from Sparta, came to nothing, as in fact
did the visit of Flamininus and the plans which he had formed. . . .

reference to king Philip, that he had indeed done all that

got an opportunity, he would go all lengths against the Romans.
The Senate accordingly composed a reply to the king's envoys

warned him for the future to be careful not to be found acting
in opposition to the Romans. As to the Peloponnese, Marcius
had reported that, as the Achaeans were unwilling to refer any

<pb n="328"/>
and desirous of managing all their affairs themselves, if the
Senate would only reject their present application and give
ever so slight an indication of displeasure, Sparta would

the Senate refused compliance with either request and
answered that the Achaeans ought not to be surprised if

would not conduct their hegemony in accordance with the

<head>Philip's Desperate Measures</head>
<p>In this period a certain dreadful foreshadowing of misfortune fell upon king Philip and the whole of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The conflict of feelings in Philip's mind.</note>
Macedonia, of a kind well worthy of close attention and record. As though Fortune had
resolved to exact from him at once the penalties for all the
impieties and crimes which he had committed in the whole
course of his life, she now visited him with furies, those deities
of retribution, those powers that had listened to the prayers of
the victims of his cruelties, who, haunting him day and night,
so plagued him to the last day of his life, that all the world was
forced to acknowledge the truth of the proverb, that "Justice
has an eye" which mere men should never despise. The first
idea suggested to him by this evil power was that, as he
<pb n="329"/>
was about to go to war with Rome, he had better remove from
the most important cities, and those along the sea-coast, the
leading citizens, with their wives and children, and place them
in Emathia, formerly called Paeonia, and fill up the cities with
Thracians and other barbarians, as likely to be more securely
loyal to him in the coming hour of danger. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">See <ref target="b5c9" targOrder="U">5, 9</ref>.</note>The actual
carrying out of this measure, and the uprooting of these men
and their families, caused such an outburst of grief, and so
violent an outcry, that one might have supposed the whole district to have been taken by the sword. Curses and appeals to
heaven were rained upon the head of the king without any
further attempt at concealment. His next step, prompted by
the wish to leave no element of hostility or disaffection in the
kingdom, was to write to the governors of the several cities
ordering them to search out the sons and daughters of such
Macedonians as had been put to death by him, and place them
in ward; in which he referred especially to
Admetus, Pyrrhicus, and Samus, and those who
had perished with them: but he also included all others whosoever that had been put to death by order of the king, quoting
this verse, we are told:&mdash;<note anchored="yes">Stasinus fr.</note>
<quote><l>"Oh fool! to slay the sire and leave the sons."</l></quote>
Most of these men being persons of distinguished families, their
fate made a great noise and excited universal pity. But Fortune
had a third act in this bloody drama in reserve for Philip, in
which the young princes plotted against each other; and their
quarrels being referred to him, he was forced to choose between
becoming the murderer of his sons and living the rest of his
life in dread of being murdered by them in his old age; and
to decide which of the two he had the greater reason to fear.
Tortured day and night by these anxieties, the miseries and
perturbations of his spirit lead to the inevitable reflection that
the wrath of heaven fell upon his old age for the sins of his
previous life: which will be rendered still more evident by
what remains to be told. . . . Just when his soul was stung
to madness by these circumstances, the quarrel between his
sons blazed out: Fortune, as it were of set purpose, bringing
their misfortunes upon the scene all at one time. . . .

them. In all of them one may learn that whenever brothers fall out and allow their quarrel to
go any great length, they invariably end not only
by destroying themselves but in the utter ruin
of their property, children, and cities; while
those who keep their self-love within reasonable bounds, and
put up with each other's weaknesses, are the preservers of
these, and live in the fairest reputation and fame. I have
often directed your attention to the kings in Sparta, telling you
that they preserved the hegemony in Greece for their country
just so long as they obeyed the ephors, as though they were
their parents, and were content to reign jointly. But directly
they in their folly tried to change the government to a
monarchy, they caused Sparta to experience every misery
possible. Finally, I have pointed out to you as an example
the case of Eumenes and Attalus; showing you that, though
they succeeded to but a small and insignificant realm, they
have raised it to a level with the best, simply by the harmony and
unity of sentiment, and mutual respect which they maintained
towards each other. But so far from taking my words to heart,
you are, as it seems to me, whetting your angry passions against

some one took upon himself to bring him to trial before the people in the manner usual at
Rome, and produced many bitter accusations against him, he came forward and said nothing

Once when there was a sum of money required in the Senate

of a legal difficulty, refused to open the treasury on that particular day, Scipio said that "he would take the keys himself and

the Messenians in the war. Up to this time
the populace at Messene had been afraid of
their magistrates; but now at length, relying on
the protection of the enemy, some of them
plucked up courage to break silence and to say
that the time was come to send an embassy
to negotiate a peace. Deinocrates and his colleagues, being
no longer able to face the people under this storm of popular
odium, yielded to circumstances and retired to their own houses.
Thereupon the people, acting under the advice of the older
men, and especially under that of Epaenetus and Apollodorus,
the ambassadors from Boeotia,&mdash;who, having arrived some
time before to negotiate a peace, happened fortunately to be at
that time at Messene,&mdash;appointed and despatched envoys,
begging forgiveness for their transgressions. The Achaean
Strategus, having summoned his colleagues<note anchored="yes">That is the ten Demiurgi.</note> to council, and
given the envoys a hearing, answered that "There was but
one way in which the Messenians could reconcile themselves to
the league, and that was by at once surrendering to him the
authors of the revolt and of the murder of Philopoemen, leave
the rest to the authority of the league assembly, and at once
receive a garrison into their citadel." When this message was
announced to the Messenian populace, those who had long
been bitterly opposed to the authors of the war were ready
enough to surrender them and to arrest them; while the rest,
being persuaded that they would not be severely dealt with by
the Achaeans, readily consented to submit the general question
to the decision of the assembly. But what chiefly induced
them to unanimously accept the proposal was, that they in
fact had no choice in the matter. The Strategus accordingly
<pb n="334"/>
at once took over the citadel and marched his peltasts into it;
and then, taking some picked troops with him, entered the city;

the brink of ruin, but were restored to their
former position in the league by the magnanimity of Lycortas and the Achaeans. But the
towns of Abia, Thuria, and Pharae during these transactions
abandoned their connection with Messene, and, setting up a pillar
engraved with a treaty of alliance between themselves, formed
a separate league. When the Romans were informed that
the Messenian war had turned out successfully for the Achaeans,
without taking any account of their previous declaration they
gave a different answer to the same ambassadors, asserting
that they had taken measures to prevent any one from conveying arms or corn from Italy into Messene. By this they
showed clearly that, so far from avoiding or disregarding the
affairs of foreign nations not directly concerning themselves,
they were, on the contrary, annoyed at everything not being
referred to them and carried out in accordance with their
opinion.</p>
<p>When the ambassadors arrived in Sparta with their answer,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Achaean meeting at Sicyon.</note>
the Achaean Strategus as soon as he had settled
the Messenian business, summoned a congress
at Sicyon, and on its assembling, proposed a
resolution for the reception of Sparta into the league, alleging
<pb n="335"/>
that "The Romans had declined the arbitration which had
previously been offered to them in regard to this city,&mdash;for
they had answered that they had now no concern with any
of the affairs of Sparta. Those, however, at present in power
at Sparta were desirous of being admitted to the privileges
of the league. Therefore he advised that they should
admit the town; for this would be advantageous in two
ways: first, because they would be thus admitting men who
had remained unshaken in their loyalty to the league; and
secondly, because they would not be admitting those of the
old exiles, who had behaved with ingratitude and impiety
towards them, to any share of their privileges; but by confirming
the measures of those who had excluded them, would at the
same time be showing, with God's help, due gratitude to the
latter." With these words Lycortas exhorted the Achaeans to
receive the city of Sparta into the league. But Diophanes
and some others attempted to put in a word for the exiles, and
urged the Achaeans "Not to join in pressing heavily upon these
banished men; and not to be influenced by a mere handful of
men to strengthen the hands of those who had impiously and
lawlessly expelled them from their country."</p></div2>

The Achaeans, after listening to both, decided
to admit the city, and accordingly the agreement
was engraved on a tablet, and Sparta became

agreed to admit such of the old exiles as were not considered
to have acted in a hostile spirit against the Achaeans. After
confirming this arrangement the Achaeans sent Bippus of

had been despatched on a mission respecting

and Pharnaces, speaking highly of the moderation of Eumenes in every particular, and the
grasping temper and insolence of Pharnaces. The Senate
accordingly did not require any lengthened arguments; but,
after listening to the ambassadors, answered that they would
once more send legates to examine more minutely into the
points in dispute between the kings. Then came in the ambassadors from the Lacedaemonian exiles, and with them the
ambassadors from the citizens actually in the city; and after
giving them a long hearing, the Senate expressed no disapproval of what had been done, but promised the exiles to
write to the Achaeans on the subject of their restoration to
their country. Some days afterwards, Bippus of Argos and his
colleagues, sent by the Achaeans, entered the Senate with a
statement as to the restoration of order in Messene; and the
Senate, without showing displeasure at any part of the arrangement, gave the ambassadors a cordial reception. . . .

notoriety with the people. The first use he made of his power
was to confiscate the land granted by the tyrants to the sisters,
wives, mothers, and children of the exiles, and to distribute it
on his own authority among the poor without any fixed rule or
regard to equality. He next squandered the revenue, using the
public money as though it were his own, without the authority
of law, public decree, or magistrate. Annoyed at these proceedings, certain men managed to get themselves appointed

<p>When the Roman legates arrived and urged the putting

an end to the war, Eumenes and Ariarathes
professed to be ready to obey; but begged the
Romans to bring them, if possible, to an interview with Pharnaces, that they might see fully
from what was said in their own presence how faithless and cruel
a man Pharnaces was; and, if this proved to be impossible,
to take a fair and impartial view of the controversy and
<pb n="341"/>
decide it themselves. The legates replied that they would
do everything that was in their power and was consistent
with honour; but they required the kings to remove their
army from the country: for it was inconsistent that, when
they were there with proposals for a peace, operations of war
should be going on and mutual acts of hostility be committed.
Eumenes and his ally yielded to this representation, and immediately marched off in the direction of Galatia. The Roman
legates then visited Pharnaces, and first demanded that he
should meet Eumenes and Ariarathes in a conference, as that
would be the surest way of settling the affair; but when he
expressed repugnance to that measure, and absolutely refused
to do so, the Romans at once perceived that he plainly thought
himself in the wrong, and distrusted his own cause; but, being
anxious in any and every way to put an end to the war, they continued to press him until he consented to send plenipotentiaries
to the coast, to conclude a peace on such terms as the legates
might command. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The negotiation fails.</note> When these plenipotentiaries,

to consent to any proposal for the sake of concluding a peace.

not hold even to what they had once accepted, but continually brought forward some fresh demand, and altered their
mind again and again. The Roman legates, therefore, quickly
came to the conclusion that they were wasting their labour, as
Pharnaces could not be induced to consent to the pacification.
The conference accordingly having come to nothing, and the
Roman legates having left Pergamum, and the envoys of

<head>Callicrates Sent to Rome</head>
<p>This year the Achaean Strategus Hyperbatus brought
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <dateRange from="-180" to="-179">180</dateRange>. Debate in the Achaean assembly on the Roman despatch.</note>
before the assembly the question of the letter
from Rome as to the recall of the Lacedaemonian exiles. Lycortas and his party recommended
<pb n="342"/>  that no change should be made, on
the ground that "The Romans had only acted
as they were bound to do in listening to the petition of men
who, on the face of it, were deprived of their rights, so far as
that petition seemed reasonable; but when they were convinced that of a petition some points were impossible, and
others such as to inflict great disgrace and damage upon their
friends, it had never been their custom to insist upon them
peremptorily, or force their adoption.   So in this case also, if
it were shown to them that the Achaeans by obeying their
letter would be breaking their oaths, their laws, and the provisions engraved on the tablets, the very bonds of our league,
they will retract their orders, and will admit that we are right
to hesitate and to ask to be excused from carrying out its injunctions." Such was the speech of Lycortas. But Hyperbatus
and Callicrates advised submission to the letter, and
that they should hold its authority superior to law or tablet or
anything else. Such being the division of opinion, the
Achaeans voted to send ambassadors to the Senate, to put
before it the points contained in the speech of Lycortas.
Callicrates of Leontium, Lydiades of Megalopolis, and Aratus
of Sicyon were forthwith nominated for this mission, and were
despatched with instructions to this effect. But on their
arrival at Rome Callicrates went before the Senate, and, so far
from addressing it in accordance with his instructions, he on
the contrary entered upon an elaborate denunciation of his
political opponents; and, not contented with that, he undertook to rebuke the Senate itself.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b24c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Callicrates Turns Traitor</head>
<p>For he said that "The Romans were themselves responsible for the Greeks neglecting their letters
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Callicrates, instead of obeying his instructions, denounces his opponents, and persuades the Senate that their interference is necessary.</note>
and orders instead of obeying them. For in
all the democratic states of the day there were
two parties,&mdash;one recommending obedience to
the Roman rescripts, and holding neither law
nor tablet nor anything else to be superior to the
will of Rome; the other always quoting oaths and
tablets, and exhorting the people to be careful
about breaking them. Now the latter policy was by far the
most popular in Achaia, and the most influential with the
<pb n="343"/>
multitude; consequently the Romanisers were discredited and
denounced among the populace&mdash;their opponents glorified.
If then the Senate would give some sign of their interest in
the matter, the leaders, in the first place, would quickly change
to the Romanising party, and, in the next place, would be
followed by the populace from fear. But if this were neglected
by the Senate, the tendency towards the latter of the two
parties would be universal, as the more creditable and honourable in the eyes of the populace. Thus it came about that at
that very time certain statesmen, without any other claims whatever, had obtained the highest offices in their own cities, merely
from coming forward to speak against the rescripts of the
Senate, with the view of maintaining the validity of the laws
and decrees made in the country. If then the Senate was
indifferent about having their rescripts obeyed by the Greeks, by
all means let it go on as it is now doing. But if the Senate
wished that its orders should be carried out, and its rescripts
be despised by no one, it must give serious attention to that
subject. If it did not do so, he knew only too well that the
exact opposite of the Senate's wishes would come about, as
in fact had already been the case. For but lately, in the
Messenian disturbance, though Quintus Marcius had taken
many precautions to prevent the Achaeans adopting any
measures with regard to the Messenians without the consent of
the Romans, they had disobeyed that order; had voted the war
on their own authority; had not only wasted the whole county
in defiance of justice, but had in some cases driven its noblest
citizens into exile, and in others put them to death with every
extremity of torture, though they had surrendered, and were
guilty of no crime but that of appealing to Rome on the points
in dispute. Again, too, though the Senate had repeatedly
written to order the restoration of the Lacedaemonian exiles,
the Achaeans were so far from obeying, that they had actually
set up an engraved tablet, and made a sworn agreement with the
men actually in possession of the city that these exiles should
never return. With these instances before their eyes, the
Romans should take measures of precaution for the future."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b24c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Rome and the Achaean League</head>
<p>After delivering a speech in these words, or to this
effect, Callicrates left the Senate-house. He was followed by
<pb n="344"/>
the envoys of the exiles, who retired after delivering a short
address, stating their case, and containing some of the ordinary
appeals to pity. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans adopt the policy of raising a party in Greece against the Achaean league.</note> The Senate was persuaded that
much of what Callicrates had said touched the
interests of Rome, and that it was incumbent
upon it to exalt those who supported its own
decrees, and to humble those who resisted them.
It was with this conviction, therefore, and at this
time that it first adopted the policy of depressing those who in
their several states took the patriotic and honourable side, and
promoting those who were for appealing to its authority on
every occasion, right or wrong. The result of which was that
gradually, as time went on, the Senate had abundance of flatterers,
but a great scarcity of genuine friends. However, on this
occasion the Senate did not write about the restoration of the
exiles to the Achaeans only, but also to the Aetolians, Epirotes,
Athenians, Boeotians, and Acarnanians, calling them all as it
were to witness, in order to break down the power of the
Achaeans. Moreover, they added to their answer, without saying a word to his colleagues,
a remark confined entirely to Callicrates himself, that "everybody in the various states should be
as Callicrates." This man accordingly arrived in Greece with
his answer, in a great state of exultation, little thinking that
he had become the initiator of great miseries to all the Greeks,
but especially to the Achaeans. This nation had still at that
time the privilege of dealing on something like equal terms with
Rome, because it had kept faith with her from the time that it
had elected to maintain the Roman cause, in the hour of her
greatest danger&mdash;I mean during the wars with Philip and
Antiochus. . . . The league, too, had made progress in material
strength and in every direction from the period from which my
history commences; but the audacious proceeding of Callicrates
proved the beginning of a change for the worse. . . .</p>
<p>The Romans having the feelings of men, with a noble
spirit and generous principles, commiserate all who have met
with misfortunes, and show favour to all who fly to them for
protection; but directly any one claims anything as of right,
on the ground of having been faithful to their alliance, they
at once draw in and correct their error to the best of their
<pb n="345"/>
ability. Thus then Callicrates, who had been sent to Rome to
plead for the rights of the Achaeans, acted in exactly the
opposite spirit; and dragging in the subject of the Messenian
war, on which the Romans themselves had made no complaint, returned to Achaia to overawe the people with the
threat of the hostility of Rome. Having therefore by his official
report frightened and dismayed the spirits of the populace,
who were of course ignorant of what he had really said in the
Senate, he was first of all elected Strategus, and,
to make matters worse, proved to be open to
bribery; and then, having got the office, carried out the
restoration of the Lacedaemonian and Messenian exiles. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. 180-<date value="-179">179</date>.</note><note anchored="yes">See Hicks's <title>Greek Inscriptions,</title> p. 330.</note> . . .</p></div2>

whereas during the periods of the wars with
Philip and Antiochus, Roman influence had become supreme
in Greece, Aristaenus directed his policy with the idea of
carrying out with alacrity every order from Rome, and sometimes even of anticipating it. Still he endeavoured to keep
up the appearance of abiding by the laws, and did, in fact,
maintain the reputation of doing so, only giving way when any
one of them proved to plainly militate against the rescripts
from Rome. But Philopoemen accepted, and loyally performed, all Roman orders which were in harmony with the
laws and the terms of their alliance; but when such orders
exceeded these limits, he could not make up his mind to yield
a willing obedience, but was wont first to demand an arbitration, and to repeat the demand a second time; and if this
proved unavailing, to give in at length under protest, and so
finally carry out the order. . . .</p></div2>

to face, and can do so, well and good. But if Philopoemen

lose what is possible in striving for the impossible? There
are but two marks that every policy must aim at&mdash;honour and
expediency. Those to whom honour is a possible attainment
should stick to that, if they have political wisdom; those to
whom it is not must take refuge in expediency. To miss
both is the surest proof of unwisdom: and the men to do
that are clearly those who, while ostensibly consenting to obey
orders, carry them out with reluctance and hesitation. Therefore we must either show that we are strong enough to refuse
obedience, or, if we dare not venture even to suggest that, we
must give a ready submission to orders."</p></div2>
<div2 id="b24c15" type="chapter" n="15">

<p>Philopoemen, however, said that "People should not

suppose him so stupid as not to be able to
estimate the difference between the Achaean
and Roman states, or the superiority of the
power of the latter. But as it is the inevitable tendency of
the stronger to oppress the weaker, can it be expedient to assist
the designs of the superior power, and to put no obstacle in
their way, so as to experience as soon as possible the utmost
of their tyranny? Is it not, on the contrary, better to resist
and struggle to the utmost of our power? . . . And if they
persist in forcing their injunctions upon us,<note anchored="yes">Something is lost from the text.</note> . . . and if, by
reminding them of the facts we do something to soften their
resolution, we shall at any rate mitigate the harshness of their
rule to a certain extent; especially as up to this time the
Romans, as you yourself say, Aristaenus, have always made a
great point of fidelity to oaths, treaties, and promises to allies.
But if we at once condemn the justice of our own cause, and,
like captives of the spear, offer an unquestioning submission
to every order, what will be the difference between the
Achaeans and the Sicilians or Capuans, who have been notoriously slaves this long time past? Therefore it must either be
admitted that the justice of a cause has no weight with the
Romans, or, if we do not venture to say that, we must stand
by our rights, and not abandon our own cause, especially as
our position in regard to Rome is exceedingly strong and
<pb n="347"/>
honourable. That the time will come when the Greeks will
be forced to give unlimited obedience, I know full well. But
would one wish to see this time as soon or as late as possible?
Surely as late as possible! In this, then, my policy differs
from that of Aristaenus. He wishes to see the inevitable
arrive as quickly as possible, and even to help it to come: I
wish to the best of my power to resist and ward it off."</p>
<p>From these speeches it was made clear that while the
policy of the one was honourable, of the other undignified, both
were founded on considerations of safety. Wherefore while
both Romans and Greeks were at that time threatened with
serious dangers from Philip and Antiochus, yet both these
statesmen maintained the rights of the Achaeans in regard to
the Romans undiminished; though a report found its way
about that Aristaenus was better affected to the Romans than
Philopoemen. . . .

Athena there was celebrated throughout Greece, and was the central place of
worship for the Thessalians. The town stood in a rich plain on the river

treason. By these measures he raised expectations in the
minds of many, and was considered to be holding out great
hopes to all the Greeks. Nor were other parts of his life
and habits wanting in a certain royal magnificence. His
outward appearance was striking, and he was well endowed
with all the physical advantages requisite for a statesman. His
look and mien were alike dignified and such as became his
age. He had moreover avoided his father's weakness for wine

but was imitated in this respect by his intimates and friends.

the record of the arrangements made by the ten commissioners
in Asia, when settling the dominions of Antiochus, it appeared
that the Lycians had been given to the Rhodians, not as a
gift, but rather as friends and allies." But many were still dissatisfied with this solution of the matter. For the Romans
seemed to wish, by thus pitting Rhodes against Lycia, to exhaust
the accumulations and treasures of the Rhodians, because they
had heard of the recent conveyance of the bride of Perseus by
the Rhodians, and of their grand naval review. For shortly
before this the Rhodians had been holding, with great splendour and elaboration
of equipment, a review of all vessels belonging to them; the fact being that a vast quantity of timber
for ship-building had been presented to them by Perseus. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Laodice, daughter of

that the Lycian war was successfully concluded, they saw the
commencement of fresh trouble for themselves growing up.
For no sooner had the Romans arrived and made this
announcement to the Rhodians, than the Lycians began a
fresh revolt, and showed a determination of fighting to the last
extremity for autonomy and freedom. However, after hearing
the Roman envoys, the Rhodians made up their minds that the
Romans had been deceived by the Lycians, and forthwith
appointed Lycophron to lead an embassy to offer an explanation to the Senate. And the state of affairs was such that
there was momentary expectation of a fresh rising of the

Epimanes (the Madman), would sometimes
steal from the court, avoiding his attendants,
and appear roaming wildly about in any
chance part of the city with one or two companions. His
favourite place to be found was the shops of the silversmiths or goldsmiths, chatting and discussing questions of art
with the workers in relief and other artists; at another time he
would join groups of the people of the town and converse with
any one he came across, and would drink with foreign visitors
of the humblest description. Whenever he found any young
men carousing together he would come to the place without
giving notice, with fife and band, like a rout of revellers, and
often by his unexpected appearance cause the guests to rise and
run away. He would often also lay aside his royal robes, and,

and sometimes as tribune. And when he got the office and
took his seat on an ivory curule chair, after the fashion of the
Romans, he heard law cases which came on in the agora, and
decided them with the utmost seriousness and attention. This
conduct was very embarrassing to respectable people, some of
whom regarded him as a good natured easy-going man, and others
as a madman. In regard to making presents, too, his behaviour
was on a par with this. Some he presented with dice made
of gazelle horn, some with dates, others with gold. There
were even instances of his making unexpected presents to
men whom he met casually, and whom he had never seen
before. In regard to public sacrifices and the honours paid to
the gods, he surpassed all his predecessors on the throne; as
witness the Olympieium at Athens and the statues placed
round the altar at Delos. He used also to bathe in the
public baths, when they were full of the townspeople, pots of
the most expensive unguents being brought in for him; and on
one occasion on some one saying, "Lucky fellows you kings,
to use such things and smell so sweet!" without saying a
word to the man, he waited till he was bathing the next day,
and then coming into the bath caused a pot of the largest
size and of the most costly kind of unguent called <foreign lang="la">stacte</foreign> to be
poured over his head, so that there was a general rush of the
bathers to roll themselves in it; and when they all tumbled
down, the king himself among them, from its stickiness, there
was loud laughter. . . .

the war with Perseus, to be described in the twenty-seventh book, were briefly
these:&mdash;</note></p>
<p>In B.C. <date value="-174">174</date> Perseus forced the Dolopes, who had appealed against him
to Rome, to submit to his authority. After this successful expedition he
marched through Central and Northern Greece, visiting Delphi, where he
stayed three days, Phthiotid Achaia, and Thessaly. He carefully abstained from inflicting any damage in the districts through which he
passed, and tried to gain the confidence of the various states. In the
same year he made friendly advances to the Achaeans, who had forbidden
any Lacedaemonian to enter their territory, by offering to restore their
fugitive slaves. But in spite of the exertions of Xenarchus the Strategus,
the Achaeans refuse to make any change (<bibl n="Liv. 41.22">Livy, 41, 22</bibl>-24).</p>
<p>The same year saw also commotions in Aetolia, which were settled by
five Roman commissioners: and in Crete, on the old score of the status
of the Lycians. Q. Minucius was sent to settle this also (<bibl n="Liv. 41.25">Livy, 41, 25</bibl>).</p>
<p>In B. C. <date value="-173">173</date> Perseus entered on still more active intrigues in Greece,
and in spite of the wildest scandals that were afloat as to his tyranny, he
gained a powerful hold in Aetolia, Thessaly, and Perrhaebia. The Senate
accordingly sent Marcellus to Aetolia and Achaia, and App. Claudius to
Thessaly, to inquire into the facts; and a commission of five into Macedonia,
with directions to proceed afterwards to Alexandria (<bibl n="Liv. 42.5">Livy, 42, 5, 6</bibl>).</p>
<p>In B. C. <date value="-172">172</date> king Eumenes visited Rome and urged the Senate to take
measures in time to counteract the attempts of Perseus; warning them that
he had already obtained strong hold upon the Boeotians and Aetolians,
and had an inexhaustible recruiting ground in Thrace. That everywhere
he had secured the death or exile of the partisans of Rome, and was overrunning in arms Thessaly and Perrhaebia (<bibl n="Liv. 42.11">Livy, 42, 11</bibl>-13).</p>
<p>The Senate, already inclined to listen to these representations, was
still more inclined to do so by the defiant tone of Harpalus, the representative of king Perseus; by the attempted assassination of Eumenes by
emissaries of Perseus at Delphi on his home journey; by receiving a report from Greece from C. Valerius confirming the speech of Eumenes; and
lastly by the confession of one L. Rammius of Brundisium, that he had been
requested to poison certain Roman envoys who were accustomed to stay
at his house on their journeys to and from Macedonia and Greece (<bibl n="Liv. 42.15">Livy,
42, 15-17</bibl>).
<pb n="356"/></p>
<p>War was now determined on for the next year, and the praetor ordered
to enroll troops. And Eumenes also, now recovered from the wounds of
the assassins, made preparations to join in the struggle (<bibl n="Liv. 42.18">Livy, 42, 18</bibl>-27).</p>
<p>In B. C. <date value="-171">171</date>, fresh legions having been enrolled, and an army of sixteen
thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry ordered to Macedonia, envoys
appeared from Perseus demanding the reason. The Senate would not allow
them to enter the Pomoerium, but received them in the temple of Bellona:
and after listening to a report from Sp. Cavilius that Perseus had, among
other acts of hostility, taken cities in Thessaly and entered Perrhaebia in arms,
the Senate answered the Macedonian envoys that any complaint they had to
make must be made to the consul, P. Licinius, who would presently be in
Macedonia, but that they must not come into Italy again (<bibl n="Liv. 42.36">Livy, 42, 36</bibl>).</p>
<p>A few days afterwards five commissioners were sent into Greece, who
distributed the districts to be visited among themselves: Servius and
Publius Lentulus and Lucius Decimius were to go to Cephallenia, the
Peloponnese, and the west coast generally; Q. Marcius and Aulus Atilius
to Epirus, Aetolia, Thessaly, and thence to Boeotia and Euboea, where they
were to meet the Lentuli. Meanwhile a letter from Perseus, demanding the
cause of their coming and of the presence of troops in Macedonia, was received and left unanswered. After visiting the districts assigned to them,
in the course of doing which Marcius and Atilius had met Perseus on the
river Peneus, and granted him a truce to enable him to send envoys to

reinstated by a reaction in popular feeling. Then they obtained another decree
banishing the twelve men who, though not in office, had convened the league

cities of Boeotia as one nation to the discretion of the commissioners.
But this latter proposal was diametrically opposed to the policy of Marcius and his
colleagues. What suited that policy best was
to split up Boeotia into separate cities: and
they therefore received Lases and his party, as
well as the envoys from Chaeronea and Lebadea,
and all who came from single cities, with great favour and lavish
courtesy; but treated Ismenias with ostentatious neglect and
coldness. Some of the exiles<note anchored="yes">See note 2, page 356.</note> also attacked Ismenias and were

One party were for committing the town unconditionally to Rome; but the Coroneans
and Haliartians flocked to Thebes and vehemently maintained
that they ought to maintain the alliance with Perseus. For a
time neither of the two parties showed any disposition to give
in to each other; but when Olympichus of Coronea set the
example of changing sides and asserting that they ought to
cleave to the Romans, a great change and revolution came
over the feelings of the populace. First, they compelled
Dicetas to go on an embassy to Marcius and the other commissioners to excuse them for their alliance with Perseus. Next,
they expelled Neon and Hippias, crowding to their houses, and
bidding them go and make their own defence for the terms that
they had made; for they were the men who had negotiated the
alliance. When these men had left the town, the people immediately collected into the assembly and first voted honours and
gifts to the Romans, and then ordered the magistrates to push
on the alliance. Last of all they appointed ambassadors to
hand over the city to the Romans and to restore their exiles.

<p>Whilst these things were being accomplished at Thebes,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The cause of the exiles' triumph at Chalcis.</note>
the exiles in Chalcis appointed Pompides to
state their grievances against Ismenias, Neon,
and Dicetas. The bad policy of these men
being manifest, and the Romans lending their support to the
exiles, Hippias and his party were rendered so odious that
they were in danger of falling victims to the fury of the populace, until the Romans, by checking the assaults of the mob,
secured them a certain degree of safety.</p>
<p>When the Theban envoys arrived, bringing with them to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dissolution of the Boeotian league, B. C. <date value="-171">171</date>.</note>
the commissioners the decrees and honours I
have mentioned, a rapid change passed over
the face of things in each of the towns, for
they were separated by a very narrow interval from each other.
The commissioners with Marcius received the Theban envoys, complimented their town and counselled them to restore
the exiles, and bade the several towns send embassies to Rome
submitting themselves individually and unreservedly to the
protection of the Romans. Their policy, therefore, of splitting
up the league of the Boeotian towns, and of destroying the
popularity of the Macedonian royal house with the Boeotian
populace having thus completely succeeded, the commissioners
sent for Servius Lentulus from Argos, and leaving him in
charge at Chalcis went themselves to the Peloponnese; while
Neon a few days afterwards retired to Macedonia; and
Ismenias and Dicetas, being thrown at once into prison,
shortly afterwards put an end to their lives. Thus it came
about that the Boeotians, who had for a long period of
years, and through many strange vicissitudes, maintained a
national league, by now rashly and inconsiderately adopting
the cause of Perseus, and giving way to an outburst of unreasoning excitement, were entirely disintegrated and split up
into separate cities.</p>
<p>When Aulus and Marcius arrived at Argos, after communication with the council
of the Achaean league,<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Commissioners in the Peloponnese.</note>
they called upon Archon the Strategus to despatch a thousand men to Chalcis, to garrison

the prytanis that year was Agesilochus, a man of high rank,

to throw in their fortunes with those of Rome; and, among
other things, had counselled them to repair forty ships, in order
that, if any occasion for using them should arise, it should not
find them still in the midst of preparations, but ready to
answer to the call and to carry out their resolve at once. By
stating these facts to the Roman envoys, and showing them

<head>Perseus Sends a Statement to the Greeks</head>
<p>After the conferences had been held between the Roman
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Perseus sends a circular despatch to the Greek States.</note>
envoys and the Greeks, Perseus drew up a
despatch containing a statement of his case, and
the arguments employed on either side; partly
from an idea that he would thus be shown to
have the superiority of right on his side, and partly because he
wished to test the feelings of the several states. Copies of
this despatch he sent to the other states by his
ordinary letter-carriers; but to Rhodes he sent
also Antenor and Philip as ambassadors, who, on
their arrival in the island, handed over the document to the
magistrates, and a few days afterwards entered the Council
chamber and urged the Rhodians "To remain neutral for the
present and watch what happened; and, if the Romans attacked
Perseus in violation of the treaty, to endeavour to mediate.
For this was the interest of all, and pre-eminently of the
Rhodians, who more than most peoples desired equality and
freedom of speech, and were ever the protectors, not only of
their own liberty, but of that of the rest of Greece also; and
therefore ought to be proportionally careful to provide and
<pb n="360"/>
guard against a policy of an opposite tendency." These and
similar arguments of the envoys found favour with the Rhodian
people. But, as they were already pledged to an attitude of
friendship to Rome, the influence of the upper classes so far
prevailed that, though a friendly reception was given to the
Macedonian envoys, they demanded in their formal answer
that Perseus should not ask them to take any measure which
would involve the appearance of hostility to Rome. Antenor
and his colleagues would not accept this reply, but with thanks
for the kindness of their general reception, sailed back to

Rhodes in the second six months of the Prytany of Stratocles.
When the question came on for discussion,
Agathagetus, Rhodophon, Astymedes, and
many others were for sending the ships and
taking part in the war from the first, without
any further pretence; but Deinon and Polyaratus,
though really displeased at the favour already
shown to Rome, now for the present used the case of Eumenes
as their pretext, and began by that means to alienate the feelings
of the populace. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Jealousy of Eumenes.</note> There had in fact been a long standing feeling
of suspicion and dislike in the minds of the Rhodians against
Eumenes, dating from the time of his war with Pharnaces; when,
upon king Eumenes blockading the entrance
of the Hellespont to prevent ships sailing into
the Pontus, the Rhodians had interfered with
his design and thwarted him. This ill-feeling had again been
recently exasperated during the Lycian war on the question of
certain forts, and a strip of territory on the frontier of the
Rhodian Peraea, which was being damaged by some of
Eumenes's subjects. These incidents taken together made
the Rhodians ready to listen to anything against the king.
Seizing on this pretext, the party of Deinon tried to discredit the despatch, asserting that it did not come from the
<pb n="362"/>
Romans but from Eumenes, who wished to involve them
on any possible pretext in a war, and bring expense and
perfectly unnecessary suffering upon the people. In support
of their contention they put forward the fact that the man who
brought the letter was some obscure trainer or another; and
asserted that the Romans were not accustomed to employ such
messengers, but were rather inclined to act with unnecessary
care and dignity in the despatch of such missives. When
they said this they were perfectly aware that the letter had
really been written by Lucretius: their object was to persuade
the Rhodian people to do nothing for the Romans readily, but
rather to perpetually make difficulties, and thus give occasions
for offence and displeasure to crop up between the two nations.
For their deliberate purpose was to alienate Rhodes from the
Roman friendship, and to join it to that of Perseus, by every
means in their power. Their motives for thus clinging to
Perseus were that Polyaratus, who was ostentatious and vain,
had become heavily in debt; and that Deinon, who was
avaricious and unscrupulous, had from the first relied on
increasing his wealth by getting presents from princes and
kings. These speeches having been delivered, the Prytanis
Stratocles rose, and, after inveighing at some length against
Perseus, and speaking with equal warmth in praise of the
Romans, induced the people to confirm the decree for the
despatch of the ships. Forthwith six quadriremes were prepared, five of which were sent to Chalcis under the command
of Timagoras, and the other under the command of another
Timagoras to Tenedos. This latter commander fell in at
Tenedos with Diophanes, who had been despatched by
Perseus to Antiochus, and captured both him and his crew.
All such allies as arrived with offers of help by sea Lucretius
thanked warmly, but excused from taking part in this service,
observing that the Romans had no need of naval support. . . .</p>

<pb n="363"/>

some cavalry skirmishes, which were generally favourable to the
king, Perseus advanced nearer to the Roman camp, and a more
important battle was fought, in which the king again scored a considerable success with his cavalry and light-armed troops. The
Romans lost two hundred cavalry killed and as many prisoners

<p>After the Macedonian victory Perseus summoned

his Council, when some of his friends expressed an opinion that he ought to send an
embassy to the Roman general, to signify his
readiness even now to pay the Romans the
same amount of tribute as his father had formerly
undertaken to pay when beaten in war, and to
evacuate the same places. "For if," they argued,
"the Romans accept the terms the war will be ended in a
manner honourable to the king after his victory in the field;
and the Romans, after this taste of Macedonian valour, will be
much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or
harsh burden upon the Macedonians. And if, on the other
hand, in spite of the past, they prove obstinate and refuse to
accept them, the anger of heaven will with justice fall on them;
while the king by his moderation will gain the support of
Gods and men alike." The majority of his friends held this
view, and Perseus expressing his assent to it, Pantauchus, son
of Balacrus, and Midon of Beroea, were forthwith sent as
ambassadors to Licinius. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans are inexorable.</note> On their arrival,
Licinius summoned his Council, and the ambassadors having stated their proposals in accordance with their instructions, Pantauchus and his colleague

return as stern an answer as possible. For this is a peculiarity
<pb n="364"/>
of the Romans, which they have inherited from their ancestors,
and are continually displaying,&mdash;to show themselves most
peremptory and imperious in the presence of defeat, and most
moderate when successful: a very noble peculiarity, as every
one will acknowledge; but whether it be feasible under certain
circumstances may be doubted. However that may be, on the
present occasion they made answer that Perseus must submit
without reserve himself, and give the Senate full power to take
whatever measures it might think good concerning Macedonia
and all in it. On this being communicated to Pantauchus and
Midon, they returned and informed Perseus and his friends;
some of whom were roused to anger at this astonishing display
of haughtiness, and advised Perseus to send no more embassies
or messages about anything whatever. Perseus, however,
was not the man to take such a line. He sent again and
again to Licinius, with continually enhanced offers, and promising
a larger and larger sum of money. But as nothing that he
could do had any effect, and as his friends found fault with
him, and told him that, though he had won a victory, he was
acting like one who had been defeated and lost
all, he was at length compelled to renounce the
sending of embassies, and remove his camp back

<p>When the report of the favourable result for Perseus of

the cavalry engagement, and of the victory of
the Macedonians, spread through Greece, the
inclination of the populace to the cause of
Perseus blazed out like a fire, most of them
having up to that time concealed their real feelings. Their
conduct, to my mind, was like what one sees at gymnastic
contests. When some obscure and far inferior combatant
descends into the arena with a famous champion reputed to
be invincible, the spectators immediately bestow their favour
upon the weaker of the two, and try to keep up his spirits by
applause, and eagerly second his efforts by their enthusiasm.
And if he succeeds so far as even to touch the face of his
opponent, and make a mark to prove the blow, the whole of
the spectators again show themselves on his side. Sometimes
they even jeer at his antagonist: not because they dislike or
<pb n="365"/>
undervalue him, but because their sympathies are roused by the
unexpected, and they are naturally inclined to take the weaker
side. But if any one checks them at the right moment, they
are quick to change and see their mistake. And this is what
Cleitomachus is said to have done. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A scene at Olympia.</note> He had
the character of being an invincible athlete,
and, as his reputation was spread all over the
world, King Ptolemy is said to have been inspired with the
ambition of putting an end to it. He therefore had Aristonicus the boxer, who was thought to have unusual
physical capabilities for that kind of thing trained with extraordinary care, and sent to Greece. When he appeared on the
arena at Olympia a great number of the spectators, it seems,
immediately showed their favour for him, and cheered him on,
being rejoiced that some one should have had the courage to
make some sort of stand against Cleitomachus. But when, as
the fight went on, he showed that he was a match for his
antagonist, and even gave him a well-placed wound, there was
a general clapping of hands, and the popular enthusiasm
showed itself loudly on his side, the spectators calling out to
Aristonicus to keep up his spirits. Thereupon they say that
Cleitomachus stepped aside, and after waiting a short time to
recover his breath, turned to the crowd and asked them
"Why, they cheered Aristonicus, and supported him all they
could? Had they detected him in playing foul in the combat?
Or were they not aware that Cleitomachus was at that moment
fighting for the honour of Greece, Aristonicus for that of king
Ptolemy? Would they prefer an Egyptian to carry off the
crown by beating Greeks, or that a Theban and Boeotian
should be proclaimed victor in boxing over all comers?"
Upon this speech of Cleitomachus, they say that such a revulsion of feeling came over the spectators, that Aristonicus in
his turn was conquered more by the display of popular feeling
than by Cleitomachus.</p></div2>

<head>The Unthinking Multitude</head>
<p>What happened in the case of Perseus in regard to the
feeling of the multitude was very similar to this. For if any one
had pulled them up and asked them plainly, in so many words,
whether they wished such great power to fall to one man, and
were desirous of trying the effect of an utterly irresponsible despotism,
<pb n="366"/>  I presume that they would have promptly bethought
themselves, recanted all they had said, and gone to the other
extreme of feeling. Or if some one had briefly recalled to their
recollection all the tyrannical acts of the royal house of Macedonia
from which the Greeks had suffered, and all the benefits they
had received from the Romans, I imagine they would have at
once and decisively changed their minds. However, for the
present, at the first burst of thoughtless enthusiasm, the people
showed unmistakable signs of joy at the news, being delighted at
the unlooked-for appearance of a champion able to cope with
Rome. I say this much to prevent any one, in ignorance of human
nature, from bringing a rash charge of ingratitude against the
Greeks for the feelings which they displayed at that time. . . .</p></div2>

on the leather between them the missile was loosely set.
When the sling was being swung round, with the two thongs

<head>Charops of Epirus</head>
<p>Cephalus came [to Pella] from Epirus. He had long
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">What induced the leading men in Epirus to join Perseus.</note>
been connected by friendship with the royal
house of Macedonia, but was now compelled
by the force of circumstances to embrace the
side of Perseus, the cause of which was as
follows: There was a certain Epirote named Charops, a man
of high character, and well disposed to Rome, who, when
Philip was holding the passes into Epirus, was the cause of
his being driven from the country, and of Titus Flamininus
conquering Epirus and Macedonia. Charops had a son
named Machatus, who had a son also named Charops.
Machatus having died when this son was quite a youth, the
elder Charops sent his grandson with a suitable retinue to
Rome to learn to speak and read Latin. In the course of
<pb n="368"/>
time the young man returned home, having made many intimate friendships at Rome. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Charops.</note> The elder Charops
then died, and the young man, being of a restless
and designing character, began giving himself airs and attacking the distinguished men in the country. At first he was not
much noticed, Antinous and Cephalus, his superiors in age and
reputation, managing public affairs as they thought right. But
when the war with Perseus broke out, the young man at once
began laying information against these statesmen at Rome,
grounding his accusations on their former intimacy with the
Macedonian royal family; and by watching everything they said
or did, and putting the worst construction on it, suppressing
some facts and adding others, he succeeded in getting his accusations against them believed. Now Cephalus had always shown
good sense and consistency, and at the present crisis had
adhered to a course of the highest wisdom. He had begun
by praying heaven that the war might not take place, or the
question come to the arbitrament of arms; but when the war
was actually begun, he was for performing all treaty obligations
towards Rome, but for not going a step beyond this, or showing any unbecoming subservience or officiousness. When
Charops then vehemently accused Cephalus at Rome, and represented everything that happened contrary to the wishes of the
Romans as malice prepense on his part, at first he and others
like him thought little of the matter, being not conscious of
entertaining any designs hostile to Rome. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Aetolian leaders arrested.</note> But when they saw

in Epirus,&mdash;they at length began to be anxious about what
would happen, and to consider their position. They resolved
therefore to try every possible means to prevent themselves
from being similarly arrested without trial and carried to
Rome, owing to the slanders of Charops. It was thus that
Cephalus and his friends were compelled, contrary to their
original policy, to embrace the cause of Perseus. . . .</p></div2>

possession of them. Therefore Meleager and his colleagues

<p>About this time there came also ambassadors from the

Rhodians towards the end of summer, Agesilochus, Nicagoras, and Nicander. The objects
of their mission were to renew the friendship
of Rhodes and Rome; to obtain a license for importing
corn from the Roman dominions; and to defend their
state from certain charges that had been brought against
it. For there were most violent party contests going on in
Rhodes: Agathagetus, Philophron, Rhodophon, and Theaetetus resting all their hopes on the Romans, and Deinon and
Polyaratus on Perseus and the Macedonians; and as these
divisions gave rise to frequent debates in the course of their
public business, and many contradictory expressions were
used in their deliberations, plenty of opportunities were
afforded to those who wished to make up stories against the
state. On this occasion, however, the Senate affected to be
ignorant of all this, though perfectly acquainted with what
went on in the island, and granted them a license to import
one hundred thousand medimini of corn from Sicily. This
answer was given by the Senate to the Rhodians separately.
Audience was then given collectively to all the envoys from
the rest of Greece that were united in the same policy. . . .</p></div2>

man whose accusations of himself obtained the greater credit
from the fact that he had never been supposed to be at enmity with him. He reminded Thoas first of the events in
the time of Antiochus; and then reproached him for ingratitude to himself, because, when he had been surrendered to
Rome, he obtained an unexpected release at the intercession
of Nicander and himself. He ended by calling upon the

place a garrison in Acarnania; for they had

advice of Diogenes was the opposite. "A garrison," he
said, "ought not to be put into any of their cities, for that
was what was done to those who had been at war with
Rome and had been beaten; whereas the Acarnanians had
done no wrong, and did not deserve in any respect to have
a garrison thrust upon them. Chremes and Glaucus and
their partisans were slandering their political opponents, and
desired to bring in a garrison which would support their selfseeking

<p>The Greeks made up their minds that this embassy

required much consideration on their part.
They therefore called to council such men as

Arcesilaus and Ariston of Megalopolis, Stratius
of Tritaea, Xenon of Patrae and Apollonides of
Sicyon. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Lycortas is for complete neutrality.</note> But Lycortas stood firm to his original
view: which was that they should send no help

co-operation with either would be disadvantageous to the
Greeks at large, because he foresaw the overwhelming power
which the successful nation would possess; while active

already in former times been in opposition to many of the

up his mind that the Achaeans must take active
part with Rome and her allies, it happened most
conveniently that Attalus made his proposal to
him and found him ready to accept it. Archon
at once eagerly promised his support to Attalus's
request: and when thereupon that prince's envoys
appeared at the next congress, and addressed
the Achaeans about the restoration of king Eumenes's honours,
begging them to do this for the sake of Attalus, the people did
not show clearly what their feeling was, but a good many rose
to speak against the proposal from many various motives.
Those who were originally the advisers of the honours being
paid to the king were now desirous to confirm the wisdom of
their own policy; while those who had private reasons for
animosity against the king thought this a good opportunity
for revenging themselves upon him; while others again, from
spite against those who supported him, were determined that
Attalus should not obtain his request. Archon, however, the
Strategus, rose to support the envoys,&mdash;for it was a matter
that called for an expression of opinion from the Strategus,&mdash;
but after a few words he stood down, afraid of being thought
to be giving his advice from interested motives and the hope
of making money, because he had spent a large sum on his
office. Amidst a general feeling of doubt and hesitation,
Polybius rose and delivered a long speech. But that part of it
which best fell in with the feelings of the populace was that in
which he showed that "The original decree of the
Achaeans in regard to these honours enacted that
such honours as were <term>improper and contrary to law</term>
were to be abolished, but not <emph>all</emph> honours by any means. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Polybius.</note> That
Sosigenes and Diopeithes and their colleagues, however, who
were at the time judges, and for private reasons personally hostile
to Eumenes, seized the opportunity of overturning all the erections put up in honour of the king; and in doing so had gone
beyond the meaning of the decree of the Achaeans, and beyond
the powers entrusted to them, and, what was worst of all, beyond the demands of justice and right. For the Achaeans
had not resolved upon doing away with the honours of
<pb n="377"/>
Eumenes on the ground of having received any injury at his
hands; but had taken offence at his making demands beyond
what his services warranted, and had accordingly voted to
remove everything that seemed excessive. As then these
judges had overthrown these honours, because they had a greater
regard for the gratification of their private enmity than for the
honour of the Achaeans, so the Achaeans, from the conviction
that duty and honour must be their highest consideration, were
bound to correct the error of the judges, and the unjustifiable
insult inflicted upon Eumenes: especially as, in doing so, they
would not be bestowing this favour on Eumenes only, but on
his brother Attalus also." The assembly having expressed their
agreement with this speech, a decree was written out ordering
the magistrates to restore all the honours of king Eumenes,
except such as were dishonourable to the Achaean league or
contrary to their law. It was thus, and at this time, that
Attalus secured the reversal of the insult to his brother
Eumenes in regard to the honours once given him in the
Peloponnese. . . .

to make an invasion of Illyria and Macedonia difficult for the
Dardani. Their journey through this region was accompanied
by much suffering; but they reached Scodra, and being there
informed that Genthius was at Lissus, they sent a message to
him. He promptly responded: and having been admitted to an

to which their instructions referred. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Genthius temporises.</note> Genthius

for Genthius remained of the same mind,&mdash;
willing to join with Perseus in his war, but professing to be in want of money. Perseus disregarded the hint, and sent another mission
under Hippias to conclude the treaty, without taking any notice
of the main point, while professing a wish to do whatever
Genthius wished. It is not easy to decide whether to ascribe
such conduct to mere folly, or to a spiritual delusion. For my
part, I am inclined to regard it as a sheer spiritual delusion when
men aim at bold enterprises, and risk their life, and yet neglect the most important point in their plans, though they see it
all the time and have the power to execute it. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The dislike of Perseus to give money turned out happily for Greece.</note>
For I do not think it will be denied by any

statesmen, I do not say on a great scale, but even to a moderate extent, they would all&mdash;Greeks and kings alike&mdash;have
yielded to the temptation. As it was, he happily did not take
that course, which would have given him, if successful, an

course: which resulted in confining the numbers of the Greeks

coast road from Thessaly into Macedonia. Marcius however, after only a
rather severe skirmish with the light-armed troops of Hippias, effected the
passage of the mountains and descended upon Dium. The king was taken
by surprise: he had not secured the pass of Tempe, which would have cut
off the Romans from retreat; and he now hastily retired to Pydna. Q.
Marcius occupied Dium, but after a short stay there retired upon Phila, to
get provisions and secure the coast road. Whereupon Perseus reoccupied
Dium, and contemplated staying there to the end of the summer. Q.
Marcius took Heracleum, which was between Phila and Dium, and made
preparations for a second advance on Dium. But the winter (B. C. <dateRange from="-169" to="-168">169</dateRange>-168) was now approaching, and he contented himself with seeing that the

despatched Polybius with orders to prevent the

from consideration for the Achaeans, or from a desire to prevent
Appius from obtaining any success, it is difficult to say. Polybius, however, returned to the Peloponnese and found that the
letter from Epirus had arrived, and that the Achaean congress
had been soon afterwards assembled at Sicyon. He was
therefore in a situation of great embarrassment. When Cento's

Agesilochus, son of Hegesias, and Nicagoras, son of Nicander,
were sent to Rome; Agepolis, Ariston, and Pancrates to the
Consul and commander of the fleet, with instructions to renew
the friendship of the Cretans with Rome, and to make their
defence against the accusations that were being uttered against
their state; while Agesilochus and his colleagues were at the
same time to make a proposal about a license to export corn
from the Roman dominions. The speech made by these

answer, he said that "He himself paid no attention to those calumnies, and advised them not

<pb n="384"/>
their interests to do."  Did the Consul act
thus because he was suspicious of Antiochus,
and was afraid, if he conquered Alexandria, that
he would prove a formidable second enemy to themselves, seeing
that the war with Perseus was becoming protracted, and the war
for Coele-Syria had already broken out? Or was it because he
saw that the war with Perseus was all but decided, now that
the Roman legions had entered Macedonia, and because he
had confident hopes of its result; and therefore wished, by
instigating the Rhodians to interfere between the kings, to give
the Romans a pretext for taking any measures they might
think good concerning them? It would not be easy to say
for certain; but I am inclined to believe that it was the latter,
judging from what shortly afterwards happened to the Rhodians.
However, Agepolis and his colleagues immediately afterwards
proceeded to visit Gaius Marcius Figulus: and, having received
from him still more extraordinary marks of favour than from
Quintus Marcius, returned with all speed to Rhodes. When
they received the report of the embassy, and knew that the

Next he dwelt on the last conquest of it by his father
Antiochus; and finally he denied that any such agreement
was made between the late king Ptolemy and his father as
the Alexandrian ministers asserted, to the effect that Ptolemy
was to take Coele-Syria as a dowry when he married Cleopatra,
<pb n="387"/>

of the justice of his claim, he sailed down the

Genthius to make an alliance with him, returned
before the winter, and reported that Genthius
would undertake to join in the war with Rome if
he was paid three hundred talents and received
proper securities. Thereupon Perseus sent Pantauchus, one

to agree to pay Genthius the money; to interchange oaths of
alliance; to take from Genthius such hostages as he himself

might select, and send them at once to Macedonia; and to allow
Genthius to have such hostages from Perseus as he might name

for the transport of the three hundred talents. Pantauchus immediately started and met Genthius at Mebe&omacr;n, in the country of
the Labeates, and quickly bought the young monarch over to
join in the projects of Perseus. The treaty having been sworn
to and reduced to writing, Genthius at once sent the hostages

especially urgent that he should prepare for a contest at sea;

form would be easily accomplished by himself and the forces
he might despatch. Genthius yielded to the advice and set
about his preparations, naval and military alike: and Perseus,
as soon as the ambassadors and hostages from Genthius
entered Macedonia, set off from his camp on the River
Elpeius,<note anchored="yes">Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 44.8">44, 8</bibl>) calls it the Enipeus (<term>Fersaliti</term>),

first act on meeting them was to take the oaths to the alliance

in the presence of the whole body of cavalry; for he was very
anxious that the Macedonians should know of the adhesion of
Genthius, hoping that this additional advantage would have
the effect of raising their courage: and next he received the
hostages and handed over his own to Olympion and his
colleagues, the noblest of whom were Limnaeus, the son of
Polemocrates, and Balacrus, son of Pantauchus. Lastly, he
sent the agents who had come for the money to Pella, assuring
them that they would receive it there: and appointed the ambassadors for Rhodes to join Metrodorus at Thessalonica, and
hold themselves in readiness to embark.</p>
<p>This embassy succeeded in persuading the Rhodians to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">and sends others to Eumenes and Antiochus.</note>

Perseus next sent Herophon, who had been
similarly employed before, on a mission to
Eumenes; and Telemnastos of Crete to Antiochus to urge
him "Not to let the opportunity escape; nor to imagine that
Perseus was the only person affected by the overbearing and
oppressive conduct of Rome: but to be quite sure that, if he

<p>In venturing upon a narrative of the intrigues of Perseus

of great embarrassment. For to give full and
accurate details of the negotiations, which these
two kings conducted in secret between themselves, appeared
to me to be an attempt open to many obvious criticisms and
exceedingly liable to error: and yet to pass over in complete
silence what seemed to have exercised the most decisive influence in the war, and which alone can explain many of the
subsequent events, seemed to me to wear the appearance of
a certain sluggishness and entire want of enterprise. On the
whole, I decided to state briefly what I believed to be truth,
and the probabilities and surmises on which I founded that
opinion; for I was, in fact, during this period more struck
than most people at what happened.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b29c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Reasons to Suspect Intrigue between Eumenes and Perseus</head>
<p>I have already stated<note anchored="yes">In a previous part of the book now lost. See <bibl n="Liv. 44.25">Livy, 44, 25</bibl>.</note> that Cydas of Crete, while, serving
<pb n="392"/>
in the army of Eumenes and held in especial honour by him,
had in the first place had interviews with
Cheimarus, one of the Cretans in the army of
Perseus, and again had approached the walls of
Demetrias, and conversed first with Menecrates, and then with Antimachus.
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Romans become suspicious of Eumenes, and ostentatiously transfer their favour to his brother Attalus.</note> Again, that
Herophon had been twice on a mission from
Perseus to Eumenes, and that the Romans on that account
began to have reasonable suspicions of king Eumenes, is
rendered clear from what happened to Attalus. For they
allowed this prince to come to Rome from Brundisium, and
to transact the business he had on hand, and finally gave him
a favourable answer and dismissed him with every mark of
kindness, although he had done them no service of any importance in the war with Perseus; while Eumenes, who had
rendered them the most important services, and had assisted
them again and again in their wars with Antiochus and
Perseus, they not only prevented from coming to Rome, but
bade him leave Italy within a certain number of days, though
it was mid-winter. Therefore it is quite plain that some intriguing had been taking place between Perseus and Eumenes
to account for the alienation of the Romans from the latter.
What this was, and how far it went, is our present subject of
inquiry.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b29c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Eumenes Intrigues With Perseus</head>
<p>We can easily satisfy ourselves that Eumenes cannot

have wished Perseus to be the victor in the war
and become supreme in Greece. For to say
nothing of the traditional enmity and dislike
existing between these two, the similarity of
their respective powers was sufficient to breed
distrust, jealousy, and, in fact, the bitterest animosity between them. It was always open to
them to intrigue and scheme against each other
secretly, and that they were both doing. For
when Eumenes saw that Perseus was in a bad way, and was
hemmed in on every side by his enemies, and would accept
any terms for the sake of putting an end to the war, and was
sending envoys to the Roman generals year after year with
this view; while the Romans also were uneasy about the
<pb n="393"/>
result, because they made no real progress in the war until
Paulus took the command, and because
Aetolia was in a dangerous state of excitement, he conceived that it would not be impossible that the
Romans would consent to some means of ending the war and
making terms: and he looked upon himself as the most proper
person to act as mediator and effect the reconciliation. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">B. C. <date value="-168">168</date>.</note> With
these secret ideas in his mind, he began sounding Perseus by
means of Cydas of Crete, the year before, to find out how
much he would be inclined to pay for such a chance. This
appears to me to be the origin of their connexion with each
other.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b29c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Struggle between Eumenes and Perseus</head>
<p>Two kings, one of whom was the most unprincipled
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The bargain attempted between Eumenes and Perseus.</note>
and the other the most avaricious in the world,
being now pitted against each other, their
mutual struggles presented a spectacle truly
ridiculous. Eumenes held out every kind of
hope, and threw out every species of bait, believing that he
would catch Perseus by such promises. Perseus, without
waiting to be approached, rushed to the bait held out to him,
and made for it greedily; yet he could not make up his mind
to swallow it, to such an extent as to give up any money.
The sort of huckstering contest that went on between them
was as follows. Eumenes demanded five hundred talents as
the price of his abstention from co-operating with the Romans
by land and sea during the fourth year of the war, and fifteen
hundred for putting an end to the war altogether, and promised to give hostages and securities for his promise at once.
Perseus accepted the proposal of hostages, named the
number, the time at which they were to be sent, and the
manner of their safe custody at Cnosus. But as to the money,
he said that it would be disgraceful to the one who paid, and
still more to the one who received it, to be supposed to remain
neutral for hire; but the fifteen hundred talents he would
send in charge of Polemocrates and others to Samothrace,
to be held as a deposit there. Now Perseus was master of
Samothrace; but as Eumenes, like a poor physician, preferred
a retaining-fee to a payment after work, he finally gave up
the attempt, when he found that his own craftiness was no
<pb n="394"/>
match for the meanness of Perseus. They thus parted on
equal terms, leaving, like good athletes, the battle of avarice
a drawn one. Some of these details leaked out at the time,
and others were communicated subsequently to Perseus's
intimate friends; and he has taught us by them that every
vice is clinched, so to speak, by avarice.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b29c9" type="chapter" n="9">
<head>The Avarice of Perseus</head>
<p>I add the further question from my own reflexions,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Reflexions on the blindness of the avaricious kings.</note>
whether avarice is not also short-sighted? For
who could fail to remark the folly of both the
kings? How could Eumenes on the one hand
expect to be trusted by a man with whom he was on such bad
terms; and to get so large a sum of money, when he was
able to give Perseus absolutely no security for recovering
it, in case of his not carrying out his promises? And
how could he expect not to be detected by the Romans in
taking so large a sum? If he had concealed it at the time he
certainly would not have done so long. Moreover, he would
have been bound at any rate, in return for it, to have adopted
the quarrel with Rome; in which he would have been certain
to have lost the money and his kingdom together, and very
probably his life also, by coming forward as an enemy of the
Romans. For if, even as it was, when he accomplished
nothing, but only imagined it, he fell into the gravest dangers,
what would have happened to him if this design had been
brought to perfection? And again, as to Perseus&mdash;who could
fail to be surprised at his thinking anything of higher importance, or more to his advantage, than to give the money and
allow Eumenes to swallow the bait? For if, on the one hand,
Eumenes had performed any part of his promises, and had
put an end to the war, the gift would have been well bestowed;
and if, on the other hand, he had been deceived of that
hope, he could at least have involved him in the certain
enmity of Rome; for he would have had it entirely in his
own power to make these transactions public. And one may
easily calculate how valuable this would have been to Perseus,
whether he succeeded or failed in the war: for he would
have regarded Eumenes as the guilty cause of all his misfortunes, and could in no way have retaliated upon him more
effectually than by making him an enemy of Rome. What
<pb n="395"/>
then was the root of all this blind folly? Nothing but
avarice. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">See Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. Aem. 12"><title>Aemilius,</title> ch. 12</bibl>.</note> It could have been nothing else; for, to save himself

committed themselves past all excuse. For they at once
sent ambassadors to Crete, to renew their friendly relations
with the entire Cretan people, and to urge that, in view of the
dangers that threatened them, they should throw in their lot with
the people of Rhodes, and hold the same people to be friends
and enemies as they did, and also to address the separate cities
to the same effect. . . .</p></div2>

of the Syrian war. And the reason is one
which I have often mentioned. Though their
subjects are simple and without complications,
they seek the name and reputation of historians
not from the truth of their facts, but the number
of their books; and accordingly they are obliged
to give petty affairs an air of importance, and fill out and give
rhetorical flourishes to what was originally expressed briefly;
dress up actions and achievements which were originally quite
secondary; expatiate on struggles; and describe pitched battles,
in which sometimes ten or a few more infantry fell, and still
fewer cavalry. As for sieges, local descriptions, and the like,
one cannot say that their treatment is adequate, because they
have no facts to give. But a writer of universal history must
pursue a different plan; and therefore I ought not to be condemned for
minimising the importance of events, if I sometimes pass over affairs that have met with wide fame and
laboured description, or for mentioning them with brevity; but
I ought to be trusted to give to each subject the amount of discussion which it deserves. Such historians as I refer to, when
they are describing in the course of their work the siege, say
of Phanoteia, or Coroneia, or [Haliartus], are forced to display all the contrivances, bold strokes, and other features of a
siege; and when they come to the capture of Tarentum, the
sieges of Corinth, Sardis, Gaza, Bactra, and, above all, of
Carthage, they must draw on their own resources to prolong
the agony and heighten the picture, and are not at all satisfied
with me for giving a more truthful relation of such events as they
really occurred. Let this statement hold good also as to my
description of pitched battles and public harangues, as well as
other departments of history; in all of which I might fairly
claim considerable indulgence, as also in what is now about to
<pb n="397"/>
be narrated, if I am detected in some inconsistency in the
substance of my story, the treatment of my facts, or the style
of language; and also if I make some mistakes in the names

indeed the magnitude of my work is a sufficient excuse in all
these points, unless, indeed, I am ever detected in deliberate

of time, and seeing that it was disadvantageous to all the Greeks,

they had only to congratulate the Romans." Such was the

But the Senate seized the opportunity of making an example of the Rhodians, and produced an

embassy as having been sent by the Rhodians
in the interests either of the Greeks or themselves, but in those of Perseus. For if they had
meant to send an embassy in behalf of the Greeks, the proper
time for doing so was when Perseus was plundering the territory
and cities of Greece, while encamped for nearly two years in
Thessaly. But to let that time pass without notice, and to
come now desiring to put an end to the war, at a time when
the Roman legions had entered Macedonia, and Perseus was
closely beleagured and almost at the end of his hopes, was a
clear proof to any one of observation that the Rhodians had
sent their embassy, not with the desire of ending the war, but
to rescue and save Perseus to the best of their ability. Therefore they deserved no indulgence at the hands of the Romans
at this time, nor any favourable reply." Such was the Senate's
answer to the Rhodians. . . .</p></div2>

<head>Uncertainties of Fortune</head>
<p>One is often reminded of the words of Demetrius of
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Demetrius of Phalerum on mutability.</note>
Phalerum. In his treatise on Fortune, wishing
to give the world a distinct view of her mutability,
he fixed upon the period of Alexander, when
that monarch destroyed the Persian dynasty, and thus expresses
himself: "If you will take, I don't say unlimited time or many
<pb n="401"/>
generations, but only these last fifty years immediately preceding
our generation, you will be able to understand the cruelty of
Fortune. For can you suppose, if some god had warned
the Persians or their king, or the Macedonians or their king,
that in fifty years the very name of the Persians, who once
were masters of the world, would have been lost, and that the
Macedonians, whose name was before scarcely known, would
become masters of it all, that they would have believed it?
Nevertheless it is true that Fortune, whose influence on our life
is incalculable, who displays her power by surprises, is even
now I think, showing all mankind, by her elevation of the
Macedonians into the high prosperity once enjoyed by the
Persians, that she has merely lent them these advantages until
she may otherwise determine concerning them." And this has
now come to pass in the person of Perseus; and indeed
Demetrius has spoken prophetically of the future as though he
were inspired. And as the course of my history brought me to
the period which witnessed the ruin of the Macedonian kingdom,
I judged it to be right not to pass it over without proper
remark, especially as I was an eye-witness of the transaction.
It was a case I thought both for enlarging on the theme
myself, and for recalling the words of Demetrius, who appeared
to me to have shown something more than mere human
sagacity in his remarks; for he made a true forecast of the
future almost a hundred and fifty years before the event. . . .</p></div2>

<p>In the Peloponnesus a mission arrived before the end
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Autumn of B.C. <date value="-169">169</date>.</note>
of the winter from the two kings, Ptolemy (Philometor) and Ptolemy (Physcon), asking for help.
This gave rise to repeated and animated discussions. The party of Callicrates and Diophanes were against
granting the help; while Archon, Lycortas, and Polybius were
for sending it to the kings in accordance with the terms of their
alliance. For by this time it had come to pass that the younger
Ptolemy had been proclaimed king by the people (at Alexandria),
owing to the danger which threatened them; and that the
elder had subsequently returned from Memphis, and was reigning jointly with his sister. As they stood in need of every
kind of assistance, they sent Eumenes and Dionysodorus to
the Achaeans, asking a thousand foot and two hundred horse,
with Lycortas to command the foot and Polybius the horse.
They sent a message also to Theodoridas of Sicyon, urging
him to hire them a thousand mercenaries. For the kings
chanced to have become intimately acquainted with these particular men, owing to the transactions I have related before.
The ambassadors arrived when the Achaean congress was in
session in Corinth. They therefore came forward, and after
recalling the many evidences of friendship shown by the
Achaeans to the kingdom of Egypt, and describing to them
the danger in which the kings then were, they entreated them
to send help. The Achaeans generally were ready enough to
go to the help of the kings (for both now wore the diadem
and exercised regal functions), and not only with a detachment,
but with their full levy.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Winter of B.C. <dateRange from="-169" to="-168">169</dateRange>-<date value="-168">168</date>.</note> But Callicrates and

<head>The Achaeans Agree to Help the Ptolemies</head>
<p>The people were alarmed lest they should be thought

to fail the Romans in any way: and accordingly
Lycortas and Polybius rose in their turn, and,
among other advice which they impressed upon
them, argued that "When in the previous year the Achaeans
had voted to join the Roman army with their full levy, and
sent Polybius to announce that resolution, Quintus Marcius,
while accepting the kindness of their intention, had yet stated
that the assistance was not needed, since he had won the pass
into Macedonia. Their opponents therefore were manifestly
using the need of helping the Romans merely as a pretext for
preventing this aid being sent to Alexandria. They entreated
the Achaeans, in view of the greatness of the danger surrounding
the king of Egypt, not to neglect the right moment for acting;
but keeping in mind their mutual agreement and good services,
and above all their oaths, to fulfil the terms of their agreement."</p>
<p>The people were once more inclined to grant the aid when
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Callicrates defeats the motion, but at a smaller meeting at Sicyon Polybius prevails.</note>
they heard this: but Callicrates and his party
managed to prevent the decree being passed, by
staggering the magistrates with the assertion

help abroad in public assembly.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)n a)gora=.</foreign> The objection, though it served to divert the magistrates from
going on with the proposition at the time, seems to have been got over before
the meeting at Sicyon; unless, indeed, the latter was considered to be of a
different nature in regard to the age of those attending. But we have no information
as to this restriction of thirty years of age,&mdash;whether it was universal,
or confined to particular occasions. This passage would seem to point to the
latter alternative.</note>  But a short time afterwards
a meeting was summoned at Sicyon, which was
attended not only by the members of the council, but by all citizens over thirty years of age;
and after a lengthened debate, Polybius especially dwelling on
the fact that the Romans did not require assistance,&mdash;in which he
was believed not to be speaking without good reason, as he had
spent the previous summer in Macedonia at the headquarters
<pb n="404"/>
of Marcius Philippus,&mdash;and also alleging that, even supposing
the Romans did turn out to require their active support, the
Achaeans would not be rendered incapable of furnishing it by
the two hundred horse and one thousand foot which were to
be despatched to Alexandria,&mdash;for they could, without any inconvenience, put thirty or forty thousand men into the field,&mdash;
the majority of the meeting were convinced, and were inclined
to the idea of sending the aid. Accordingly, on the second of
the two days on which, according to the laws, those who
wished to do so were bound to bring forward their motions,
Lycortas and Polybius proposed that the aid should be sent.
Callicrates, on the other hand, proposed to send ambassadors
to reconcile the two Egyptian kings with Antiochus. So once
more, on these two motions being put, there was an animated
contest; in which, however, Lycortas and Polybius got a considerable majority on their side. For there was a very wide
distinction between the claims of the two kingdoms. There
were very few instances to be found in past times of any act
of friendship on the part of Syria to the Greeks,&mdash;though the
liberality of the present king was well known in Greece,&mdash;but
from Egypt the acts of kindness in past times to the Achaeans
had been as numerous and important as any one could possibly
expect. By dwelling on this point Lycortas made a great
impression, because the distinction between the two kingdoms
in this respect was shown to be immense. For it was as difficult to count up all the benefactions of the Alexandrine kings,
as it was impossible to find a single act of friendship done by
the dynasty of Antiochus to the Achaeans. . . .</p></div2>

Senate had sent a mission under T. Numisius to do so. But
this really made against their argument: for Titus Numisius

<pb n="405"/>
had returned to Rome completely unsuccessful in the object
of their mission. However, as Polybius and his party did
not wish to speak against the despatch, from consideration for
Marcius, they retired from the discussion: and it was thus

the Roman commander Gaius Popilius Laenas.
Upon the king greeting him from some distance,
and holding out his right hand to him, Popilius
answered by holding out the tablets which contained the decree of the Senate, and bade
Antiochus read that first: not thinking it right,
I suppose, to give the usual sign of friendship until he knew
the mind of the recipient, whether he were to be regarded as a
friend or foe. On the king, after reading the despatch, saying
that he desired to consult with his friends on the situation,
Popilius did a thing which was looked upon as exceedingly
overbearing and insolent. Happening to have a vine stick in
his hand, he drew a circle round Antiochus with it, and ordered
him to give his answer to the letter before he stepped out of

that circumference. The king was taken aback by this haughty
proceeding. After a brief interval of embarrassed silence, he
replied that he would do whatever the Romans demanded.

one and all greeted him with warmth. The contents of the

in a state of excitement. They promptly caused the invading
army to evacuate the country, and remained there to keep
watch until the forces had sailed away for Syria. Thus did
the Romans save the kingdom of Ptolemy, when it was all but
sinking under its disasters. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The previous defeat of Perseus really secured the salvation of Egypt.</note> Fortune indeed so

year, pretending that, even if the disaster of the
Gallic rising had not happened to the kingdom,
he should have come to Rome, to congratulate
the Senate, and to receive some mark of its
approval for having been actively engaged on
their side and loyally shared in all their dangers;
but, as it happened, he had been forced to come
at that time to Rome owing to the danger from
the Gauls. Upon finding a general welcome from everybody,
owing to the acquaintance formed with him on the campaign,
and the belief that he was well disposed to them, and meeting
with a reception that surpassed his expectation, the young
man's hopes were extraordinarily raised, because he did not
know the true reason of this friendly warmth. The result was
that he narrowly escaped ruining his own and his brother's
fortunes, and indeed the entire kingdom. The majority at Rome
were thoroughly angry with king Eumenes, and believed that
he had been playing a double game during the war, keeping up
communications with Perseus, and watching his opportunity
against them: and accordingly some men of high rank got
Attalus under their influence, and urged him to lay aside the
character of ambassador for his brother, and to speak in his
own behalf; as the Senate was minded to secure a separate
kingdom and royal government for him, because of their displeasure with his brother. This excited the ambition of
Attalus still more, and in private conversation he signified his
assent to those who advised this course. Finally, he arranged
with some men of position that he would actually appear
before the Senate and deliver a speech on the subject.

<head>Stratius Sent to Attalus</head>
<p>While Attalus was engaged on this intrigue, Eumenes,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Stratius is sent to dissuade Attalus from his meditated treason.</note>
fearing what would happen, sent his physician
Stratius to Rome, putting him in possession of
the facts, and charging him to employ every means
to prevent Attalus from following the advice
of those who wished to ruin their kingdom. On arriving at
Rome and getting Attalus by himself, he used a great variety
of arguments to him (and he was a man of great sense
and powers of persuasion), and at length, with much trouble,
succeeded in his object, and in recalling him from his
mad project. He represented to him that "he was already
practically joint-king with his brother, and only differed from
him in the fact that he wore no diadem, and was not called
king, though in everything else he possessed an equal and
identical authority: that in the future he was the acknowledged
heir to the crown, and with no very distant prospect of possession;
as the king, from the weak state of his health, was in constant expectation of his departure, and being childless could
not, even if he wished it, leave the crown to any one else."
(For in fact that natural son of his, who afterwards succeeded
to the crown, had not as yet been acknowledged.) "Above all,
he was surprised at the hindrance Attalus was thus interposing
to the measures necessary at that particular crisis. For they
ought to thank heaven exceedingly if they proved able, even
with hearty co-operation and unanimity, to repel the threatened
attack of the Gauls; but if he should at such a time quarrel
with and oppose his brother, it was quite clear that he would
ruin the kingdom, and deprive himself both of his present
power and his future expectations, and his other brothers also
of the kingdom and the power they possessed in it." By these
and similar arguments Stratius dissuaded Attalus from taking
any revolutionary steps.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b30c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Attalus At Rome</head>
<p>Accordingly, when Attalus appeared before the Senate,
he congratulated it on what had happened; expatiated on the
loyalty and zeal shown by himself in the war with Perseus; and
urged at some length that the Senate should send envoys to
restrain the audacity of the Gauls, and compel them to confine
themselves once more to their original boundaries. He also
said something about the cities of Aeneus and Maronea, desiring
<pb n="409"/>
that they might be given as a free gift to himself. But he said
not a single word against the king, or about the partition of the
kingdom. The senators, supposing that he would interview
them privately on a future occasion upon these points, promised to send the envoys, and loaded him lavishly with the
customary presents, and, moreover, promised him these cities.
But when, after receiving these marks of favour, he at once
left Rome without fulfilling any of its expectations, the
Senate, though foiled in its hopes, had nothing else which it
could do; but before he had got out of Italy it declared
Aeneus and Maronea free cities,&mdash;thus rescinding its promise,&mdash;and sent Publius Licinius at
the head of a mission to the Gauls. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Embassy to Galatia.</note> And what

by Philocrates, the second by Philophron
and Astymedes. For when the Rhodians received the answer given to the embassy of
Agesipolis immediately after the battle of Pydna,
they understood the anger and threatening
attitude of the Senate towards them, and promptly despatched
these embassies. Astymedes and Philophron, observing in
the course of public and private conversations the suspicions
and anger entertained towards them at Rome, were reduced to
a state of great discouragement and distress. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Terror of the Rhodian envoys at the threat of war.</note>
But when one of the praetors mounted the
Rostra and urged the people to declare war
against Rhodes, then indeed they were beside themselves with
terror at the danger that threatened their country. They
assumed mourning garments, and in their various interviews
with their friends dropped the tone of persuasion or demand,
and pleaded instead, with tears and prayers, that they would not
adopt any measure of supreme severity towards them. A few
days afterwards Antony, one of the tribunes, introduced them
to the Senate, and dragged the praetor who advised the war
down from the Rostra. Philophron spoke first, and was
<pb n="410"/>
followed by Astymedes; and, having thus uttered the
proverbial "swan's song," they received an answer which, while
freeing them from actual fear of war, conveyed a bitter and
stern rebuke from the Senate for their conduct. Now Astymedes considered himself to have made a good speech on
behalf of his country, but did not at all satisfy
the Greeks visiting or residing at Rome. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A criticism on the speech of the Rhodian Astymedes.</note> For
he afterwards published the speech containing his argument in defence, which, to all those
into whose hands it fell, appeared absurd and quite unconvincing. For he rested his plea not alone on the merits of his
country, but still more on an accusation of others. Comparing
the good services done and the co-operation undertaken by
the others, he endeavoured to deny or minimise them; while
he exaggerated those of Rhodes as far above their actual
amount as he could. The errors of others, on the contrary,
he inveighed against in bitter and hostile terms, while those of
the Rhodians he attempted to cloak and conceal, in order
that, by this comparison, those of his own country might appear
insignificant and pardonable, those of others grave and beyond
excuse, "all of whom," he added, "had already been pardoned
before." But this sort of pleading can in no circumstances be
considered becoming to a statesman. Take the case of the
betrayal of secrets. It is not those who, for fear or gain, turn
informers that we commend; but those who endure any torture
and punishment rather than involve an accomplice in the same
misfortune. These are the men whom we approve and consider noble. But a man who, from some undefined alarm,
exposes to the view of the party in power all the errors of
others, and who recalls what time had obliterated from the
minds of the ruling people, cannot fail to be an object of dislike to all who hear of it.</p></div2>

Theaetetus at once envoy and navarch to convey it at the beginning of summer, accompanied by an embassy under Rhodophon,

with the Romans. They acted thus because they wished that,
if the embassy failed by an adverse answer at Rome, the failure
might take place without the people having passed a formal
decree, the attempt being made solely on the initiative of the
navarch, and the navarch having by the law power to act in
such a case. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The astuteness of the Rhodian policy.</note> For the fact was that the republic
of Rhodes had been administered with such
consummate statesmanship, that, though it had
for nearly a hundred and forty years been engaged in conjunction with Rome in actions of the greatest importance and
glory, it had never yet made an alliance with her. Nor
ought I to omit stating the reason of this policy of the
Rhodians. They wished that no ruler or prince should be
entirely without hope of gaining their support or alliance; and
they therefore did not choose to bind or hamper themselves
beforehand with oaths and treaties; but, by remaining uncommitted, to be able to avail themselves of all advantages as they
arose. But on this occasion they were much bent upon
securing this mark of honour from Rome, not because they
were anxious for the alliance, or because they were afraid of
any one else at the time except the Romans, but because they
wished, by giving an air of special importance to their design,
to remove the suspicions of such as were inclined to entertain
unfavourable thoughts of their state. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Caunus, in Peraea, and Mylassa, in Caria, revolt.</note> For immediately after

they conquered the Mylassians and Alabandians in the field,
these two peoples having combined their forces to attack
Orthosia. But when the decree concerning the Lycians and

<head>Greek States and the War With Perseus</head>
<p>I have already directed my readers' attention to the
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The three classes of men who in the various states got into trouble for their conduct during the Macedonian war.</note>
policy of Deinon and Polyaratus. For Rhodes
was not the only place which experienced grave
danger and important changes. Nearly all the
states suffered in the same way. It will therefore be instructive to take a review of the
policy adopted by the statesmen in the several
countries, and to ascertain which of them will be proved to
have acted with wisdom, and which to have done otherwise:
in order that posterity in similar circumstances of danger may,
with these examples as models, so to speak, before their eyes,
be able to choose the good and avoid the bad with a genuine
insight; and may not in the last hour of their lives dishonour
their previous character and achievements, from failing to perceive where the path of honour lies. There were, then,
three different classes of persons who incurred blame for their
conduct in the war with Perseus. One consisted of those
who, while displeased at seeing the controversy brought to a
decisive end, and the control of the world fall into the power of
one government, nevertheless took absolutely no active steps for
or against the Romans, but left the decision entirely to Fortune.
A second consisted of those who were glad to see the
question settled, and wished Perseus to win, but were unable to
convert the citizens of their own states or the members of
their race to their sentiments. And a third class consisted of
those who actually succeeded in inducing their several states
<pb n="413"/>
to change round and join the alliance of Perseus. Our
present task is to examine how each of these conducted their
respective policies.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b30c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Examples of Three Classes of Statesmen</head>
<p>In the last class were Antinous, Theodotus, and Cephalus,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Antinous, Theodotus, and Cephalus of the Molossi are instances of the third class.</note>
who induced the Molossians to join Perseus.
These men, when the results of the campaign
went completely against them, and they found
themselves in imminent danger of the worst
consequences, put a bold face upon it and met
an honourable death in the field. These men deserve our
commendation for their self-respect, in refusing to allow themselves to lapse into a position unworthy of their previous life.</p>
<p>Again, in Achaia and Thessaly and Perrhaebia several<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Several instances of the first class in Achaia Phiotis, Thessaly, and Perrhaebia.</note>
persons incurred blame by remaining neutral,
on the ground that they were watching their
opportunity, and were in heart on the side of
Perseus; and yet they never let a word to that
effect get abroad, nor were ever detected in
sending letter or message to Perseus on any subject whatever,
but conducted themselves with unexceptionable discretion.
Such men as these therefore very properly determined to face
judicial inquiry and stand their judgment, and to make every
effort to save themselves. For it is quite as great a sign of
cowardice to abandon life voluntarily when a man is conscious
of no crime, from fear of the threats of political opponents or
of the power of the conquerors, as it is to cling to life to the
loss of honour.</p>
<p>Again, in Rhodes and Cos, and several other cities, there<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Instances of the second class in Rhodes, Cos, and other places.</note>
were men who favoured the cause of Perseus,
and who were bold enough to speak in behalf
of the Macedonians in their own cities, and to
inveigh against the Romans, and to actually
advise active steps in alliance with Perseus, but who were not
able to induce their states to transfer themselves to alliance
with the king. The most conspicuous of such men were in
Cos the two brothers Hippias and Diomedon, and in Rhodes
Deinon and Polyaratus.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b30c8" type="chapter" n="8">
<head>Shameless Conduct of the Supporters of Perseus</head>
<p>And it is impossible not to view the policy of these
men with disapproval. To begin with, all their fellow-citizens
<pb n="414"/>  were aware of everything they had done or said;
in the next place, the letters were intercepted and made
public which were coming from Perseus to them, and
from themselves to Perseus, as well as the messengers from
both sides: yet they could not make up their minds to
yield and put themselves out of the way, but still disputed
the point. The result of this persistence and clinging
to life, in the face of a desperate position, was that they
quite ruined their character for courage and resolution,
and left not the least ground for pity or sympathy in the
minds of posterity. For being confronted with their own
letters and agents, they were regarded as not merely unfortunate, but rather as shameless. One of those who went
on these voyages was a man named Thoas. He had frequently
sailed to Macedonia on a mission from these men, and when
the decisive change in the state of affairs took place, conscious
of what he had done, and fearing the consequences, he retired
to Cnidos. But the Cnidians having thrown him into prison,
he was demanded by the Rhodians, and on coming to Rhodes
and being put to the torture, confessed his crime; and his
story was found to agree with everything in the cipher of
the intercepted letters, and with the despatches from Perseus
to Deinon, and from Deinon and Polyaratus to him. Therefore it was a matter of surprise that Deinon persuaded himself
to cling to life and submit to so signal an exposure.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b30c9" type="chapter" n="9">
<head>Polyaratus of Rhodes</head>
<p>But in respect to folly and baseness of spirit, Polyaratus
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The vain attempts of Polyaratus to escape,</note>
surpassed Deinon. For when Popilius Laenas
charged king Ptolemy to send Polyaratus to
Rome, the king, from a regard both to Polyaratus himself and his country, determined not to send him
to Rome but to Rhodes, this being also what Polyaratus himself asked him to do. Having therefore caused a galley to
be prepared, the king handed him over to Demetrius, one of
his own friends, and despatched him, and wrote a despatch to
the Rhodians notifying the fact. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">at Phaselis,</note> But touching at Phaselis in
the course of the voyage, Polyaratus, from some
notion or another which he had conceived,
took suppliant branches in his hand, and fled for safety to the
city altar. If any one had asked him his intention in thus
<pb n="415"/>
acting, I am persuaded that he could not have told it. For if
he wanted to go to his own country, where was the need of suppliant branches? For his conductors were charged to take him
there. But if he wished to go to Rome, that was sure to take
place whether he wished it or no. What other alternative was
there? Other place that could receive him with safety to himself
there was none. However, on the people of Phaselis sending
to Rhodes to beg that they would receive Polyaratus, and take
him away, the Rhodians came to the prudent resolution of
sending an open vessel to convoy him; but forbade the captain
of it to actually take him on board, on the ground that the
officers from Alexandria had it in charge to deliver the man
in Rhodes. When the vessel arrived at Phaselis, and its captain, Epichares, refused to take the man on board, and
Demetrius, who had been deputed by the king for that business, urged him to leave the altar and resume his voyage; and
when the people of Phaselis supported his command, because
they were afraid they would incur some blame from Rome on
that account, Polyaratus could no longer resist the pressure of
circumstances, but once more went on board Demetrius's galley.
But in the course of the voyage he seized an opportunity of
doing the same again at Caunus, flying for
safety there in the same way, and begging the
Caunians to save him. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">at Caunus,</note> Upon the Caunians rejecting him, on
the grounds of their being leagued with Rhodes, he sent
messages to Cibyra, begging them to receive him in their
city, and to send him an escort. He had some claim upon
this city, because the sons of its tyrant, Pancrates, had been
educated at his house; accordingly, they listened to his request, and did what he asked. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">and at Cibyra.</note> But when he
got to Cibyra, he placed himself and the
Cibyratae into a still greater difficulty than that which he
caused before when at Phaselis. For they neither dared to
retain him in their town for fear of Rome, nor had the
power of sending him to Rome, because of their ignorance of the sea, being an entirely inland folk. Eventually they were reduced to send envoys to Rhodes and the
Roman proconsul in Macedonia, begging them to take over
the man. Lucius Aemilius wrote to the Cibyratae, ordering
<pb n="416"/>
them to keep Polyaratus in safe custody; and to the Rhodians
to make provision for his conveyance by sea and his safe
delivery upon Roman territory. Both peoples obeyed the
despatch: and thus Polyaratus eventually came to Rome, after
making a spectacle of his folly and cowardice to the best of
his ability; and after having been, thanks to his own folly,
four times surrendered&mdash;by king Ptolemy, the people of
Phaselis, the Cibyratae, and the Rhodians.</p>
<p>The reason of my having dwelt at some length on the
story of Polyaratus and Deinon is not that I have any desire
to trample upon their misfortunes, for that would be ungenerous in the last degree; but in order that, by clearly showing
their folly, I might instruct those who fall into similar difficulties
and dangers how to take a better and wiser course. . . .</p></div2>

to congratulate the Roman commanders on the
event. And as now all power tended towards
Rome, in every city those who were regarded
as of the Romanising party were in the
ascendant, and were appointed to embassies
and other services. Accordingly they flocked into Macedonia&mdash;from Achaia, Callicrates, Aristodamus, Agesias, and
Philippus; from Boeotia, Mnasippos; from Acarnania, Chremas; from Epirus, Charops and Nicias; from Aetolia, Lyciscus

once. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">A scene in a Roman theatre.</note> But on their beginning to play the
tune, accompanied by appropriate movements,
he sent to them to say that they were not playing well, and must put more excitement into it. At first they
<pb n="419"/>
did not know what to make of this, until one of the lictors
showed them that they must form themselves into two companies, and facing round, advance against each other as
though in a battle. The fluteplayers caught the idea at
once, and, adopting a motion suitable to their own wild strains,
produced a scene of great confusion. They made the middle
group of the chorus face round upon the two extreme groups,
and the fluteplayers, blowing with inconceivable violence and
discordance, led these groups against each other. The members of the chorus
meanwhile rushed, with a violent stamping which shook the stage, against those opposite them, and
then faced round and retired. But when one of the chorus,
whose dress was closely girt up, turned round on the spur of
the moment and raised his hands, like a boxer, in the face of
the fluteplayer who was approaching him, then the spectators
clapped their hands and cheered loudly. Whilst this sort of
sham fight was going on, two dancers were brought into the
orchestra to the sound of music; and four boxers mounted
upon the stage, accompanied by trumpeters and clarion
players. The effect of these various contests all going on
together was indescribable. But if I were to speak about
their tragic actors, I should be thought by some to be
jesting.<note anchored="yes">From Athenaeus, xiv. 4, p. 615. It seems to be part of some strictures

<head>Eumenes Prevented from Visiting Rome</head>
<p>Just as he had got his answer, news came that
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">To prevent a visit from Eumenes the Senate pass a decree forbidding all kings to visit Rome.</note>
Eumenes was on his way. This caused the
Senators much embarrassment. They were
thoroughly incensed with him, and were entirely fixed in their sentiments towards him;
and yet they did not wish to betray themselves.
For having proclaimed to all the world that
this king was their foremost and most esteemed friend, if they
now admitted him to an interview and allowed him to plead
his cause, they must either, by answering as they really thought
and in harmony with their sentiments, signalise their own
folly in having marked out such a man in past times for
special honour; or if, in deference to appearances, they gave
him a friendly answer, they must disregard truth and the
interests of their country. Therefore, as both these methods of
proceeding could have consequences of a disagreeable nature,
they hit upon the following solution of the difficulty. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Eumenes stopped at Brundisium.</note> On the
ground of a general dislike of the visits of kings, they published
a decree that "no king was to visit Rome." Having been
informed subsequently that Eumenes had landed
at Brundisium in Italy, they sent the quaestor to
convey the decree to him, and to bid him to
communicate with himself if he wanted anything from the
Senate; or, if he did not want anything, to bid him depart at
the earliest possible opportunity from Italy. When the
quaestor met the king and informed him of the decree, the
latter, thoroughly understanding the intention of the Senate,
said not a single word, except that "he wanted nothing."</p>
<p>This is the way in which Eumenes was prevented from
coming to Rome. And it was not the only important
result of this decree. For the Gauls were at that time threatening the kingdom of Eumenes; and it was soon made
apparent that by this repulse the king's allies were all greatly
depressed, while the Gauls were doubly encouraged to press
<pb n="422"/>
on the war. And it was in fact their desire to humiliate him
in every possible way that induced the Senate to adopt this
resolution.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Winter of B.C. <dateRange from="-167" to="-166">167</dateRange>-166.</note> These things were going on at the

one could properly find fault with them for this,
as far as Delos and Lemnos were concerned, for
they had of old laid claim to them; but there
is good reason for reproaching them in respect to the territory
of Haliartus. Haliartus was nearly the most ancient city in
Boeotia; had met with a heavy misfortune: instead of endeavouring in every possible way to restore it,&mdash;to contribute
to its utter annihilation, and to deprive its dispossessed inhabitants of even their hopes for the future, was an act which
would be thought worthy of no Greek nation, and least of
all of the Athenians. They open their own territory to all

consonant with the spirit of their State. However, the Senate
granted them Delos and Lemnos. Such was the decision in

<head>Grand Festival At Daphne</head>

games in Macedonia held by the Roman proconsul Aemilius
Paulus, wishing to out do Paulus by the splendour of his
liberality, he sent envoys to the several cities
announcing games to be held by him at
Daphne; and it became the rage in Greece
to attend them. The public ceremonies began
with a procession composed as follows: first
<pb n="426"/>
came some men armed in the Roman fashion, with their
coats made of chain armour, five thousand in the prime of
life. Next came five thousand Mysians, who were followed
by three thousand Cilicians armed like light infantry, and
wearing gold crowns. Next to them came three thousand
Thracians and five thousand Gauls. They were followed by
twenty-thousand Macedonians, and five thousand armed with
brass shields, and others with silver shields, who were followed
by two hundred and forty pairs of gladiators. Behind these
were a thousand Nisaean cavalry and three thousand native
horsemen, most of whom had gold plumes and gold crowns,
the rest having them of silver. Next to them came what are
called "companion cavalry," to the number of a thousand,
closely followed by the corps of king's "friends" of about the
same number, who were again followed by a thousand picked
men; next to whom came the <term>Agema</term> or guard, which was
considered the flower of the cavalry, and numbered about a
thousand. Next came the "cataphract" cavalry, both men
and horses acquiring that name from the nature of their
panoply; they numbered fifteen hundred. All the above men
had purple surcoats, in many cases embroidered with gold and
heraldic designs. And behind them came a hundred six-horsed,
and forty four-horsed chariots; a chariot drawn by four elephants
and another by two; and then thirty-six elephants in single file
with all their furniture on.</p>
<p>The rest of the procession was almost beyond description,
but I must give a summary account of it. It consisted of
eight hundred young men wearing gold crowns, about a thousand
fine oxen, foreign delegates to the number of nearly three
hundred, and eight hundred ivory tusks. The number of
images of the gods it is impossible to tell completely: for representations of every god or demigod
or hero accepted by mankind were carried there, some gilded and others adorned with
gold-embroidered robes; and the myths, belonging to each,
according to accepted tradition, were represented by the most
costly symbols. Behind them were carried representations of
Night and Day, Earth, Heaven, Morning and Noon. The best
idea that I can give of the amount of gold and silver plate is this:
One of the king's friends, Dionysius his secretary, had a thousand
<pb n="427"/>
boys in the procession carrying silver vessels, none of which
weighed less than a thousand drachmae;<note anchored="yes">A drachma may be taken as between a sixth and a seventh of an ounce.</note> and by their side
walked six hundred young slaves of the king holding gold
vessels. There were also two hundred women sprinkling unguents from gold boxes; and after them came eighty women
sitting in litters with gold feet, and five hundred in litters with
silver feet, all adorned with great costliness. These were the
most remarkable features of the procession.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b31c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>The King's Behavior at the Festival</head>
<p>The festival, including the gladiatorial shows and hunting,
lasted thirty days, in the course of which there was continual
round of spectacles. During the first five of these everybody
in the gymnasium anointed himself with oil scented with
saffron in gold vessels, of which there were fifteen, and the
same number scented with cinnamon and nard. On the
following days other vessels were brought in scented with
fenugreek, marjoram, and lily, all of extraordinary fragrancy.
Public banquets were also given, at which couches were prepared, sometimes for a thousand and sometimes for fifteen
hundred, with the utmost splendour and costliness.</p>
<p>The whole of the arrangements were made personally by the
king. He rode on an inferior horse by the side of the procession, ordering one part to advance, and another to halt, as
occasion required; so that, if his diadem had been removed,
no one would have believed that he was the king and the master
of all; for his appearance was not equal to that of a moderately
good servant. At the feasts also he stood himself at the
entrance, and admitted some and assigned others their places;
he personally ushered in the servants bringing the dishes; and
walking about among the company sometimes sat down and
sometimes lay down on the couches. Sometimes he would
jump up, lay down the morsel of food or the cup that he was
raising to his lips, and go to another part of the hall; and
walking among the guests acknowledge the compliment, as
now one and now another pledged him in wine, or jest at any
recitations that might be going on. And when the festivity
had gone on for a long time, and a good many of the guests had
departed, the king was carried in by the mummers, completely
shrouded in a robe, and laid upon the ground, as though he
<pb n="428"/>
were one of the actors; then, at the signal given by the music,
he leapt up, stripped, and began to dance with the jesters; so
that all the guests were scandalised and retired. In fact every
one who attended the festival, when they saw the extraordinary
wealth which was displayed at it, the arrangements made in the
processions and games, and the scale of the splendour on which
the whole was managed, were struck with amazement and
wonder both at the king and the greatness of his kingdom:
but when they fixed their eyes on the man himself, and the
contemptible conduct to which he condescended, they could
scarcely believe that so much excellence and baseness could
exist in one and the same breast.<note anchored="yes">Hultsch prints in parallel columns the text of this fragment as it appears

were those with Astymedes from Rhodes, Eureus

gave audience to these last. The ambassadors
from Prusias complained of king Eumenes,
alleging that he had taken certain places belonging to their
country, and had not in any sense evacuated Galatia, or obeyed
the decrees of the Senate; but had been supporting all who
<pb n="429"/>
favoured himself, and depressing in every possible way those
who wished to shape their policy in accordance with the

<p>The Senate next called in the Rhodians and heard
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Rhodians appeal against the injury done to their trade, B. C. <date value="-165">165</date>.</note>
what they had to say. When Astymedes entered,
he adopted a more moderate and more effective
line of argument than on his former embassy. He
omitted the invectives against others, and took
the humble tone of men who are being flogged, begging to be forgiven, and declaring that his country had suffered sufficient
punishment, and a more severe one than its crime deserved. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Astymedes.</note> And
then he went briefly through the list of the Rhodian
losses. "First, they have lost Lycia and Caria,
which had already cost them a large sum of
money, having been forced to support three wars against them;
while at the present moment they have been deprived of a considerable revenue which they used to draw from those countries.
But perhaps," he added, "this is as it should be: you gave
them to our people as a free gift, because you regarded us
with favour; and in now recalling your gift, because you suspect
and are at variance with us, you may seem only to be acting
reasonably. But Caunus, at any rate, we purchased from
Ptolemy's officers for two hundred talents; and Stratoniceia we
received as a great favour from Antiochus, son of Seleucus;
and from those two towns our people had a revenue of a
hundred and twenty talents a year. All these sources of revenue
<pb n="430"/>
we have surrendered, in our submission to your injunctions.
From which it appears that you have imposed a heavier
penalty on the Rhodians for one act of folly, than on the
Macedonians that have been continually at war with you. But
the greatest disaster of all to our State is that the revenue
from its harbour has been abolished by your making Delos a
free port; and by your depriving our people of that independence by which the harbour, as well as other interests of the
States, were maintained in suitable dignity.<note anchored="yes">He means that, they being no longer able to decide in mercantile affairs
independently of Rome, the prestige (<foreign lang="greek">prostasi/a</foreign>), and consequently the popularity,
of this harbour is destroyed.</note> And it is easy
to satisfy yourselves of the truth of my words. Our revenue
from harbour dues amounted in past years to one million
drachmae, from which you have now taken one hundred
and fifty thousand; so that it is only too true, gentlemen of Rome, that your anger has affected the resources
of the country. Now, if the mistake committed, and the
alienation from Rome, had been shared in by the entire
people, you might perhaps have seemed to be acting rightly
in maintaining a lasting and irreconcilable anger against
us; but if the fact is made clear to you that it was an exceedingly small number who shared in this foolish policy, and that
these have all been put to death by this very people itself,
why still be irreconcilable to those who are in no respect
guilty? Especially when to every one else you are reputed
to exhibit the highest possible clemency and magnanimity.
Wherefore, gentlemen, our people having lost their revenues,
their freedom of debate, and their position of independence, in
defence of which in time past they have been ever willing to
make any sacrifices, now beg and beseech you all, as having
been smitten sufficiently, to relax your anger, and to be reconciled and make this alliance with them: that it may be made
manifest to all the world that you have put away your anger
against Rhodes, and have returned to your old feelings and
friendship towards them." Such among others were the
words of Astymedes. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Senate is mollified by this speech and by</note> He was thought to have

to explain that "The league had neither heard
the defence of the accused persons, nor given
any decision whatever concerning them; but
wished the Senate to take measures in regard
to these men, that they might have a trial and not perish
uncondemned. They begged that, if possible, the Senate
should itself conduct the investigation, and declare who are the
persons guilty of those charges; but, if its variety of business
made it impossible to do this itself, that it should intrust the
business to the Achaeans, who would show by their treatment
of the guilty their detestation of their crime." The Senate
recognised that the tone of the embassy was in conformity
with its own injunctions, but still felt embarrassed how to act.
Both courses were open to objection. To judge the case of
the men was, it thought, not a task it ought to undertake; and
to release them without any trial at all evidently involved ruin
to the friends of Rome. In this strait the Senate, wishing
to take all hope from the Achaean people of the restitution of
the men who were detained, in order that they might obey
without a murmur Callicrates in Achaia, and in the other
states those who sided with Rome, wrote the following answer:
"We do not consider it advisable either for ourselves or
for your nationalities that these men should return home."
The publication of this answer not only reduced the men who
<pb n="432"/>
had been summoned to Italy to complete despair and dejection, but was regarded by all Greeks as a common sorrow, for
it seemed to take away all hope of restoration from these
unfortunate men. When it was announced in Greece the
people were quite crushed, and a kind of desperation invaded the minds of all; but Charops and Callicrates, and
all who shared their policy, were once more in high
spirits. . . .</p></div2>

<p>A large number of embassies having come to
Rome, the Senate gave a reply to Attalus and Athenaeus. For
Prusias, not content with earnestly pressing his accusations himself against Eumenes and Attalus, had also instigated the Gauls
and Selgians (in Pisidia), and many others in Asia, to adopt
the same policy; consequently king Eumenes had sent his
brothers to defend him against the accusations thus brought.
On their admission to the Senate they were thought to have
made a satisfactory defence against all accusers; and finally
returned to Asia, after not only rebutting the accusations,
but with marks of special honour. The Senate, however, did
not altogether cease to be suspicious of Eumenes and Antiochus.
They sent Gaius Sulpicius and Manius Sergius as envoys to
investigate the state of Greece; to decide the question of
territory that had arisen between Megalopolis and the Lacedaemonians; but, above all, to give attention to the proceedings
of Antiochus and Eumenes, and to discover whether any
warlike preparations were being made by either of them, or any
combination being formed between them against Rome. . . .</p></div2>

a mere boy, to do anything. But now, being in the very prime

demanding that the Romans should restore him to his kingdom, which belonged to him by a far better right than to the
children of Antiochus. He entered at great length upon
arguments to the same effect, affirming that Rome was his
country and the nurse of his youth; that the sons of the
Senators were all to him as brothers, and the Senators as
fathers, because he had come to Rome a child, and was then

was, it seems to me, a mistrust inspired by the vigorous time

many opportunities. Demetrius understood the hint, but said

hostage; for it was absurd that, when the boy Antiochus had

<p>Demetrius having thus delivered himself in vain of his

done. But he was naturally of a lofty spirit, and possessed
sufficient daring to carry out his resolutions. He promptly
called Diodorus, who had recently arrived from Syria, to his
aid, and confided his secret purpose to him. Diodorus had
had the charge of Demetrius as a child, and was a man of
considerable adroitness, who had besides made a careful
inspection of the state of affairs in Syria. He now pointed out
to Demetrius that "The confusion caused by the murder of
Octavius,&mdash;the people mistrusting Lysias, and Lysias mistrusting the people, while the Senate was convinced that the
lawless murder of their envoy really originated with the
king's friends,&mdash;presented a most excellent opportunity for
his appearing on the scene: for the people there would
promptly transfer the crown to him, even though he were to
arrive attended by but one slave; while the Senate would
not venture to give any further assistance or support to Lysias
after such an abominable crime. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Demetrius resolves to escape from Rome, and again consults Polybius.</note> Finally, it was quite possible

begged him to lend his assistance, and to join him in contriving
to manage his escape.</p>
<p>There happened to be at Rome a certain Menyllus of<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Menyllus of Alabanda (in Caria) helps him by hiring a vessel.</note>
Alabanda, on a mission from the elder Ptolemy
to confront and answer the younger before the

was a strong friendship and confidence, and
Polybius therefore thought him just the man for the purpose
in hand. He accordingly introduced him with all speed to
Demetrius, and with warm expressions of regard. Being
trusted with the secret, Menyllus undertook to have the necessary
ship in readiness, and to see that everything required for the
<pb n="441"/>
voyage was prepared. Having found a Carthaginian vessel
anchored at the mouth of the Tiber, which had been on sacred
service, he chartered it. (These vessels are carefully selected
at Carthage, to convey the offerings sent by the Carthaginians
to their ancestral gods at Tyre.) He made no secret about
it, but chartered the vessel for his own return voyage; and
therefore was able to make his arrangements for provisions also
without exciting suspicion, talking openly with the sailors and
making an appointment with them.</p></div2>

<p>When the shipmaster had everything ready, and nothing

remained except for Demetrius to do his part, he
sent Diodorus to Syria to gather information, and
to watch the disposition of the people there.
His foster-brother Apollonius took part in this expedition;
and Demetrius also confided his secret to the two brothers
of Apollonius, Meleager and Menestheus, but to no one else
of all his suite, though that was numerous. These three
brothers were the sons of the Apollonius who occupied so
important a position at the court of Seleucus, but who had
removed to Miletus at the accession of Antiochus Epiphanes.
As the day agreed upon with the sailors approached, it was
arranged that one of his friends should give an entertainment
to serve as an excuse for Demetrius going out. For it was
impossible that he should sup at home; as it was his constant
habit, when he did so, to invite all his suite. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Polybius sends a warning to Demetrius.</note> Those who were in
the secret were to leave the house after supper and go to the

ill and confined to his bed; but he was kept acquainted with all that was going on by constant communications
from Menyllus. He was therefore exceedingly anxious, knowing Demetrius to be fond of conviviality and full of youthful
wilfulness, lest, by the entertainment being unduly prolonged,
some difficulty should arise from over-indulgence in wine to
prevent his getting away. He therefore wrote and sealed a
small tablet; and just as it was getting dusk sent a servant of
his own, with orders to ask for Demetrius's cupbearer and give
him the tablet, without saying who he was or from whom he

and at once pretending that he felt sick, he left
the banquet escorted by his friends. Arrived
at his lodging, he sent away those of his servants
who were not suited to his purpose to Anagnia, ordering them
to take the hunting nets and hounds and meet him at Cerceii,
where it had been his constant custom to go boar hunting,

that orders had arrived from the king which made it necessary
for him to remain at Rome for the present, and to send some
of the most trustworthy of his young men to his Majesty, to
inform him of what had been done about his brother. He
should not, therefore, he said, go on board himself; but the
young men who were to sail would come about midnight. The
shipmasters made no difficulty about it, as the passage money
for which they had originally bargained was in their hands;
<pb n="443"/>
and they had long made all their preparations for sailing, when
Demetrius and his friends arrived about the third watch.
There were altogether eight of them, besides five slaves and
three boys. Menyllus entered into conversation with them,
showed them the provisions in store for the voyage, and commended them earnestly to the care of the shipmaster and
crew. They then went on board, and the pilot weighed anchor
and started just as day was breaking, having absolutely no
idea of the real state of the case, but believing that he was
conveying some soldiers from Menyllus to Ptolemy.</p></div2>

was likely to make any inquiry for Demetrius
or those who had gone with him. For those
of his household who stayed in the city supposed him to have gone to Cerceii; and those
at Anagnia were expecting him to come there
too. The flight from Rome, therefore, was entirely unremarked;
until one of his slaves, having been flogged at Anagnia, ran off
to Cerceii, expecting to find Demetrius there; and not finding
him, ran back again to Rome, hoping to meet him on
the road. But as he failed to meet him anywhere, he went and
informed his friends in Rome and the members of his household who had been left behind in his house. But it was not
until the fourth day after his start that, Demetrius being looked
for in vain, the truth was suspected. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Senate is summoned, but decides not to attempt pursuit.</note> On the

<pb n="445"/>
colleagues saw that Ptolemy had collected a formidable corps of
mercenaries, they reminded him of their commission, which
was to restore him "without a war," and at last persuaded him
to go as far as Side (in Pamphylia), and there disband his
mercenaries, give up his idea of invading Cyprus, and meet
them on the frontiers of Cyrene. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">He, however, takes about 100 Cretans back with him to Africa.</note> Meanwhile, they said that

landing at Apis.</p></div2>

<head>Ptolemy Physcon Invades Cyrene</head>
<p>Meanwhile Torquatus had crossed to Alexandria and
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Ptolemy Physcon invades the dominions of his brother.</note>
was trying to induce the elder Ptolemy to be
reconciled to his brother, and yield Cyprus to
him. But Ptolemy, by alternate promises and
refusals and the like, managed to waste the
time, while the younger king lay encamped with his thousand
Cretans at Apis in Libya, according to his agreement. Becoming thoroughly irritated at receiving no intelligence, he first
sent Gnaeus Merula to Alexandria, hoping by this means to
bring Torquatus and those with him to the place of meeting.
But Merula was like the others in protracting the business:
forty days passed without a word of intelligence, and the king
was in despair. The fact was that the elder king, by using
every kind of flattery, had won the commissioners over, and
was keeping them by him, rather against their will than with it.
Moreover, at this time the younger Ptolemy was informed that
the people of Cyrene had revolted, that the cities were
conspiring with them, and that Ptolemy Sympetesis had also
taken their side. This man was an Egyptian by birth, and
had been left by the king in charge of his whole kingdom when
he was going on his journey to Rome. When the king was
informed of this, and learned presently that the Cyreneans were
encamped in the open country, afraid lest, in his desire to add
<pb n="446"/>
Cyprus to his dominions, he might lose Cyrene also, he threw
everything else aside and marched towards Cyrene. When he
came to what is called the Great Slope, he found the Libyans
and Cyreneans occupying the pass. Ptolemy was alarmed at
this: but, putting half his forces on board boats, he ordered
them to sail beyond the difficult ground, and show themselves
on the rear of the enemy; while with the other half he marched
up in their front and tried to carry the pass. The Libyans being
panic-stricken at this double attack on front and rear, and
abandoning their position, Ptolemy not only got possession of
the pass, but also of Tetrapyrgia, which lay immediately below
it, in which there was an abundant supply of water. Thence
he crossed the desert in seven days, the forces under
Mochyrinus coasting along parallel to his line of march. The
Cyreneans were encamped eight thousand five hundred strong,
eight thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry: for having
satisfied themselves as to the character of Ptolemy from his
conduct at Alexandria, and seeing that his government and
policy generally were those of a tyrant rather than a king, they
could not endure the idea of becoming his subjects, but were
determined to venture everything in their desire for freedom.
And at last he was beaten. . . .</p></div2>

go to Rome and convince the Senate that he had done this

was taken without chains or a guard. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Extraordinary conduct of Isocrates.</note>But directly Isocrates

astonishing spectacle, sufficient to convince us that nothing
can be more frightful than a man, in body and soul alike,
when once divested of his humanity. His aspect was
<pb n="451"/>
beyond all measure terrifying and savage, as might be expected in a man who had neither washed the dirt from
his body, nor pared his nails, nor cut his hair, for a year.
The wild glare and rolling of his eyes also showed such inward
horror, that any one who saw him would have rather approached
any animal in the world than him. Leptines, on the contrary,
maintained his original view: was ready to appear before the
Senate; owned plainly to all who conversed with him what he
had done; and asserted that he would meet with no severity
at the hands of the Romans. And eventually his expectation was
fully justified. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Senate decide to keep the question of the murder open.</note> For the Senate, from
the idea, I believe, that, if it received and

thus kept the charge in reserve, that they might have the power
of using the accusation whenever they chose. They therefore
confined their answer to Demetrius to these words: "He shall
find all favour at our hands, if he satisfy the Senate in accordance with the obedience which he owed to it before." . . .</p>

the origin and manner of the rise and unusually early glory of
Scipio's reputation in Rome; and also how it came about that
Polybius became so attached to and intimate with him, that the
fame of their friendship and constant companionship was not
merely confined to Italy and Greece, but became known to
more remote nations also. We have already shown that the
acquaintance began in a loan of some books and the conversation about them. But as the intimacy went on, and the Achaean
<pb n="453"/>

and Scipio, the sons of Lucius Aemilius Paulus,<note anchored="yes">See note on p. 456.</note> exerted all

to remain in Rome. This was granted: and the intimacy was
becoming more and more close, when the

with the blood mounting to his cheeks, Scipio said, "Why is
it, Polybius, that though I and my brother eat at the same
table, you address all your conversation and all your questions
and explanations to him, and pass me over altogether? Of
course you too have the same opinion of me as I hear the rest

to be a mild effete person, and far removed from the true
Roman character and ways, because I don't care for pleading in

as I have done: far from it! It is merely that, your brother
being the elder, I begin and end my remarks with him, and
address my explanations and counsels to him, in the belief
that you share the same opinions. However, I am delighted
to hear you say now that you appear to yourself to be somewhat less spirited than is becoming to members of your family:
for you show by this that you have a really high spirit, and I
should gladly devote myself to helping you to speak or act in
any way worthy of your ancestors. As for learning, to which
I see you and your brother devoting yourselves at present with
so much earnestness and zeal, you will find plenty of people
<pb n="454"/>
to help you both; for I see that a large number of such
learned men from Greece are finding their way into Rome at
the present time. But as to the points which you say are just
now vexing you, I think you will not find any one more fitted
to support and assist you than myself." While Polybius was
still speaking the young man seized his right hand with both of
his, and pressing it warmly, said, "Oh that I might see the day
on which you would devote your first attention to me, and join
your life with mine. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Polybius is some what alarmed at the responsibility.</note> From that moment I shall think myself
worthy both of my family and my ancestors."
Polybius was partly delighted at the sight of
the young man's enthusiasm and affection, and
partly embarrassed by the thought of the high position of his
family and the wealth of its members. However, from the hour
of this mutual confidence the young man never left the side of
Polybius, but regarded his society as his first and dearest object.</p></div2>

other practical proof of an affection which recalled the relationship of father and son, or of
kinsmen of the same blood. The first impulse
and ambition of a noble kind with which he was
inspired was the desire to maintain a character for chastity,
and to be superior to the standard observed in that respect
among his contemporaries. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The deterioration in Roman morals and its causes.</note> This was a glory which, great and
difficult as it generally is, was not hard to gain
at that period in Rome, owing to the general
deterioration of morals. Some had wasted
their energies on favourite youths; others on mistresses; and
a great many on banquets enlivened with poetry and wine, and
all the extravagant expenditure which they entailed, having
quickly caught during the war with Perseus the dissoluteness
of Greek manners in this respect. And to such monstrous
lengths had this debauchery gone among the young men, that
many of them had given a talent for a young favourite. This
dissoluteness had as it were burst into flame at this period: in
the first place, from the prevalent idea that, owing to the
destruction of the Macedonian monarchy, universal dominion
was now secured to them beyond dispute; and in the second
place, from the immense difference made, both in public and
<pb n="455"/>
private wealth and splendour, by the importation of the riches
of Macedonia into Rome. Scipio, however, set his heart on a
different path in life; and by a steady resistance to his
appetites, and by conforming his whole conduct to a consistent
and undeviating standard, in about the first five years after
this secured a general recognition of his character for goodness
and purity.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b32c12" type="chapter" n="12">
<head>Scipio's Generosity to his Mother</head>
<p>His next object was to cultivate lofty sentiments in
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scipio's liberality to his mother.</note>
regard to money, and to maintain a higher standard of disinterestedness than other people. In this respect he had an
excellent start in his association with his natural father (L.
Aemilius): but he also had good natural impulses towards the
right; and chance contributed much to his success in this
particular aim. For he first lost the mother of his adoptive
father, who was the sister of his natural father Lucius, and
wife of his adoptive grandfather, Scipio the Great. She left a
large fortune, to which he was heir, and which gave him the
first opportunity of giving a proof of his principles. Aemilia,
for that was this lady's name, was accustomed to attend the
women's processions in great state, as sharing the life and
high fortune of Scipio. For besides the magnificence of her
dress and carriage, the baskets, cups, and such implements for
the sacrifice, which were carried in her train, were all of silver
or gold on great occasions; and the number of
maid-servants and other domestics that made
up her train was in proportion to this splendour.
All this establishment, immediately after Aemilia's funeral,
Scipio presented to his own mother, who had long before been
divorced by his father Lucius, and was badly off considering
the splendour of her birth.<note anchored="yes">She was the daughter of C. Papirius Carbo, Coss. B. C. <date value="-231">231</date>.</note> She had therefore in previous
years refrained from taking part in grand public processions;
but now; as there chanced to be an important state sacrifice,
she appeared surrounded with all the splendour and wealth
which had once been Aemilia's using among other things the
same muleteers, pair of mules, and carriage. The ladies, therefore, who saw it were much impressed by the kindness and
liberality of Scipio, and all raised their hands to heaven and
prayed for blessings upon him. This act, indeed, would be
<pb n="456"/>
thought honourable anywhere, but at Rome it was quite astonishing: for there no one ever thinks of giving any of his
private property to any one if he can help it. This was the
beginning of Scipio's reputation for nobility of character,
and it spread very widely,&mdash;for women are talkative and prone
to exaggeration whenever they feel warmly.</p></div2>

When he took the inheritance he was bound to pay them their portion. For their
father covenanted to give each of his two
daughters a marriage portion of fifty talents. Half of this their
mother paid down at once to their husbands, but left the
other half undischarged when she died. Now, the Roman
law enjoins the payment of money due to women as dowry
in three annual instalments, the personal outfit having been
first paid within ten months according to custom.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tw=n e)pi/plwn</foreign>,

Scipio instructed his banker at once to pay the twenty-five
talents to each within the ten months. When, therefore,
Tiberius Gracchus and Scipio Nasica, for they were the
husbands of these ladies, called on the banker at the expiration
<pb n="457"/>  of the ten months, and asked whether Scipio had given
him any instructions as to the money, he told them they
might have it at once, and proceeded to enter the transfer of
twenty-five talents to each.<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">poiou=ntos th\n diagrafh\n</foreign> seems a banker's term for "paying," i.e. by

a mistake, for they had no claim for the whole as yet, but only
took a third according to the law; and upon the banker answering that such were his instructions from Scipio, they could not
believe him, and went to call on the young man, supposing
him to have made a mistake. And, indeed, their feelings
were natural: for at Rome, so far from paying fifty talents
three years in advance, no one will pay a single talent before
the appointed day; so excessively particular are they about
money, and so profitable do they consider time. However,
when they reached Scipio and asked him what instructions he
had given his banker, on his replying, "To pay both sisters the
whole sum due to them," they told him he had made a mistake;
and with a show of friendly regard pointed out to him that,
according to the laws, he had the use of the money for a considerable time longer. But Scipio replied that he was quite aware
of all that; but that close reckoning and legal exactness were
for strangers; with relations and friends he would do his best
to behave straightforwardly and liberally. He therefore bade
them draw on the banker for the whole sum. When Tiberius
and Nasica heard this they returned home in silence, quite
confounded at the magnanimity of Scipio, and condemning
themselves for meanness, though they were men of as high a
character as any at Rome.</p></div2>

Aemilius, died, and left him and his brother
Fabius joint heirs to his property, he did an act
honourable to himself and worthy to be recorded. Lucius died without children in the
eyes of the law, for the two elder had been adopted into other
families, and the other sons, whom he was bringing up to be
the successors to himself and to continue his family, all died;<note anchored="yes">Of his two younger sons' one died five days before his Macedonian triumph,
the other three days after it. See <bibl n="Liv. 45.40">Livy, 45, 40</bibl>.</note>
<pb n="458"/>
he therefore left his property to these two. But Scipio, perceiving that his brother was worse off than himself, renounced
the whole of his share of the inheritance, though the property
was valued altogether at over sixty talents, with a view of thus
putting Fabius on an equality with himself in point of wealth.
This was much talked about; but he afterwards gave a still
clearer proof of his liberality. For when his brother wished
to give some gladiatorial games in honour of his father, but
was unable to support the expense, because of the enormous
costliness of such things, Scipio contributed half of this also
from his own pocket. Now the cost of such an exhibition,
if it is done on a large scale, does not amount in all to less
than thirty talents. While the fame of his liberality to his
mother was still fresh, she died; and so far from taking back
any part of the wealth he had recently bestowed on her, of
which I have just spoken, Scipio gave it and the entire
residue of his mother's property to his sisters,<note anchored="yes">The two sisters were both named Aemilia; the elder was married to Q.
Aelius Tubero, the younger to M. Porcius Cato, elder son of the Censor. The
daughters were prevented from taking the inheritance of their mother's property by the lex Voconia (B. C. <date value="-174">174</date>), in virtue of which a woman could not be
a haeres, nor take a legacy greater than that of the haeres, or of all the
haeredes together. The object of the law was to prevent the transference of
the property of one gens to another on a large scale. It was evaded (1) by
trusteeships, <bibl n="Gaius Inst. 2.274">Gaius, 2, 274</bibl>; Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. Cic. 41"><title>Cic.</title> 41</bibl>:

by Augustus in favour of mothers of three children, <bibl n="D.C. 56.10"><title>Dio Cass.</title> 56, 10</bibl>. See also

had no legal claim at all upon it. Accordingly his sisters
again adopted the splendour and retinue which Aemilia had
employed in the public processions; and once more the
liberality and family affection of Scipio were recalled to the
minds of the people.</p>
<p>With such recommendations dating from his earliest years,
Publius Scipio sustained the reputation for high morality and
good principles, which he had won by the expenditure of
perhaps sixty talents, for that was the sum which he bestowed
from his own property. And this reputation for goodness did
not depend so much on the amount of the money, as on
the seasonableness of the gift and the graciousness with which
<pb n="459"/>
it was bestowed. By his strict chastity, also, he not only
saved his purse, but by refraining from many irregular pleasures
he gained sound bodily health and a vigorous constitution,
which accompanied him through the whole of his life and
repaid him with many pleasures, and noble compensations for
the immediate pleasures from which he had formerly abstained.</p></div2>

character for public life in every country, but
especially in Rome: and he therefore was bound
to give all his most serious attention to it. In this
he was well seconded by Fortune also. For as
the Macedonian kings were especially eager
about hunting, and the Macedonians devoted
the most suitable districts to the preservation of game,
these places were carefully guarded during all the war time,
as they had been before, and yet had not been hunted the
whole of the four years owing to the public disturbances: the
consequence was that they were full of every kind of animal.
But when the war was decided, Lucius Aemilius, thinking that
hunting was the best training for body and courage his young
soldiers could have, put the royal huntsmen under the charge
of Scipio, and gave him entire authority over all matters connected with
the hunting. Scipio accepted the duty, and, looking upon himself as in a quasi-royal position, devoted his whole
time to this business, as long as the army remained in
Macedonia after the battle of Pydna.  Having then ample
opportunity for following this kind of pursuit,
and being in the very prime of his youth and
naturally disposed to it, the taste for hunting which he acquired became permanent.
Accordingly when he returned to Rome, and
found his taste supported by a corresponding
enthusiasm on the part of Polybius, the time that other young
men spent in law courts and formal visits,<note anchored="yes">That is, the morning from
daybreak till about ten or eleven. The <foreign lang="la">salutationes</foreign> came first, and the law business in the third hour.</note> haunting the Forum

<pb n="460"/>
reputation than others, whose only chance of gaining credit was
by inflicting some damage on one of their fellow-citizens,&mdash;for
that was the usual result of these law proceedings. Scipio, on
the other hand, without inflicting annoyance on any one,
gained a popular reputation for manly courage, rivalling
eloquence by action. The result was that in a short time he
obtained a more decided superiority of position over his contemporaries, than any Roman is remembered to have done;
although he struck out a path for his ambition which, with a
view to Roman customs and ideas, was quite different from
that of others.</p></div2>

Lucius Anicius having condemned some of the

by a crowd of the worst and most unprincipled persons, who

But what protected him and inclined people to believe that he
was acting on a fixed design, and in accordance with the will
of the Romans, was his former intimacy with them, and the support of the old man Myrton and his son Nicanor. These two
had the character of being men of moderation and on good
terms with the Romans; but though up to that time they had
been widely removed from all suspicion of injustice, they now
gave themselves up wholly to support and share in the lawless
acts of Charops. This man, after murdering some openly in

report; they were exceedingly angry at the

suitable one for declaring war against this people for more
reasons than one. For, in the first place, the coasts of Illyria
towards Italy had been entirely neglected by them ever since
they had expelled Demetrius of Pharos; and, in the next
place, they did not wish their own citizens to become enervated by a long-continued peace; for it was now the twelfth

Diogenes and Miltiades and their colleagues made a better

<p>It has happened to not a few, from the desire for increasing their wealth, to lose their life along with their money. It
was from being captivated by such passions that Orophernes,
king of Cappadocia, perished and was expelled from his kingdom. But having briefly narrated the restoration of this king
(Ariarathes), I will now bring back my narrative to its regular
course; for at present I have, to the exclusion of Greek
affairs, selected from those of Asia the events connected with
Cappadocia out of their proper order, because it was impossible to separate the voyage of Ariarathes from Italy from
his restoration to his kingdom.<note anchored="yes">Orophernes was soon deposed, and Ariarathes V. restored, but we have
no certain indication when this happened. See <ref target="b3c5" targOrder="U">3, 5</ref>.</note> I will therefore now go back
to the history of Greece during this period, in which a peculiar
and extraordinary affair took place in regard to the city of
Oropus, of which I will give the whole story from beginning
to end, going both backward and forward in point of time,
that I may not render the history of an episode which was
made up of separate events, and was not on the whole important, still more insignificant and indistinct by relating it
under different years. For when an event as a whole does
not appear to readers to be worth attention, I cannot certainly
expect a student to follow its details scattered at intervals
through my history.<note anchored="yes">The episode of Oropus here referred to, Polybius' s account of which
is lost, was made remarkable by the visit of the three philosophers to Rome
as ambassadors from Athens. The story, as far as Athens was concerned,
is told by <bibl n="Paus. 7.11.4">Pausanias, 7, 11, 4-7</bibl>.  The Athenians had been much impoverished
by the events of the war with Perseus (B.C. <dateRange from="-172" to="-168">172</dateRange>-168), and had made a raid or
raids of some sort upon Oropus. The Oropians appealed to Rome. The
Romans referred the assessment of damages to an Achaean court at Sicyon.
The Athenians failed to appear before the court at Sicyon, and were condemned by default to a fine of five hundred talents. Thereupon Carneades the
Academician, Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic were sent to
plead for a remission of a fine which the Athenians were wholly unable to pay.
They made a great impression on the Roman youth by their lectures, and
Cato urged that they should get their answer and be sent away as soon as
possible. The Senate reduced the fine to one hundred talents: but even that
the Athenians could not collect; and they seem to have managed to induce the Oropians to allow an Athenian garrison to hold Oropus, and to give hostages
for their fidelity to the Athenian government. This led to fresh quarrels and
an appeal to the Achaean government. The Achaean Strategus, Menalcidas
of Sparta, was bribed by a present of ten talents to induce an interference in
behalf of Oropus. Thereupon the Athenians withdrew their garrison from
Oropus, after pillaging the town, and henceforth took no part in the quarrels
which ensued, arising from the demands of Menalcidas for his ten talents;
which the Oropians refused to pay, on the ground that he had not helped them
as he promised; quarrels which presently centred round the question of the
continuance of Sparta in the Achaean league. The date of the original quarrel
between Athens and Oropus is not fixed, but the mission of the philosophers
was in B.C. <date value="-155">155</date>. See Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. Cat. Mi. 22"><title>Cato,</title> 22</bibl>;

<p>For the most part when things go well men generally get
on together; but in times of failure, in their annoyance at
events, they become sore and irritable with their friends. And
this is what happened to Orophernes, when his affairs began

troops to pillage the territory of Priene, Attalus assisting and

the boldness of their attack, and at the

observing that the enemy were advancing in complete

and, after a suitable harangue, advanced at a slow pace
towards the enemy. His charge was delivered with great

the Deciatae had mustered their forces, and appeared on the
ground intending to fight side by side with the Oxybii; but
finding themselves too late for the battle, they received the
fugitives in their ranks, and after a short time charged the
Romans with great fury and enthusiasm; but being worsted in
the engagement, they immediately all surrendered themselves
and their city at discretion to the Romans. Having thus become
masters of these tribes, Opimius delivered over their territory
on the spot to the people of Marseilles, and for the future forced
the Ligurians to give hostages at certain fixed intervals to the
Marsilians. He then deprived the tribes that had fought with
them of their arms, and divided his army among
the cities there for the winter, and himself took
up his winter quarters in the country. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Opimius winters in Gaul, B. C. <dateRange from="-154" to="-153">154</dateRange>-153.</note> Thus

<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Achaeans decline to help either Rhodes or Crete, although inclined to support Rhodes.</note>
with a similar mission. The Congress of the
Achaeans was that year at Corinth: and on each
body of ambassadors pleading their respective causes, the
assembled people were more inclined towards
the Rhodians, from respect to the reputation of
their state, and the general character of their
policy and statesmen.  When Antiphatas saw this, he wished
to come forward to make another speech; and, having obtained
permission from the Strategus to do so, he spoke in weightier
and more exalted terms than might be expected from a Cretan;
for, in fact, the young man was in no way of the ordinary
Cretan type, but had shunned the characteristic principles of
his countrymen. Accordingly the Achaeans received his plain
speaking with favour; and still more for the sake of his father
Telamnestus, who had taken a spirited part with them at the
head of five hundred Cretans in their war against Nabis.
However, none the less for that, after listening to him they
were still inclined to aid the Rhodians, until Callicrates
of Leontium stood up and said that they ought not to go to
war in favour of either, or to send aid to either of the two
peoples without the consent of the Romans. This argument

frequently happens that such men, when, in spite of following
all the rules of medicine and obeying the prescriptions of the
doctors, they are unable to make any advance towards improvement, give up all such efforts in despair, and either listen
wholly to priests and seers, or try every sort of charm or

were baffled in every direction, they were reduced to listen to
every kind of suggestion, and to magnify and accept every
kind of chance. Nor was this unnatural. For when nothing
dictated by reason proves successful, and yet some action or
another must necessarily be pushed on, there is no alternative
but to try something which does not depend on reason. The
Rhodians, having come to this dilemma, acted accordingly;
and, among other things that were in defiance of reason, reelected as their archon a man of whom they disapproved. . . .</p></div2>

<head>Fishing Near Scylla</head>
<p>It is not Homer's manner to indulge in mere mythological
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Homer true to nature.</note>
stories founded on no substratum of truth. For
there is no surer way of giving an air of verisimilitude to fiction than to mix with it some particles of truth. And
this is the case with the tale of the wanderings of Odysseus. . . .</p>
<p>For instance, Aeolus, who taught the way of getting through
the straits, where there are currents setting both ways, and the
passage is rendered difficult by the indraught of the sea, came
to be called and regarded as the dispenser and king of the winds;
just as Danaus, again, who discovered the storages of water in
Argos, and Atreus, who discovered the fact of the sun's revolution
being in the opposite direction to that of the heaven, were
called seers and priest-kings. So the priests of the Egyptians,
the Chaldeans, and the Magi, being superior to the rest of the
world in wisdom, obtained rule and honour in former generations. And on this principle, too, each one of the gods is
honoured as the inventor of something useful to man. I do
not allow therefore that Aeolus is wholly mythical, nor the
wanderings of Odysseus generally. Some mythical elements
have been undoubtedly added, as they have in the War or
<pb n="481"/>
Ilium; but the general account of Sicily given by the poet
agrees with that of other historians who have given topographical details of Italy and Sicily. I cannot agree therefore
with the remark of Eratosthenes that "we shall discover
where Odysseus wandered, when we find the cobbler who
sewed up the leather bag of the winds." See for instance how
Homer's description of Scylla agrees with what really happens
at the Scyllaean rock, and the taking of the sword fish:<note anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 12.95"><title>Odyss.</title> 12, 95</bibl>.</note>
<quote><l>"And there she fishes, roaming round the rock,</l>
<l>For dog-fish and for dolphins, or what else</l>
<l>Of huger she may take that swims the sea."</l></quote>
For the fact is that tunnies swimming in great shoals along the
Italian coast, if they are drifted from their course and are prevented from reaching Sicily, fall a prey to the larger fish, such
as dolphins, dog-fish, or other marine monsters; and from
hunting these the sword-fish (called also xiphiae, or sometimes
sea-dogs) are fattened. The same thing happens at a rise of
the Nile, and other rivers, as in the case of a fire or a burning
forest; the animals crowd together, and, in their effort to escape
the fire or the water, fall a prey to stronger animals.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b34c3" type="chapter" n="3">
<head>Fishing for Swordfish</head>
<p>Fishing for sword-fish at the Scyllaean rock is carried on
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Fishing for sword-fish.</note>
in this way. A number of men lie in wait, two
each in small two-oared boats, and one man is
set to look out for them all. In the boat one
man rows, while the other stands on the prow holding a spear.
When the look-out man signals the appearance of a sword-fish
(for the animal swims with one-third of its body above water),
the boat rows up to it, and the man with the spear strikes it at
close quarters, and then pulls the spear-shaft away leaving the
harpoon in the fish's body; for it is barbed and loosely fastened
to the shaft on purpose, and has a long rope attached to it.
They then slacken the rope for the wounded fish, until it is
wearied out with its convulsive struggles and attempts to
escape, and then they haul it on to land, or, if its size is not too
great, into the boat. And if the spear-shaft falls into the sea it
is not lost; for being made of two pieces, one oak and the
other pine, the oak end as the heavier dips under water, the
<pb n="482"/>
other end rises above it and is easily got hold of. But sometimes it happens that the man rowing is wounded, right through
the boat, by the immense size of the animal's sword; for it
charges like a boar, and hunting the one is very like hunting
the other.</p>
<p>This would lead us to conjecture that the wandering
described by Homer was near Sicily, because he has assigned
to Scylla the kind of fishing which is indigenous to the
Scyllaean rock; and because what he says of Charybdis
correctly describes what does happen in the Straits. But the

<p>Or if there are some points which do not answer, we
must lay the blame on ignorance or poetic licence, which uses
real history, picturesque detail, and mythological allusion. The
object of history is truth, as when in the catalogue of ships the
poet describes the features of the several localities, calling one
city "rocky," another "frontier-placed," another "with wealth
of doves," or "hard by the sea." But the object of picturesque
detail is vividness, as when he introduces men fighting; and
that of mythological allusion is to give pleasure or rouse wonder.
But a narrative wholly fictitious creates no illusion and is not
Homeric. For all look upon his poetry as a philosophical
work; and Eratosthenes is wrong in bidding us not judge his
poems with a view to having any serious meaning, or to seek
for history in them.</p>

<pb n="483"/>
at an even speed in the nine days, he would make two
thousand five hundred stades a day. Now, who has ever
asserted that any one made the voyage from Lycia or Rhodes
to Alexandria in four days, a distance of four thousand
stades?</p>
<p>To those who ask how it was that Odysseus, though he
came to Sicily three times, never once went through the straits,
I answer that all subsequent sailors avoided that passage
also. . . .</p></div2>

<head>Implausibility of Pytheas's Geography</head>
<p>In treating of the geography of Europe I shall say
nothing of the ancient geographers, but shall confine my
attention to their modern critics, Dicaearchus, Eratosthenes,
who is the most recent writer on geography, and Pytheas, who
has misled many readers by professing to have traversed on
foot the whole of Britain, the coastline of which island, he
says, is more than forty thousand stades. And again by his
stories of Thule and the countries in its neighbourhood, "in
which," he says, "there is neither unmixed land or sea or air,
but a kind of compound of all three (like the jelly-fish or Pulmo
Marinus), in which earth and sea and everything else are held
in suspense, and which forms a kind of connecting link to the
whole, through which one can neither walk nor sail." This
substance, which he says is like the Pulmo Marinus, he saw
with his own eyes, the rest he learnt by report. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cadiz to the Don.</note> Such
is Pytheas's story, and he adds that, on his return thence,
he traversed the whole of the coast of Europe
from Gades to the Tanais. But we cannot
believe that a private person, who was also a poor man, should
have made such immense journeys by land and sea. Even
Eratosthenes doubted this part of his story, though he believed
what he said about Britain, and Gades, and Iberia. I would
much rather believe the Messenian (Euhemerus) than him.
The latter is content with saying that he sailed to one country
which he calls Panchaia;<note anchored="yes">Panchaia or Panch&emacr;a, the fabulous island or country in the Red Sea or
Arabian gulf, in which Euhemerus asserted that he had discovered the inscriptions which proved the reputed gods to have been famous generals or kings.

as equivalent to "Arabian." See <bibl n="Verg. G. 2.139">Verg. <title>Georg.</title> 2, 139</bibl>.</note> while the former asserts that he has
actually seen the whole northern coast of Europe up to the
<pb n="484"/>
very verge of the world, which one would hardly believe of
Hermes himself if he said it. Eratosthenes calls Euhemerus
a Bergaean,<note anchored="yes">That is "as great a liar as Antiphanes of Berga." See below. Strabo
classes Antiphanes with Pytheas and Euhemerus more than once (see <bibl n="Strab. 2.3.5">2, 3, 5</bibl>).
Hence came the verb <foreign lang="greek">berga/zein,</foreign> "to tell travellers' tales" (Steph. <title>Byz.</title>). But
there is considerable doubt as to the identification of the traveller Antiphanes,
some confounding him with a comic poet of the same name, and others with

did not.<note anchored="yes">Strabo here protests against Dicaearchus being treated as a standard of
geographical truth. For Pytheas see Appendix.</note> . . . Eratosthenes and Dicaearchus give mere
popular guesses as to distances.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b34c6" type="chapter" n="6">
<head>Distances In the Mediterranean</head>
<p>For instance, Dicaearchus says that the distance from
the Peloponnese to the Pillars is ten thousand stades
and still further to the head of the Adriatic; and from
the Peloponnesus to the Sicilian straits three thousand;
and therefore the remainder, from the Straits to the Pillars,
is seven thousand stades. I say nothing about the three
thousand stades, whether they are right or wrong; but
the seven thousand cannot be made out, whether you measure
along the coast or straight across the sea. The coast route is
a kind of obtuse angle, contained by two lines resting on the
straits and the pillars respectively; so that we have a triangle,
of which the apex is Narbo, and the base the straight line
representing the course by the open sea; of the two sides of
the triangle which contain the obtuse angle, that which extends
from the straits to Narbo is more than eleven thousand two
hundred stades, the other from Narbo to the Pillars is a little
under eight thousand. The longest distance from Europe to
Libya across the Tuscan sea is allowed to be not more than
three thousand stades, that by the Sardinian sea is somewhat less; but let us call it three thousand stades. Now
suppose a perpendicular let down through the gulf of Narbo
to the base of the triangle, that is to the straight seacourse, measuring two thousand stades; it requires only a
schoolboy's geometry to prove that the coasting voyage is
longer than the direct sea voyage by nearly five hundred
stades.<note anchored="yes"><p>Polybius proves his point by the demonstration of the proposition "The square of hypotenuse of a right-angled-triangle is equal to the squares of the
sides containing the right angle."</p>
<p>By applying this principle AD = 7745.9 . . and DC = 11019.9 . . . and the
whole AC = 18765.8: whereas AB + BC (i.e. the coasting voyage) = 19200
stades (a difference of 434.2 stades, not 500). Add to this the 3000 from the
Peloponnese to the Straits, the total coast voyage is 22,200 stades, as against
Dicaearchus's 10,000.</p></note> And when the three thousand stades from the
<pb n="485"/>
Peloponnese to the straits are added, the whole number of
the stades even of the straight sea course will be more than
double Dicaearchus's reckoning. And if we measure to the
head of the Adriatic we must add still more by his own
admission; that is to say, from the Peloponnese to Leucas is
seven hundred stades, from Leucas to Corcyra seven hundred,
from Corcyra to Ceraunia seven hundred, and from Ceraunia
along the Illyrian coast six thousand one hundred and fifty. Strabo quotes this reckoning of the distance from the Peloponnese to the
head of the Adriatic to prove that Polybius, on his own showing, is wrong in
admitting that this distance (8250 stades) is greater than that from the Peloponnese to the Pillars, which Dicaearchus said was 10,000 stades, and which
Polybius showed to be 18,765 stades by the shortest route.</p>
<p>In talking such nonsense he might well be regarded as
having gone beyond even Antiphanes of Berga, and, in fact,
to have left no folly for his successors to commit. . . .</p></div2>
<div2 id="b34c7" type="chapter" n="7">
<head>Gaul and Spain</head>
<p>From Ithaca to Corcyra is more than nine hundred

thousand. From Marseilles to the Pillars is more than nine
thousand; from the Pyrenees, rather less than eight thousand.
. . . The Pagus from source to mouth is eight thousand,
not following its windings, but taking a direct line. . . .
Eratosthenes is quite ignorant of the geography of Iberia,
and sometimes makes statements about it entirely contradictory. He says, for instance, that its western coast as
far as Gades is inhabited by Gauls, since the whole western
side of Europe, as far south as Gades, is occupied by that

people: and then, quite forgetting he has said this, when
taking a survey of the whole of Spain, he nowhere mentions
the Gauls. . . . The length of Europe is less than that of
Libya and Asia put together by the distance between the sunrise in summer and at the point of the equinox; for the source of
the Tanais is at the former, and the Pillars are at the western

This fountain has a tide which rises and falls

When it is high tide at sea it is low tide in the fountain, and
high in the fountain when it is low at sea. The explanation
of this is that the wind, which rises from the bowels of the
earth to the surface, is prevented from finding its natural
egress when the earth is covered with water at the rise of the
tide, and being thus turned back into the interior of the earth,
it stops up the underground channels of the fountain and
produces a deficiency of water; but when the earth is again
uncovered, the wind having once more found an easy egress,

native Alexandrians, who have never from the same cause
become properly accustomed to civil life, but who are yet
better than the second class; for though they are now a

<p>SPAIN, the eastern and southern parts of which were, since the 2d Punic
war, governed by the Romans under a kind of military occupation without
being reduced to the form of regular provinces, was always in a disturbed
state, partly from sudden uprisings of various tribes against the Roman
authority, and partly from numerous bodies of banditti, who seized strongholds or fortified towns and carried on their depredations from these
centres. Hence it had been the policy of the Roman praetors and consuls
to insist on the demolition of fortresses and city walls, as we learn from
the accounts of Cato in B.C. <date value="-195">195</date> and others. In B.C. <date value="-177">177</date> Tiberius

found that the war had accordingly spread to the Celtiberian tribes, the
Belli and Titthi, who attempted to build the walls of Segeda. On
Nobilior ordering them to desist, in accordance with Gracchan settlement,
most of them obeyed after some resistance, but some of them fled to the
Arevacae (near the sources of the Douro and Tagus); and this powerful
tribe, after defeating the Roman army, entrenched themselves in Numantia,
under the walls of which Nobilior sustained further losses. He was superseded in B.C. <date value="-152">152</date> by Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who, partly by strategy,
and partly by administrative skill and conciliation, restored the Roman
fortunes to a better position. The Belli and Titthi became allies of

had never happened before. To such an extent did the panic
go, that sufficient men were not found to come forward for the
office of military tribune, and these posts were consequently
not entirely filled up; whereas heretofore a larger number
than were wanted had been wont to volunteer for the duty:
nor would the men nominated by the Consuls as <foreign lang="la">legati</foreign> to

who, though he had already acquired a reputation for high
principle and pure morality, had not been known for his
personal courage, seeing the Senate was in a difficulty, stood
up and bade them send him to Iberia, either as military

Cato stood up and said: "As though we had
nothing else to do, we sit here the whole day

Achaia as they had before. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Restoration of the Achaean detenus, B. C. <date value="-151">151</date>.</note> Cato, however, remarked with a

be more convenient to me. Still, as I do not think it becoming in statesmen to be ready with argument and exposition on
every subject of debate without distinction, but rather to adapt
their speeches to the nature of the particular occasion, so neither
do I think it right for historians to practise their skill or

of Cato, who were roughly treated at Carthage; and when, in

Cato urged immediate war. The Senate, however, again sent commissioners, among whom was Cato himself,
to examine into the matter. They reported that the Carthaginians had an army and navy. An ultimatum was therefore
sent, that the army and navy were to be broken up within the
year, or that the next consuls should bring the question of war
before the Senate (B. C. <date value="-150">150</date>). Just at this crisis Utica, in

they were reduced to a state of the utmost
embarrassment by the people of Utica anticipating
their design by putting themselves under the protection of Rome. This seemed their only hope of safety left:
and they imagined that such a step must win them favour at
Rome: for to submit to put themselves and their country
under control was a thing which they had never done even in
their darkest hour of danger and defeat, with the enemy at
their very walls. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Carthaginian plenipotentiaries at Rome.</note> And now they had lost all the fruit of this

<pb n="501"/>
left, to accept war with courage or to surrender their independence, after a long and anxious discussion held secretly in the
Senate-house, they appointed two ambassadors with plenary
powers, and instructed them, that, in view of the existing state
of things, they should do what seemed for the advantage of
their country. The names of these envoys were Gisco
Strytanus, Hamilcar, Misdes, Gillimas, and Mago. When
they reached Rome from Carthage, they found war already
decreed and the generals actually started with their forces.
Circumstances, therefore, no longer giving them any power of
deliberating, they offered an unconditional surrender.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b36c4" type="chapter" n="4">
<head>Meaning of Surrender</head>
<p>I have spoken before about what this implies, but I
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">What is implied by their surrender. See <ref target="b20c9" targOrder="U">20, 9-10</ref>.</note>
must in this place also briefly remind my readers
of its import. Those who thus surrender themselves to the Roman authority, surrender all
territory and the cities in it, together with all men and women
in all such territory or cities, likewise rivers, harbours, temples,
and tombs, so that the Romans should become actual lords of
all these, and those who surrender should remain lords of
nothing whatever. On the Carthaginians making a surrender
to this effect, they were summoned into the Senate-house and
the Praetor delivered the Senate's decision, which was to this
effect: "They had been well advised, and
therefore the Senate granted them freedom and
the enjoyment of their laws; and moreover, all
their territory and the possession of their other
property, public or private." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Senate re-grant their liberty and territory to the Carthaginians,</note> The Carthaginian envoys were

obeying such commands as should be imposed on them by the
<pb n="502"/>
consuls. This dashed their satisfaction for a time, because
they had no means of knowing what orders were to be given
them through the consuls; however, they started at once,
being anxious to report what had occurred to their countrymen
with all speed. When they arrived in Carthage and stated the
facts, the citizens considered that the envoys had in all respects
acted with proper caution; but they were greatly alarmed and
distressed by the fact that in the answer no mention was made
of the city itself.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b36c5" type="chapter" n="5">
<head>Speech of Mago Brettius</head>
<p>At this juncture they say that Mago Brettius delivered a
manly and statesmanlike speech. He said:
"The Carthaginians had two opportunities of
taking counsel in regard to themselves and their
country, one of which they had let pass; for in good truth it
was no use now to question what was going to be enjoined on them by the consuls, and why it was that the
Senate had made no mention of the city: they should have
done that when they made the surrender. Having once made
that, they must clearly make up their mind to the necessity of
submitting to every possible injunction, unless it should prove
to be something unbearably oppressive or beyond what they
could possibly expect. If they would not do this, they must
now consider whether they preferred to stand an invasion and
all its possible consequences, or, in terror of the attack of the
enemy, accept without resistance every order they might impose
upon them." <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The hostages are sent to Lilybaeum.</note> But as the imminence of war and
the uncertainty of the future made every one
inclined to submit to these injunctions, it
was decided to send the hostages to Lilybaeum. Three
hundred young men were forthwith selected and sent to Lilybaeum amidst loud expressions of sorrow and tears, each of
them being escorted by his nearest friends and relations, the
whole scene being made especially moving by the lamentations
of the women. On landing at Lilybaeum the hostages were
at once handed over by the consuls to Quintus Fabius
Maximus, who had been appointed to the command in Sicily
at that time. By him they were safely conveyed to Rome and
confined in the dockyard of the six-benched ships.</p></div2>

<head>Views In Greece of Roman Policy</head>
<p>THERE was a great deal of talk of all sorts in Greece, first
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The various views held in Greece as to the Roman policy.</note>
as to the Carthaginians when the Romans conquered them, and subsequently as to the question
of the pseudo-Philip. The opinions expressed in
regard to the Carthaginians were widely divided,
and indicated entirely opposite views. Some commended the
Romans for their wise and statesmanlike policy in regard to
that kingdom. For the removal of a perpetual menace, and the
utter destruction of a city which had disputed the supremacy
with them, and could even then if it got an opportunity have
still been disputing it,&mdash;thus securing the supremacy for their
own country,&mdash;were the actions of sensible and far-sighted men.
Others contradicted this, and asserted that the Romans had no
such policy in view when they obtained their supremacy; and
that they had gradually and insensibly become perverted to
the same ambition for power, which had once characterised
the Athenians and Lacedaemonians; and though they had
advanced more slowly than these last, that they would from
all appearances yet arrive at the same consummation. For
in old times they had only carried on war until their opponents
were beaten, and induced to acknowledge the obligation of
obedience and acceptance of their orders; but that nowadays
they had given a foretaste of their policy by their conduct to
Perseus, in utterly destroying the Macedonian dynasty root and
branch, and had given the finishing stroke to that policy by the
course adopted in regard to the Carthaginians; for though this
latter people had committed no act of irretrievable outrage,
they had taken measures of irretrievable severity against them,
in spite of their offering to accept any terms, and submitting to
any injunctions that might be placed upon them. Others
<pb n="506"/>
again said that the Romans were generally a truly civilised
people; and that they had this peculiarity, on which they
prided themselves, that they conducted their wars openly and
generously, not employing night surprises or ambuscades, but
scorning every advantage to be gained by stratagem and
deceit, and regarding open and face-to-face combats as
alone becoming to their character: but that in the present
instance their whole campaign against the Carthaginians had
been conducted by means of stratagem and deceit. Little by
little,&mdash;by holding out inducements here, and practising concealment there,&mdash;they had deprived them of all hopes of
assistance from their allies. This was a line of conduct more
appropriate by rights to the intriguing chicanery of a monarchy,
than to a republican and Roman policy. Again, there were
some who took the opposite line to these. They said that if
it were really true that, before the Carthaginians had made
the surrender, the Romans had behaved as alleged, holding
out inducements here, and making half revelations there, they
would be justly liable to such charges; but if, on the contrary, it was only after the Carthaginians had themselves made
the surrender,&mdash;acknowledging the right of the Romans to take
what measures they chose concerning them,&mdash;that the latter in
the exercise of their undoubted right had imposed and enjoined
what they determined upon, then this action must cease to be
looked on as partaking of the nature of impiety or treachery.
And some denied that it was an impiety at all: for there
were three ways in which such a thing could be defined, none
of which applied to the conduct of the Romans. An impiety
was something done against the gods, or one's parents, or the
dead; treachery was something done in violation of oaths or
written agreements; an injustice something done in violation
of law and custom. But the Romans could not be charged on
any one of these counts: they had offended neither the gods,
their parents, nor the dead; nor had they broken oaths or
treaties, but on the contrary charged the Carthaginians
with breaking them. Nor again had they violated laws, customs, or their own good faith; for having received a voluntary surrender, with the full power of doing what they pleased
in the event of the submitting party not obeying their injunctions,
<pb n="507"/>  they had, in view of that eventuality having arisen, applied force to them.</p></div2>

<head>Pseudo-Philip</head>
<p>Such were the criticisms commonly made on the dealings
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The pretended Philip, son of Perseus, B. C. <date value="-149">149</date>.</note>
of the Romans with the Carthaginians. But as
to the Pseudo-Philip, the report at first appeared
quite beneath consideration. A Philip suddenly appears in Macedonia, as though he had dropped from
the skies, in contempt of Macedonians and Romans alike,
without having the least reasonable pretext for his claim, as
every one knew that the real Philip had died in Alba in Italy
two years after Perseus himself. But when, three or four
months afterwards, a report arrived that he had conquered the
Macedonians in a battle in the territory of the Odomanti
beyond the Strymon, some believed it, but the majority were
still incredulous. But presently, when news came that he had
conquered the Macedonians in a battle on this side of the
Strymon, and was master of all Macedonia; and when letters
and envoys came from the Thessalians to the Achaeans
imploring help, as though the danger were now affecting
Thessaly, it seemed an astonishing and inexplicable event; for
there was nothing to give it the air of probability, or to supply
a rational explanation of it.</p>

matters then, we, in default of a better, follow the prevailing
opinions of the multitude, attempting by supplications and
sacrifices to appease the wrath of heaven, and sending to
ask the gods by what words or actions on our part a change
for the better may be brought about, and a respite be obtained for the evils which are afflicting us. But those things,
of which it is possible to find the origin and cause of their
occurrence, I do not think we should refer to the gods. I
mean such a thing as the following. In our time all Greece
was visited by a dearth of children and generally a decay of
population, owing to which the cities were denuded of inhabitants, and a failure of productiveness resulted, though
there were no long-continued wars or serious pestilences
among us. If, then, any one had advised our sending to ask the
gods in regard to this, what we were to do or say in order to
become more numerous and better fill our cities,&mdash;would he
not have seemed a futile person, when the cause was manifest
and the cure in our own hands? For this evil grew upon us
rapidly, and without attracting attention, by our men becoming
perverted to a passion for show and money and the pleasures
of an idle life, and accordingly either not marrying at all, or, if
they did marry, refusing to rear the children that were born, or
at most one or two out of a great number, for the sake of
leaving them well off or bringing them up in extravagant
luxury. For when there are only one or two sons, it is evident that, if war or pestilence carries off one, the houses must
be left heirless: and, like swarms of bees, little by little the
cities become sparsely inhabited and weak. On this subject
there is no need to ask the gods how we are to be relieved
from such a curse: for any one in the world will tell you that
it is by the men themselves if possible changing their objects
of ambition; or, if that cannot be done, by passing laws for the
preservation of infants. On this subject there is no need of
<pb n="511"/>
seers or prodigies. And the same holds good of all similar
things. But in regard to events of which the causes are impossible or difficult to discover, it is reasonable to feel a
difficulty. And in this class may be reckoned the course of
Macedonian history. For the Macedonians had enjoyed
many important favours at the hands of the Romans, having
been as a nation liberated from arbitrary government and
imports, and having obtained undisputed freedom in the place
of slavery; and having been individually relieved to a great
extent from intestine factions and civil bloodshed.<note anchored="yes">A considerable passage is here lost, with the exception of a few words,

claims to the throne, they displayed great courage and conquered a Roman army. These facts may well seem a puzzle
to us, for it is difficult to discover their cause. And accordingly one would be inclined to say in such matters that what

wrath of God had fallen upon the Macedonians. And this

best man of all the kings of our time, and the
most completely fortunate; for he reigned more
than sixty years in the soundest health and
to extreme old age,&mdash;for he was ninety when
he died. He was, besides, the most powerful
man physically of all his contemporaries: for instance, when
it was necessary to stand, he would do so without moving a
foot all day long; and again, when he had once sat down to
business he remained there the whole day; nor did it
distress him the least to remain in the saddle day and night
continuously; and at ninety years old, at which age he died,
he left a son only four years old, called Sthembanus, who was
<pb n="512"/>
afterwards adopted by Micipses, and four sons besides.
Owing, again, to the affection existing between these sons,
he kept his whole life free from any treasonable plot and his
kingdom unpolluted by any family tragedy. But his greatest
and most divine achievement was this: Numidia had been
before his time universally unproductive, and was looked
upon as incapable of producing any cultivated fruits. He was
the first and only man who showed that it could produce
cultivated fruits just as well as any other country whatever, by
cultivating farms to the extent of ten thousand plethra for each
of his sons in different parts of it. On this man's death,
then, so much may reasonably and justly be said. Scipio
arrived at Cirta on the third day after his departure, and
settled everything properly and fairly.<note anchored="yes">Massanissa, feeling himself to be dying, had asked Scipio to come to him.

a purple dyed robe over his armour fastened by
a brooch, and attended by ten bodyguards armed with swords;
and in the next place, having advanced in front of these

behind the trench and palisade and beckoned the king to
come to him, whereas it ought to have been quite the other way. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Interview between Hasdrubal and King Gulussa.</note>
However, Gulussa, after the Numidian fashion, being not
inclined to stand on ceremony, advanced
towards him unattended, and when he got near
him asked him "Whom he was afraid of that he
had come in full armour?" And on his answering, "The
Romans," Gulussa remarked: "Then you should not have
trusted yourself to the city, when there was no necessity for
your doing so. However, what do you want, and what do
you ask me to do?" To which Hasdrubal replied: "I want
you to go as our ambassador to the Roman commander, and
to undertake for us that we will obey every injunction; only
I beg of you both to abstain from harming this wretched city."
Then said Gulussa: "Your demand appears to me to be quite
childish! Why, my good sir, what you failed to get by your
embassies from the Romans, who were then quietly encamped
at Utica, and before a blow had been struck,&mdash;how can you
expect to have granted you now, when you have been completely
invested by sea and land, and have almost given up every hope

ill informed; for they still had good hopes of their outside

thought that the forces in the country were still unconquered,<note anchored="yes">The task of subduing the country in B.

And above all, they trusted in the support of the gods, and in
what they might expect from them; for they believed that
they would not disregard the flagrant violation of treaty from
which they were suffering, but would give them many opportunities of securing their safety. Therefore he called on the
Roman commander in the name of the gods and of Fortune to
spare the city; with the distinct understanding that, if its
inhabitants failed to obtain this grace, they would be cut to
pieces to the last man sooner than evacuate it." After some
more conversation of the same sort, these men separated for

violating even the laws of men?" The king went on to
remind Scipio that above all things it was necessary to finish
the business speedily; for, apart from unforeseen contingencies,
the consular elections were now close at hand, and it was only
right to have regard to that, lest, if the winter found them just
where they were, another Consul would come to supersede
him, and without any trouble get all the credit of his labours. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">He offers Hasdrubal personal security for delivering the town.</note>
These words induced Scipio to give directions

his private property and to bring out with him whichever of his
slaves he chose. With these concessions therefore Gulussa
went to his meeting with Hasdrubal on the third day, who
again came forward with great pomp and at a dignified step,
clothed in his purple robe and full suit of armour, so as to
cast the tyrants of tragedy far into the shade. He was
naturally fat, but at that time he had grown extremely corpulent, and had become more than usually red from exposure
to the sun, so that he seemed to be living like fat oxen at a fair;
and not at all like a man to be in command at a time of such
terrible miseries as cannot easily be described in words.
When he met the king, and heard the offer of the Consul, he
slapped his thigh again and again, and appealing to the gods and

his administration of affairs, we cannot fail to be
struck by his want of spirit and courage; for at a time when
his fellow-citizens were absolutely perishing with famine, he
gave banquets and had second courses put on of a costly kind,
and by his own excellent physical condition made their misery
more conspicuous. For the number of the dying surpassed
belief, as well as the number who deserted every day from
hunger. However, by fiercely rebuking some, and by executing as well as abusing others, he cowed the common people:
and by this means retained, in a country reduced to the

scarcely enjoy in a prosperous city. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Comparison between Hasdrubal and Diaeus.</note> Therefore I think I was

<head>Consummation of the Misfortunes of Greece</head>
<p>My thirty-eighth book embraces the consummation of the misfortunes of Greece. For
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The ill-luck which occasioned the fall of Greece.</note>
though Greece as a whole, as well as separate
<pb n="516"/>
parts of it, has on several occasions sustained grave disasters,
yet to none of her previous defeats could the word "misfortune" be more properly applied, than to those which have
befallen her in our time. For it is not only that the
<emph>sufferings</emph> of Greece excite compassion: stronger still is the
conviction, which a knowledge of the truth of the several
occurrences must bring, that in all she undertook she was
supremely unfortunate. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The fall of Greece was even more lamentable than that of Carthage.</note> At any rate, though the disaster of
Carthage is looked upon as of the severest
kind, yet one cannot but regard that of Greece
as not less, and in some respects even more so.
For the Carthaginians at any rate left something
for posterity to say on their behalf; but the mistakes of the
Greeks were so glaring that they made it impossible for those
who wished to support them to do so. Besides, the destruction of the Carthaginians was immediate and total, so that
they had no feeling afterwards of their disasters: but the
Greeks, with their misfortunes ever before their eyes, handed
down to their children's children the loss of all that once was
theirs. And in proportion as we regard those who live in pain
as more pitiable than those who lose their lives at the moment
of their misfortunes, in that proportion must the disasters of
the Greeks be regarded as more pitiable than those of the
Carthaginians,&mdash;unless a man thinks nothing of dignity and
honour, and gives his opinion from a regard only to material
advantage. To prove the truth of what I say, one has only
to remember and compare the misfortunes in Greece reputed
to be the heaviest with what I have just now mentioned.</p></div2>

<p>Now, the greatest alarm that fortune ever brought upon
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Comparison between the fall of Greece under the Romans with the Persian invasion, B.C. <date value="-480">480</date>.</note>
the Greeks was when Xerxes invaded Europe:
for at that time all were exposed to danger
though an extremely small number actually
suffered disaster. The greatest sufferers were the
Athenians: for, with a prudent foresight of what was coming,
they abandoned their country with their wives
and children.  That crisis then caused them
damage; for the Barbarians took Athens and
laid it waste with savage violence: but it brought them no
shame or disgrace. On the contrary, they gained the highest
<pb n="517"/>
glory in the eyes of all the world for having regarded everything as of less importance, in comparison with taking their
share in the same fortune as the other Greeks. Accordingly,
in consequence of their exalted conduct, they not only immediately recovered their own city and territory, but soon
afterwards disputed the supremacy in Greece with the Lacedaemonians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The defeat of the Athenians at Aegospotami, B. C. <date value="-405">405</date>.</note> Subsequently, indeed, they were
beaten by the Spartans in war, and forced to
submit to the destruction of their own city

reproach to the Lacedaemonians, for having used the power
put into their hands with excessive severity, rather than to the
Athenians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">of the Spartans at Leuctra, B. C. <date value="-371">371</date>.</note> Then the Spartans once more, being

But what disgrace was there in having retired, while disputing
for the most honourable objects, to the limits of their ancestral
dominion? Therefore, these events we may speak of as
failures, but not as misfortunes in any sense. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The destruction of Mantinea, B. C. <date value="-362">362</date>,</note>The Mantineans
again were forced to leave their city, being

Lacedaemonians. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">and of Thebes, B. C. <date value="-335">335</date>.</note> The Thebans, indeed, besides the loss of their army, saw their country depopulated at the time when Alexander, having
resolved on the invasion of Asia, conceived that by making an
example of Thebes he should establish a terror that would act
as a check upon the Greeks, while his attention was distracted
upon other affairs: but at that time all the world pitied the
Thebans as having been treated with injustice and harshness,
and no one was found to justify this proceeding of Alexander.</p></div2>

<p>Accordingly after a short time they obtained assistance,
and once more inhabited their country in security. For
the compassion of foreigners is no small benefit to those
who are unjustly dispossessed; since we often see that,
with the change of feeling among the many, Fortune also
changes; and even the conquerors themselves repent, and make

good the disasters of those who have fallen under undeserved
misfortunes. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">The tyranny of the later kings of Macedonia.</note> Once more, at certain periods the Chalcidians
and Corinthians and some other cities, owing to
the advantages of their situation, were attacked
by the kings of Macedonia, and had garrisons
imposed on them: but when they were thus enslaved all
the world were eager to do their best to liberate them, and
loathed their enslavers and regarded them continually as
their enemies. But above all, up to this time it was generally
single states that were depopulated, and in single states
that reverses were met with, in some cases while disputing for
supremacy and empire, and in others from the treacherous
attacks of despots and kings: so that, so far from their losses
bringing them any reproach, they escaped even the name of
misfortune. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">But the last fall of Greece was embittered by the fact that it came from the folly of the Greeks themselves</note> For we must look on all those who meet with
incalculable disasters whether private or public
as the victims of losses, and those only to be
"unfortunate," to whom events through their
own folly bring dishonour. Instances of this
last are the Peloponnesians, Boeotians,
Phocians, . . . and Locrians, some of the
dwellers on the Ionian gulf, and next to these the Macedonians, . . . who all as a rule did not merely suffer loss,
but were "unfortunate," with a misfortune of the gravest kind
and for which they were themselves open to
reproach: for they displayed at once want of
good faith and want of courage, brought upon
themselves a series of disgraces, lost all that could bring them
honour, . . . and voluntarily admitted into their towns the
Roman fasces and axes. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">rather than of their leaders.</note> They were in the utmost panic, in fact,
owing to the extravagance of their own wrongful acts, if one
ought to call them their own; for I should rather say that the

<head>Rome and the Achaean League</head>
<p>In regard to these men, it should not be a matter
of surprise if we leave for a while the ordinary method and
spirit of our narrative to give a clearer and more elaborate
exposition of their character. I am aware that some may
<pb n="519"/>
be found, regarding it as their first duty to cast a veil over
the errors of the Greeks, to accuse us of writing in a spirit of
malevolence. But for myself, I conceive that with right-minded
persons a man will never be regarded as a true friend who
shrinks from and is afraid of plain speech, nor indeed as a good
citizen who abandons the truth because of the offence he will
give to certain persons at the time. But a writer of public
history above all deserves no indulgence whatever, who regards
anything of superior importance to truth. For in proportion'
as written history reaches larger numbers, and survives for
longer time, than words spoken to suit an occasion, both the
writer ought to be still more particular about truth, and his
readers ought to admit his authority only so far as he
adheres to this principle. At the actual hour of danger it is
only right that Greeks should help Greeks in every possible
way, by protecting them, veiling their errors or deprecating
the wrath of the sovereign people,&mdash;and this I genuinely did
for my part at the actual time: but it is also right, in regard
to the record of events to be transmitted to posterity, to leave
them unmixed with any falsehood: so that readers should not
be merely gratified for the moment by a pleasant tale, but
should receive in their souls a lesson which will prevent a
repetition of similar errors in the future. Enough, however,
on this subject. . . .</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" type="summary" place="inline" resp="ess">In the autumn of B. C. <date value="-150">150</date> the corrupt Menalchidas of Sparta
was succeeded as Achaean Strategus by Diaeus, who, to cover his
share in the corruption of Menalchidas, induced the league to act
in the matter of some disputed claim of Sparta in a manner
contrary to the decisions of the Roman Senate. The Spartans
wished to appeal again to Rome; whereupon the Achaeans
passed a law forbidding separate cities to make such appeals,
which were to be only made by the league. The Lacedaemonians
took up arms: and Diaeus professing that the league was not
at war with Sparta, but with certain factious citizens of that
city, named four of its chief men who were to be banished. They
fled to Rome, where the Senate ordered their restoration. Embassies went from Achaia and from Sparta to Rome to state their
respective cases; and on their return gave false reports,&mdash;Diaeus
<pb n="520"/>
assuring the Achaeans that the Senate had ordered the Spartans
to obey the league; Menalchidas telling the Spartans that the
Romans had released them from all connexion with the league.
War then again broke out (B.C. <date value="-148">148</date>). Metellus, who was in
Macedonia on the business of the Pseudo-Philip, sent legates to
the Achaeans forbidding them to bear arms against Sparta, and
announcing the speedy arrival of commissioners from Rome to
settle the dispute. But the Achaean levies were already mustered
under the Strategus Damocritus, and the Lacedaemonians seem
to have almost compelled them to fight. The Spartans were
beaten with considerable loss: and on Damocritus preventing a
pursuit and a capture of Sparta, the Achaeans regarded him as
traitor and fined him fifty talents. He was succeeded in his
office of Strategus by Diaeus (autumn B.C. <date value="-148">148</date> - B. C. <date value="-147">147</date>) who
promised Metellus to await the arrival of the commissioners
from Rome. But the Spartans now assumed their freedom from
the league and elected a Strategus of their own, Menalchidas;
who provoked a renewal of the war by taking the tow of Iasos
on the Laconian frontier. In despair of resisting the attack of
the Achaeans, and disowned by his fellow-citizens, he took poison.
The Roman commissioners arrived, led by L. Aurelius Orestes, in
B.C. <date value="-147">147</date>, and summoning the magistrates of the Achaean towns
and the Strategus Diaeus before them at Corinth, announced the
decision of the Senate&mdash;separating Lacedaemon, Corinth, Argos,
Heraclea near Aete, and Orchomenus in Arcadia from the
Achaean league, as not being united by blood, and only being
subsequent additions. The magistrates, without answering,
hastily summoned the league congress. The people, on hearing
the Roman decision, pillaged the houses of the Lacedaemonian
residents in Corinth, and savagely attacked all who were or who
looked like Spartans. The Roman envoys endeavoured to restrain the popular fury. But they were somewhat roughly
handled themselves; and the people could not be persuaded to
release the Spartans whom they had arrested: though they let
all others go, and sent an embassy to Rome, which, however,
meeting the former embassy on its return, and learning the
hopelessness of support in Rome, returned home. It is this outbreak which is referred to in the next fragment. See <bibl n="Paus. 7.12">Pausanias,

arrived in Rome from the Peloponnese, they
reported what had taken place, and declared
that they had a narrow escape of actually losing
their lives. They made the most of the occurrence and put the worst interpretation upon it; for they represented the violence which had been offered them as not
the result of a sudden outbreak, but of a deliberate intention
on the part of the Achaeans to inflict a signal insult upon them.
The Senate was therefore more angry than it had ever been,
and at once appointed Sextus Julius Caesar
and other envoys with instructions to rebuke and
upbraid the Achaeans for what had occurred,
yet in terms of moderation, but to exhort them
"not to listen to evil councillors, not to allow themselves to
be betrayed into hostility with Rome, but even yet to make
amends for their acts of folly by inflicting punishment on the
authors of the crime." This was a clear proof that the Senate
gave its instructions to Aurelius and his colleagues, not with
the view of dismembering the league, but with the object of
restraining the obstinacy and hostility of the Achaeans by
terrifying and overawing them. Some people accordingly
imagined that the Romans were acting hypocritically, because the Carthaginian war was still unfinished; but this was
not the case. The fact is, that they had long regarded the
Achaean league with favour, believing it to be the most trustworthy of all the Greek governments; and though now they
were resolved to give it an alarm, because it had become too
lofty in its pretensions, yet they were by no means minded to
go to war or to have a serious quarrel with the Achaeans. . . .</p></div2>

Diaeus and Critolaus, and all who shared their

and pests of the community, carefully selected,&mdash;took, as the
proverb has it, with the left hand what the Romans gave with
the right, and went utterly and entirely wrong in their calculations. For they supposed that the Romans, owing to the
troubles in Libya and Iberia, feared a war with the Achaeans
and would submit to anything and say anything. Thinking,
therefore, that the hour was their own, they answered the
Roman envoys politely that "They would, nevertheless, send
Thearidas and his colleagues to the Senate; while they would
themselves accompany the legates to Tegea, and there in consultation with the Lacedaemonians would provide for some
settlement of the war that would meet the views of both parties."
With this answer they subsequently induced the unhappy
nation to follow the senseless course to which they had long
before made up their mind. And this result was only what
might have been expected from the inexperience and corruption of the prevailing party.</p></div2>

both as to the satisfaction to be given for previous complaints

avoid the meeting, and that Critolaus should go alone to Tegea.<note anchored="yes" place="marg">contrives to avoid a settlement</note>
When Sextus and his fellow-commissioners therefore had
almost given them up, Critolaus arrived; and when the meeting with the Lacedaemonians took place, he would settle
nothing,&mdash;alleging that he had no authority to make any arrangement without the consent of the people at large; but that he
would bring the matter before the Achaeans at their next congress, which must be held six months from that time. Sextus
and his fellow-commissioners, therefore, convinced of the ill
disposition of Critolaus, and much annoyed at his conduct,
dismissed the Lacedaemonians to their own country, and
themselves returned to Italy with strong views as to the folly
and infatuation of Critolaus.</p>

in the spirit of that of Sextus Julius, exerting themselves with
great zeal to prevent the Achaeans from proceeding to an
open breach with Rome, either on the pretext of their grievance
against the Lacedaemonians, or from any feeling of anger
against the Romans themselves.   But the assembled people
would not hear them; insulting words were

driven from the assembly. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Riotous scene at Corinth.</note> The fact was that such a crowd

tried to incite the people by saying that, if they
quitted themselves like men, they would have
no lack of allies; but, if they betrayed womanish fears, they
would not want for masters. By many other such words to
the same effect, conceived in the spirit of a charlatan and
huckster, he roused and excited the populace. He attempted
also to make it plan that he was not acting at random in
these proceedings, but that some of the kings and republics
were engaged in the same policy as himself.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b38c11" type="chapter" n="11">
<head>Violent Policy of Critolaus</head>
<p>And when some of the Gerusia wished to check him,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Critolaus carries his point, and induces the Achaeans to pro-</note>

to retire, and stood up fronting his opponents,
and bade any one of them come up to him,

come near him, or venture to touch his chlamys.
And, finally, he said that "He had restrained
himself now for a long time; but would endure
it no longer, and must speak his mind. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">claim war against the Lacedaemonians.</note> The people to fear
were not Lacedaemonians or Romans, but the traitors among
themselves who co-operated with their foes: for there were
some who cared more for Romans and Lacedaemonians than
for their own country." He added, as a confirmation of his
words, that Evagoras of Aegium and Stratius of Tritaea
betrayed to Gnaeus Papirius and his fellow-commissioners all
the secret proceedings in the meetings of the magistrates.
And when Stratius acknowledged that he had had interviews
with those men, and should do so again, as they were friends
and allies, but asserted that he had told them nothing of what
was said in the meetings of the magistrates, some few believed
him, but the majority accepted the accusation as true. And
so Critolaus, having inflamed the people by his accusations
against these men, induced the Achaeans once more to decree a
war which was nominally against the Lacedaemonians, but in
effect was against the Romans; and he got another decree
added, which was a violation of the constitution, namely, that
whomsoever they should elect as Strategi should have absolute
power in carrying on the war. He thus got for himself something like a despotism.</p>
<p>Having carried these measures, he began intriguing to<note anchored="yes" place="marg">The Roman envoys retire from Corinth.</note>
bring on an outbreak and cause an attack upon
the Roman envoys. He had no pretext for
doing this; but adopted a course which, of all
possible courses, offends most flagrantly against the laws of
gods and man. The envoys, however, separated; Gnaeus
Papirius went to Athens and thence to Sparta to watch the
turn of events; Aulus Gabinius went to Naupactus; and the
other two remained at Athens, waiting for the arrival of Caecilius Metellus. This was the state of things in the Peloponnese. . .

<head>Variety Is Pleasing</head>
<p>I AM fully aware that some will be found to criticise my
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">A defence of the historian's method of parallel histories of several countries, each kept up to date.</note>
work, on the ground that my narrative of events
is incomplete and disconnected; beginning, for
instance, the story of the siege of Carthage, and
then leaving it half told, and interrupting the
stream of my history, I pass over to Greek
affairs, and from them to Macedonian or
Syrian, or some other history; whereas students require continuity, and desire to hear the end of a subject; for the combination of pleasure and profit is thus more completely secured.
But I do not think this: I hold exactly the reverse. And as
a witness to the correctness of my opinion I might appeal to
nature herself, who is never satisfied with the same things
continuously in any of the senses, but is ever inclined to
change; and, even if she is satisfied with the same things,
wishes to have them at intervals and in diversity of circumstance. This may be illustrated first by the sense of hearing,
which is never gratified either in music or recitations by a continuance of the same strains or subjects; it is the varied style,
and, in a word, whatever is broken up into intervals and has the
most marked and frequent changes, that gives it pleasurable
excitement. Similarly one may notice that the palate can
never remain gratified by the same meats, however costly, but
grows to feel a loathing for them, and delights in changes of
diet, and often prefers plain to rich food merely for the sake of
variety. The same may be noticed as to the sight: it is quite
incapable of remaining fixed on the same object, but it is a
variety and change of objects that excites it. And this is more
<pb n="527"/>
than all the case with the mind; for changes in the objects of
attention and study act as rests to laborious men.</p></div2>
<div2 id="b39c2" type="chapter" n="2">
<head>Digressions in History</head>
<p>Accordingly the most learned of the ancient historians
have, as it seems to me, taken intervals of rest in this way:
some by digressions on myths and tales, and others by
digressions on historical facts,&mdash;not confining themselves to
Greek history, but introducing disquisitions on points of foreign
history as well. As, for instance, when, in the course of a history
of Thessaly and the campaigns of Alexander of Pherae, they
introduce an account of the attempts of the Lacedaemonians
in the Peloponnese; or those made by the Athenians; or actions
which took place in Macedonia or Illyria: and then break off
into an account of the expedition of Iphicrates into Egypt, and
the iniquitous deeds of Clearchus in the Pontus. This will
show you that these historians all employ this method; but,
whereas they employ it without any system, I do so on a
regular system. For these men, after mentioning, for instance,
that Bardylis, king of the Illyrians, and Cersobleptes, king
of the Thracians, established their dynasties, neither go on
continuously with the stories nor return to them after an
interval to take them up where they left off, but, treating them
like an episode in a poem, they go back to their original subject.
But I made a careful division of all the most important countries
in the world and the course of their several histories; pursued
exactly the same plan in regard to the order of taking the several
divisions; and, moreover, arranged the history of each year in
the respective countries, carefully keeping to the limits of the
time: and the result is that I have made the transition backwards and forwards between my continuous narrative and the
continually recurring interruptions easy and obvious to students,
so that an attentive reader need never miss anything. . . .</p>

before the Roman commander, quite forgetful of his proud

<p>When the Carthaginian commander thus threw himself as a
suppliant at Scipio's knees, the proconsul with a glance at those
present said: "See what Fortune is, gentlemen! What an

us. Who would not learn from such a spectacle that a mere

some of the deserters came to the edge of the roof and begged
the front ranks of the assailants to hold their hands for a
little; and, on Scipio ordering a halt, they began abusing
Hasdrubal, some for his perjury, declaring that he had sworn
again and again on the altars that he would never abandon
them, and others for his cowardice and utter baseness: and
they did this in the most unsparing language, and with the
bitterest terms of abuse. And just at this moment Hasdrubal's

<p>At the sight of the city utterly perishing amidst the

inevitable change which awaits cities, nations, and dynasties,
one and all, as it does every one of us men. This, he
thought, had befallen Ilium, once a powerful city, and the
once mighty empires of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, and
that of Macedonia lately so splendid. And unintentionally or

<p>Another still more remarkable saying of his I may record. . .

"O Polybius, it is a grand thing, but, I know not how, I feel
a terror and dread, lest some one should one day give the same
order about my own native city." . . . Any observation more
practical or sensible it is not easy to make. For in the midst
of supreme success for one's self and of disaster for the enemy,
to take thought of one's own position and of the possible reverse
which may come, and in a word to keep well in mind in the
midst of prosperity the mutability of Fortune, is the characteristic of a great man, a man free from weaknesses and worthy
to be remembered. . . .</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" type="summary" place="inline" resp="ess">After the rejection of the orders conveyed by the legates of
Metellus (38, 11), Critolaus collected the Achaean levies at
Corinth, under the pretext of going to war with Sparta; but he
soon induced the league to declare themselves openly at war with
Rome. He was encouraged by the adhesion of the Boeotarch
Pytheas, and of the Chalcidians. The Thebans were the readier
to join him because they had lately been ordered by Metellus, as
arbiter in the disputes, to pay fines to the Phocians, Euboeans,
and Amphissians. When news of these proceedings reached
Rome in the spring of B. C. <date value="-146">146</date>, the consul Mummius was ordered
to lead a fleet and army against Achaia. But Metellus in
Macedonia wished to have the credit of settling the matter himself; he therefore sent envoys to the Achaeans ordering them to
release from the league the towns already named by the Senate
viz. Sparta, Corinth, Argos, Heracleia, and Orchomenus in
Arcadia, and advanced with his army from Macedonia through
Thessaly by the coast road, skirting the Sinus Maliacus.
Critolaus was already engaged in besieging Heraclea Oetea, to
compel it to return to its obedience to the league, and when his
scouts informed him of the approach of Metellus, he retreated to
Scarphea on the coast of Locris, some miles south of the pass of
Thermopylae. But before he could get into Scarphea Metellus
caught him up, killed a large number of his men, and took one
thousand prisoners. Critolaus himself disappeared; Pausanias
seems to imagine that he was drowned in the salt marshes of
the coast, but Livy says that he poisoned himself. <bibl n="Paus. 7.14">Pausanias, 7.14-15</bibl>. <bibl n="Liv. Per. 52">Livy, Ep. 52</bibl>. Orosius, 5, 3.</note>

the insolent demeanour and neglect of their duties on the part
of the slaves,&mdash;airs which they assumed as having been recently
liberated, or, in the case of others, because they were excited

by the prospect of freedom. Moreover the men were compelled

to these men? The members of this conclave were Diaeus
and Damocritus, who had but recently been recalled from exile
owing to the disturbed state of the times, and with them
Alcamenes, Theodectes and Archicrates; and of these last I
have already stated at length who they were, and have described their character, policy, and manner of life.</p></div2>

<p>Such being the men with whom the decision rested,
<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Cruel death of Sosicrates.</note>
the determination arrived at was what was to
be expected. They not only imprisoned Andronidas and Lagius and their friends, but even
the sub-Strategus Sosicrates, on the charge of his having
presided at a council and given his voting for sending an
embassy to Caecilius Metellus, and in fact of having been the
cause of all their misfortunes. Next day they empanelled
judges to try them; condemned Sosicrates to death; and
having bound him racked him till he died, without however
inducing him to say anything that they expected: but they
acquitted Lagius, Andronidas and Archippus, partly because
the people were scared at the lawless proceeding against
Sosicrates, and partly because Diaeus got a talent from
Andronidas and forty minae from Archippus; for this man
could not relax his usual shameless and abandoned principles
in this particular even "in the very pit,"<note anchored="yes">The pit is the place dug out (<foreign lang="greek">ska/mma</foreign>) and prepared in the gymnasium

had acted with similar cruelty a short time before also in
<pb n="535"/>
regard to Philinus of Corinth. For on a charge of his holding
communication with Menalcidas<note anchored="yes">See note on <ref target="b30c17" targOrder="U">30, 17</ref>.</note> and favouring the Roman
cause, he caused Philinus and his sons to be flogged and
racked in each other's sight, and did not desist until the boys
and Philinus were all dead. When such madness and ferocity
was infecting everybody, as it would not be easy to parallel even
among barbarians, it would be clearly very natural to ask why
the whole nation did not utterly perish. <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Greece is saved by the rapidity of her ruin.</note> For my
part, I think that Fortune displayed her resources
and skill in resisting the folly and madness of
the leaders; and, being determined at all hazards to save the
Achaeans, like a good wrestler, she had recourse to the only
trick left; and that was to bring down and conquer the Greeks
quickly, as in fact she did. For it was owing to this that the
wrath and fury of the Romans did not blaze out farther; that
the army of Libya did not come to Greece; and that these
leaders, being such men as I have described, did not have an
opportunity, by gaining a victory, of displaying their wickedness
upon their countrymen. For what it was likely that they
would have done to their own people, if they had got any
ground of vantage or obtained any success, may be reasonable inferred from what has already been said. And indeed
everybody at the time had the proverb on his lips, "had we
not perished quickly we had not been saved."<note anchored="yes">For this proverb see Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. Them. 29"><title>Themist.</title> 29</bibl>; <title>de Alex. Virt.</title> 5; <title>de Exil.</title> 7.</note> . . .</p></div2>

here. He was a member of a family and gens
of the first rank, but in himself was garrulous and wordy, and exceedingly ostentatious.
From his boyhood he had a great leaning to Greek studies
and literature: but he was so immoderate and affected in
this pursuit, that owing to him the Greek style became
offensive to the elder and most respectable men at Rome.
Finally he attempted to write a poem and a formal history
in Greek, in the preface to which he desired his readers
to excuse him if, being a Roman, he could not completely
command the Greek idiom or method in the handling
of the subject. To whom M. Porcius Cato made a very
<pb n="536"/>
pertinent answer. "I wonder," said he, "on what grounds
you make such a demand. If the Amphictyonic council had
charged you to write the history, you might perhaps have been
forced to allege this excuse and ask for this consideration.
But to write it of your own accord, when there was no compulsion to do so, and then to demand consideration, if you
should happen to write had Greek, is quite unreasonable. It
is something like a man entering for the boxing match or
pancratium in the public games, and, when he comes into the
stadium, and it is his turn to fight, begging the spectators to
pardon him 'if he is unable to stand the fatigue or the blows.'
Such a man of course would be laughed at and condemned at
once."<note anchored="yes">Plutarch reports the same anecdote much more briefly in <bibl n="Plut. Cat. Ma. 12"><title>Cato Maj.</title> 12</bibl>,
as do others. Professor Freeman (<title>History of Federal Government,</title> p. 142)
seems to regard it as a serious indication that the Amphictyonic council had
become a body exercising some literary authority, in default of any other. I
think that Cato had no such meaning. He mentioned any body of men,
however unlikely to exercise such an influence, which at any rate was Greek.</note> And this is what such historiographers should experience, to prevent them spoiling a good thing by their rash presumption. Similarly, in the rest of his life, he had imitated all the
worst points in Greek fashions; for he was fond of pleasure and
averse from toil. And this may be illustrated from his conduct
in the present campaign: for being among the first to enter
Greece at the time that the battle in Phocis took place, he retired
to Thebes on the pretence of illness, in order to avoid taking
part in the engagement; but, when the battle was ended, he
was the first to write to the Senate announcing the victory,
entering into every detail as though he had himself been

<p>There were many statues of Philopoemen, and many<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Statues of Philopoemen.</note>
erections in his honour, voted by the several

which befell Greece at Corinth, wished to abolish
them all and to formally indict him, laying an information
against him, as though he were still alive, as an enemy and illwisher to Rome. But after a discussion, in which Polybius
spoke against this sycophant, neither Mummius nor the commissioners would consent to abolish the honours of an illustrious man. . . .</p>
<p>Polybius, in an elaborate speech, conceived in the spirit of<note anchored="yes" place="marg">Speech of Polybius defending the memory of Philopoemen.</note>
what has just been said, maintained the cause of
Philopoemen. His arguments were that "This
<pb n="538"/>
man had indeed been frequently at variance with
the Romans on the matter of their injunctions,
but he only maintained his opposition so far as to inform and
persuade them on the points in dispute; and even that he did
not do without serious cause.  He gave a genuine proof of his
loyal policy and gratitude, by a test as it were of fire, in the
periods of the wars with Philip and Antiochus. For, possessing
at those times the greatest influence of any one in Greece, from
his personal power as well as that of the Achaeans, he preserved
his friendship for Rome with the most absolute fidelity, having
joined in the vote of the Achaeans in virtue of which, four
months before the Romans crossed from Italy, they levied
a war from their own territory upon Antiochus and the
Aetolians, when nearly all the other Greeks had become
estranged from the Roman friendship." Having listened to
this speech and approved of the speaker's view, the ten commissioners granted that the complimentary erections to Philopoemen in the several cities should be allowed to remain.
Acting on this pretext, Polybius begged of the Consul the
statues of Achaeus, Aratus, and Philopoemen, though they
had already been transported to Acarnania from the Peloponnese: in gratitude for which action people set up a marble
statue of Polybius himself.<note anchored="yes">The base of a statue of Polybius has been discovered at Olympia with

anything whatever of the goods sold by the Quaestor anywhere:&mdash;for he was going a round of the cities and selling the
property of all those who had been partisans of Diaeus, as
well of such as had been condemned, except those who left

deserved great praise and abiding remembrance, and according to others the reverse. If
any king before him ever was, he was mild and

he never put any of his own friends to death on
any charge whatever; and I believe that not a
single man at Alexandria either owed his death
to him. Again, though he was notoriously ejected from his
throne by his brother, in the first place, when he got a clear
opportunity against him in Alexandria, he granted him a
complete amnesty; and afterwards, when his brother once
more made a plot against him to seize Cyprus, though he got
him body and soul into his hands at Lapethus, he was so far
from punishing him as an enemy, that he even made him grants
in addition to those which formerly belonged to him in virtue
of the treaty made between them, and moreover promised him
his daughter. However, in the course of a series of successes

arrived at the end of my whole work, I wish
to recall to the minds of my readers the
point from which I started, and the plan which
I laid down at the commencement of my history, and then
to give a summary of the entire subject. I announced then at
starting that I should begin my narrative at the point where
Timaeus left off, and that going cursorily over the events in
Italy, Sicily, and Libya&mdash;since that writer has only composed a
history of those places,&mdash;when I came to the time when Hannibal took over the command of the Carthaginian army; Philip
son of Demetrius the kingdom of Macedonia; Cleomenes of
Sparta was banished from Greece; Antiochus succeeded to the
kingdom in Syria, and Ptolemy Philopator to that in Egypt,&mdash;I
promised that starting once more from that period, namely the
139th Olympiad, I would give a general history of the world:
marking out the periods of the Olympiads, separating the
events of each year, and comparing the histories of the several
countries by parallel narratives of each, up to the capture of
Carthage, and the battle of the Achaeans and Romans in the
Isthmus, and the consequent political settlement imposed on
the Greeks. From all of which I said that students would
learn a lesson of supreme interest and instructiveness. This
was to ascertain how, and under what kind of polity, almost
the whole inhabited world came under the single authority of
Rome, a fact quite unparalleled in the past. These promises
then having all been fulfilled, it only remains for me to state
the periods embraced in my history, the number of my books,
and how many go to make up my whole work. . . .

the hunting company, and drawing his sword rescued the king
