						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*(h r(htorikh/ e)stin a)nti/strofos th=| dialektikh=</lemma> is translated by Cicero, <hi rend="italic">ex altera parte respondere dialecticae</hi>, Orat. XXXII 114. &lsquo;Vox a scena ducta videtur. Chori antistrophe strophae ad assem respondet, eiusque motus ita fit, ut posterior in prioris locum succedat...Significat ex altera parte respondere et quasi ex adverso oppositum esse; id quod etiam in antistrophen cadit.&rsquo; Trendel. <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Arist.</hi> &sect; 14 p. 74: and to the same effect, <hi rend="italic">Comment. ad Arist. de Anima</hi>, II 11 5 p. 408. &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofon</foreign> dicitur quod alius rei quasi partes agit eamque repraesentat;&rsquo; Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Comm. ad Anal. Pr.</hi> I 2, 25 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 6. </p>
						<p>The term is borrowed from the manoeuvres of the chorus in the recitation of the choral odes. <foreign lang="greek">*strofh/</foreign> denotes its movement in one direction, to which the <foreign lang="greek">a)ntistrofh/</foreign>, the counter-movement, the wheeling in the opposite direction, exactly corresponds, the same movements being repeated. M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Diss. Eumen.</hi> p. 41. <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> c. XIV &sect; 4. Mure, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gk. Lit.</hi> Bk. III. c. 1 &sect; 15. Hence it is extended to the words sung by the chorus during the latter of these evolutions, and signifies a set of verses precisely parallel or answering in all their details to the verses of the <foreign lang="greek">strofh/</foreign>. And thus, when applied in its strict and proper sense, it denotes an exact correspondence in detail, as a fac-simile or counterpart. </p>
						<p>Hence in Logic <foreign lang="greek">a)ntistre/fein</foreign> is used to express terms and propositions which are <hi rend="italic">convertible</hi>, and therefore identical in meaning, precisely similar in all respects. On the various senses of <foreign lang="greek">a)ntistre/fein</foreign> and its derivatives in Logic, see Waitz, u. s. In this signification, however, <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign> does not properly represent the relation actually subsisting between the two arts, the differences between them being too numerous to admit of its being described as an exact correspondence in detail; as I have already pointed out in the paraphrase (Introd. p. 134). </p>
						<p>It also represents Rhetoric as an art, independent of, though analogous to, Dialectics, but not growing out of it, nor included under it. The word is of very frequent occurrence in Plato (Gorgias, Republic, Philebus, Timaeus, Theaetetus, Leges), who joins it indifferently with the genitive and dative; and he employs it in this latter sense; as likewise Isocrates, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ a)ntid</foreign>. &sect; 182; and Aristotle himself in several places; Polit. VI (IV) 5, 1292 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 7, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e)/stin a)nti/strofos</foreign> (corresponding) <pb n="2"/> <foreign lang="greek">au(/th e)n tai=s o)ligarxi/ais w(/sper h( turanni\s e)n tai=s monarxi/ais</foreign>. c. 6 ult. 1293 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33. c. 10, 1295 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18. de part. anim. II 17 ult. <foreign lang="greek">e)n me\n ou)=n tou/tois toi=s zw/|ois h( glw=tta toiau/th th\n fu/sin e)sti/n, w(/sper a)ntistro/fws e)/xousa tw=| mukth=ri tw=n e)lefa/ntwn</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Lastly, Waitz, u. s., points out a peculiar signification of it, &lsquo;res contraria alteri quam potestate aequiparat,&rsquo; in de Gen. Anim. II 6, 743 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28. <foreign lang="greek">to\ yuxro\n suni/sthsin a)nti/strofon</foreign> (as a balance) <foreign lang="greek">th=| qermo/thti th=| peri\ th\n kardi/an to\n e)gke/falon</foreign>. Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">Comm. ad de Anima</hi> u. s., after defining <foreign lang="greek">a)ntistre/fein</foreign> as above, adds, <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign> ex eadem chori similitudine significat <hi rend="italic">ex altera parte respondere</hi> (this is from Cicero, u. s.) Arist. Rhet. I 1; quod non significat, rhetoricam in dialecticae locum succedere (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> can be substituted for it, step into its place, as <hi rend="italic">a convertible term</hi>), sed quasi ex adverso esse oppositam (stands over against it, as a corresponding opposite in a <foreign lang="greek">sustoixi/a</foreign>, two parallel rows of coordinate opposites, like the partners in a country dance). Quintilian, Inst. Orat. II 17, 42, <hi rend="italic">specie magis quam genere differunt.</hi> </p>
						<p>The term <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign> therefore applied to the two arts, seems to represent them as two coordinate opposites, or opposites in the same row (see Spengel on the study of Rhetoric, Munich 1842, p. 21). They are sister arts, with general resemblances and specific differences; two species under one genus, proof: both modes of proof, both dealing with probable materials, but distinguished by the difference of the two instruments of proof employed: the one <hi rend="italic">concluding</hi> by the formal svllogism, and by the regular induction, assumed complete; the other drawing its <hi rend="italic">inferences</hi> by the abbreviated, imperfect, conversational enthymeme, never complete in <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, and by the single example in the place of the general induction. </p>
						<p>Rhetoric is afterwards described as <foreign lang="greek">parafue/s, mo/rion</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(moi/wma</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. II &sect; 7). <foreign lang="greek">parafue/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mo/rion</foreign> both express in different ways the relation that Rhetoric bears to Dialectics as the off-shoot, <hi rend="italic">branch</hi>, or part; a species or variety of the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> art of probable reasoning: <foreign lang="greek">parafue/s</foreign> as a subordinate shoot, growing out of the same root with the larger plant or tree,&mdash;a term so far corresponding with <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign>, but differing from it in making Rhetoric <hi rend="italic">subordinate.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">mo/rion</foreign> reduces it to a still lower level in comparison with the other. <foreign lang="greek">o(moi/wma</foreign> implies no more than a mere general resemblance. </p>
						<p>In Sext. Empir. adv. Math. VII 6, occurs an explanation of <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign>, quite in character with the ordinary Greek etymologies, <foreign lang="greek">r(htorikh/n, h(=s a)nti/strofon ei)=nai th\n dialektikh/n</foreign>, (not referring apparently to this passage, but most probably to the <foreign lang="greek">sunagwgh\ texnw=n</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">toute/stin i)so/strofon, dia\ to\ peri\ th\n au)th\n u(/lhn stre/fesqai</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">versari circa</hi>), as Homer called Ulysses <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/qeon</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">i)so/qeon</foreign>. Alexander (infr.) gives the same explanation. </p>
						<p>Bacon <hi rend="italic">Adv. of learning</hi> Bk. II IX 3, has <hi rend="italic">antistrophe</hi> for &lsquo;correspondence&rsquo;, &ldquo;and it hath the same relation or <hi rend="italic">antistrophe</hi> that the former hath.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>The points of correspondence and difference between the two arts have been already fully explained in the Introduction, p. 90 foll.: I will here give a summary of them from Alexander's <hi rend="italic">Commentary on the</hi> <pb n="3"/> <hi rend="italic">Topics</hi>, p. 4. They are 1. that both of them are <foreign lang="greek">mh\ peri\ e(/n ti ge/nos a)fwrisme/non</foreign>; that is, that neither of them has any special subject-matter, like the sciences, but argues or perorates upon any thesis or subject whatsoever that can be presented to it. 2. <foreign lang="greek">to\ di) e)ndo/cwn kai\ piqanw=n</foreign>, no proof or conclusion, or principle, that they employ is more than probable; exact demonstration and necessary conclusions are excluded from both alike; <foreign lang="greek">pi/stis</foreign>, belief, the result of mere persuasion, and not <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mh</foreign>, the infallible result of scientific demonstration, being the object aimed at. 3. <foreign lang="greek">mh\ di) oi)kei/wn a)rxw=n</foreign>, they have no &lsquo;special, appropriate&rsquo; first principles, such as those from which the special sciences are deduced; though they likewise appeal to the <foreign lang="greek">ta\ koina/</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">koinai\ a)rxai/</foreign>, the ultimate axioms and principles common to all reasoning, which are above those of the special sciences, and from which the latter must be deduced. And, 4. they are <foreign lang="greek">o(moi/ws peri\ ta\ a)ntikei/mena a)llh/lois</foreign>; they argue indifferently the opposite sides of the same question, and conclude the positive or negative of any proposition or problem; unlike science and demonstration, which can only arrive at one conclusion. Where the materials and the method are alike only probable, every question has, or may be made to appear to have, two sides, either of which may be maintained on probable principles; in Dialectics and Rhetoric no certainty is either attained or attainable. The chief points of difference between them are, that Dialectics deals practically as well as theoretically with every kind of problem or question that can be submitted to it; proceeds by question and answer, in the way of debate, and its discussions are of a more general or universal character; whereas the subjects of Rhetoric are practically, though not theoretically, almost absolutely limited to Politics; it follows a method of continuous narration or explanation (<foreign lang="greek">diecodikw=s</foreign>), and deals in its conclusions rather with individual cases than with general principles or universal rules, maxims and axioms. </p>
						<p>Alexander, in a preceding passage, gives the following very extraordinary account of the derivation and original meaning of <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">to\ ga\r a)nt. a)nti\ tou= i)so/strofo/n te kai\ peri\ ta\ au)ta\ strefome/nhn kai\ kataginome/nhn le/gei</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">koina\ a(pa/ntwn</lemma>] See Introd., p. 87, and the Paraphrase, pp. 134&mdash;5. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)fwrisme/nhs</lemma>] &lsquo;marked off, separated by a limit&rsquo;, from every thing else about it; and so &lsquo;definite, special&rsquo; (&sect; 7). 1, 2, 1 <foreign lang="greek">peri/ ti ge/nos i)/dion a)fwrisme/non</foreign>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= doqe/ntos</foreign>. Polit. I 13, 1260 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1 <foreign lang="greek">a)fwrisme/nhn tina\ doulei/an</foreign> (a definite, limited, kind of slavery). Ib. IV (VI) 4, 1290 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25 <foreign lang="greek">a)podiori/zein. a)fori/zetai</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">h( th=s yuxh=s du/namis</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">pro\s ta\s a)/llas duna/meis tw=| e)/rgw| tou/tw|</foreign>, &ldquo;this capacity of the soul is marked off, separated, distinguished, from all the rest by this function,&rdquo; de Anima II 4, 9, 416 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 20. The preposition is similarly used in the compound <foreign lang="greek">a)poble/pein</foreign>, which is &lsquo;to look away, or off&rsquo;, from all surrounding objects, so as to fix the attention on one particular thing, or turn it in one particular direction. Comp. Lat. <hi rend="italic">de</hi>finire, <hi rend="italic">de</hi>terminare. </p>
						<p>Parallel passages, in which this same characteristic of Rhetoric and <pb n="4"/> Dialectics is noticed, are cited in the Introd. p. 75. See also Quintilian, II 21, 16&mdash;19, on the province of the orator. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sunh/qeian</lemma>] &lsquo;habituation, familiarity, practice&rsquo;, acquired by <hi rend="italic">association</hi> (prop. that of living or herding together).

See also on I 10, 18. This <foreign lang="greek">sunh/qeia</foreign> is derived from the constant operation or activity, the <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeiai</foreign>, of the developed and acquired and settled <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign>, or mental state (<foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">e)/xein</foreign>, &lsquo;to be in such and such a state or condition&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">to\ pw=s e)/xein</foreign>): by the constant exercise of the <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign>, or established confirmed habit, and its <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeiai</foreign>, is produced by association that familiarity, or habituation, or practice, which secures success even to the empirical unartistic use of Dialectics or Rhetoric. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)kh=| tau=ta dra=|n</lemma> is the use of them antecedent to practice, and without previously acquired familiarity: <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ tau)toma/tou</foreign>, by a mere spontaneous impulse, and therefore &lsquo;at random.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Est autem dialectica,&rsquo; says John of Salisbury, <hi rend="italic">Metalogicus</hi>, II 4, &lsquo;ut Augustino placet, bene disputandi scientia: quod quidem ita accipiendum est ut vis habeatur in verbis; ne scilicet dialectici credantur, quos casus iuvat artis beneficio destitutos.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)ta/</lemma>] Rhetoric and its processes. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(dopoiei=n</lemma>] &lsquo;to make a way&rsquo;; to trace a path to be followed, which will lead you without unnecessary deviations to the place at which you wish to arrive. <foreign lang="greek">o(do/s</foreign> therefore, in this metaphorical usage, is not merely <hi rend="italic">a</hi> way, but <hi rend="italic">the</hi> way, the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> way; the way which will lead you most surely and expeditiously to the end proposed. Hence it denotes a regular, systematic, or scientific method; the best and easiest way of attaining the end desired in any intellectual pursuit or branch of study. And thus it is that the simple <foreign lang="greek">o(do/s</foreign>, as well as the compound <foreign lang="greek">me/qodos</foreign>, come to denote a scientific or systematic procedure in the pursuit of truth as a philosophical &lsquo;method&rsquo;, or in any art or study. Hence we find <foreign lang="greek">o(dw=| dih|rh=sqai</foreign>, Plat. Phaedr. 263 B, of a systematic methodical scientific division; and Rep. VII 533 D: <foreign lang="greek">kaq'  o(do/n</foreign>, in the same sense, Rep. IV 435 A, and Crat. 425 B. In Aristotle, de gen. et corr.

						<p>Quintilian describes the views of some of those who thus rigorously limit the province of Rhetoric as an <hi rend="italic">art</hi>&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ai( pi/steis e)/ntexno/n e)sti mo/non</foreign>&mdash; to the employment of the &lsquo;enthymeme&rsquo;, the rhetorical representative of the logical and demonstrative &lsquo;syllogism&rsquo;; with the exclusion of all that is, strictly speaking, &lsquo;beside the subject or real issue&rsquo;, all that is beside the facts of the case and the direct proof of them; all indirect proof, namely, from the assumed character of the speaker himself, or appeals to the feelings of the judges or audience, and also all ornaments and graces of style and delivery. Aristotle here assumes this to be theoretically the only true and proper method, though he by no means consistently adheres to it in his actual treatment of the subject. Quintilian's description is as follows, though, as the reasons for the exclusion of these indirect proofs are somewhat different from those assigned by Aristotle, he probably does not refer immediately to him: <hi rend="italic">Fuerunt et clari quidem oratores quibus solum videretur oratoris officium</hi> docere. <hi rend="italic">Namque et affectus duplici ratione excludendos putabant: primum quia vitium esset omnis animi perturbatio; deinde quia iudicem a veritate depelli misericordia vel ira similibusque non oporteret: et voluptatem audientium pctere, quum vincendi tantum gratia diceretur, non modo agenti supervacuum sed vix etiam viro dignum arbitrabantur.</hi> Inst.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pragmateu/esqai</lemma> is well explained by Bonitz on Metaph.

The primary sense of doing business, or occupying oneself about anything, passes into the more limited or special signification of an <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> pursuit, and thence of &lsquo;a special study&rsquo;, &lsquo;a systematic treatment of a particular subject of investigation, or practice&rsquo; (as in this present case, of Rhetoric, comp. &sect; 10). <foreign lang="greek">pragmatei/a</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">me/qodos, te/xnh, e)pisth/mh, filosofi/a</foreign>, and many other words, is used to express not only the intellectual process of investigation, but also the resulting science, art, treatise, or written work, or part of such work.

						<p>&lsquo;Crooked&rsquo; for perverse, immoral, wrong, is very common in the earlier writers of our own language. Deut. xxxii 5, a perverse and crooked generation. Ps. cxxv 5, Prov. ii 15, whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths. Ep. ad Phil. ii 15, and in many other places and authors. For examples of the latter, see Richardson's Dict.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ka)\n ei)/ tis...poih/seie</lemma>] The process by which <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in this and similar forms of expression&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">w(s a)\n ei), w(/sper a)\n ei), kaqa/per a)\n ei), oi(o/nper a)\n ei)</foreign>, and the like&mdash;has lost its force, become inactive, (<hi rend="italic">consopitum</hi>, &lsquo;gone to sleep&rsquo;, Buttm.,) in the sentence, is explained by Buttmann in his note on Dem. Mid. &sect; 15, p. 530. The conditional <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> belongs to some verb in the apodosis, originally expressed, afterwards left to be understood, as in the clause before us. The expression at full length would be, <foreign lang="greek">ka)\n, ei)/ tis poih/seie, poih/seie</foreign>, &lsquo;as one would do, if he were to do&rsquo;. Still, though the particle has lost its direct and active force in this sentence, some latent notion of conditionality always remains, even when the verb which <foreign lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> supposes cannot actually be supplied. This is the case in such phrases as <foreign lang="greek">fobou/menos w(/sper a)\n ei) pai=s</foreign>, Pl. Gorg. 479 A &lsquo;fearing as a child would&rsquo;: Ar. parva naturalia <foreign lang="greek">peri\ mantikh=s</foreign> I 2, 2 <foreign lang="greek">o(/swn w(/sper a)\n ei) la/los h( fu/sis e)stin</foreign>, &lsquo;whose natural habit is, as it might be (<foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>), talkative&rsquo;; de Anima I 5, 5, 409 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27, <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper a)\n ei) th\n yuxh\n ta\ pra/gmata tiqe/ntes</foreign>. In such cases the <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is retained by habit and association, when the sense no longer requires it. The phrase accordingly is not found in the earlier forms of the language, and does not become common till the time of Plato and Aristotle, with whom, the latter especially, it is very frequent. The association required time before it was established as a fixed habit. I believe that it does not occur in Thucydides, and that it makes its first appearance in Xenophon; that is, in the forms above given; for as an unnecessary appendage to a participle, or in cases <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> is thus used by earlier writers. See Hermann on Soph. Phil. 491, and Jelf, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 430, I, for some instances [K&uuml;hner's <hi rend="italic">Ausf&uuml;hrliche Grammatik</hi> &sect; 398 p. 209 sq.

						<p>Aristotle seems to be the earliest writer who assumed the license of joining <foreign lang="greek">ka)\n ei)</foreign> with the subjunctive mood, as in Pol.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)podido/nai</lemma>] a word of <hi rend="italic">very</hi> frequent use in Aristotle, has for one of its elementary senses that of &lsquo;to give back&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">reddere;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">a)po/</foreign> as in <foreign lang="greek">a)pone/mein, a)polamba/nein, a)paitei=n, a)po/plous, a)poplei=n</foreign> (see Sturz. Lex. Xenoph.), from which all the other senses in which at least Aristotle employs it may be deduced. Another of the original senses of the word is &lsquo;to give forth&rsquo;, or &lsquo;produce&rsquo;, as the earth produces her fruits, and this also <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be applied to the interpretation of it in several of its various uses. But as this signification is likewise deducible from the other&mdash;for production, as <pb n="12"/> when the earth produces her fruits, may be regarded as a payment or restoration, or &lsquo;return&rsquo; of something <hi rend="italic">as due</hi>&mdash;it may perhaps be better to refer them all to the one original signification, <hi rend="italic">reddere.</hi> So in Eth. N. II 1, 1103, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 22, <foreign lang="greek">ta\s e)nergei/as a)podido/nai</foreign> is not simply &lsquo;to produce&rsquo;, but to produce energies that are <hi rend="italic">due to the system</hi>, energies <hi rend="italic">corresponding</hi> to the faculties from which they spring. So Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Arist.</hi> &sect; 55, p. 132, &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">a)podido/nai</foreign> proprie est reddere, unde ex suum cuique tribuendi significatione facile orta est declarandi vis (<hi rend="italic">declarare</hi> is the sense which the word bears in the passage specially referred to, Top. A 5, 102 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3) nihil enim est aliud quam logice suam cuique naturam reddere.&rsquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)podido/nai</lemma> is therefore (1) to give back, restore, repay, render, always implying some kind of obligation, (2) to render <hi rend="italic">as a due</hi>, &lsquo;assign&rsquo; (which best represents it in the majority of cases in Aristotle); of <hi rend="italic">due</hi> distribution, <hi rend="italic">suum cuique;</hi> hence (3) of the due fulfilment of any office or duty, as <foreign lang="greek">a)podido/nai lo/gon</foreign>, &lsquo;to <hi rend="italic">render</hi> an account&rsquo;, to explain, or set forth, any statement or doctrine, <foreign lang="greek">a)pofai/nesqai</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">declarare.</hi> To one or the other of these I believe all the multifarious uses of the word may be referred. </p>
						<p>I will add a few examples in the way of illustration:&mdash;Dem. c.

						<p>So here <foreign lang="greek">a)podido/nai</foreign> is &lsquo;duly to assign, distribute, or apportion&rsquo; and again I 2, 5, <foreign lang="greek">a)podi/domen ta\s kri/seis</foreign> &lsquo;we render our judgments&rsquo;. These same applications of the word occur likewise in Plato, as Rep. 379 A, (to represent), Ib. 472 D, VI 508 E, Phaedr. 237 C, Theaet. 175 D, Polit. 295 A. The precise opposite, <foreign lang="greek">a)polamba/nein</foreign>, occurs with the same sense of <foreign lang="greek">a)po/</foreign>, I 11, 3. <foreign lang="greek">a)pone/mein</foreign> is used in exactly the same sense, &lsquo;to assign as a due&rsquo;; see for instance Eth. Nic. IV 7, 1123 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 18, <foreign lang="greek">o( toi=s qeoi=s a)pone/momen</foreign>, Ib.

						<p>It may be worth while to say a few words on this very common usage of <foreign lang="greek">h)/dh</foreign> and analogous particles of time, in the way of illustration and exemplification. <foreign lang="greek">*)/hdh</foreign> and its analogues <foreign lang="greek">e)/ti, ou)ke/ti, ou)/pw</foreign>, are used emphatically to mark a critical point, climax, degree attained, as deserving of special and particular attention, at the moment, and in reference to something else which is not equally remarkable. They are all particles of time, and derive this their secondary sense from the metaphorical application of this notion of &lsquo;already&rsquo;, a definite time which we have just reached: &lsquo;point&rsquo;, or &lsquo;stage&rsquo;, or &lsquo;degree&rsquo; attained being substituted by the metaphor for &lsquo;time&rsquo; in the original sense of the word. </p>
						<p>This will be best illustrated by a few examples.

						<p>The use of <hi rend="italic">demum</hi> is precisely similar, and common in most Latin writers. Sallust, Cat.

						<p>Similarly in a negative sentence, <foreign lang="greek">ou)/pw</foreign> sometimes introduces the notion of time in estimating the amount or degree, Eth. Nic.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)na/gkh di) au)tw=n h(tta=sqai</lemma>] The argument of this clause, <foreign lang="greek">xrh/simos de/&mdash; e)pitimh/sews</foreign>, is summed up in two lines of Euripides, Alex. Fragm. 55 (12) Dind. <foreign lang="greek">a)glwssi/a| de\ polla/kis lhfqei\s a)nh\r</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">di/kaia le/cas h(=sson eu)glw/ssou fe/rei</foreign>. It is to the effect, that truth and right having a natural superiority over falsehood and wrong, the proper use of Rhetoric is to enable them to assert and enforce that superiority; to bring truth to light, and detect and expose deceit and sophistry. If the opposites of truth and right <hi rend="italic">do</hi> ever prevail over these, it must be the fault of the parties concerned themselves, <foreign lang="greek">a)na/gkh di) au)tw=n h(tta=sqai</foreign>, who have failed to avail themselves <pb n="23"/> of this powerful instrument. Rhetoric is therefore &lsquo;corrective&rsquo; or &lsquo;remedial&rsquo; of the perversion of truth and right to which legal decisions are always more or less liable from misrepresentation of facts, fallacious arguments, or the blinding of the judgment by appeals to the feelings. </p>
						<p>According to this translation of <foreign lang="greek">di) au)tw=n</foreign>, it is correctly and logically said that it is <hi rend="italic">a consequence</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>) of the natural superiority of truth and right to their opposites, that if those who have truth and right on their side are defeated, their defeat must be due to themselves, to their own neglect of Rhetoric, which would have enabled them to <hi rend="italic">enforce</hi> this their <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> superiority. Whereas if we follow Victorius (and Spengel who assents to his view, <hi rend="italic">Arist. Ars Rhet.</hi> Vol. II p. 26) in explaining <foreign lang="greek">di) au)tw=n</foreign> by <foreign lang="greek">di) e)nanti/wn, w(/ste</foreign> becomes incorrect or meaningless: for there is neither truth nor sense in saying that it <hi rend="italic">follows from</hi> the natural superiority of truth and justice that these, in the case of a wrong judgment, are defeated by their opposites; and not only so, but with this interpretation <foreign lang="greek">a)na/gkh</foreign> is also wrong&mdash;the consequence, if there be one, is certainly not necessary&mdash;and <foreign lang="greek">di) au)tw=n</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">u(p'  au)tw=n</foreign>. </p>

I 19, 87, where only the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> are directly mentioned, but the other, which is absolutely indispensable, must of course be assumed as a third division: by Cicero himself, de Orat. II 27, 115, <hi rend="italic">ita omnis ratio dicendi tribus ad persuadendum rebus est nixa; ut probemus vera esse quae defendimus; ut conciliemus nobis eos qui audiunt; ut animos eorum ad quemcunque causa postulabit motum vocemus.</hi> This is repeated in &sect;&sect; 121 and 128 and the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> described at length in c. 43 and the following. These two latter are again referred to Orat. XXXVII 128; and again in Partitiones Oratoriae XIII 46 the three <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign> are thus ingeniously distinguished in a twofold division. <hi rend="italic">Argumentandi duo</hi> <pb n="29"/> <hi rend="italic">sunt genera, quorum alterum ad fidem directe spectat, alterum se inflectit ad motum.</hi> (These are the &lsquo;direct&rsquo; and &lsquo;indirect&rsquo; proofs and arguments.) <hi rend="italic">Dirigitur cum proposuit aliquid quod probaret, sumpsitque ea quibus niteretur; atque his confirmatis ad propositum se retulit atque conclusit. Illa autem altera argumentatio, quasi retro et contra, prius sumit quae vult eaque confirmat, deinde id quod proponendum fuit permotis animis iacit ad extremum.</hi> </p>
						<p>Quintilian touches on this subject in many places of his work; the most detailed account of <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> is given in the second chapter of his sixth book: the description and distinction of them occur in &sect;&sect; 18, 19. They are both referred, as subordinate species, to the general head of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">affectus</hi>&rsquo;, &sect; 8, comp. &sect; 12; and these are again distinguished from the direct and logical arguments, &sect; 3. In this and the following section he compares these two classes of arguments together in respect of their rhetorical value and importance, and comes to a conclusion precisely opposite to that of Aristotle. For Aristotle holds that these indirect proofs, though necessary to the orator by reason of the deficiencies and infirmities of his audience, <foreign lang="greek">dia\ th\n tou= a)kroatou= moxqhri/an</foreign>, III 1 &sect; 5, and therefore not to be excluded from the theory or practice of Rhetoric, yet are to be regarded as merely auxiliary and subordinate, standing in the same relation to the direct proofs as dress and personal ornaments to the body, serviceable but not essential. Quintilian on the contrary pronounces that these in comparison with the overpowering force of the appeals to the feelings are only not contemptible in respect of their power of persuasion; <hi rend="italic">quos equidem non contemno, sed hactenus utiles credo ne quid per eos iudici sit ignotum; atque ut dicam quod sentio, dignos a quibus causas diserti docerentur</hi> &sect; 3: that those that use them therefore are only fit to lay before the judges the facts of the case, not to influence their decision, and to instruct the real advocate, who can sway their minds and feelings at his will, and force them to decide in favour of his client: <hi rend="italic">ubi vero animis iudicum vis afferenda est, et ab ipsa veri contemplatione abducenda mens, ibi proprium oratoris opus est</hi> &sect; 5. </p>
						<p>It may be observed in concluding this note, that there is a somewhat important difference, which I have already pointed out in the Introduction, between Aristotle's view of the use to be made of <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> in the practice of Rhetoric, and that of the Latin Rhetoricians, as well as the author of the Rhet. ad Alex.; see c. 39 (38) 2. Quintilian's <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi>&mdash;and compare Cicero in de Oratore, II 43&mdash;expresses the influence of character upon opinion, in general: but in Aristotle's system the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> means something more; the effect must be produced immediately <hi rend="italic">by the speech</hi> <foreign lang="greek">dei= de\ kai\ touto sumbai/nein dia\ to\n lo/gon, a)lla\ mh\ dia\ to\ prodedo/casqai poi=o/n tina ei)=nai to\n le/gonta</foreign>, Rhet.

The primary sense of <foreign lang="greek">e)pieikh/s</foreign> is therefore &lsquo;equitable&rsquo;, one who has a leaning to the merciful side and of an indulgent disposition, as opposed to one who takes a strict and rigorous view of an offence, puts a harsh construction on men's motives and actions, is inclined to enforce on all occasions the letter of the law. From this, and because we think this the <hi rend="italic">better</hi> disposition of the two, <foreign lang="greek">e)pieikh/s</foreign> is &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; by metaphor (i.e. the <foreign lang="greek">metafora\ a)po\ tou= ei)/dous e)pi\ to\ ge/nos</foreign>, the second of the four species of metaphors, Poet. XXI 7) to the general (or generic) signification of &lsquo;good&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a(plw=s</lemma>] has various usages. It may for instance mean (I) &lsquo;simply&rsquo;, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">sunqe/sei</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">kata\ sumplokh/n</foreign>: and this appears to be the primary sense of the word, in accordance with the derivation. Thus as the elements of nature are often called <foreign lang="greek">a(pla= sw/mata</foreign> in their simple, uncombined state, so we have <foreign lang="greek">a(plw=s</foreign>, de Anima II 14, 8, to denote &lsquo;singly, or simply, by itself&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">kaq'  e(auth/n</foreign> Themistius), without the admixture of any other element; <foreign lang="greek">dokei= de/ tisin h( tou= puro\s fu/sis a(plw=s ai)ti/a th=s trofh=s kai\ th=s au)ch/sews ei)=nai</foreign>. Similarly when applied in a moral sense to human character, it denotes &lsquo;simplicity&rsquo; (of composition), &lsquo;singleness&rsquo; of heart and purpose, as opposed to &lsquo;duplicity&rsquo;, (Plat. Rep. III 397 E, <foreign lang="greek">ou) diplou=s a)nh\r ou)de\ pollaplou=s</foreign>. VIII 55, 4 D, Rhet. I 9, 29, Eur. Rhes. 395 <foreign lang="greek">filw= le/gein ta)lhqe\s a)ei\ kou) diplou=s pe/fuk'  a)nh/r</foreign>. Ruhnk. Tim. p. 86). </p>
						<p>The commonest signification however is that of (2) <hi rend="italic">simpliciter et sine exceptione</hi> &lsquo;generally&rsquo; or &lsquo;universally&rsquo;, as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">kaq'  e(/kaston</foreign>, &lsquo;specially&rsquo;, &lsquo;particularly&rsquo;, &lsquo;individually&rsquo;, Eth. N.

See also Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Comm. on Organ.</hi> Vol. I p. 354, who exemplifies it from Aristotle. </p>
						<p>From this again may be distinguished a third sense (3), in which it is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">kaq'  au(to/n</foreign>, and opposed to <foreign lang="greek">pro/s ti</foreign>, &lsquo;the relative&rsquo;. In this sense it is defined, Top. B 11, 115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 33, <foreign lang="greek">o(\ a)\n mhdeno\s prostiqeme/nou dokh=| ei)=nai kalo\n h)\ ai)sxro\n h)\ a)/llo ti tw=n toiou/twn, a(plw=s r(hqh/setai</foreign>. de Soph. El. c. 5, 166 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 22 and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 37, where <foreign lang="greek">to\ a(plw=s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mh\ a(plw=s</foreign> are opposed as the absolute and relative in a paralogism of the substitution of the one for the other.

						<p>From these three may perhaps be distinguished a fourth sense (4) in which it occurs; for instance, in Met. A 6, 987 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, <foreign lang="greek">oi( *puqago/reioi... li/an a(plw=s e)pragmateuqhsan</foreign> &ldquo;treated the subject too simply&rdquo;, i. e. too carelessly, without taking sufficient pains with it, with insufficient <hi rend="italic">elaboration;</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">negligenter</hi>&rsquo;, Bonitz ad loc. q. v. On the various modes in which <foreign lang="greek">a(plw=s</foreign> is opposed to the relative and particular see Schrader on I 9, 17. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kuriwta/thn e)/xei pi/stin to\ h)=qos</lemma>] &lsquo;is the most authoritative, effective, instrument of persuasion&rsquo;. On the influence of character on the judgment add to the passages already quoted, Rhet. ad Alex. c. 38 (39), 2, and Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/dosis</foreign> &sect;&sect; 276&mdash;280. </p>
						<p>The oratorical artifice here described is well illustrated by Marc Antony's speech in <hi rend="italic">Fulius Caesar</hi>, Act III Sc. 2, &ldquo;I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts,&rdquo; &amp;c. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ku/rios</lemma> in this and similar cases seems to derive its meaning from the &lsquo;authority&rsquo; or &lsquo;influence&rsquo; exercised by any one or any thing that has the power of doing so, of which general notion it is a special application. It corresponds to our &lsquo;sovereign&rsquo;, as when we speak of a sovereign remedy. Trendelenburg, on de Anima II 5, 7, <hi rend="italic">Comm.</hi> p. 368, would connect this signification with the <foreign lang="greek">ku/rios no/mos</foreign>, &lsquo;ratio e iudiciis et foro tracta videtur. <foreign lang="greek">ku/rios no/mos</foreign>, qui <foreign lang="greek">a)ku/rw|</foreign> oppositus est, lex est quae rata viget &amp;c.&mdash;ita hic <foreign lang="greek">ku/ria o)no/mata</foreign>, quatenus eorum auctoritas valet.&rsquo; This is perhaps unnecessarily narrowing the signification. Other persons and things, besides laws, exercise authority. A good instance of <foreign lang="greek">ku/rios</foreign> in this general sense, implying superiority, authority, mastery, occurs in de Anima II 8, 3, 419 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 19, <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)/sti de\ yo/fou ku/rios o( a)h\r ou)de\ to\ u(/dwr</foreign>, where <foreign lang="greek">ku/rios</foreign> may be interpreted &lsquo;absolute master&rsquo;, the air and water are not <hi rend="italic">absolute masters</hi> of sound: some other conditions are required to produce it.

						<p>By these <foreign lang="greek">lo/goi</foreign> we may understand either the actual words which are the instruments or <hi rend="italic">medium</hi> of the reasonings, or better the reasonings or arguments themselves which the words convey. This explanation appears to be sufficiently rational and consistent, and in accordance with the ordinary usages of the language. Spengel, however, in his paper <hi rend="italic">&uuml;ber die Rhet. des Arist.</hi> (Trans. Bav. Acad. 1851) p. 26, and again in his edition of the Rhetoric, Vol. II p. 46, thinks that the text requires alteration, and would read <foreign lang="greek">di) au)tou= de\ tou= lo/gou</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">dia\ d'  au)tou= tou= lo/gou</foreign>, which seems to be totally unnecessary. The explanation above given is confirmed by the rendering of the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Translatio</hi> &lsquo;per orationes autem credimus&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">orationes</hi>&rsquo; plainly stands for the &lsquo;words of the speeches in which these arguments are expressed&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">parafue/s</lemma>] which usually appears under the form <foreign lang="greek">parafua/s</foreign> in Aristotle and Theophrastus, properly denotes either a branch or a separate plant &lsquo;growing alongside&rsquo; of the parent plant, and proceeding either from the stem or the root, as a scion or offshoot.

It is not merely perfectly intelligible, and absolutely unexceptionable on all critical grounds, but when compared with the commencement of the Anal. Post., to which reference is immediately after made, it seems to tally so precisely with what is there stated, that it might almost be regarded as a necessary addition. In the passage of the Analytics we are told that every kind of instruction and learning, proof scientific and popular, mathematical or dialectical knowledge, is conveyed by way of syllogism or induction: and it is then added, <foreign lang="greek">w(s d'  au(/tws kai\ oi( r(htorikoi\ sumpei/qousin: h)\ ga\r dia\ paradeigma/twn, o(/ e)stin e)pagwgh/, h)\ di) e)nqumhma/twn, o(/per e)sti\ sullogismo/s</foreign>, a statement with which the <foreign lang="greek">h)\ o(ntinou=n</foreign> of the Rhetoric seems to correspond to a nicety.

The work is mentioned twice by Dionysius, Ep. ad Amm. I cc. 6 and 8, each time in company with Analytics and Topics. From this circumstance and from the reference here, it is natural to conclude that its subject was connected in some way with Logic. Diogenes Laert.

						<p>There is no real contradiction between what is here said and in Probl. XVIII 3. In the Problem the question is <hi rend="italic">why</hi> people in general are better pleased with examples than with enthymemes, the fact being assumed. The answer is, that they learn more from them, and are therefore more amused, and the facts which are adduced by way of examples are more familiar and interesting; the enthymeme (as the syllogism in the Topics) proceeds from universals, which we are less acquainted with than with particulars. Consequently, examples are more pleasing and therefore plausible (<foreign lang="greek">piqana/</foreign>), whilst the conclusive <pb n="39"/> argument, the enthymeme which leaves the adversary without reply, is more striking, and therefore more applauded. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qorubei=sqai</lemma>, &lsquo;to be applauded&rsquo;, is a regular formation of the passive.

Buttmann also in his <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 119 and p. 294 (Engl. Transl.) assumes a distinction between some varieties of them, which is not very clearly made out. They fall under three heads, first desideratives, second imitatives (as <pb n="46"/> <foreign lang="greek">turannia=|n</foreign>, to play the tyrant); &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;it is improper to rank verbs denoting <hi rend="italic">diseases</hi> (the third), <foreign lang="greek">o)fqalmia=|n, u(deria=|n, ywra=|n</foreign>, &amp;c., in the same class (as the imitatives);&rdquo; these belong rather to a preceding division, viz. verbs in <foreign lang="greek">aw</foreign> formed from nouns, &ldquo;and expressing, chiefly, the having a thing or quality, and performing an action; as <foreign lang="greek">koma=|n, xola=|n, boa=|n, goa=|n, tolma=|n</foreign>.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>A much better and more exact account of these forms of verbs, in respect of the connexion and distinction of their senses, is to be found in Lobeck's learned note on Phrynichus, p. 79&mdash;83. &ldquo;Verbs in <foreign lang="greek">a=|n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ia=|n</foreign>,&rdquo; (this is not true of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> these verbs and requires qualification; <foreign lang="greek">dama=|n, geitnia=|n, pera=|n</foreign>, for instance, can hardly be said to denote either a bodily, or mental affection.

A long list of examples is there given, chiefly of rarer words.

Quintilian in this fourth chapter mentions, besides Aristotle's division, those which were adopted by Anaximenes, Protagoras, Plato (in the Sophist), and Isocrates.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qewro\n h)\ krith/n</lemma>] This classification of the different kinds of &lsquo;audience&rsquo; is made for the purpose of determining the divisions of Rhetoric; because, the audience being the end and object of the speech, that to which every speech is ultimately referred, and everything being defined or determined by its end (<foreign lang="greek">te/los</foreign>, Eth. Nic. III 10, 1115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 23), the number of the varieties of audiences must fix the number of the divisions or branches of Rhetoric. Audiences are of two kinds; either mere &lsquo;spectators&rsquo;, like the <foreign lang="greek">qeatai/</foreign> in a theatre, at the games, or in any exhibition where amusement is the object, or at all events where there is no interest of a <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> character or tendency<note anchored="yes">Thuc.

						<p>So that we have three kinds of audiences, and consequently three branches of Rhetoric. The public or national assembly, to which the <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi> kind of rhetoric is addressed; the law-courts and their &lsquo;judges&rsquo;, properly so called, the object of the <hi rend="italic">forensic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> branch of the art; and thirdly the &lsquo;spectators&rsquo;, those who go to be amused or interested by the show-speeches, or <foreign lang="greek">e)pidei/ceis</foreign>, the Panegyrics (in two senses), funeral orations, burlesques, or whatever other form may be taken by speeches composed merely to display skill in composition without practical interest (where the <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, the faculty, or skill shewn, is only in question); or, if they please, to criticise them, and so become &lsquo;critics&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The term <foreign lang="greek">krith/s</foreign>, &lsquo;judge&rsquo;, which belongs properly only to the second of the three branches, may also be extended to the other two, since they all have to &lsquo;decide&rsquo; in some sense, to choose between opposite views, either on questions of expediency in matters of state, or right and wrong in legal questions, or the merits of a composition as &lsquo;critics&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dia\ to\ mh/te...pollw=| de/</lemma>...] Wolf and MS A^{c} have <foreign lang="greek">pollw=| te</foreign>, which is of course the more regular and strictly grammatical usage. On the general question of the meaning and distinctions of <foreign lang="greek">kai/, de/</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign>, with and without the negative, see Hermann's excellent dissertation in his Review of Elmsley's Medea, on lines 4, 5. Porson, Elmsley, and their English followers were in the habit of laying down rigorous and inflexible rules of Greek grammar, which were supposed to admit of no exception; any apparent violation of them was to be summarily emended: one of the great services rendered by Hermann to the study of the Greek language is the relaxation of these over exact rules, and the substitution of a rational and logical explanation of these differences of expression, and the analysis of their distinctions, for these often unwarranted alterations of the text. &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">*kai\</foreign> particula est coniunctiva&rsquo;, says Hermann; &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">te</foreign> adiunctiva; <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> disiunctiva&rsquo;. In the case of <foreign lang="greek">ou)de/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mhde/, ou)/te</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mh/te</foreign>, when several things are subordinated to, and included under, one negative conception, the one or the other (<foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign>) is used according as the writer had or had not any notion of a <hi rend="italic">difference</hi> between them. If the things under the general negative conception are represented <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> as subordinate and with no expression of difference of opposition between them, the <hi rend="italic">adnexive</hi> <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign> is employed, and the formula is <foreign lang="greek">ou)...te...te</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ou)...ou)/te...ou)/te</foreign>, and similarly with <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>: on the other hand, if some difference between any of the subordinate members of the division is to be marked, <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign> must be replaced by <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>, and the formula will be <foreign lang="greek">ou)...ou)de/</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ou)de/...ou)de/</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ou)... ou)/te...ou)/te...ou)de/</foreign>, and so on for other similar cases. And the change of <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> in the second clause of the sentence before us, represents the sudden occurrence to the writer's mind of the thought that there is an important difference between the two things that are assigned as reasons for not introducing a regular scientific division into the treatment of Rhetoric (viz. its necessarily unscientific character, and the fact that its <pb n="60"/> province has already been unduly extended by previous professors), which requires to be marked, and accordingly is marked by the change of the particle. This, however, is not the only irregularity in Aristotle's sentence; for, evidently intending at the commencement to include both the subordinate members under the original negative, he introduces in the second clause a positive conception; contributing perhaps to enforce the distinction of the two, but in violation of grammatical accuracy. </p>

Tacit., Proleg. <hi rend="italic">de Stili Taciti brevitate</hi>, p. LXXVIII sq., <foreign lang="greek">su/llhyis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">zeu=gma</foreign> proper. The figure in general is thus described, &lsquo;qua aut genere aut personis aut alio quo modo diversa uno eodemque constructionis genere <hi rend="italic">comprehenduntur</hi>&rsquo;<hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as I have failed to enter into the distinction which B&ouml;tticher makes between the two varieties I will substitute my own explanation of the difference. In <foreign lang="greek">su/llhyis</foreign> the two terms are united in one construction with a third, to which one is referred <hi rend="italic">literally</hi>, the other <hi rend="italic">metaphorically</hi>, or at all events in different senses. This appears in the instances given, as <hi rend="italic">dissimulationem nox et lascivia exemerat: nocte ac laetitia incaluisse: praeda famaque onusti: mixti copiis et laetitia.</hi> To these I will venture to add from a modern English writer the case of Miss Bolo in <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi>, who after her defeat at whist in the Bath Assembly Rooms retires &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">in</hi> a flood of tears <hi rend="italic">and</hi> a sedan chair&rsquo;; to which Eur. Hel. 182, <foreign lang="greek">au)gai=sin e)n tai=s xruse/ais e)/n te do/nakos e)/rnesin</foreign>, is an exact parallel. In <foreign lang="greek">zeu=gma</foreign> proper, this third term will not apply in <hi rend="italic">any sense</hi> to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of the others, and some other word or phrase must necessarily be <hi rend="italic">supplied</hi> to complete the sense; as in the passage of Herodotus quoted above, and in the text of Aristotle. Add to the examples collected from Tacitus by B&ouml;tticher, Hor. Od. III 4. 11, <hi rend="italic">ludo fatigatumque somno.</hi> Liv. XXVII 46 sub fin. <hi rend="italic">fessi somno ac vigiliis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">fessi vigiliis ac propterea somno graves</hi>). Hom. Il.

It seems to represent something quite different from the other; but what? The <foreign lang="greek">zeu=gma</foreign> in fact is a kind of grammatical bracket, under which two heterogeneous expressions are improperly included. Another well-known example of this <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> is the truly Irish epitaph on Boyle the Philosopher: &lsquo;He was the father of Chemistry, and grand-uncle of the Earl of Cork.&rsquo;</note> (a mere carelessness of expression dignified by <pb n="62"/> that name), &lsquo;a figure of speech&rsquo;, as it is briefly expressed in Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, &lsquo;wherein two subjects <hi rend="italic">are used jointly</hi> with the same predicate, which strictly belongs only to one, as in Il. A 533, where <foreign lang="greek">e)/bh</foreign> must be supplied with <foreign lang="greek">*zeu/s</foreign>.&rsquo; So Herod. I 90, <foreign lang="greek">xrhsta\ e)/rga kai\ e)/pea poie/ein</foreign>, where of course <foreign lang="greek">le/gein</foreign> is required with <foreign lang="greek">e)/pea</foreign>. Under this head comes the case before us, where to complete the intended sense we must supply <foreign lang="greek">a)lla\ mh\ mo/non</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">tw=| metabai/nein</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">tw=| e)piskeua/zein e)pisth/mas</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">lo/gwn</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)piskeua/zein</lemma>, &lsquo;to re-construct or re-constitute&rsquo;, is opposed to <foreign lang="greek">kataskeua/zein</foreign>. The latter is &lsquo;to <hi rend="italic">lay down</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">kata/</foreign>), settle or establish a system&rsquo;; the former, &lsquo;to construct anew or afresh, to renew&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/</foreign>, from the primary sense of direction to, <hi rend="italic">in place</hi>, passes into a secondary one of direction or succession <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>, &lsquo;after&rsquo;; hence, thirdly, it takes the meaning of repetition, as anew, afresh, re- (in comp.), and of development in the way of growth, as in <foreign lang="greek">e)pidido/nai</foreign> &lsquo;to augment or grow&rsquo;. Hence <foreign lang="greek">e)piskeua/zein</foreign> is properly to &lsquo;refit&rsquo;, &lsquo;renew&rsquo;, &lsquo;repair&rsquo;, &lsquo;restore&rsquo;, as walls, ships, bridges, roads (Thucyd., Xenoph., Demosth., see the Lexx.), and thence transferred to &lsquo;reconstruction&rsquo; of a science or study. A similar sense of <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/</foreign> appears in the verbs, <foreign lang="greek">e)peipei=n</foreign> &lsquo;to say <hi rend="italic">after</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">add</hi> the words&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">e)pagei/rein</foreign> &lsquo;to collect after or in addition&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">e)pimanqa/nein, e)pakolouqei=n, e)panqei=n, e)pibiou=n</foreign> (to live after, outlive), <foreign lang="greek">e)panaqea=sqai</foreign> (Xen.

						<p>When Herodotus at the opening of his work uses the term <foreign lang="greek">i(stori/h</foreign>, he means no more than the &lsquo;inquiries&rsquo; or &lsquo;researches&rsquo; which he is now collecting into a continuous narrative. (Comp. &sect; 13, <foreign lang="greek">ai( peri\ ta\s pra/ceis istori/ai</foreign> and the note there.) It is not till we come to Polybius that the word assumes its modern signification, a scientific history, a systematic work that can be employed in education, Hist. I 1, 2. It is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> defined, and distinguished from other departments of study by the addition of <foreign lang="greek">pragmatikh/</foreign>, I 2, 8, the study of human actions and affairs.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(pa/rcai, a)rkei=n</lemma>, <hi rend="italic">Anonymus</hi>, ap. Brandis, u. s., p. 44. </p>
						<p>The verbs <foreign lang="greek">u(pa/rxein, ei)=nai, gi/gnesqai</foreign>, stand to one another in the relation of past, present, and future; to be already in existence, to be (simple and absolute being, independent of time), and to become, to come into being from a state (if that be possible) of non-being. The <hi rend="italic">aorist</hi> infin, gives <foreign lang="greek">u(pa/rcai</foreign> here a future sense, &lsquo;to become or to be made&rsquo;, which does not naturally, <hi rend="italic">ex vi verbi</hi>, belong to it. Hermann, in one of those notes which have thrown so much light upon the niceties of Greek grammar (on Ajax 1061 subsequently referred to without further discussion in the treatise <hi rend="italic">de Part.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> IV, 2, <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi>, Vol. IV), contends against Elmsley (who had condemned as a solecism this use of the aorist infin. without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, after verbs such as <foreign lang="greek">dokei=n, nomi/zein, oi)/esqai, fa/nai, e)lpi/zein, prosdoka=n</foreign>, in reference to future time) in support of the usage; and distinguishes three modes of expression in which futurity is conveyed by the infinitive: first, the simple future inf. as <foreign lang="greek">dokei=n pesei=sqai</foreign>, which conveys directly the simple and absolute notion of futurity, without modification or qualification; second, the infin., aorist or present, with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n, pi/ptein a)/n, pesei=n a)/n</foreign>, which indicates a merely conditional futurity, might or would fall, under certain circumstances or conditions; and thirdly, the present or aorist infin. without <foreign lang="greek">a)/n, pi/ptein</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">pesei=n</foreign>, which, corresponding to the indefinite (in point of time) present and aorist, <foreign lang="greek">pi/ptei</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)/pese</foreign>, denote simply the possibility or likelihood of the object falling at some uncertain future time; <hi rend="italic">caducum esse.</hi> The distinction between the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aorist</hi> infinitive is this: &lsquo;Praesentis autem et aoristi infinitivis, sive accedat <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> sive non, ita utuntur, ut aoristus rei transeunti, praesens duranti adhibeatur.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Without disputing the truth of this, it is yet possible to explain the difference otherwise. <hi rend="italic">Permanence</hi> (&lsquo;duranti&rsquo;) does not seem to me to be in any way connected with the conception of present time, though the perfect often is; as when we say &lsquo;this <hi rend="italic">has been</hi>&rsquo; up to the present time, we often imply our belief in its continuance; and I should rather explain the present infin. in these cases as expressing the mere fact of the existence of the thing named, or the abstract notion of it. The present tense, as it is called, I act, I do, to act, to do, is in reality independent of time: the time present is, I am acting, I am doing; and the present infin. &lsquo;to do&rsquo; is the naked conception of &lsquo;doing&rsquo; without any connotation of time (so the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> infinit. with the definite article stands for a <hi rend="italic">substantive;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)=nai</foreign> is the mere notion of being). The aorist infin. again may derive its notion of futurity and likelihood, either, as Hermann thinks, from the indefiniteness expressed by the tense, or, in other cases, from the connotation of <hi rend="italic">habit</hi>, implying <hi rend="italic">liability</hi>, which is also one of its acquired senses. The broad distinction will be, <foreign lang="greek">dokw= pesei=sqai</foreign>, &lsquo;I think it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> fall&rsquo;, at some future time, and nothing more: <foreign lang="greek">dokw= pi/ptein</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">pesei=n a)/n</foreign>, &lsquo;I think it <hi rend="italic">could, would</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">might</hi> fall&rsquo;, under certain conditions; <foreign lang="greek">dokw= pi/ptein</foreign>, &lsquo;I think the notion of falling belongs to it&rsquo;, &lsquo;I think it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> fall&rsquo;; that is, that it is <hi rend="italic">liable</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">likely</hi>, to fall, <hi rend="italic">caducum esse</hi>: and <foreign lang="greek">dokw= pesei=n</foreign>, implying also the liability or likelihood of the preceding, is distinguished from it (according to Hermann) by <pb n="66"/> representing the act or event as transient and not permanent. But such a distinction as this last, though it be intelligible, is at least untranslatable; as in such a case as <foreign lang="greek">noei=s dra=sai</foreign> (Soph. Phil. 918), &lsquo;what dost thou intend to do&rsquo;, where the expression of the liability must needs be omitted, and still more the transient nature of the proposed act. But we can hardly suppose that any distinction can be seriously intended when Sophocles writes <foreign lang="greek">noei=s dra=sai</foreign>: and then, three lines afterwards, v. 921, <foreign lang="greek">dra=|n noei=s</foreign>. The choice between the two seems to be dictated rather by convenience than by any other motive. </p>
						<p>With regard to the distinction of the present and aorist infin., it may be observed, that we are often obliged, as the practice of translation shews, to disregard whatever difference there may be conceived to be between them, as either inappreciable or at all events inexpressible, and to render them by the same English words. Take, for example, the ordinary phrase <foreign lang="greek">dei= labei=n</foreign> (it occurs, for instance, II 8, 12). It is quite certain that in this case past time is not directly signified; though it may possibly be included as an accessory in the notion of it in the way of an addition to the abstract conception of &lsquo;taking up, acquiring&rsquo;&mdash;as representing the <hi rend="italic">previous formation</hi> of the opinion, which has been <hi rend="italic">taken up</hi> before. But at all events no one would think of <hi rend="italic">translating</hi> <foreign lang="greek">dei= labei=n</foreign> in any other form than that of the simple verb &lsquo;to assume or suppose&rsquo;. </p>

And not only is the substance of the next sentence, <foreign lang="greek">le/gw de\ to\ u(po\ oi)kei/wn fqei/resqai k.t.l.</foreign>, found in the discussions of the Politics VIII (V) 1, but the very same metaphor, from the tightening and relaxation of the strings of the lyre, is employed there, 1301 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17, as here; and in c. 9, 1309 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 18, the same illustration, derived from the flat and aquiline nose, is used to represent the excessive exaggeration and intensification, or depression and relaxation of the constitution, as of the feature, which altogether effaces its true character. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nie/menai kai\ e)piteino/menai</lemma>] This metaphor from the screwing up or relaxation of the strings of the lyre, producing a difference of musical pitch or tone, which it raises or lowers, is a very favourite one both with Plato and Aristotle, and is used to represent, as I have already said, exaggeration or intensification on the one hand, (exactly as we speak of &lsquo;screwing up our courage&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> I 7, 60), and depression or relaxation on the other. If for example the nose is lowered or depressed to excess in the way of flatness as a snub-nose, or exaggerated in the other direction to excessive sharpness and prominence as an aquiline nose, it ends by losing the character of a nose altogether, and is either altogether effaced or becomes a beak: and so with the constitutions of states. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ u(po\ oi)kei/wn fqei/resqai</lemma> therefore means that forms of government are destroyed or change their character by the exaggeration or relaxation of their own proper and peculiar institutions, and it is in the &lsquo;mean&rsquo; state alone between these two excesses that the constitution can be said to maintain its true character. For instance the <foreign lang="greek">o(/ros</foreign>, definition or principle, of a democracy is equality; if this be intensified or exaggerated, or carried to excess, if the thing be logically carried out, and everybody actually becomes equal, the government degenerates into mob-rule or anarchy and thus loses its true democratic character; if it be relaxed and the equality diminished, the democratic principle and its institutions become <pb n="70"/> so enfeebled, that the inequalities increase until at last it becomes an oligarchy, <foreign lang="greek">a)nieme/nh a)sqeneste/ra gi/netai w(/ste te/los h(/cei ei)s o)ligarxi/an</foreign>. </p>

						<p>Aristotle's own definition of happiness in the Eth. Nic., the result of his inquiries in that work, is something far different, <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia yuxh=s kat'  a)reth/n</foreign>, the fully developed activity or active exercise (implying full consciousness) of the soul in respect of its proper (and therefore highest) excellence: that is contemplation, <foreign lang="greek">qewri/a</foreign>, the exercise of the highest faculty, the <foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign>, or intuitive reason; the highest faculties being the <hi rend="italic">intellectual.</hi> This is the theory; but practically a lower view of happiness is admitted (Bk. X), which consists in the exercise of the moral as well as the intellectual virtues. Of the definitions here given, <foreign lang="greek">au)ta/rkeia zwh=s</foreign> comes nearest to his own: it expresses a self-sufficing life, complete in itself, independent of all external aids and advantages, and is in fact essential to the notion of happiness. See Eth. Nic. I 5 (quoted below). </p>
						<p>The essentials of the three first of these definitions are found all united in the conception of happiness, the ultimate end of all human desire and effort, which forms the conclusion of the tenth book of the Nicomachean Ethics, from the sixth chapter to the end. It contains first, the <foreign lang="greek">eu)praci/a met'  a)reth=s</foreign>, in the exercise of moral and intellectual virtue, the intellectual being the higher and more perfect form of it, and in that the intuitive contemplative energy; secondly, the <foreign lang="greek">au)ta/rkeia th=s zwh=s</foreign>, the self-sufficiency and independence of everything external, which is necessary to perfection and happiness; and thirdly, the life <foreign lang="greek">met'  a)sfalei/as</foreign>, the happiness residing in <foreign lang="greek">qewri/a</foreign> being most secure because it is most independent and the nearest approach to the happiness of the Gods, who have all their wants and faculties satisfied in themselves, and want nothing &lt;*&gt;m without (c. 7); and also  <foreign lang="greek">h(/distos</foreign>, because pleasure is the necessary accompaniment of <pb n="74"/> every <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign> (active exercise, <hi rend="italic">realisation</hi> in exercise, of any <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign> or capacity), and <foreign lang="greek">qewri/a</foreign> being the most perfect form of <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, the pleasure that accompanies it must needs be the highest and most complete; and the exercise of the moral faculties in proportion to their comparative excellence. <foreign lang="greek">kai\ tw=| a)nqrw/pw| dh\ o( kata\ to\n nou=n bi/os</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">h(/distos kai\ kra/tistos</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ei)/per tou=to ma/lista a)/nqrwpos. ou(=tos a)/ra kai\ eu)daimone/statos</foreign>.

Similarly in the present passage, they are distinguished from cattle and slaves as <hi rend="italic">inanimate</hi> moveable furniture, or &lsquo;plenishing&rsquo;. Herodotus writes the word <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/ploa</foreign> in I 94; elsewhere, as usual, <foreign lang="greek">e)/pipla</foreign>. The derivation appears to be, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ e)pipolh=s skeu/h, ta\ e)pipo/laia</foreign>, superficial&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tau=ta de\ pa/nta kai\ a)sfalh= kai\ e)leuqe/ria kai\ xrh/sima</lemma>] All the kinds of property just mentioned are &lsquo;secure&rsquo;, (in the sense, &lsquo;that the use of it is always in your own power&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>), not liable to risk, as money made and employed in trade or commerce; and &lsquo;liberal&rsquo;, such as befit a gentleman, a man of &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; education and pursuits, cultivated and accomplished and refined, <foreign lang="greek">o( pepaideume/nos</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">paidei/a, h(=| diagignw/skomen ta\ kala\ kai\ ta\ ai)sxra/</foreign>, Aesch. c.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)leuqe/rios</lemma>, as here applied, expresses the general notion of liberality, in character and habits of mind. In the Ethics, and most frequently in the ordinary language, it is restricted as a moral virtue to a <hi rend="italic">species</hi> of liberality, that namely which manifests itself <foreign lang="greek">peri\ do/sin xrhma/twn kai\ lh=yin</foreign>. Eth. Nic. II 7. The <foreign lang="greek">e)leuqe/rios</foreign> represents the gentleman <pb n="81"/> from the democratic point of view; he embodies the notion of &lsquo;freedom which is the <foreign lang="greek">o(/ros</foreign>, the principle, and the end and aim of the democratic commonwealth; he is the type of a free citizen, and therefore as expressive of <hi rend="italic">character</hi> the term denotes &lsquo;that which a model free citizen ought to be&rsquo;; and connotes or implies those qualifications, particularly education and enlightenment, which enable him efficiently to discharge the proper functions of a free citizen, and those social qualities and habits which fit him for such a society. This is opposed to the aristocratic conception of a gentleman which makes the character or notion depend rather upon birth, wealth and station; and according to which the <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqoi/, a)/ristoi, a)risth=es</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">boni, optimi, optimates</hi>, &amp;c., are the nobles, the men of rank, and of good family in a state. See further on this subject, Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi>, &sect;&sect; 321&mdash;328. </p>
						<p>Another characteristic of Greek feeling, which deserves notice, is brought into view in the application of the term <foreign lang="greek">e)leuqe/ria</foreign> to distinguish a particular kind of property; and this is, the contempt for trade and commerce as a profession and a means of acquiring wealth, which as B. St Hilaire observes (note on <hi rend="italic">Transl. of Ar. Pol.</hi> p. 36) was common to all antiquity. A similar observation is made by B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Publ.

In XI 4, 918 D, in the course of a discussion on the legitimate objects and uses of trade, he makes the remark, <foreign lang="greek">dio\ pa/nta ta\ peri\ th\n kaphlei/an kai\ e)mpori/an kai\ pandokei/an ge/nh</foreign> (in the actual practice of them) <foreign lang="greek">diabe/blhtai/ te kai\ e)n ai)sxroi=s ge/gonen o)nei/desin</foreign>, which results from their general tendency to corrupt the character of those who follow these pursuits, by the immoderate desire of gain which they stimulate and foster. Accordingly no citizen of the model state is allowed to follow any retail trade; this must be confined to metics and strangers, <foreign lang="greek">me/toikon ei)=nai xrew\n h)\ ce/non o(\s a)\n me/llh| kaphleu/sein</foreign>.

On Plato's general views on this subject, as expressed in the &lsquo;Laws&rsquo;, see Grote, Plato, III 431. </p>
						<p>Aristotle similarly condemns trade and the business and practice of interchanging commodities, so far as its object is mere money-making, <foreign lang="greek">xrhmatistikh/</foreign>. This is the accumulation of <hi rend="italic">unnatural</hi>, artificial property: the only kind of property or wealth that is natural, <foreign lang="greek">fu/sei</foreign>, is that which can be applied directly to one's own use, <foreign lang="greek">pro\s xrh=sin</foreign>, and ultimately <foreign lang="greek">pro\s to\ eu)= zh=|n</foreign>, and falls under the province of <foreign lang="greek">oi)konamikh/</foreign>, from which <foreign lang="greek">xrhmatistikh/</foreign> is excluded.

Hence of the two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">kthtikh/</foreign>, the one, which may be called <foreign lang="greek">oi)konomikh/</foreign>, because it forms part of the science of &oelig;conomics (domestic economy) properly understood, is neces<pb n="82"/> sary and laudable; the other, <foreign lang="greek">h( kaphlikh/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">metablhtikh/</foreign>, with its offspring usury, which <hi rend="italic">breeds</hi> money out of money, and is thence called <foreign lang="greek">to/kos</foreign>, &lsquo;is justly reprehended&rsquo; and usury &lsquo;most reasonably the object of abhorrence&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">th=s de\ metablhtikh=s yegome/nhs dikai/ws, ou) ga\r kata\ fu/sin a)ll'  a)p) a)llh/lwn e)sti/n, eu)logw/tata misei=tai h( o)bolostatikh\ dia\ to\ u(p) au)tou= tou= nomi/smatos ei)=nai th\n kth=sin kai\ ou)k e)f) o(/per e)pori/sqh. k.t.l.</foreign> I 10 sub fin. </p>
						<p>On the character and tendencies of <foreign lang="greek">e)/mporoi</foreign>, compare Xen. Oecon. XX 27, 28. In the same treatise, c.

See Oecon. c. VI 8, 9, 10, c. XV 9. </p>

At the same time in the somewhat obscure summing up at the conclusion of his note, he seems (as I understand him) to be in favour, as a general principle, of the hypothesis, that a difference of form in the termination of a verb radically the same (he cites <foreign lang="greek">i)/llw</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ei)/llw</foreign> and its numerous varieties as a remarkable instance) <hi rend="italic">does</hi> express a corresponding variety in the signification; as in the instance given, the various terminations correspond to different varieties of the general notion of &lsquo;rolling&rsquo;.</note>.

In this definition, friendship or love is described as a state of mind, a moral habit or disposition, not as a natural affection. The desire of doing our friend good for his own sake is a necessary accompaniment and consequence of the feeling or affection, but not identical with it. The definition is &lsquo;rhetorical&rsquo;, and does not give the &lsquo;essence&rsquo; of the thing, as a scientific definition would. The definition of <foreign lang="greek">fili/a</foreign> as a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, II 4, 2, is in exact conformity with this, and equally deficient. In the Ethics, VIII 2, after quoting some of the ordinary current notions of love to be found in the preceding poets and philosophers, he proceeds to the establishment of his own. And here again the same conception of it reappears in the words <foreign lang="greek">tw=| de\ fi/lw| fasi\ dei=n bou/lesqai ta)gaqa\ e)kei/nou e(/neka</foreign>.

For though we may be &lsquo;fond&rsquo; of wine, <foreign lang="greek">fi/loinos</foreign>, or &lsquo;fond&rsquo; of animals, there is in these cases no true reciprocity of affection. Further, since &lsquo;fondness&rsquo; is applicable to three classes of objects, the good, the pleasant, and the useful, three classes of corresponding &lsquo;friendships&rsquo; or &lsquo;fondnesses&rsquo; are hereby determined; but only the first of them, the love of the good, is the basis of true and perfect love; and consequently <pb n="94"/> the highest and perfect form of &lsquo;love&rsquo; can only exist between the good, <foreign lang="greek">telei/a d'  e)sti\n h( tw=n a)gaqw=n fili/a kai\ kat) a)reth\n o(moi/wn: ou(=toi ga\r ta)gaq), o(moi/ws bou/lontai a)llh/lois, h(=| a)gaqoi/: a)gaqoi\ d) ei)si\ kaq) au(tou/s</foreign>, c. 4, init.

						<p>First, &lsquo;Good is anything that is in itself and for its own sake desirable (an object of choice), and that for whose sake we choose something else (which is the ulterior end of our preference for anything); and that which is the universal aim, either of everything or&rsquo; (as a qualification to exclude inanimate things) &lsquo;everything that has sensation or reason, or (would be their aim) if they were to <hi rend="italic">acquire</hi> the reasoning faculty&rsquo; (supposing they have it not yet, as infants and beasts).

						<p>The first of these two definitions, which represents Good as desirable in and for itself, and as <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to obtain which we choose something else, is in fact identical with the second which describes it as the ultimate end or aim of all action and desire, only differing from it in terms. Every thing that we choose or desire, and every act that we perform, is as the means to one universal end, the Good. This view of the nature of Good is laid down and illustrated in the first chapter of the Nic.

						<p>The same view of the nature of Good is to be found equally in Plato, from whom Aristotle may have derived it.

The &lsquo;simultaneous&rsquo; kind of accompaniment appears also in this word sometimes even in the ordinary language, as when Plato writes, Menex. 249 D, <foreign lang="greek">a)kolou/qei met'  e)mou=</foreign>, Lach. 187 D, <foreign lang="greek">meta\ tou= patro\s a)kolouqw=n</foreign>: and similarly Demosthenes and the Orators; and Xenophon joins it with <foreign lang="greek">su/n</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ ta\ poihtika\ trixw=s</lemma>] This triple division of productive causes or conditions is thus explained by Majoragius. &lsquo;Point tres species rerum conficientium quae ita distingui possunt.

The ground of the distinction of the first of the three classes, of which the illustration is <foreign lang="greek">to\ u(giai/nein</foreign>, the healthy state of body, active, actual health, as produced by <foreign lang="greek">u(giei/a</foreign>, health in itself, we learn from two passages of the Nic.

Here <foreign lang="greek">u(gi/eia</foreign> itself represents the formal cause of health, which is internal and essential (<foreign lang="greek">me/ros, e)/xesqai</foreign>), and developes, quickens, and stimulates the bodily functions into healthy activity, gives health an active reality (<foreign lang="greek">e)nergei=</foreign>), and is therefore contrasted with the efficient, and <hi rend="italic">external</hi> cause, the physician, who, as the Paraphrast on the parallel passage, X 4, says, <foreign lang="greek">sunthrei= kai\ fula/ttei, kai\ o(/pws paramei/nh| zhtei=</foreign>.

The second and third divisions represent two kinds of extraneous causes or conditions, distinguished from this formal, intrinsic cause.

Ethics and Rhetoric are <foreign lang="greek">praktikai\ te/xnai</foreign>, the arts of the painter and statuary <foreign lang="greek">poihtikai/</foreign>. Compare Introd. pp. 16&mdash;19. By the distinction here taken we find brought into view the specially &lsquo;practical&rsquo; character of the virtues, which, like the art that describes them, end in action: though besides this, <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of the virtues, at any rate, produce lasting effect, and leave results beyond the mere performance of the act, some <hi rend="italic">positive benefit</hi> (as an <foreign lang="greek">e)/rgon</foreign>) to an individual or the community.

Of the two, <foreign lang="greek">poihtiko/s</foreign> is most frequently used in the expression of this conception, as may be seen in the following sections. </p>
						<p>All moral virtues must necessarily be each a form of good: for they produce a good moral habit, or condition, or constitution in those that possess them, and are besides productive (and effective) of good in their actions and the results of these. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Each of them, its substance or true nature&rsquo; (the first Category, <foreign lang="greek">ti/ e)sti/, ou)si/a</foreign>, substance what the thing is, really and essentially), &lsquo;and qualities&rsquo; (the third Category), &lsquo;must be treated separately, <foreign lang="greek">xwri/s</foreign>, apart&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ th\n h(donh\n a)gaqo\n ei)=nai</lemma>] What is here taken for granted, as universally admitted, that pleasure is good (though not necessarily <hi rend="italic">the</hi> good) is in both the treatises on pleasure, in the 6th and 10th books of the Nicomachean Ethics, carefully investigated and discussed, and the opinions held upon the question by preceding philosophers, as Eudoxus <pb n="102"/> and Plato, examined, Bk. VII, c. 12, seq. and X, c. 2. Aristotle's conclusion (in Bk. X) is that though pleasure may be regarded as good it is not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> good, i.e. the supreme good, good in itself, because there are <hi rend="italic">some</hi> pleasures which are not proper objects of choice and therefore not good. Eudemus (if the seventh book be his), seems rather to be inclined to the contrary view; it is said at any rate, c. 14, init., <foreign lang="greek">a)na/gkh ou)=n th\n h(donh\n a)gaqo/n ti ei)=nai</foreign>, and three lines further, <foreign lang="greek">a)/riston t'  ou)de\n kwlu/ei h(donh/n tina ei)=nai</foreign>.

This difference of view between the master and pupil (on the supposition that eudemus is the author of Bk. VII) is in fact in exact conformity with the difference of their respective definitions of pleasure; Aristotle defining it as the perfecting (<foreign lang="greek">telei/wsis</foreign>) of the <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, but not our <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign> itself, and therefore not &lsquo;the supreme good&rsquo;; whilst Eudemus goes further and describes it as an &lsquo;unimpeded energy&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">a)nempo/distos e)ne/rgeia</foreign>: and in fact this variation may be regarded as one of the principal arguments for the difference of authorship of the two treatises on pleasure in the Nic. Eth. The principle upon which the fact is here assumed in the Rhetoric, is stated in both treatises of the Ethics; the universal recognition, namely, of the principle that pleasure is desirable. See VII 14 init. and X 2, 1172 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 35, <foreign lang="greek">oi( d'  e)nista/menoi w(s ou)k a)gaqo\n ou(= pa/nt) e)fi/etai, mh\ ou)qe\n le/gwsin: o(\ ga\r pa=si dokei=, tou=t) ei)=nai fame/n</foreign>. </p>

But when we try to render &lsquo;to drop&rsquo; by a word <hi rend="italic">exactly corresponding</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign> in its primary sense), the language seems to fail us.

But these are not single words. And I am brought to the conclusion that the Greek language <hi rend="italic">has</hi> no single word to express the notion exactly; which is the less surprising, inasmuch as the French language labours under the same deficiency; the periphrasis <hi rend="italic">laisser tomber</hi> being made to supply the place of &lsquo;to drop&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">e)kxei=n</foreign>, Soph.

Phileb. 13 B.</note> or break the pitcher at the door&rsquo;, after you have carried it home from the distant well with much toil and trouble, expresses the general conception of &lsquo;lost labour&rsquo;, &lsquo;labour thrown away&rsquo;.

This requires some qualification. When the &lsquo;intellectual&rsquo; virtues are included as the objects of <foreign lang="greek">e)/painos</foreign>, as they certainly are in the Eth. Eud. II 1. 18, the approbation loses its exclusively moral character. In Eth. Nic. I 12, Aristotle together with the moral virtues, justice, courage, &lsquo;goodness&rsquo; in general, includes also as objects of praise all kinds of <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign> or excellence, such as strength and swiftness, which are manifested in <hi rend="italic">action.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ o(\ oi( e)xqroi\ kai\ oi( fau=loi e)painou=sin</lemma>] Victorius, in illustration of the former of these two topics, quotes Virg. Aen. XI 282, <hi rend="italic">Stetimus tela aspera contra, Contulimusque manus; experto credite quantus In clypeum assurgat, quo turbine torqueat hastam.</hi> The prowess of Aeneas could not be more highly extolled than by the praises extorted from his enemy Diomede. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ oi( fau=loi</lemma>] is rejected as a subsequent insertion by Muretus, F. A. Wolf, Bekker, Brandis, and Spengel, because it is passed over unnoticed in the explanatory commentary that follows, <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper ga\r&mdash;peponqo/tes</foreign>. <pb n="112"/> Vater alone defends it. The explanation of it is easy, and it is perfectly consistent with the context and with good sense. If the vilest and meanest, the &lsquo;worthless and contemptible&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">fau=loi</foreign>, who are <hi rend="italic">least</hi> likely to be sensible of merit in others, being almost devoid of right moral instinct, find themselves compelled to praise some signal act of valour, disinterestedness, or virtue&mdash;we are engaged here upon <hi rend="italic">actions&mdash;a fortiori</hi> it must meet with the approbation of better judges, and be emphatically good. If with this reasonable explanation we take into account Aristotle's hasty and careless habit, twice already noticed, of interrupting an explanation or an argument by the insertion of something bearing indirectly on the subject, but not immediately appropriate, I think we may without scruple retain the words objected to. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/sper ga\r pa/ntes h)/dh o(mologou=sin</lemma>] &lsquo;for this is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> as good as, equivalent to, an universal admission&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">h)/dh</foreign>, &lsquo;by this time&rsquo;, now that we have got as far as this, have reached, that is, the level of enemies, the extreme case of those who are interested in denying the merit&mdash;if <hi rend="italic">they</hi> approve, all others must necessarily do so. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dia\ ga\r to\ fanero\n...to\ *)/ilion</lemma>] There is a difficulty here which has much occupied the commentators, arising from the want of connexion, as the present text stands, between the two rules laid down, <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper kai\... e)painou=sin</foreign>, and the example (from Simonides) which is <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">dio/</foreign>, to follow from them: the example, according to the present reading, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an inference from either of them. The best way of meeting the difficulty seems to be to adopt, with Spengel, the reading of the best MS A^{c}. This omits the words <foreign lang="greek">ou(\s oi( fi/loi ye/gousi kai\ a)gaqoi/</foreign>, without which the sense is clear and consistent. &lsquo;For it must be owing to its being <hi rend="italic">evident</hi> that they are inclined to (would) admit it, just as&rsquo; (it is equally evident that, by the same rule, in the opposite case) &lsquo;those who are praised by their enemies must be worthless&rsquo;, (because if your enemy approves of your conduct towards him, which is assumed to be hostile, it shews that you can have done him no harm: and therefore that you have been wanting either in courage or patriotism or energy and skill). Of this the example of the Corinthians is now a real instance, and their suspicion of Simonides' intentions may be traced to the general rule. &lsquo;And this was why the Corinthians conceived the suspicion that they had been insulted by Simonides, when he wrote, &lsquo;Ilium has no fault to find with the Corinthians&rsquo; (which it ought to have had if they had done their duty). The Corinthians misinterpreted Simonides&rsquo; expressions; his intentions were innocent, but he failed to perceive the inference that might be derived from them. The line of Simonides is apparently misquoted by a lapse of memory. The Schol. Pind. Ol. XIII p. 78, who cites it, has <foreign lang="greek">mani/ei</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">i^</foreign>) for <foreign lang="greek">me/mfetai</foreign>; and this reading appears also in another reference to it in Plut. Vit. Dion. c. I sub init. (cf. Bergk and Gaisf.), <foreign lang="greek">o( *simwni/dhs fhsi\ toi=s *korinqi/ois ou) mhni/ein to\ *)/ilion e)pistrateu/sasi meta\ tw=n *)axaiw=n, o(/ti ka)kei/nois oi( peri\ *glau=kon e)c a)rxh=s *kori/nqioi gegono/tes sunema/xoun proqu/mws</foreign>. Homer only says, Il. Z 152 seq., that Glaucus himself attributed his origin to <pb n="113"/> Sisyphus of Ephyre or Corinth. If this be the true explanation of the reason why Ilium was &lsquo;not wroth&rsquo;, or &lsquo;found no fault&rsquo;, with the Corinthians, and Aristotle remembered it when he used the example, it seems that the instance is very ill chosen for the purpose of illustrating the rule. In this case nothing is imputed to the Corinthians except that the aid of Glaucus and his men of Corinthian race compensated the Trojans for their own hostility, and therefore that Troy had nothing to reproach them with, which could scarcely be construed by them as an <hi rend="italic">insult:</hi> and the example only applies to the rule which it is supposed to exemplify in this sense; that the Trojans ought by the rule to have been represented as having directly censured the Corinthians, if Simonides had intended to pay them a compliment; by the mere omission of this they thought that he had insulted them. </p>

The <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> seems here intended in the more general sense in which <foreign lang="greek">proairei=sqai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> are employed in the ordinary language, and even sometimes in the Ethical treatise itself, as I 2, init. <foreign lang="greek">e)peidh\ pa=sa gnw=sis kai\ proai/resis a)gaqou= tino\s o)re/getai. proai/resis</foreign> is defined in Eth.

Thus the <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> is composed of two separate elements or faculties, intellectual and impulsive, of which the latter alone is the agent of motion, or stimulates to action: the intellectual part deliberates prior to action, and decides whether the proposed object of the action is good or bad, right or wrong<note anchored="yes">Accordingly, Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">*q</foreign> 5, 1048 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 11, <foreign lang="greek">o)/recis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> are distinguished; <foreign lang="greek">o)/recis</foreign> is the general and spontaneous impulse to action, which when controlled and determined by the intellectual principle, <foreign lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign>, becomes the compound <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>, the deliberate moral purpose.</note>. Though the <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> in its general and wider signification of &lsquo;deliberate, voluntary purpose&rsquo; is capable of prompting to action of every kind, yet in its narrower and specially ethical usage it is <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> action alone that it originates and determines, <foreign lang="greek">oi)keio/taton ga\r ei)=nai dokei= th=| a)reth=| kai\ ma=llon ta\ h)/qh kri/nein tw=n pra/cewn</foreign>, Eth.

						<p>The Syntax of the phrase, which only Trendelenburg, as far as I know, has attempted to explain<note anchored="yes">Trendel. in <hi rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.</hi> 1828, Vol. II p. 481&mdash;3. The author, who has discussed with great learning and ingenuity the meaning of this Aristotelian technicality, and its relation to <foreign lang="greek">to\ ti/ h)=n ei)=nai</foreign>, is, it seems to me, less successful in his grammatical explanation. I think that from the analogy of similar constructions of this dative in the ordinary language, the use of it here must needs be a case of <hi rend="italic">attraction</hi>, as I have explained it in the note. Trendelenburg, who takes nothing into account but the possible meanings of the dative (or, as he rightly prefers to call it, the &lsquo;acceptive&rsquo;) case, locative, instrumental, acceptive, selects the last of the three as that which belongs to the dative in this phrase. <foreign lang="greek">to\ mege/qei ei)=nai</foreign> express, according to him, &lsquo;the abstract conception (<foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)=nai</foreign>) belonging to (given to and received by) magnitude&rsquo;: making this dative depend solely upon <foreign lang="greek">ei)nai</foreign>, and leaving out the attraction to a word in the dative, actually or hypothetically preceding, as in any way concerned in the &lsquo;government&rsquo; of it. This is all that I have to object to in Trendelenburg's paper: in the rest he has shewn the same ability and intimate knowledge of his author which characterizes all his other writings upon Aristotle.</note>, seems to be this:&mdash;The dative is in apposition with a supposed <foreign lang="greek">tini/, to/ tini ei)=nai mego/qei</foreign>, and the construction is analogous to <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste sullabo/nti ei)pei=n</foreign>, I 10, 18. Other instances of a similar use of the dative, which lead up to the explanation of this, are such as Thuc. I 24, <foreign lang="greek">e)n deci/a| e)sple/onti to\n *)io/nion ko/lpon</foreign>: and others are to be found in Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 388. </p>

						<p>Leodamas of Acharnae was a famous orator, an earlier contemporary of Demosthenes and Aeschines. The latter mentions him, c.

He is mentioned again in II 23, 25 (comp. the note there); in Dem. adv. Lept. 501 and 502, who also speaks of him as a distinguished orator, where allusion is made to a certain proposition of his to cancel the &lsquo;grant&rsquo;, especially the <foreign lang="greek">a)te/leia</foreign>, made to Chabrias for his public services &mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ou(=tos e)gra/yato th\n *xabri/ou dwrea/n</foreign><note anchored="yes">This cannot be the same accusation as that which Aristotle here refers to; <foreign lang="greek">e)gra/yato dwrea/n</foreign> <hi rend="italic">and</hi> <foreign lang="greek">to\n pra/canta</foreign>, &lsquo;the man that carried into execution a nefarious scheme&rsquo;, are quite inapplicable to the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> offence.

Were there two accusers of Chabrias on his trial? Or two separate trials? (this seems improbable): or has Aristotle made a slip of memory in assigning the accusation of Chabrias to Leodamas? None of these suppositions is necessary to reconcile the, at first sight, conflicting statements. The accusation of Leodamas is directed against <hi rend="italic">both</hi> parties; he takes the case of Callistratus first, and then secondly (<foreign lang="greek">pa/lin de/</foreign>) applies the converse of the argument which he had issued against the other to the offence of Chabrias. Philostratus, who took part in the same proceedings, was another and independent accuser. Mr Grote, p. 393, note 3, who does not refer to the passage of Aristotle, assigns the trial or trials of Callistratus and Chabrias to this period, 366 B. C., and the alleged misconduct about Oropus. The other speech of Leodamas against Chabrias, referred to by Dem. adv. Lept. l. c. was earlier, and had nothing to do with the affair of Oropus.

						<p>Callistratus, son of Callicrates, of Aphidna, a distinguished Athenian orator and politician, of the earlier half of the 4th cent. B. C. His name first appears in history in the year 379 B. C. Aristotle refers to two speeches of his, Rhet. I 14. 1, and III 17. 14. Leodamas' accusation of him, here mentioned, seems to have been directed against his conduct in the affairs of Oropus, in 366, Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist.

						<p>On Callistratus and Chabrias Mr Elder's articles in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> may be consulted. Callistratus' name occurs very frequently in the Attic orators. See Baiter and Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> Vol. III; Ind. Nom. p. 73. </p>

It appears therefore that there is no occasion to have recourse to the explanation of Victorius and Buhle, that <foreign lang="greek">e)pibouleu/ein</foreign> is (or can be) put for <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/ein</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/esqai</foreign>.

In a speech, quoted by Spedding (<hi rend="italic">Letters and life of Fr. Bacon</hi>, Vol. III. p. 18), Bacon says: I liken this bill to that sentence of the poet (Pindar), who sets this as a paradox in the fore-front of his book, <hi rend="italic">first water, then gold</hi>, preferring necessity before pleasure; and I am of opinion, that things necessary in use are better than those things that are glorious in estimation.</note>.

						<p>These two opposite topics represent two prevailing modes of estimating &lsquo;value&rsquo;, by <hi rend="italic">use</hi> and <hi rend="italic">price:</hi> Political Economy teaches us that the former is the true, the latter the false standard.

Moral considerations are altogether laid aside, and Rhetoric is here permitted (not recommended) to take the immoral side of the question: vice may be regarded as an &lsquo;end&rsquo; of human desire and exertion. </p>
						<p>Bonitz, <hi rend="italic">Arist. Stud.</hi> I. p. 87, proposes an ingenious alteration, which no one who is satisfied with the preceding explanation will consider necessary. It is to substitute for the existing text, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ a)reth\ mh\ kaki/as kai\ kaki/a mh\ a)reth=s mei/zwn</foreign>, &lsquo;positive, downright, virtue is greater (better <hi rend="italic">or</hi> worse) than mere absence of vice, and downright vice than mere absence of virtue&rsquo;: which he neither translates nor explains; but, it is to be presumed, it means that the superiority of the one to the other still rests upon its <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> character. The <hi rend="italic">morality</hi> remains constant; for vice is still represented as the object of men's aims: it is therefore no improvement in that respect. His reason for the change is, &lsquo;that it never could occur to any one to institute a comparison in respect of magnitude (<hi rend="italic">Gr&ouml;sse</hi>) between <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mh\ a)reth/</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">kaki/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mh\ kaki/a</foreign>.&rsquo; Not perhaps if <foreign lang="greek">mei/zwn</foreign> implied nothing but mere magnitude or quantity; but when it is extended to the general notion of superiority the comparison may very well be made between them. And besides, Bonitz's altered comparison appears to rest upon the very same distinction of the positive and negative; for in what other sense can vice be regarded as superior to nonvirtue? </p>

The higher and nobler choice is illustrated by the preference of being wronged to doing wrong. This, though cited here as a popular sentiment, was by no means the current and prevailing opinion at Athens. Plato, Rep.

In fact one of the main objects of the Republic is to prove that the reverse of this is true; and the long and laborious process which he is obliged to go through in the establishment of his position is quite sufficient to shew how strong must have been the prejudices in favour of the adverse doctrine which must be surmounted before he could hope to make his own views acceptable. The Gorgias also is occupied with the solution of this same question, in the comparison namely of doing and receiving injury and wrong, on <hi rend="italic">which</hi> side the advantage, when rightly estimated, really lies.

If it be applied to the rule, the show or appearance, <foreign lang="greek">to\ dokei=n</foreign>, of wealth is said <foreign lang="greek">lanqa/nein</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be seen; which is absurd. It <hi rend="italic">does</hi> follow from the topic in &sect; 37, and may possibly have been thence transferred to this place. Some MSS and the Greek Scholiast give <foreign lang="greek">ploutei=n...kai\ dokei=n</foreign>, but it seems unlikely that the two verbs, if the combination of the two was intended, should be so widely separated: also <foreign lang="greek">kai\ to\ dokei=n</foreign> would be required. This was corrected by Muretus, <foreign lang="greek">to\ ploutei=n kai\ dokei=n fanei/h a)\n mei=zon a)gaqo\n tou= ploutei=n</foreign>, which seems rather too violent an alteration. Brandis would adopt the reading of his anonymous commentator, <foreign lang="greek">dio\ to\ ploutei=n kai\ dokei=n fanei/h a)\n mei=zon a)gaqo\n tou= mh\ dokei=n</foreign> (Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i p. 42), also conjectured by Vater, and confirmed by the Greek Schol., who explains it, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ to\ ploutei=n kai\ fai/nesqai mei=zon tou= ploutei=n kai\ mh\ fai/nesqai</foreign>. Another mode of correction had occurred to me, the interchange, viz. of <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">tou=, tou= ploutei=n...to\ dokei=n</foreign>. The meaning of this would be, that the appearance or outward show of wealth, together with the wealth itself which it manifested, might upon this principle be made to appear superior to the wealth without the show, because the possessor would lose all the credit of it&mdash;but this involves perhaps rather a non-natural interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">pro\s a)lh/qeian tei/nei</foreign>. I am indebted to Mr Munro for a suggestion that deserves attention: the substitution of <foreign lang="greek">tw=|</foreign>, for <foreign lang="greek">tou=, dokei=n</foreign>: the alteration is very slight, and gives an excellent sense; the value of wealth by this rule may be considered to be augmented by the addition of the prominent and conspicuous display of it.

						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">o(/ros</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">aristocracy</hi> is in the Politics <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign> and not <foreign lang="greek">paidei/a</foreign>. The two following observations are added in the way of notes to explain the apparent discrepancy. &lsquo;Aristocracy is a kind of polity in which education is the qualification for a share in the government. By education, I mean that which is established by the law of the land: for it is those who have lived in constant obedience to the state institutions that bear rule in the aristocracy&rsquo;. The virtue of a citizen is not one and the same; it varies under different forms of government. The system of education must therefore be fixed and controlled by the government and conformed to its established institutions. This is the &lsquo;education established by the law&rsquo; of the text. On the absolute necessity of this kind of training in virtue under state direction for grown men as well as children, see Eth. N. X 10, 1179 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32 seq., and the unfinished treatise on education in Bk. V (VIII) of the Politics. &ldquo;Such men as these must necessarily appear &lsquo;best&rsquo;, and it is from them that this (form of constitution) has derived its name&rdquo;. Since <foreign lang="greek">paidei/a</foreign> therefore is the necessary preparation for <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign>, either of them may be represented as the object of the state. Definitions of <foreign lang="greek">a)ristokrati/a</foreign> are to be found, Pol. III 7, 1279 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 34, where two explanations of the <foreign lang="greek">a)risto-</foreign> in the name are given: either <foreign lang="greek">dia\ to\ tou\s a)ri/stous a)/rxein</foreign> (which is adopted here), or <foreign lang="greek">dia\ to\ pro\s to\ a)/riston th=| po/lei kai\ toi=s koinwnou=sin au)th=s</foreign>: c. 15, 1286 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4, <foreign lang="greek">tw=n pleio/nwn a)rxh\n a)gaqw=n d'  a)ndrw=n</foreign>, Ib.

The government of the hereditary monarchs of Persia is &lsquo;tyrannous&rsquo; in respect of the nature and mode of exercise of their power, though these and other barbarian monarchies are <foreign lang="greek">kata\ no/mon kai\ patrikai/</foreign>, Pol.

The regular constitutional sovereign is protected, if at all, by a national guard of citizens, III 14, 1285 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 24.

All choice is directed to some end: the end of the state, or its governing and guiding principle, must control and give a direction to all the choice and the consequent action of its citizens; and hence the necessity that the statesman and public speaker should be acquainted with it. &lsquo;Plainly therefore it is with a view to the end of each form of government that our analysis of its habits, institutions, and interests should be conducted, because it is to this that the motives and actions of the body of men that we have to address are ultimately directed&rsquo;. <pb n="156"/> </p>

But as a <foreign lang="greek">fulakh/</foreign>, in some sense, is equally required by any sole ruler or monarch, who is always in danger from the attempts of rivals, or rebels, or revolutionists,&mdash;the sole ruler has only one life to lose, and hence the <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> danger; in governments of many, where the members are numerous, the attempt to get rid of them all would be difficult or impossible, and consequently it is not made&mdash;so here <foreign lang="greek">basilei/a</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">monarxi/a</foreign> is included under the general head of <foreign lang="greek">turanni/s</foreign>: so Schrader.

Vater, who does not agree with Victorius' and Schrader's view, thinks that some words descriptive of the <foreign lang="greek">te/los</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">basilei/a</foreign> have dropt out; and Spengel, by &lsquo;indicating a lacuna&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">Rhet.

						<p>Upon the whole I think that Brandis' view of the question is to be preferred (<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i p. 43).

For example, the definition here given coincides in no single point with that of the Ethics. It regards virtue solely on the side of its usefulness, probably because this feature of it is likely to produce the greatest effect upon the popular mind. Instead of a <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> it is a mere <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, an undeveloped faculty or power&mdash;this is most expressly denied in Eth. N.

The end and object of the true statesman is to make the citizens good, and this must be effected by training them in obedience to the laws of that form of government under which they live; the type of the perfect citizen varying under various constitutions. <foreign lang="greek">dokei= de\ kai\ o( kat'  a)lh/qeian politiko\s peri\ tau/thn</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">th\n a)reth\n</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ma/lista peponh=sqai: bou/letai ga\r tou\s poli/tas a)gaqou\s poiei=n kai\ tw=n no/mwn u(phko/ous</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ndri/a</lemma>] In the chapter on this virtue of &lsquo;gratitude&rsquo; in the Nic. Ethics, III 11, <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> (as it is there written) is first defined in general terms as a virtue residing in a mean state in things that inspire confidence, or encouragement, or boldness, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ qarrale/a</foreign>, on the one hand, and fear on the other: its sole object and aim in choosing a course of action and encountering danger being <foreign lang="greek">to\ kalo/n</foreign>, the right and noble as an ultimate end, because it is so, and for no other reason; which implies also the opposite, the spurning of what is base and disgraceful. This is the general notion of fortitude, the endurance of pain, labour, danger, in the pursuit of an unselfish, honourable, high and noble object, when the opposite course would be base, mean, disgraceful<note anchored="yes">Acts of fortitude must likewise be deliberate and voluntary, <foreign lang="greek">dei= d'  ou) di) a)na/gshn a)ndrei=on ei=nai, a)ll) o(/ti kalo/n</foreign> (1116 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2).</note>. From this are <pb n="162"/> then distinguished five popular notions of &lsquo;courage&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> in a narrower sense, none of which can be properly called &lsquo;fortitude&rsquo;. The first of these is <hi rend="italic">political courage</hi>, the courage of a citizen, as a member of a state, and living under and directed by its laws, described in 1116 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 17&mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2. And this seems to be the view of courage which is taken here, the terms employed in each corresponding very closely, <foreign lang="greek">dokou=si ga\r u(pome/nein tou\s kindu/nous</foreign> (this restricts the virtue to facing <hi rend="italic">danger</hi> and gives it a narrower sense than &lsquo;fortitude&rsquo;) <foreign lang="greek">oi( poli=tai dia\ ta\ e)k tw=n no/mwn e)piti/mia kai\ ta\ o)nei/dh kai\ dia\ ta\s tima/s</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18. <foreign lang="greek">di) ai)dw=</foreign> (it is due to a sense of honour) <foreign lang="greek">kai\ dia\ kalou= o)/recin, timh=s ga/r, kai\ fugh\n o)nei/dous, ai)sxrou= o)/ntos</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 28. Further, one of the characteristics of this form of <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> reappears in Eth. Eudem. III 1. 13, as belonging to political courage, <foreign lang="greek">mi/a me\n politikh/: au(/th d'  e)sti\n h( di) ai)dw= ou)=sa</foreign>, and another &sect; 16, <foreign lang="greek">dia\ no/mon de\ h( politikh\ a)ndrei/a</foreign>. The prominence of the military character of this virtue is likewise marked in the description both of the Ethics and Rhetoric by <foreign lang="greek">u(pome/nein tou\s kindu/nous</foreign> in the one, and by <foreign lang="greek">e)/rgwn e)n kindu/nois</foreign> &sect; 8, and <foreign lang="greek">h(...e)n pole/mw|</foreign> &sect; 6, in the other; so that it seems that there is sufficient warrant for the identification of the two; the duty to the state and obedience to its laws being again made the ground of the obligation to practise this virtue. </p>

						<p>The third virtue, <foreign lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">temperantia</hi>, is likewise represented under a <hi rend="italic">political</hi> aspect. It is a virtue by which men's bodily appetites are regulated according to the dictates of the laws of the state, &lsquo;are so disposed towards bodily pleasures as the law enjoins&rsquo;. In Eth. Nic. III cc. 13, 14, there is no regular definition of it; but we gather from the contents of the two chapters that it is a virtue of self-control, which consists in a mean state with regard to the indulgence in bodily pleasures, (pains having less to do with the virtue); and in a due <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> or estimate of the value of them. It is thus a &lsquo;mean&rsquo; between <foreign lang="greek">a)kolasi/a</foreign>, &lsquo;excessive indulgence in them&rsquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">a)naisqhsi/a</foreign>, total &lsquo;insensibility&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)leuqerio/ths</lemma>] The principal difference between the views taken of the virtues in the Ethics and Rhetoric respectively, is that in the latter they are regarded solely on the side of their utility to society&mdash;a political view&mdash;in the Ethics they are confirmed habits or states resulting from a due regulation of the elementary <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> out of which they are formed and developed. They are &lsquo;relative means&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">meso/thtes pro\s h(ma=s</foreign>, mean states varying in individuals according to the special character of each, lying at a variable distance between two extremes of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> out of which they grow, the proper mean in any given case being determined by the <foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign> or practical wisdom, the objective standard being the collective judgment of those who are specially endowed with this faculty, the <foreign lang="greek">fro/nimoi</foreign>.

This is a very different and much narrower view of the virtue than that which is conveyed by the description of it in Nic. Eth.

The <foreign lang="greek">megalo/yuxos</foreign> of the Ethics is a man of high aims and lofty spirit, full of scorn and contempt for all that is beneath him, men and things, and with a pride which is justified by his deserts: pride without merits to support it is no longer proper pride, a virtue; but degenerates into vanity <foreign lang="greek">xauno/ths</foreign>, an undue sense of one's own merits. </p>

This identification of the causes of the two actions leads to the &lsquo;false inference&rsquo;, that as the same cause produces the same effect, and the cause of both actions is the same, the effects are likewise the same, and both of them are acts of virtue. And then the further inference is drawn, that whatever a man will do from a less powerful motive, he will do <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> from one which is higher and more prevailing: the higher the motive or cause, the more powerful the impulse or effect.

The mere repetition of the actions, <foreign lang="greek">to\ polla/kis fai/nesqai pepraxo/ta</foreign>, is serviceable in producing this impression, because it seems to shew an inclination or fondness for them, and thence a certain direction of the <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> or choice, and a certain <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> or moral state, which are indications of a virtuous habit. <foreign lang="greek">sumptw/ma</foreign> is a &lsquo;concurrence&rsquo; or &lsquo;accidental coincidence&rsquo; of one thing or act with another, between which there is no <hi rend="italic">necessary connexion</hi>, and, like <foreign lang="greek">ta\ a)po\ tu/xhs</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">purely accidental.</hi> &lsquo;<foreign lang="greek">su/mptwma</foreign> est, cum quopiam aliquid agente, et quod nihil ad rem quae intervenit faciat, extrinsecus quippiam excitatum contingit; e.g. deambulante illo solem deficere: <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ tu/xhs</foreign> vero, cum quopiam aliquid agente alicuius rei gratia, aliquid ex eo actu praeter propositum evenerit; ut scrobem facientem, ut arborem serat, thesaurum defossum invenire.&rsquo; Victorius.

There the pleading is always direct, and the arguments pointed at an adversary; comparisons with others are altogether out of place, or only occasionally serviceable. If Isocrates had had this practice, he would not have fallen into the habit of comparing, into which he had been led by confining himself to the epideictic branch of Rhetoric where they tell and are in point. <hi rend="italic">Secondly</hi>, this is what Isocrates himself tells us of his own habits and pursuits, Antid. &sect;&sect; 2, 3, <foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ ga\r ei)dw\s e)ni/ous tw=n sofistw=n blasfhmou=ntas peri\ th=s e)mh=s diatribh=s kai\ le/gontas w(s e)/sti peri\ dikografi/an... au)to\s de\ pa=si tou=to pepoihke/nai fanero\n o(/ti proh/|rhmai kai\ le/gein kai\ gra/fein ou) peri\ tw=n i)di/wn sumbolai/wn, a)ll'  u(pe\r thlikou/twn k.t.l.</foreign> Panath. &sect; 11, <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  e)peidh\ tou= politeu/esqai dih/marton e)pi\ to\ filosofei=n</foreign> (i.e. literary labour, speech writing) <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ponei=n kai\ gra/fein, ou) peri\ mikrw=n th\n proai/resin poiou/menos ou)de\ peri\ tw=n i)di/wn sumbolai/wn ou)de\ peri\ w(=n a)/lloi ti/nes lhrou=sin, a)lla\ peri\ tw=n *(ellhnikw=n k.t.l.</foreign> Ib. &sect; 39 seq. <foreign lang="greek">h(gou=mai de\ xrh=nai tou\s boulome/nous e)gkwmia/sai tina\ tw=n po/lewn a)kribw=s kai\ dikai/ws mh\ mo/non peri\ au)th=s poiei=sqai tou\s lo/gous h(=s proh|rhme/noi tugxa/nousin, a)ll'  w(/sper</foreign> (here follows a simile) <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw kai\ tai=s po/lesi parista/nai mh\ ta\s mikra\s tai=s mega/lais, k.t.l.</foreign> [Cf. note on Paneg. &sect; 11.

The two first of these statements seem to put the reading <foreign lang="greek">a)sunh/qeian</foreign> beyond question, <foreign lang="greek">sunh/qeian</foreign> being contrary alike to the known facts and the probabilities of the case. It is nevertheless supported by Max Schmidt, in his tract on the date of the Phetoric, pp. 17, 18. With this reading, <foreign lang="greek">dikologi/a</foreign> must be confined to speech writing for the use of parties in a legal process. </p>
						<p>This is one of the passages of the Rhetoric on which Victorius founds <pb n="186"/> his charge against Aristotle of jealousy and illwill towards Isocrates, whom he supposes the other to have lost no opportunity of assailing with open or covert censure and ridicule in his Rhetoric. See his commentary, pp. 154, 507, 586, 605, and elsewhere. Here at least, (with the reading <foreign lang="greek">a)sunh/qeian</foreign>), there is neither one nor the other.

						<p>This inquiry naturally leads to a classification of the sources or causes of human action, which are found to fall under seven heads; some of these have their origin in ourselves and are under our own control, others are external to us and independent of us, and exercise upon us and our actions the force of necessity and compulsion. To the causes whose origin is <hi rend="italic">without</hi> us belong (1) chance or accident, (2) nature, and (3) ex-ternal force or compulsion; over these we have no control: the causes which spring from <hi rend="italic">within</hi> us, and are therefore more or less in our power to master and overrule, are (4) habit, (5) reasoning or calculation, (6) passion, (7) appetite or desire.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)x e(ko/ntes</lemma>] Victorius here draws attention to Aristotle's well-known distinction, Eth. N. III 2, init., between <foreign lang="greek">ou)x e(kw/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/kwn</foreign>. Acts due to ignorance, acts which would not have been done, had the doer been aware of all the circumstances of the case, cannot be called <foreign lang="greek">a)kou/sioi</foreign>, involuntary or unintentional, unless they bring after them regret or repentance; neither are they strictly speaking <foreign lang="greek">e(kou/siai</foreign>, intentional, because no harm was intended; they lie between the two and must take the name of <foreign lang="greek">ou)x e(kou/siai</foreign>, &lsquo;not-intentional&rsquo;; neither intentional nor &lsquo;unintentional&rsquo;. I doubt if this distinction is applicable here; the only cases that it can be applied to are chance or accident, nature, and external compulsion, under which all actions are said to be involuntary, i.e. in which the will has no concern; and this is true. But in the Ethics, the actions there in question are not said to be involuntary&mdash;the doer meant to do what he did&mdash;but acting in ignorance, he acted unintentionally, in so far as he did not intend to do the mischief that followed. But this ignorance from which the unintentional character of the act is derived, essential in the Ethics, has no place here; ignorance is not included in an act done by chance, nature, or external compulsion. </p>
						<p>Now as we act voluntarily in all these four cases in which the impulse is from within and action in our own power, it follows (from the preceding) that the object of all voluntary action is some form either of real or <pb n="199"/> apparent good, or of real or apparent pleasure; including, in the good, real and apparent, the removal of evil and the substitution of a greater good for a less, because all these are <foreign lang="greek">ai(reta/</foreign> (desirable), objects of choice; and in the case of pleasure, the entire removal of pain and the substitution of a less for a greater; both of which are like the others (<foreign lang="greek">w(sau/tws</foreign>) desirable in the sense of pleasurable. </p>

						<p>It is therefore (from the preceding considerations) the rhetorician's business to discover the number <hi rend="italic">and</hi> kinds (so Aristotle, but the number <hi rend="italic">of</hi> kinds will be sufficient,) of good in the form of utility or expediency, and of pleasure. And as the first has been already examined and analysed under the head of deliberative Rhetoric (cc. 6, 7, good, absolute, and comparative), it remains for us to bestow a similar treatment on pleasure. Meanwhile we are not to forget that definitions for <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi> purposes are sufficient, provided they are neither obscure nor over-exact: in the one case they are not understood, in the other they are also apt to be unintelligible by the popular apprehension, but besides this they trespass upon an alien province and method of reasoning, the scientific, namely, or philosophical, I 4. 4&mdash;6, &amp;c.

					<p>gives the analysis of pleasure, so far as it is of service to the rhetorician. </p>
					<p>The general plan of this chapter, and the connexion of its contents, are as follows. First we have a definition of pleasure and a general description of its nature in &sect;&sect; 1, 2. From this we learn that all that is in accordance with our nature is pleasurable, all that runs counter to it painful, &sect;&sect; 3, 4. Consequently all <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> desires and appetites produce pleasure by their gratification: and these fall into two classes, bodily appetites and mental desires, the former irrational and connected with the pleasures of sense, the latter rational, in so far as they are of an intellectual character, suggested and acquired by some kind of intellectual process of the nature of persuasion, &sect; 5, and conveyed by a faculty, <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>, intermediate between sense and intellect. The analysis <pb n="200"/> of these intellectual pleasures (which include the pleasures of imagination, memory and anticipation, of love and friendship, and its counterfeit, flattery) occupies &sect;&sect; 6&mdash;20. In the remainder of the chapter other kinds of intellectual pleasures are distinguished, and referred to the principles implied in the definition. </p>
					<div3 id="b1c11s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>The first word of the chapter is a commentary upon the concluding observations of the last: <foreign lang="greek">u(pokei/sqw</foreign>, &lsquo;let us assume&rsquo;, as a definition, &lsquo;take it for granted&rsquo;: there is no occasion to enter into details, or attempt <hi rend="italic">to prove</hi> that it is what I am about to describe. Similarly <foreign lang="greek">e)/stw</foreign>, 5. 3, 6. 2, 7. 2, 10. 3. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kata/stasin...ei)s th\n u(pa/rxousan fu/sin</lemma>] This characteristic of pleasure, &lsquo;the resettlement of the soul&rsquo;, i.e. the vital and sensitive system, &lsquo;into its normal state&rsquo; after a disturbance of the balance or harmony, which is pain, reappears in one of the special <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> of pleasure, &sect; 21, <foreign lang="greek">e)n tw=| manqa/nein ei)s to\ kata\ fu/sin kaqi/stasqai</foreign>. So that learning, as a pleasure, like pleasure in general, is, according to this view, the filling up of a vacuum, the supply of a want, the satisfaction of a craving, the restoration of a balance of the system, the re-establishment of a broken harmony. This is the Platonic conception of <hi rend="italic">pleasure;</hi> not, so far as I remember, of <hi rend="italic">learning</hi> in particular. See Appendix, p. 234. Lucretius takes the same view of pleasure, de Rer. Nat. II 963 (there quoted). </p>

Substitute a colon for the full stop: retain <foreign lang="greek">ka)\n</foreign> (for <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e)n</foreign>) instead of <foreign lang="greek">a)ei\ e)n</foreign>; and understand the first three clauses <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\&mdash;e)lpi/zei</foreign>, as three distinct and independent propositions, the basis of the conclusion which follows; <foreign lang="greek">ei) de\ tou=to</foreign> is a repetition in sum of the foregoing, &lsquo;if all this, I say, be so&rsquo;, (<foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> is appropriate in a <hi rend="italic">resumption</hi> of what has been just said, note on I 1. 11); <hi rend="italic">if</hi> pleasure is a mode of sensation, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> is a feeble kind of sensation, and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> memory and hope <hi rend="italic">are</hi> attended by a <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> or mental impression of that which is remembered or hoped (some phenomenon past or future, the former a fact, the latter an imagination), it follows that pleasure, which is sensation, accompanies the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future because <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> <pb n="205"/> does, which is a form of sensation, <foreign lang="greek">e)pei/per kai\ ai)/sqhsis</foreign><note anchored="yes">That pleasure is attendant upon every act of sensation is stated in Eth.

In this case <foreign lang="greek">ka)/n</foreign> is to be retained in preference to <foreign lang="greek">a)ei\ e)n</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fantasi/a</lemma>] which is here called a &lsquo;sort of feeble sensation&rsquo;, is described otherwise in the psychology of the de Anima.

Hamilton). It is a faculty intermediate between sensation and memory, and thus becomes connected with the intellect; the seat of memory is <foreign lang="greek">to\ prw=ton ai)sqhtiko/n</foreign>, viz. the heart, where the results of sensation are all collected in a focus, and thence transmitted to the mind. The memory is defined, de memoria, c. 1, ult. 451 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15, <foreign lang="greek">fanta/smatos, w(s ei)ko/nos ou(= fa/ntasma, e(/cis</foreign>; which represents it as a state (in the heart, or the appropriate organ) of the impression <foreign lang="greek">fa/ntasma</foreign>, transferred by the faculty of <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> from the sensation itself, which (the impression) is the representation (the <foreign lang="greek">ei)kw/n</foreign>) of the real object of sense, that of which it is the <foreign lang="greek">fa/ntasma</foreign>. The office of the <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> is therefore to convey the impressions of the actual objects of sense delivered to it by sensation, and to impress or print them on the organ fitted for their reception; when thus impressed or &lsquo;represented&rsquo; they become memory, and so are passed on to the intellect. To compare with what is said in the Rhetoric, of this <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> being a sort of feeble sensation, we have in the de Anima, <foreign lang="greek">*g</foreign> 3, 428 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, what almost (not quite) justifies it, <foreign lang="greek">e)peidh\... h( de\ fantasi/a ki/nhsi/s tis dokei= ei)=nai kai\ ou)k a)/neu ai)sqh/sews gi/gnesqai a)ll'  ai)sqanome/nois kai\ w(=n ai)/sqhsi/s e)stin, e)/sti de\ gi/nesqai ki/nhsin u(po\ th=s e)nergei/as th=s ai)sqh/sews, kai\ tau/thn o(moi/an a)na/gkh ei)=nai th=| ai)sqh/sei, ei)/h a)\n au(/th h( ki/nhsis ou)/te a)/neu ai)sqh/sews e)ndexome/nh ou)/te mh\ ai)sqanome/nois u(pa/rxein...kai\ ei)=nai kai\ a)lhqh= kai\ yeudh=</foreign>.

						<p>Most appetites and desires are accompanied by a certain pleasure: which is felt either in the recollection of the past, or in the anticipation of the future, enjoyment; for instance, those who are suffering under (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> held, possessed by) fevers feel a pleasure in the thirst (that attends them), either from the remembrance of former draughts, or the expectation of future; and lovers in talking of their beloved (in his absence), or painting his portrait, or drawing his likeness, from memory, and composing verses in his honour&rsquo; (so Victorius and Vater; else, <foreign lang="greek">gra/fontes</foreign> &lsquo;writing of him&rsquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">poiou=nte/s ti a)ei/</foreign> &lsquo;in anything that they ever do which has any connexion with him&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= e)rwme/nou</foreign> &lsquo;so as to recall him to their recollection&rsquo;); for in all such cases the recollection appears to their fancy (<foreign lang="greek">oi)/ontai</foreign>) to be like the (present) perception (by any of the senses) of the beloved. </p>

The <foreign lang="greek">pettoi/</foreign> in particular was an old and favourite game, which appears from the constant allusions to it in Greek literature. The earliest mention of it occurs in Homer, Od. <foreign lang="greek">a/</foreign> 107. The corresponding Latin game, <hi rend="italic">latrunculi</hi>, is described by Ovid, Ars Am. II 208, III 357. </p>
						<p>The same is the case with &lsquo;serious&rsquo; games (games that require study and attention, such as chess, and <foreign lang="greek">pettei/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">kubei/a</foreign>, according to Plato, l. c.)&mdash;the only difference between serious games and games of mere amusement, in respect of the pleasures they afford, is that the pleasure in <pb n="212"/> the one case must be <hi rend="italic">acquired</hi>, and arise from habit and cultivation, whereas others are <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> agreeable, lit. <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">eu)qu/s</foreign>, from the very first); to this latter class belong hunting with dogs, and every kind of chace. </p>
						<p>Various &lsquo;kinds of chace&rsquo; are enumerated in the Politics, I 8, in the description of the &lsquo;hunting stage&rsquo;, the second, according to Aristotle, in the development of human civilization. He takes occasion from this to distinguish the several kinds of hunting. <foreign lang="greek">oi( d'  a)po\ qh/ras zw=si, kai\ qh/ras e(/teroi e(te/ras, oi(=on oi( me\n a)po\ lh|stei/as, oi( d) a)f) a(liei/as, o(/soi li/mnas kai\ e(/lh kai\ potamou\s h)\ qa/lattan toiau/thn</foreign> (i. e. of the same kind as the lakes, marshes and rivers, namely, fish-producing) <foreign lang="greek">prosoikou=sin, oi( d'  a)p) o)rni/qwn h)\ qhri/wn a)gri/wn</foreign>, piracy, man-hunting, fishing, fowling, and hunting wild animals, hunting proper. </p>
						<p>Wherever there is rivalry or competition, there is also victory, the opportunity of shewing one's superiority. And this is what makes practice at the bar and in the law courts (where there is a perpetual struggle and contest for the victory going on between the two rival pleaders), and that of dialectics (what is avowedly and technically a contest between two opposites), pleasant occupations. </p>

						<p>This quasi-sensation, the <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>, is again employed to explain the pleasure we derive from honour and fair fame, the favourable opinion of others.

This is what may be called the &lsquo;passive&rsquo; liking, said of the recipient of the action or liking; and is opposed to the active form of liking or love in this respect; that it is an end or ultimate object in itself, whereas the other looks to some further end beyond itself, namely, some good which it seems to see in the object of its affection. It is probable that little or no distinction is here intended to be made between <foreign lang="greek">filei=n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)gapa=|n</foreign>, since it is the end and not the process that is here in question, and they seem to be used pretty nearly as synonyms.

Eating and drinking too much are other cases in point; when the system is settled or satisfied, the repetition of the acts of eating and drinking disturbs the harmonious balance and produces discomfort or disease.

						<p>Twining in his note on Poet. IV 4 (note 22, p. 186 seq.) in describing and illustrating this doctrine of Aristotle, remarks that &lsquo;he does not see how any <hi rend="italic">information</hi> can be said to be acquired by the spectator&rsquo; (or listener) from the mere <hi rend="italic">identification</hi> of two objects, the inference that &lsquo;this is that&rsquo;. And this remark is true if this were all that Aristotle means by his doctrine. The mere identification of an object compared with one already known conveys no <hi rend="italic">new</hi> knowledge, which is essential to <pb n="219"/> the notion of <hi rend="italic">learning.</hi> But what seems to be Aristotle's real meaning is (as I have expressed it above) that by the comparison of the representation with the original, whether it be a picture, or a trait of character in a tragedy, or a metaphor, you <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> something <hi rend="italic">new</hi> in this respect; that the representation, in proportion to its accuracy and finish (the number of <hi rend="italic">details</hi> introduced), enables you to <hi rend="italic">discover</hi> or <hi rend="italic">observe</hi> by the comparison something new in the object which you had never observed before: and this is the &lsquo;inference&rsquo; from the resemblance, which the <foreign lang="greek">sullogismo/s</foreign>, here and in the Poetics, is intended to express.

In the discussion of <foreign lang="greek">to\ fi/lauton</foreign>, the subject of Eth. Nic. IX 8, two kinds of self-love are distinguished; the one low and vulgar, characteristic of the <foreign lang="greek">polloi/</foreign>, which consists in <foreign lang="greek">to\ e(autoi=s a)pone/mein to\ plei=on e)n xrh/masi kai\ timai=s kai\ h(donai=s tai=s swmatikai=s...tou/twn ga\r oi( polloi\ o)re/gontai...oi( dh\ peri\ tau=ta pleone/ktai xari/zontai tai=s e)piqumi/ais kai\ o(/lws toi=s pa/qesi kai\ tw=| a)lo/gw| th=s yuxh=s&mdash;dio\ kai\ h( proshgori/a gege/nhtai a)po\ tou= pollou= fau/lou o)/ntos</foreign>, 1168 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 16, seq.; and it has therefore got a &lsquo;bad name&rsquo;: but <foreign lang="greek">to\ fi/lauton</foreign> in its true sense, when this desire of superiority over others, and consequent preference of self&mdash;this grasping spirit. <foreign lang="greek">pleoneci/a</foreign>, in a good sense&mdash;manifests itself in a desire to excel them in honour and virtue, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> becomes praiseworthy and right. <foreign lang="greek">e)n pa=si dh\ toi=s e)painetoi=s o( spoudai=os fai/netai e(autw=| tou= kalou= ple/on ne/mwn. ou(/tw me\n ou)=n fi/lauton ei)=nai dei= kaqa/per ei)/rhtai: w(s d'  oi( polloi/, ou) xrh/</foreign>, 1169 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 35.

So we say &lsquo;fond of money&rsquo; or anything else, meaning &lsquo;over-fond&rsquo; of it. The natural fondness is in all cases to be distinguished from the vicious over-fondness. </p>
						<p>This love of self will naturally be extended to all that immediately belongs to, or is closely connected with, oneself, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ au(tw=n</foreign>, as our &lsquo;words&rsquo; and &lsquo;works&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">lo/goi</foreign> all that we &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">say</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;and, as we should now add in this our &lsquo;reading age&rsquo;, &lsquo;read and write&rsquo;&mdash;all our talk, studies, habits of thought, theories, arguments and such like, everything in which <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> is expressed; and <foreign lang="greek">e)/rga</foreign>, all that we <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">produce</hi>, all our actions and works; in which latter is included the propagation of children, <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=n ga\r e)/rga ta\ te/kna</foreign>.

This natural fondness for our own &lsquo;works&rsquo; is assigned in Eth. Nic.

						<p>It is this love which men feel for what is specially their own in word <pb n="222"/> or work that is the foundation of their liking for flattery, for the love of others, and for honour, the external tokens of respect&mdash;all of which are recognitions of their merit in word or deed in some shape or other, and evidence of respect, admiration, and regard; from the flatterer a mere pretence, with the others a reality. It is also the explanation of the parental affection, children being in a special and peculiar sense a man's own work. </p>
						<p>And this accounts also for the pleasure which we find in supplying a defect, or bringing anything to a state of perfection (see on &sect; 22), &lsquo;because <hi rend="italic">now</hi> (by this time, not before, <foreign lang="greek">h)/dh</foreign>) the work becomes our own&rsquo;: the <hi rend="italic">perfection</hi> of it is due to ourselves, and we get the credit of the whole. Victorius remarks upon this, that the difference between this form of pleasure and that which is expressed in the same words in &sect; 22, lies in the difference of the source of the pleasure and the motive of the action in either case. In the former the motive is benevolent, and the pleasure is that of doing good to others; here the motive is selfish, and the pleasure that of gratifying oneself. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pei\ to\ a)/rxein h(/diston</lemma>] &lsquo;ut res plana certaque ponitur&rsquo;. Victorius. However, it may most readily be deduced from the innate love of power, already indicated in &sect;&sect; 14, 22, <hi rend="italic">q. v.</hi> To this natural impulse or emotion is traced the pleasure that is derived from &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;, or the reputation of it&mdash;this is not the same as the pleasure of learning or acquiring knowledge, but that of possessing and exercising it, or the influence which the reputation of it carries with it&mdash;Now &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo; may be understood in two senses; &lsquo;practical wisdom&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis, to\ fronei=n</foreign>, which is pleasant to possess and exercise because it implies power, in the shape of influence over the actions of others; and &lsquo;speculative wisdom&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign>, which gratifies our love of wonder, &sect; 21, because it brings with it the knowledge of all sorts of things that are interesting and curious (and therefore objects of wonder). One would have supposed that the love of taxing, censuring, or finding fault with our neighbours and friends, <foreign lang="greek">e)pitima=|n</foreign>, is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> traceable to the pleasure of exercising power so frequently noticed before. Here however an intermediate step is introduced between the feeling and its real origin. This is the love of honour. Censuring and finding fault implies an advantageous contrast between ourselves and those whom we thus &lsquo;tax&rsquo;, a superiority in judgment or virtue, which gives us the right to <pb n="223"/> find fault; and the honour we all love is reflected upon ourselves by the contrast. But the pleasure lies ultimately not in the honour itself, but in the superiority that respect and the outward signs of it indicate. </p>
						<p>MS A^{c} here adds <foreign lang="greek">kai\ to\ a)/rxein</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">h(du\ ei)=nai</foreign>, adopted by Spengel. It would mean of course the general exercise of authority, an extension of the special <foreign lang="greek">e)pitima=|n</foreign>, and analogous to it, as manifested in various modes of punishment or correction by word and deed. And herein would lie the distinction. The private citizen can only find fault (viz. with his tongue); the ruler can inflict actual penalties, personal or pecuniary. </p>

This same topic is also applied to &lsquo;good&rsquo;, I 6. 29; the difference being in the &lsquo;ends&rsquo; or motives severally proposed, which stimulate the action in each; in the one it is success, a form of good; in the other, pleasure; the skill or degree of excellence shewn in the exercise of any faculty, bodily or mental, is the same in both. To dwell on that in which our superiority is shewn is of course pleasant, by the preceding rule. Problem XVIII 6, quoted by Gaisford, raises the question suggested by this topic.

						<p>This fragment of Euripides' Antiope (Fr. XX Dind., XXVII Wagner) is quoted also in Plato's Gorgias 484 E, &amp;c., with one or two trifling variations.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)rh/sqw</lemma>] This is the first instance in the Rhetoric of the use of this most familiar Aristotelian form of expression (a verb in the third person of the imperative passive), which in some of his works occurs sometimes at the end of nearly every chapter. It expresses the completeness and sufficiency of any action or process, that a thing has been completely gone through and finished, and that that is sufficient, and no more need be said or done about it. Thus <foreign lang="greek">ei)rh/sqw</foreign>, &lsquo;let so much <hi rend="italic">have been said</hi> upon the subject&rsquo;, means, let it suffice to have said so much, let this be considered sufficient, and the subject closed; and let us now &lsquo;have done with it&rsquo;, and go on to something else. It is not peculiar to Aristotle, though very much more common in him than in other writers. It occurs <pb n="225"/> for instance in Xenophon, Mem. IV 2. 19, <foreign lang="greek">o(/mws de\ ei)rh/sqw moi</foreign>, &lsquo;be satisfied with my saying so much&rsquo;, let it suffice to have said so much: Plato, Phileb. 57 C, <foreign lang="greek">ei)rh/sqw</foreign>, &lsquo;let it be said once for all&rsquo;, and no more about it. Ib. 62 E, <foreign lang="greek">meqei/sqwn</foreign>, and Stallbaum's note on Phaedr. 278 B, <foreign lang="greek">pepai/sqw</foreign>, &lsquo;enough of this joking&rsquo;, Ib. 250 C, <foreign lang="greek">kexari/sqw</foreign>, Theaet. 197 D, <foreign lang="greek">pepoih/sqw</foreign>, Euthyd. 278 D, <foreign lang="greek">pepai/sqw u(mi=n</foreign>, Rep. VIII 553 A, 562 A, IX 588 D, <foreign lang="greek">pepla/sqw</foreign>. Thucyd. I 71, <foreign lang="greek">w(ri/sqw</foreign>, &lsquo;let this definition suffice&rsquo;. Ar. Eth. Nic. I 1 ult. <foreign lang="greek">pefroimia/sqw</foreign>, &lsquo;let so much suffice by way of preface&rsquo;; Top. A 8, 103 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, and 13, 105 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, <foreign lang="greek">diwri/sqw</foreign>: <hi rend="italic">et passim.</hi> </p>
						<p>This notion of a completed, perfected, concluded, fixed and permanent, and sufficient action, belongs to the perfect tense in general, and appears, not only in the imperative of the passive, but also in the indicative, perfect and future (the <hi rend="italic">paulo post futurum</hi>, on which see Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 498). Of the indicative, instances are, Soph. Trach. 586, <foreign lang="greek">memhxa/nhtai tou)/rgon</foreign>, Philoct. 1280, <foreign lang="greek">pe/paumai</foreign>, Eur. Hippol. 1457, <foreign lang="greek">kekarte/rhtai ta)ma/</foreign>, my powers of endurance are exhausted, the play is played out, all my endurance and sufferings are over, and this is the end: compare <foreign lang="greek">pepo/nqasi ga/r</foreign>, Rhet. II 8. 2; Aesch. Eum. 680, and Aesch. S. c. T. 1050, <foreign lang="greek">diateti/mhtai</foreign> (Paley's notes on both passages). Fragm. Phryx (Fr. Aesch. 263), <foreign lang="greek">diapefrou/rhtai bi/os</foreign>. Eur. Orest. 1203, and Phoen. 1019, <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rhtai lo/gos</foreign>. Plat. Phileb. 62 D, <foreign lang="greek">meqei=ntai</foreign>. Ar. Rhet. I 14 ult. II 5 ult. <foreign lang="greek">kai\ peri\ me\n foberw=n kai\ qarrale/wn ei)/rhtai</foreign>, &lsquo;so much for&rsquo;, where the perf. ind. pass. in summing up at the end of the chapter, plainly differs only in form from the ordinary imperative. <hi rend="italic">Troia fuit. Fuit Ilium.</hi> </p>
						<p>Of the <hi rend="italic">paulo post futurum</hi> a good instance occurs Theaet. 180 A, in the humorous description of the Heraclitean philosophers, &lsquo;and if you look for an explanation of the meaning of the meaning of this, <foreign lang="greek">e(te/rw| peplh/cei kainw=s metwnomasme/nw|</foreign>, you will be instantly shot with (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> another phraselet, <foreign lang="greek">r(hmati/w|</foreign>) another brand new word coined for the occasion&rsquo;, i. e. you will have been shot already, as it were; almost before you know where you are. </p>
						<p>The observation on this use of the tense in Jelf's <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 399, obs. 1, is quite inadequate, and not quite correct: Matthiae, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 500, p. 841, is somewhat more satisfactory. </p>

						<p>Such are the motives and incentives that stimulate men to injustice and wrong, which have been found to be so many varieties of pleasure: we next proceed to examine and classify, for the use of the forensic practitioner, the dispositions and characters of wrong-doers and of their intended victims, those who are most likely to be exposed to wrong. </p>
						<p>First of all, the &lsquo;possibility&rsquo; of effecting it must always be taken into account by any one who contemplates the perpetration of a wrong: and not only the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> possibility, as whether so and so is possible to a human being (physical or absolute possibility), but a <hi rend="italic">special</hi> possibility to <pb n="226"/> themselves, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e(autoi=s dunato/n</foreign>; in other words, the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> possibility, when the act is done in such a way or under such circumstances as shall render it worth their while; such that the prejudice or injury sustained by the action or its consequences shall not outweigh the prospective benefit; an act done in spite of these considerations may be regarded as morally &lsquo;impossible&rsquo;. </p>

					<div3 id="b1c12s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)n toi=s u(/steron</lemma>] The subject of &lsquo;general probability and improbability&rsquo; shall be considered hereafter, that is, in II 19, where the <foreign lang="greek">dunato/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)du/naton</foreign> (one of the four <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign>) are analysed. This is expressed by the <foreign lang="greek">koina\ ga\r tau=ta pa/ntwn tw=n lo/gwn</foreign> of the parenthesis: &lsquo;because they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> common to all kinds of speeches&rsquo;, (viz. the three kinds of Rhetoric, which is here taken as the basis of their <foreign lang="greek">koino/ths</foreign>, elsewhere it is their opposition to the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, see Introd. on <foreign lang="greek">to/poi</foreign>, p. 128), &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> they shall be considered hereafter&rsquo;, viz. with the rest in II 19. We now proceed to the subject of the special or moral probability, which affects would-be wrongdoers themselves (<foreign lang="greek">au)toi\ d'  oi)/ontai dunatoi\ ei)=nai</foreign>...), and under the circumstances of any particular case. </p>
						<p>The first class of persons that rely on this kind of possibility, in the sense of a possible exemption from punishment if they do wrong, are able speakers and men of action&mdash;the one capable of defending themselves against attack with their tongues by plausible argument, the other of carrying through the business or transaction in the best and completest way, so as to secure all possible advantage; and men already practised in many forensic contests&mdash;and so with acquired experience of the resources available for defence against an accuser in a court of justice; and men with many friends, having an extensive or influential connexion, or well befriended,&mdash;these will be well helped; and the wealthy&mdash;who can buy off an accuser or antagonist, and corrupt the judges. </p>

						<p>The possibility of doing wrong with impunity is greatest when the parties themselves answer to any of the foregoing descriptions; and <pb n="227"/> if not, (in the next degree), when they have friends, or servants and followers, or associates of these kinds; for these circumstances and capacities make it possible for them (<foreign lang="greek">dia/</foreign>, the cause, the power is due to these) to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the things (this applies specially to the <foreign lang="greek">praktikoi/</foreign>), and to escape either detection or punishment. </p>

						<p>Again, the possibility is increased, the attempt becomes easier, if they are friends either of the objects of the wrong, those whom they propose to injure, or of the judges who would have to try the case if brought before them: for friends are off their guard (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> unguarded), and thereby particularly exposed to injury and wrong, and moreover are inclined to come to terms or to be reconciled without &lsquo;prosecuting&rsquo; the case, or bringing it before a court of justice; and judges are ready to oblige their friends, and either let them off altogether, or inflict a very slight penalty (so fair and upright were the Athenian dicasts). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi(...fi/loi a)fu/laktoi k.t.l.</lemma>] This sounds very atrocious, and certainly has a highly immoral appearance on the face of it. But we are to recollect that the author told us in his apology for Rhetoric in the preface that such suggestions are to be regarded only as exemplifications of the <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> of the art, which argues each side of every question indifferently without regard to moral considerations: but in <hi rend="italic">practice</hi>, though the rhetorician as such <hi rend="italic">can</hi> employ immoral arguments, no <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> rhetorician would have recourse to them. Rhetoric does not profess to teach virtue; that must be learned <hi rend="italic">aliunde.</hi> This is <hi rend="italic">Aristotle's</hi> view of the matter: the Sophists, who, as we are expressly told, identified the study of Rhetoric with a general, political education, had no such excuse or justification for the immoralities of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> Rhetoric, which they inculcated without alloy. </p>

VII (VI) 8, 1322 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9; and particularly with verbs that imply conciliation or reconciliation, as <foreign lang="greek">prosxwrei=n</foreign> Thuc.

						<p>Persons likely to escape detection are those whose personal and moral or mental character is opposite (this is the &lsquo;opposition&rsquo; of &lsquo;contrariety&rsquo;, the extremes under the same genus, as black and white in colour, bitter and sweet in taste, hot and cold in touch or feeling, and such like) to that which the charge necessarily implies; as when a man of feeble bodily frame is charged with &lsquo;assault and battery&rsquo;, or a poor and ugly man with adultery. </p>
						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">a)sqenh/s</foreign> charged with <foreign lang="greek">ai)ki/a</foreign> was a stock example of the <foreign lang="greek">to/pos</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)ko/s</foreign> in the early rhetorical treatises.

The application of the argument of &lsquo;probability&rsquo; to the treatment of it, shewing how Rhetoric <foreign lang="greek">ta)nanti/a sullogi/zetai</foreign>, is there illustrated.

These are &lsquo;personal&rsquo; topics of argument, <hi rend="italic">argumenta a persona</hi>, &sect; 23, inferences from personal conditions, qualities, habits, employed to determine the probability of a certain action, as proceeding from <hi rend="italic">him:</hi> one of these is, <hi rend="italic">habitus corporis: ducitur enim frequenter in argumentum species libidinis, robur petulantiae; his contraria in diversum</hi>&mdash;the two cases given by Aristotle. </p>

						<p>Another class of cases in which men are disposed to do wrong, <pb n="231"/> and think wrong deeds possible, is where the profit likely to accrue is evident, or certain (patent to all, free from all doubt or obscurity), or great, or immediate; and the penalties to which they are liable small, or obscure and uncertain (not such as to attract attention, and so deter from the intended wrong; <hi rend="italic">quae obscurae admodum et caecae sunt ut perspici nequeant:</hi> Victorius), or remote. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And the reverse; where the (legal) crime tends to any kind of praise (is directed to, as its meed or reward; i. e. where what is a crime in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> point of view, is likely to meet with <hi rend="italic">praise</hi> in another), as, for instance, if the crime was accompanied by vengeance for father or mother, as it was in Zeno's case; whilst the penalties are all directed against a man's purse or person, as fine, imprisonment, banishment, or anything else of the same kind (not affecting his character or reputation): for both circumstances and both dispositions may be motives to wrong acts, only not in the same persons and the same characters&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Men of different characters are influenced by different motives in the commission of crime. Some care more for honour and glory and reputation than for their money and personal ease and comfort, and these, like Zeno, will be ready to commit what may be construed as a crime and render them liable to punishment, provided it be attended with something which leads to praise: the others, who value their personal wellbeing more than their good name, will be induced rather to do wrong acts which lead to substantial gain, and affect only their reputation. The one are virtuous, though they err; the others, sordid, mean, and vicious. </p>
						<p>Of Zeno's case, here referred to, nothing is known, and we are reduced to conjecture. Of the two best known of this name, Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic sect, whose death is placed in B. C. 263 (Clint. <hi rend="italic">Fast. Hell.</hi>), would, if alive, have been too young when Aristotle wrote the Rhetoric to have attracted public attention: it is just possible that the other, Zeno the logician, of Elea, Parmenides' follower, may be the person <pb n="232"/> here meant. Of this Zeno we learn from Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Diodorus (see the reff. in Brandis' Art. in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. Biogr.</hi>) that he joined in an attempt to rid his native country of her tyrant: and if the attempt was successful (of which we are not informed) and the tyrant slain, Zeno may <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> have mixed personal considerations with his public and patriotic motives, just as Harmodius and Aristogeiton did, as Aristotle tells us in the Politics (VIII (V) 10), in their attack upon the Athenian tyrant. Only it seems unlikely that if this were the true explanation of the allusion that Aristotle would have spoken of tyrannicide as an <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma</foreign>, a &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;, either legal or moral: and besides this, the act itself, as well as the attendant circumstance, would have been regarded as praiseworthy. </p>

See also Stallbaum's note on Gorgias 521 B, who quotes Olympiodorus (on the passage of Plato), <foreign lang="greek">h( paroimi/a au(/th e)k tou= *thle/fou e)sti\n *eu)ripi/dou, e)kei= ga/r k.t.l.</foreign> Whatever may be the origin of this proverb, it certainly was not <hi rend="italic">derived</hi> from Euripides' play: for Harpocration expressly says that it is to be found in Strattis (the Comic poet) and Simonides <foreign lang="greek">e)n i)a/mbois</foreign>.

						<p>The above explanations seem to be founded upon the <hi rend="italic">helpless condition</hi> of the Mysian people under some special circumstances which deprived them of their ordinary means of self-defence.

This imputation of cowardice or weakness is directly conveyed by Aristotle in the passage before us. This brings the two proverbs together as the expression of the same features of national character. This will furnish a sufficient explanation of Gorg. 521 B, <foreign lang="greek">ei) soi *muso/n ge h(/dion kalei=n</foreign>, and we need not have recourse with Stallbaum and Heindorf (ad loc. &sect; 162) to the <foreign lang="greek">*musw=n lei/an</foreign> to interpret it.

Callippus was an Athenian, friend and companion of Dion during his stay at Athens, and the partner of his expedition to Sicily for the liberation of his native country. By his conduct and services he had ingratiated himself with Dion's mercenaries, whom he incited to murder their general, and thereby made himself master of Syracuse. Before this, he had spread calumnious reports about Dion and excited the citizens against him. Dion being informed of this took no precautions for his own safety; partly in scorn of the attempt, and partly because he was unwilling to preserve his own power and life at the expense of the destruction of his friends: the scheme accordingly took effect, and Dion was shortly after put to death. Aristotle says upon this that Callippus justified the act by arguing that as Dion had now knowledge of his designs, and his own life <pb n="242"/> was in danger, this anticipation of the other, was a mere measure of precaution or retaliation, and no crime at all. This suspicion of Callippus is the ground of his <hi rend="italic">complaint</hi> and the occasion of the <hi rend="italic">previous difference</hi>, or sundering of their apparent friendship.

That this is a sort of justification of such an act appears in the conduct attributed to &AElig;nesidemus towards Gelo: the latter (tyrant of Syracuse) had anticipated him (the tyrant of Leontini) in reducing and enslaving some state that was neighbour of both: Aenesidemus sends a present to Gelo of eggs, cakes, and sweetmeats, the ordinary prize of the game of <foreign lang="greek">ko/ttabos</foreign>, as a prize, in acknowledgment of his superior foresight, quickness and dexterity, shewn in his &lsquo;anticipation&rsquo; of himself, <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti e)/fqasen</foreign>, admitting at the same time that he had had an eye to it himself. This shows that Aenesidemus thought it &lsquo;hardly a crime&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">e)ggu\s tou= mh\ a)dikei=n</foreign>, a justifiable act; and also illustrates the extreme liability to aggression and wrong involved in the position of this &lsquo;neighbouring state&rsquo;, which would have been wronged in any case by some one else, <foreign lang="greek">u(p'  a)/llwn me/llontas</foreign>, at any rate, even if Gelo (who here represents the <foreign lang="greek">au)toi/</foreign>, the man who takes the initiative) had not done it himself. </p>

In Pindar his name occurs three times, but only as the father of Thero, Ol. II 46, III 9, and of him and Xenocrates, Isthm. II 41. To reconcile Herodotus' statement about him with that of Aristotle here, we may perhaps suppose that Aenesidemus had made himself master of Agrigentum, on the throne of which he was succeeded by his son Thero, before the period to which this story belongs. Aristotle's narrative certainly represents him as a sovereign prince, and not as a mere mercenary in another's service.

					<p>A connected sketch of the contents of the following chapter, a particular account of <foreign lang="greek">e)piei/keia</foreign> or equity, and of the relations of the different kinds of &lsquo;law&rsquo;, will be found in the Introduction, p. 187&mdash;193, and on p. 239 (Appendix E to chap.

					<p>It analyses and classifies actions right and wrong, first from the <hi rend="italic">strictly legal</hi>, and secondly from the <hi rend="italic">equitable</hi> or moral point of view. Equity is the principle of merciful consideration, that indulgent view of men's actions which makes allowance for human infirmities, looks rather to the intention than the act, and thus mitigates or corrects (<foreign lang="greek">e)panorqoi=</foreign>) the strict rigour of the &lsquo;written law&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;I distinguish therefore two kinds of law, the special and the universal; and by special, I mean that which is determined in each people or nation (separately or individually) by themselves, (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> that which has for each class of people or nation its definition directed or referred to themselves,) by their own peculiar habits, customs, feelings, opinions, form of government, and this either unwritten or written&rsquo; (see <pb n="246"/> in explanation of this, Introd.

(I do not myself see why the first <foreign lang="greek">diw/ristai</foreign> need be omitted without manuscript authority.) &lsquo;In respect of the persons to whom it is referred, this division of law is twofold, for the right and wrong, justice and injustice, in acts, are referred to (severally determined by, divided in relation to) either the public, society in general, the whole community (against whom the offence is supposed to be directed), or an individual member of it. And therefore just and unjust acts are divided into two classes, according as they are directed against a single and definite individual, or the community at large. Adultery and assault are injuries or wrongs to the indi<pb n="248"/> viduals, refusal to serve, or desertion, is a wrong to the entire community or nation&rsquo;. This is the basis of the distinction in Attic jurisprudence between the <foreign lang="greek">di/kh</foreign>, the private civil action or suit of man against man, and the <foreign lang="greek">grafh/</foreign>, or public, criminal prosecution; since the latter is a state offence, common to the whole community, a public prosecution may be conducted by <foreign lang="greek">o( boulo/menos</foreign>, &lsquo;any one that pleases&rsquo;, provided, that is, he be a qualified Athenian citizen. See further on this subject, in Introd. I 13, p. 187, and Meier u. Sch&ouml;mann, <hi rend="italic">Der Attische Process</hi>, Bk. III. &sect; 2. Buttmann ad Dem. Med. &sect; 9. </p>
						<p>Accordingly <foreign lang="greek">o( tu/ptwn</foreign> is liable to a <foreign lang="greek">di/kh ai)ki/as; o( mh\ strateuo/menos</foreign>, one that either declines to serve altogether, and so fails in his duty to society and his country, or a deserter, to a <foreign lang="greek">grafh\ a)stratei/as</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">leipotaci/ou. moixei/a</foreign> is here included with <foreign lang="greek">ai)ki/a</foreign> in the class of wrongs that are the subject of a <foreign lang="greek">di/kh</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">di/kh i)di/a</foreign>; under the ordinary classification it exposed the offender to a <foreign lang="greek">grafh/</foreign>, a criminal prosecution, which, as it could be carried on by the husband or one of the near relations, might also properly be called <foreign lang="greek">i)di/a</foreign>. Meier u. Sch&ouml;mann, u. s., p. 163&mdash;4, 327 seq. In this case the state, as well as the husband, considered itself aggrieved as the guardian of public morals. In illustration of this twofold aspect of a crime, Victorius quotes Cic. in Verrem, V (III) 69, 161, <hi rend="italic">quibus in rebus. non solum filio, Verres, sed etiam reipublicae fecisti iniuriam: susceperas enim liberos non solum tibi sed etiam patriae.</hi> </p>

						<p>The introduction of <foreign lang="greek">a)/llous</foreign> here leads to a new distinction: a civil action between parties in their private capacity may be brought either against one or several, as when an action is brought against a club or commercial company or the partners in a firm: in either case the offence which is the subject of it is private and particular, and directed against individuals, and both of them are distinguished from state offences. </p>

This may be called a resumption, or, in a sense, a repetition of the preceding definition, or at all events of the same subject; and this seems to be confirmed by the reference, in the next sentence, to this very definition.

						<p>The distinction of the <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/gramma</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">peri\ o to\ e)pi/gramma</foreign> I have already indicated.

This, if it corresponds to any of the <foreign lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign> when they were regularly classified (on which see Introd. p. 397 seq. in Appendix E to Book III), must be the <foreign lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> of quality, <foreign lang="greek">poio/ths</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">quale:</hi> but it seems certain that in Aristotle's time they had not yet been systematised and arranged under constant technical names. At all events, in this passage in the two last cases it seems that no very clear distinction is made out; or apparently intended, as appears from the mixing up together of the examples of both. Quint. III 6.49, where Aristotle's division of <foreign lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign> is noticed, must be referred, not to this passage, but to Rhet. III 16.6, and 17. 1. </p>

But here <foreign lang="greek">e)perga/sasqai</foreign> must mean to encroach or trespass, otherwise it is no offence: and so the word is used by Aeschines, Ctesiph. &sect; 113, of the Locrians of Amphissa who &lsquo;encroached upon&rsquo; the sacred soil of Crissa, by cultivating, Thucyd. I 139, and elsewhere; as well as <foreign lang="greek">e)pinomi/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)pine/mein</foreign>, for a similar trespass on the pasturage of some one else. The primary sense must be no doubt that of reciprocal right or occupation, the interchange of cultivation. Perhaps the notion of going backwards and forwards over a border to cultivate land may have suggested the notion of trespassing, by extending the original signification to cases where there was no such right existing, or only in the trespasser's imagination. </p>

This however was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &lsquo;said&rsquo; precisely as it is here; <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, laws were divided into universal and special, and then the special subdivided into written (or positive law) and unwritten: and we now learn that the universal law is also unwritten, and that the special branch of the unwritten law, which must now be distinguished from the other, is to be found in that spirit of fairness and mercy and consideration, which consists in an inclination to relax the unnecessary rigour of the written code arising from its own imperfections, and at the same time to make due allowance for human errors and infirmities: all which is contained in the principles of equity, the unwritten law which prescribes such a course of conduct in matters of doubt. I have observed in the Introduction p. 244 that we are probably to extend this subordinate kind of <foreign lang="greek">a)/grafoi no/moi</foreign> so as to include all the prevailing feelings and opinions as to propriety and right and wrong in general which prevail in each <hi rend="italic">special</hi> state (and are therefore a kind of <foreign lang="greek">i)/dios no/mos</foreign>, distinguished from the universal): of which indeed the views and feelings represented by equity form a very considerable part. </p>

						<p>The two kinds of unwritten law are, <hi rend="italic">first</hi> the universal law, the precepts of which suggest higher considerations and higher duties than mere legal obligations to pursue virtue and avoid vice (this is what is meant by the &lsquo;excess, or higher degree, of virtue and vice&rsquo; above the legal standard, expressed in <foreign lang="greek">kaq'  u(perbolh\n a)reth=s kai\ kaki/as</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">quod eximiam virtutem aut vitium inde continet</hi>, Victorius), obedience to which law is rewarded by praise and honour and gifts (the two kinds of rewards; the &lsquo;gifts&rsquo; in this case being conferred of course not for their value as a pecuniary compensation, but in so far as they are signs of moral approbation) and the breach or violation of it punished by (not fine or imprisonment or any personal penalty, as the violation of a <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> enactment, but by) censure, reproach, dishonour (not deprivation of civil rights, which is a <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> penalty): of such precepts examples are, gratitude to benefactors, the return or repayment of obligations (differing from the <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> of gratitude), <pb n="255"/> the inclination and readiness to aid and defend one's friends, and such like. It is remarkable that amongst the precepts of the universal law which we are all bound to obey Aristotle should have here omitted the duty of interring and paying honour to the dead, so strikingly exemplified by the appeal of Antigone against Creon's tyrannous proclamation in the play to which he himself had just called our attention (comp. Eur. Suppl. 16&mdash;19, 526, 538), and still more so perhaps in the trial of the eight generals after Arginusae. </p>

						<p>And not only is the legislator unable to provide for all exceptional cases to general rules, but also the infinity of particular circumstances which distinguish human actions and crimes precludes the possibility of his enumerating in detail all those varieties which in justice should have different degrees of punishment apportioned to them; as for instance, in enacting the prohibition of &lsquo;wounding with an iron instrument&rsquo;, to define the size and the kind of instrument in every case; for life is too short, and would fail a man in the attempt to reckon them all up in detail (on this case, which is given also by Quintilian, VII 6. 8, see Introd. p. 191). </p>

III 2, on involuntary ignorance) and mere misfortunes, <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>, which should be carefully distinguished from actual crimes, and not visited with equal penalties: the latter of the two, accidental misfortunes, are such acts as are sudden and unexpected, or beyond calculation, and do not spring from a vicious habit or evil intention; errors are such as are not accidental, in the sense of unexpected and beyond calculation, and yet do not proceed from vice (in the same sense as before); but crimes are acts that are not without calculation (i.e. deliberate), and are prompted by a vicious habit or inclination, because all wrong acts that are due to desire, proceed from this depraved will and moral judgment&rsquo;.

					<div3 id="b1c14s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The magnitude of a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> varies with the degree of the <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi> that prompts it&rsquo;. There is here the same distinction taken between <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma</foreign>, a wrong done&mdash;an abstract wrong, regarded independently of the motive or intention&mdash;and the confirmed habit (the bad <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign>), depraved will and disposition implied in <foreign lang="greek">a)diki/a</foreign>. The deliberate purpose, <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>, is the measure of moral worth, and distinguishes virtue from vice, Eth. Nic. V 10, 1135 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20, <foreign lang="greek">o(/tan de\ ei)dw\s me\n mh\ probouleu/sas de\</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">pra/tth| tis</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma, oi(=on o(/sa te dia\ qumo\n kai\ a)/lla pa/qh, o(/sa a)nagkai=a h)\ fusika/, sumbai/nei toi=s a)nqrw/pois: tau=ta ga\r bla/ptontes kai\ a(marta/nontes a)dikou=si me/n, kai\ a)dikh/mata/ e)stin, ou) me/ntoi pw a)/dikoi dia\ tau=ta ou)de\ ponhroi/: ou) ga\r dia\ moxqhri/an h( bla/bh: o(/tan d'  e)k proaire/sews, a)/dikos kai\ moxqhro/s</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore (sometimes) the smallest things are greatest&rsquo;, acts apparently most trifling are sometimes indicative of the worst intentions and dispositions, &lsquo;as is exemplified in Callistratus' charge against Melanopus, that he cheated the temple-builders of three consecrated half-obols&rsquo;. Such a charge subjected the offender to a <foreign lang="greek">grafh\ i(erw=n xrhma/twn</foreign>, Dem. de Fals. Leg. &sect; 335 [= p. 435 &sect; 293]. The exact nature of the offence imputed to Melanopus cannot be ascertained: it was probably some fraud (possibly an error construed as a crime,) in the settlement of accounts between himself and the persons charged with the building or restoration of a temple, the <foreign lang="greek">naopoioi/</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The word <foreign lang="greek">naopoioi/</foreign> appears to be an <foreign lang="greek">a(/pac lego/menon</foreign>. Stephens, <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> s. v., gives no other example. On the same analogy are formed <foreign lang="greek">teixopoio/s, mhxanopoio/s, a)galmatopoio/s</foreign>. The office is <hi rend="italic">described</hi> in Pol. VII (VI) 8, 1322 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 19, <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on i(erei=s kai\ e)pimelhtai\ tw=n peri\ ta\ i(era\ tou= sw/zesqai/ te ta\ u(pa/rxonta kai\ a)norqou=sqai ta\ pi/ptonta tw=n oi)kodomhma/twn kai\ tw=n a)/llwn o(/sa te/taktai pro\s tou\s qeou/s</foreign>. The word <foreign lang="greek">i(eropoioi/</foreign>, which follows immediately, in line 24, is referred by Stahr (erroneously however) to this office of curator of sacred buildings, where he translates it &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">tempel-baumeister</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The magnitude of the vice is argued in this case from the trifling amount of the profit; if a man would commit so great a sin as sacrilege for three halfpence, how great must be the depravity of his character and intentions. Melanopus and Callistratus, as Victorius notes, are mentioned together as ambassadors to Thebes by Xenoph., Hellen. VI 2 and 3; and by Plutarch, Vit. Demosth. (p. 851 F), represented as political rivals and opponents. On Callistratus, see note on I 7. 13. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">parelogi/sato</lemma>] This verb has two different applications in conformity with the <hi rend="italic">double</hi> sense of <foreign lang="greek">logi/zesqai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">logismo/s</foreign>; the two senses, though closely connected and often identified, are at all events distinguishable; <pb n="261"/> (1) &lsquo;reasoning&rsquo; and (2) &lsquo;calculation&rsquo;; the <foreign lang="greek">para/</foreign>, which conveys the imputation of <hi rend="italic">fraud</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">para/</foreign>, amiss, awry, <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>), being common to both. Here (as in Dem. c. Aphob. <foreign lang="greek">a/</foreign>, p. 822. 25, where it stands for simple &lsquo;misreckoning&rsquo;, and Isocr. Panath. &sect; 243, for &lsquo;cheating&rsquo;, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">fraudulent</hi> miscalculation&rsquo; in accounts) it has the latter sense. Elsewhere, and <hi rend="italic">usually</hi>, (at all events in Aristotle, as Rhet. I 9. 29, II 23. 3, 25. 10 <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>, III 12. 4, <hi rend="italic">et passim</hi>,) it denotes &lsquo;wrong, fallacious, false, <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi>&rsquo;, a &lsquo;fallacy&rsquo; in argument. Lastly <foreign lang="greek">i(era/</foreign> means &lsquo;consecrated to sacred uses; devoted to the service of <hi rend="italic">the gods</hi> or <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;In the case of justice, the opposite is true&rsquo;. That is, the magnitude or strength of the just and virtuous disposition, inclination, resolution, is shewn, not now in the trifling character of the temptation or motive by which it is led astray, but in the greatness of the temptation which it withstands. &lsquo;Ut qui ingentem vim auri, apud se nullo teste depositam, cum infitiari impune possit, reddidit, iustior sit necesse est quam si idem in exigua pecunia fecit.&rsquo; Victorius. Injustice varies inversely with the magnitude of the profit or advantage to be derived from it, the less the temptation the greater the sin; justice directly, the greater the profit and the consequent temptation to do wrong, the higher the virtue in foregoing it: as, the greater the deposit, the greater the justice in restoring it. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The reason of this&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">to\ ta\ e)la/xista me/gista ei)=nai</foreign>) &lsquo;is, that (the greater crime) is virtually latent (in the less); for one who could steal (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> stole) three half-obols consecrated to religious uses would be capable of any other iniquity whatsoever&rsquo;. The <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, the indefinite latent capacity of vice, is tacitly opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, any possible enormity, to which it may, or may not, be developed. If a man will commit a crime which may be interpreted as sacrilege for such a trifle as three half-obols, he is plainly &lsquo;capable&rsquo; of sacrilege in any degree of atrocity, where the profit and temptation are greater. </p>
						<p>On the subject of <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, physical, moral, and metaphysical, the fundamental and all-pervading antithesis of the Aristotelian Philosophy, a commentary on Rhetoric is not the place to enter. It is explained by Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">Comm. on de Anima</hi>, II 1, <hi rend="italic">Elem. Log. Arist.</hi> &sect; 6, p. 61. <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign> is treated in Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">*q</foreign> 1&mdash;5, and <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, ib. 6&mdash;9, on which consult Bonitz's <hi rend="italic">Commentary.</hi> Grant, <hi rend="italic">Essays on Ethics</hi>, Essay IV, pp. 181&mdash;201, 1st [or 2nd] ed., gives a full and clear account of the relation between them, and the doctrine in general, especially in its application to Moral Philosophy. Aristotle himself nowhere gives a complete and intelligible description of this antithesis and its bearings, but assumes the knowledge of it in all his writings. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now sometimes the degree of crime, the comparative criminality, may be determined in this way; in other cases it is decided, or estimated, by the (actual amount of the) harm or injury done&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">e)k</foreign> &lsquo;from&rsquo;, means <pb n="262"/> that the decision or estimate of the amount of criminality <hi rend="italic">proceeds</hi> or <hi rend="italic">is derived from</hi> the comparison of the injury or consequences resulting from the two acts. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c14s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;And when there is no punishment (in use) equal or adequate (to the offence), but any one (that exists or can be devised) is too slight for it&rsquo;; supply <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma mei=zo/n e)sti</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And where the mischief done is incurable: for it is hard (or grievous), or indeed impossible&rsquo;. To fill up the sense either repeat <foreign lang="greek">i)a=sqai</foreign>, &lsquo;to find any adequate remedy or compensation&rsquo;; or, from <foreign lang="greek">ou(= mh\ i)/sh timwri/a</foreign>, &lsquo;to devise any adequate punishment&rsquo;. Otherwise it may be supposed (though it is unnecessary) that Aristotle wrote <foreign lang="greek">a)du/naton</foreign>, having <foreign lang="greek">a)mh/xanon</foreign> or some similar adjective in his mind, meaning &lsquo;a helpless, hopeless, irremediable&rsquo; case. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again crimes for which no legal redress is to be obtained by the injured party: for such a wrong is incurable: because &lsquo;justice&rsquo; (trial and sentence) and punishment are so many <hi rend="italic">remedies</hi>&rsquo;. On this doctrine of punishment, and the difference between <foreign lang="greek">ko/lasis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">timwri/a</foreign>, see above I 10. 17, and Introd. p. 232. Cf. Ar. Eth.

						<p>&lsquo;And if (in consequence of the wrong done) the sufferer and the victim of the wrong inflicted some heavy punishment on himself; for the perpetrator of the act deserves a still severer punishment (than that which he thus unintentionally brought upon his victim): as Sophocles, in pleading the cause of Euctemon&mdash;after he had killed himself in consequence of the outrage he had sustained&mdash;said that he would not lay the penalty at a less amount than the sufferer had estimated it at for himself&rsquo;, i. e. Euctemon by his suicide had virtually fixed the penalty of the offence at death. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*sofoklh=s</lemma>] Not the poet, but a statesman and orator advanced in life at the close of the Peloponnesian war. He was one of the ten <foreign lang="greek">pro/bouloi</foreign>, Rhet. III 18. 6, appointed by the Athenians, after the Sicilian disaster in 413 B.C., to devise measures for the public safety, Thuc. VIII I, Grote's <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> Pt. II, ch. 61, Vol. VII, p. 499, and note: and afterwards one of the thirty tyrants, Xen. Hellen. II 3. 2. This Sophocles is doubtless the same who is again mentioned, Rhet. III 15. 3. He is there described as an old man, which agrees with the statement of Thucydides, u. s., that the <foreign lang="greek">pro/bouloi</foreign> were an <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh\ presbute/rwn a)ndrw=n</foreign>; and the &lsquo;charge&rsquo; brought against him (Rhet. l. c.) was probably connected with his conduct as a member of &lsquo;the thirty&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">timh/sein, e)ti/mhsen</lemma>] In all causes civil as well as criminal which could be brought before an Athenian law-court, one point to be considered in the judgment was the <foreign lang="greek">ti/mhma</foreign> or estimate, assessment, either of the kind or amount of the penalty in criminal prosecutions, or of the damages in civil actions. This gives rise to the division of all legal processes into <foreign lang="greek">a)gw=nes a)ti/mhtoi</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">timhtoi/</foreign>. In the former of these the penalty and damages are already fixed by law or by previous private arrangement (C. R. Kennedy), and are therefore &lsquo;unassessable&rsquo; by the judges; in the <foreign lang="greek">timhtoi\ a)gw=nes</foreign> of all kinds, the amount of the damages or penalty to be awarded is at the discretion of the judges, who <foreign lang="greek">timw=sin</foreign>, estimate, assess, or fix the amount. This is the explanation of Harpocration, and Ulpian, followed by Meier &amp; Sch&ouml;mann, <hi rend="italic">Attischer Process</hi>, p. 171 note, B&ouml;ckh <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ.</hi> Bk. III, c. 11 (p. 371 Engl. Transl.), and Hermann <hi rend="italic">Pol. Antiq.</hi> &sect; 143. 7&mdash;12. Suidas, and other ancient writers, invert this distinction, and make <foreign lang="greek">timhtoi\ a)gw=nes</foreign> the cases in which the penalty is already fixed, and <foreign lang="greek">a)ti/mhtoi</foreign> those in which it is open to adjudication. See Meier &amp; Sch&ouml;mann, u. s., p. 171 note. </p>
						<p>On the whole subject see Meier &amp; Sch&ouml;mann u. s. et seq. and Mr C. R. Kennedy's article in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. Antiq.</hi> p. 970 (1st ed.) [p. 1131, 2nd ed. and cf. note on Dem. <hi rend="italic">Select Private Orations</hi>, Part II, Or. 55 &sect; 18. S.] </p>
						<p>The accuser in a criminal process, where the penalty was not already fixed by law, himself in the first instance assessed its amount, which the judges confirmed or not as they thought proper. The first was called <foreign lang="greek">tima=sqai</foreign>, the second <foreign lang="greek">tima=n</foreign>, in accordance with the usual distinction of the active and middle voice, as marking by their contrasted significations the functions of the judge and the parties in the case, <foreign lang="greek">dika/zein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">dika/zesqai, kri/nein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">kri/nesqai</foreign>, &amp;c.; the one administering justice and deciding the question, whilst the others &lsquo;get this done for them&rsquo; by the intervention of another. Aristotle has here neglected this ordinary distinction, for reasons best known to himself. As far as the phrase <foreign lang="greek">o( paqw\n e)ti/mhsen</foreign> <pb n="264"/> is concerned, the reason might be, that the accuser is supposed to represent the estimate by the deceased of his own wrongs as of equal authority with a judicial decision: but this will not apply to <foreign lang="greek">timh/sein</foreign>, Sophocles' own estimate. At the same time as <foreign lang="greek">tima=n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ti/mhma</foreign> may denote an &lsquo;estimate&rsquo; in general, the use of the verb here must be regarded rather as a departure from ordinary usage, than as a solecism, or violation of the laws of the language. </p>
						<p>On the <foreign lang="greek">sunh/goroi</foreign>, see Schneider's note on Pol. VI 5. 10, vol. II, p. 391, and <hi rend="italic">addenda</hi>, pp. 502&mdash;4. <foreign lang="greek">sunhgorw=n</foreign> here is not technical: there is no reason to suppose that it denotes one of the public <foreign lang="greek">sunh/goroi</foreign>, appointed by the state. </p>
						<p>Lastly, the entire topic, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ei) o( paqw/n&mdash;e)ti/mhsen</foreign>, is thus illustrated by Schrader: &lsquo;Sexti Tarquinii flagitium ideo maius est, quod illius foeditate inducta Lucretia sibi ipsi vim intulit. (This is suggested by Victorius.) Et Appii Claudii decemviri sceleratum de L. Virginii filia iudicium eo sceleratius est, quoniam pater illo commotus filiam interfecit (Liv. III 48).&rsquo; </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b1c14s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;And any crime that is unique, or the first of its class (that has been committed), or has been seldom paralleled&rsquo;. These three cases of especial prominence have been already applied to acts as topics of praise, I. 9. 38. See in illustration the references there given. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the frequent commission of the same offence magnifies it&rsquo;: because this shews the depraved <hi rend="italic">habit</hi>, or confirmed state, the <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> which constitutes vice. &lsquo;Nec enim is casu aut affectu, sed habitu et pravitate animi, delinquit.&rsquo; Schrader. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And any crime for which any checks and preventives or penalties have been sought and found (invented or discovered), as, for instance, at Argos a penalty is incurred by any one on whose account a law has been enacted (i.e. one of the <foreign lang="greek">&lt;*&gt;wlutikoi/</foreign>, or (if I may coin a word for the occasion)  <foreign lang="greek">zhmiwtikoi/, no/moi</foreign>), or on whose account the prison was built&rsquo;: supply <foreign lang="greek">e)zhmiw/qhsan</foreign>. This same topic has been already employed in the opposite sense, to heighten the praise due to an action, c. 9 &sect; 38. Schrader quotes in illustration Lysias, Or. XXII &sect; 16 (<foreign lang="greek">kata\ tw=n sitopw/lwn</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw de\ pa/lai peri\ th=s tou/twn panourgi/as kai\ kakonoi/as h( po/lis e)/gnwken, w(/st'  e)pi\ me\n toi=s a)/llois w)ni/ois a(/pasi tou\s a)gorano/mous fu/lakas katesth/sate, e)pi\ de\ tau/th| mo/nh| th=| te/xnh| xwri\s sitofu/lakas a)poklhrou=te</foreign>; the appointment of a special board of officers for the control of the corn-market signalizes the special rascality of the dealers. </p>

					<div3 id="b1c14s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;And the more brutal the crime is, the worse&rsquo;; that is, the nearer approach it makes to the conduct and instincts of a mere animal or brute, who is incapable of virtue and self-control; and the more cruel, savage, &lsquo;inhuman&rsquo; it is, more degraded below the level of humanity. </p>
						<p>There are three degrees in the scale of natures, moral and intellectual, (1) the beast, (2) the man, and (3) the god. Thus, Pol. I 2, 1253 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27, it is <pb n="265"/> said of a man that is incapable of society, or is in want of nothing, being all-sufficient to himself, that he is <foreign lang="greek">h)\ qhri/on h)\ qeo/s</foreign>: in respect of this complete independence he is either below or above all the various wants, instincts, affections, desires, aims, and aspirations that characterize humanity. Precisely the same view appears in the little disquisition on <foreign lang="greek">qhrio/ths</foreign> at the opening of Book VII of the Nicom. Ethics, except that here the distinction between the three natures is made to rest solely upon intellectual and moral virtue: this is human, whereas the beast and the god are alike incapable of it, the beast, from the defects already stated, being below the human standard, the gods above it. </p>
						<p>On this superiority of the gods to the practice of moral or human virtue and their entire independence of it, see Eth. Nic. X 8. A fine fragment of Cicero's lost dialogue <hi rend="italic">de Philosophia sive Hortensius</hi>, quoted by Augustine, <hi rend="italic">de Trinitate</hi> XIV c. 9, is manifestly borrowed, not translated, from this passage of Aristotle. It is printed in Nobbe's edition of Cicero, p. 1171, fragm. 35. </p>
						<p>Here therefore &lsquo;brutality&rsquo; consists in the absence of all capacity for virtue, moral and intellectual, and is consequently opposed to <foreign lang="greek">th\n u(pe\r h(ma=s a)reth/n, h(rwikh/n tina kai\ qei/an</foreign>. This brutal nature, like the divine, is extremely rate amongst mankind. (This statement is qualified in Pol. III 11, 1281 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 19, <foreign lang="greek">kai/toi ti/ diafe/rousin e)/nioi tw=n qhri/wn w(s e)/pos ei)pei=n; a)lla\ peri/ ti plh=qos ou)de\n ei)=nai a)lhqe\s kwlu/ei to\ lexqe/n</foreign>). It is found chiefly in &lsquo;barbarians&rsquo;. &lsquo;Barbarous&rsquo; and &lsquo;barbarity&rsquo; in fact express pretty nearly the same notion of character.) Again, the absence of all moderation in the indulgence of our desires and emotions and general want of selfcontrol is characteristic of the &lsquo;brutal&rsquo; nature; lb. c. 6, 1148 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34, <foreign lang="greek">to\ me\n ou)=n e)/xein e(/kasta tou/twn e)/cw tw=n o(/rwn e)sti\ th=s kaki/as, kaqa/per kai\ h( qhrio/ths</foreign>.

Finally, the instinctive <foreign lang="greek">o)re/ceis</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign>) belong to this animal part of our nature, and are therefore not always under our control; Pol. III 16, 1267 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 28; where the divine part of our nature, the controlling, regulating, intelligent <foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign>, is contrasted with the lower instincts of the brute elements of our nature, the emotional and appetitive. <pb n="266"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And when it arises from or is due to malice aforethought&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">pronoi/a</foreign> is the &lsquo;forethought&rsquo;, the <hi rend="italic">deliberate</hi> vicious <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> which constitutes &lsquo;malice prepense&rsquo;, aggravates a wrong act in proportion to its intensity and the length of time during which the evil intent has been nursed; and converts an act otherwise innocent into a crime. The <foreign lang="greek">pronoi/a</foreign> is that which distinguishes murder from homicide. It is in fact the moral <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>, distinctive of vice and virtue, of which an account has been already given in the first note on this chapter. See the passage of Eth. Nic. V 10, there quoted. Comp. Rhet. I 13. 10. There <foreign lang="greek">e)k pronoi/as</foreign> is identified with the (in Ethics) more ordinary <foreign lang="greek">e)k proaire/sews. o(/tan de\ e)k proaire/sews</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">h( bla/bh</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">a)/dikos kai\ moxqhro/s. dio\ kalw=s ta\ e)k qumou=</foreign> (actions which are done in a state of violent excitement, under the impulse of overpowering passion, are considered as involuntary, and exempted from the penalty of crimes) <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)k pronoi/as kri/netai</foreign>. The case quoted by Schrader from Magna Moralia I 17, of a woman who had caused the death of her lover by a love-potion which she had sent him only with the view of inflaming his passion, and was consequently acquitted by the court of Areopagus on the charge of murder, because the act was done without deliberate malevolent intent, is a case of <foreign lang="greek">a(ma/rthma</foreign> (one of those in which the wrong done does not amount to a crime), in which the mischief is done without due knowledge of the circumstances of the case. In Demosth. c. Aristocr. p. 634, there is a similar distinction between two kinds of <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrofoni/a</foreign>: in one sense the name is applied <foreign lang="greek">e)p'  a)kousi/w| fo/nw|</foreign>, and to acts of this kind &lsquo;a wise and humane law&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">no/mos a)nqrwpi/nws kai\ kalw=s kei/menos</foreign>, does not apply the name of murder; from this are immediately afterwards distinguished <foreign lang="greek">oi( e)k pronoi/as</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">foneu/santes</foreign>). Aeschines c. Ctesiph. &sect; 212, <foreign lang="greek">ei)/lhfe trau/matos e)k pronoi/as grafa\s grafo/menos</foreign>. Dinarch. c. Demosth. &sect; 6, <foreign lang="greek">tw=n e)k pronoi/as fo/nwn</foreign>. Compare Cic. de Off. I 8, sub fin. <hi rend="italic">Sed in omni iniustitia permultum interest utrum perturbatione aliqua animi, quae plerumque brevis est et ad tempus, an consulto et cogitata fiat iniuria. Leviora enim sunt quae repentino aliquo motu accidunt quam ea quae meditata ac praeparata inferuntur.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And any act, or wrong done, which inspires the hearers rather with terror than compassion&rsquo;. An act which tends to consequences which inspire terror, the stronger emotion, in those who may be exposed to the like treatment, must plainly be more striking in its character and important in its social effects, more noxious and prejudicial, and worse in general, than one which excites mere pity or sympathy with the sufferer, without raising alarm on account of what may follow to oneself. That which excites terror must be terrible; formidable and dangerous to the individual or society. An atrocious crime makes men tremble, and fear expels pity; the stronger emotion overpowers the weaker. Comp. Rhet. II 8. 5 and 12, &lsquo;Amasis shed no tears when he saw his son led away to <pb n="267"/> death, but wept when his friends asked an alms&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">tou=to me\n ga\r e)leeino/n, e)kei=no de\ deino/n: to\ ga\r deino\n e(/teron tou= e)leeinou= kai\ e)kkroustiko\n tou= e)le/ou kai\ polla/kis tw=| e)nanti/w| xrh/simon</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;And the rhetorical artifices or exaggerations&rsquo; (such as <foreign lang="greek">au)ch/seis, deinw/seis</foreign>, rhetorical tricks for giving extra importance and interest to a subject; or for magnifying, exaggerating, intensifying the atrocity, enormity, of a crime), &lsquo;for instance, that the accused (whose crime you desire to magnify) has subverted many principles (or obligations) of justice at once, or transgressed them; for instance, oaths, the right hand (pledge of faith, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ deciai\ h(=|s e)pe/piqmen</foreign>, Il. B 341), &lsquo;all confidence or good faith, all the laws of intermarriage, and the rest; for this is an excess of many crimes over the one which has really been committed&rsquo;; or &lsquo;a multiplication of one crime into many&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The exaggeration of this rhetorical fallacy lies in the enumeration, and apparent accumulation, of offences by division of the single offence into its parts, or the repetition&mdash;as in the instance&mdash;of the same offence under different names, which seems thus to swell its bulk and magnify its enormity. This is the reverse application of the same rhetorical artifice of exaggeration as has been already referred to in I 7. 31 (see note), the methods of <foreign lang="greek">diai/resis ei)s ta\ me/rh, suntiqe/nai</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">e)poikodomei=n</foreign> applied to the &lsquo;amplification&rsquo; of good things; the object and use of them being stated in nearly the same words, <foreign lang="greek">pleio/nwn ga\r u(pere/xein fai/netai</foreign>. </p>

The sanctity of the place converts theft into sacrilege.

						<p>&lsquo;Another aggravation of an offence is, where it is attended by disgrace (to the victim); and this in proportion to its amount (<foreign lang="greek">ma/lista</foreign>)&rsquo;. This, together with the wantonness, the unprovoked character of the aggression, is what converts a mere assault, <foreign lang="greek">ai)ki/a</foreign>, into an act of <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, a wanton outrage. See Rhet. II 2. 5, definition of <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, and I 13. 10; also note on I 12. 26, p. 239. The wound inflicted on a man's pride and sense of dignity, the injury to his feelings and honour, constitute a great aggravation of the offence. <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> is, <foreign lang="greek">to\ bla/ptein kai\ lupei=n e)f'  oi(=s ai)sxu/nh e)sti\ tw=| pa/sxonti k.t.l.</foreign> In II 6. 2, <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</foreign> is defined, <foreign lang="greek">lu/ph tis h)\ taraxh\ peri\ ta\ ei)s a)doci/an faino/mena fe/rein tw=n kakw=n h)\ paro/ntwn h)\ gegono/twn h mello/ntwn...e)pi\ toi=s toiou/tois tw=n kakw=n o(/sa ai)sxra\ dokei= ei)=nai h)\ au)tw=| h)\ w(=n fronti/zei</foreign>. </p>

					<p>The general sense and connexion of the contents of this chapter upon the <foreign lang="greek">a)/texnoi pi/steis</foreign> of the practice of Rhetoric, those adjuncts of proof and external supports of the case, which consist in the various kinds of evidence which can be adduced by the pleader in confirmation of his statements and arguments, have been already given in the Introduction to this Commentary, pp. 193&mdash;207, to which I now refer and which I need not here repeat. They are called &lsquo;unartistic&rsquo; or &lsquo;inartificial&rsquo; because they are not due to the artist's inventive skill, but are supplied to him from the outside, as it were, of his art; and all that he has to do is to use them to the best advantage.

						<p>the father of Critias being Solon's brother, Dropides. These verses, which were probably intended by the author as a compliment to the father, are misconstrued by the malicious Cleophon into a reflection on the son, whose recklessness and licentiousness had brought upon him his father's displeasure: the authority of Solon is appealed to to shew that the grandson inherited his grandfather's vices. Whether <foreign lang="greek">pur)r(o/trixi</foreign> is another malicious perversion of Cleophon, on the hypothesis that red hair implies a licentious disposition, or depravity in general&mdash;as seems to have been the opinion of the Normans, who had the proverb, <hi rend="italic">entre poil roux et f&eacute;lonie s'entreportent grant compagnie</hi>, (Wace, <hi rend="italic">Roman de Rou</hi>, quoted by Sir F. Palgrave, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Norm.</hi> II 721)&mdash;or Aristotle, quoting from memory, has <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>quoted, <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi>, cannot now be ascertained. At all events it is unlikely that <hi rend="italic">Solon</hi> intended any such imputation on Critias' character, whatever may have been the case with Cleophon; for <pb n="277"/> Critias is evidently considered as a boy or very young man from the tone of the address or message, and Victorius shews from Theocr. Id. VIII. 3, <foreign lang="greek">a)/mfw tw/g'  h)/thn pur)r(otri/xw, a)/mfw a)na/bw</foreign>, that red hair in a boy in the eyes of the Greeks was a beauty and not a deformity. It seems to me that Solon wrote <foreign lang="greek">canqo/trixi</foreign>, as Proclus gives it, and that the other reading is due either to Cleophon's malice if we interpret it <hi rend="italic">in deterius</hi>, or to Aristotle's want of memory, if we take it as synonymous with <foreign lang="greek">canqo/trixi</foreign>. The evidence of Critias' <foreign lang="greek">a)se/lgeia</foreign> derived from the verses is plainly a false inference of Cleophon and not really contained in the original: the statement in Plat. Charm. 157 E, that Solon wrote Elegies in praise of &lsquo;the house of Critias&rsquo;, and spoke of its members as &lsquo;distinguished by personal beauty and virtue and all other so-called happiness&rsquo;, is altogether against any such supposition. Victorius, who regards the inference drawn by Cleophon as justified by the language of the verses, endeavours to reconcile this with the eulogistic character of the elegy, by the remark that Critias may have been an exception to the general good character of his family. Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Poet. Lyr. Gr.</hi> p. 331, follows Proclus' version. The other variation, <foreign lang="greek">ei)pei=n moi</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ei)pe/menai</foreign>, may be either another slip of Aristotle's memory, or <foreign lang="greek">ei)pei=n moi</foreign> a mere false reading of <foreign lang="greek">ei)pe/menai</foreign>, the one being very easily mistaken for the other. </p>
						<p>Lastly, <foreign lang="greek">moi/</foreign>, if it were retained, would be a good example of the <hi rend="italic">dativus ethicus</hi> corresponding in Greek to the familiar use of &lsquo;me&rsquo; in the earlier English writers: as Shakespeare, Rob me the treasury; He smiled me in the face (Dame Quickly of Falstaff); See how this river comes me cranking in (Hotspur).

						<p>&lsquo;On the subject of contracts, arguments may be so far employed as to magnify or reduce (pull down, met. extenuate, depreciate, disparage (their value and importance), or (in other words) confirm or destroy their credit (or trustworthiness); if we have them (to produce) (<foreign lang="greek">xrh=si/s e)sti poiei=n</foreign>) we must argue for their credit and validity (<foreign lang="greek">kuri/as</foreign>, their <hi rend="italic">authoritative</hi> character); in the case of (if they <hi rend="italic">apply to</hi>, are on the side of) the opposite party, the reverse&rsquo;. </p>

					<div3 id="b1c15s21" type="section" n="21">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kataskeua/zein</lemma>] is a technical term of dialectics, denoting the constructive process and object of argumentation or syllogism, viz. to establish some <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> conclusion, to maintain or confirm a thesis; and opposed to <foreign lang="greek">a)naskeua/zein</foreign>, which represents the &lsquo;subversive&rsquo;, &lsquo;destructive&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">a)naskeua/zein</foreign> &lsquo;to undo&rsquo;, comp. <foreign lang="greek">lu/ein</foreign> &lsquo;to break up, or dissolve a thing into its elements&rsquo;), &lsquo;refutative&rsquo; syllogism or reasoning which proves a negative. On these terms see further in Introd. p. 268, and note (on p. 267) on the same page. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now in regard of establishing their credit or discrediting them, the treatment of this in no respect differs from that of the witnesses; for according to the character of those whose names are attached to, subscribed to, (inscribed <hi rend="italic">upon</hi>, as <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/gramma</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">title</hi> of a crime or a legal prosecution, I 13. 9,) the document, or contract, or who have it in their keeping, the measure (degree) of credit or trustworthiness of the contract is determined (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> by them are the contracts made trustworthy)&rsquo;. <pb n="282"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/tois pistai/</lemma>] is a somewhat irregular expression, meaning <foreign lang="greek">tosou/tw| pistote/rai ei)si\n ai( sunqh=kai</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">toiau=tai kai\ ai( sunqh=kai tw=| pistai\ ei)=nai</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The degree of integrity of those who have the document in their custody is a measure of the probability of its having been tampered with or not. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The existence of the contract being admitted, if the document be our own (&sect; 26), we must <hi rend="italic">magnify</hi> it (cry it up; <hi rend="italic">increase</hi>, exaggerate, its value and importance); for the contract (we may say) is a law, special and partial; and it is not the contracts that give authority, or validity, to the law, but the laws to the contracts which are made in conformity with them (legally)&rsquo;. Either of these arguments may be urged to shew that a covenant has the sanction of law, and shares its authority. &lsquo;And, speaking generally, the law itself is a kind of contract, and therefore any one who violates (disobeys) the provisions (understand <foreign lang="greek">sunqh/kh|</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">a)pistei=</foreign>) of a contract or makes away with it, is in fact subverting, doing away with, the laws&rsquo;. This doctrine has already been stated in other words, c. 13. 2, <foreign lang="greek">no/mon...i)/dion me\n to\n e(ka/stois w(risme/non pro\s au(tou/s</foreign>. This is therefore the positive, written, local or national law, varying in different societies, and enacted by each of them severally for mutual convenience, under an implied contract to observe and maintain them. </p>
						<p>Analogous to this view of law as a contract is the theory, in Politics, of the <hi rend="italic">Social Contract</hi>, which has been maintained by Locke, Rousseau, and many others. This view of the origin of the social organization and of government, is founded upon the natural freedom and equality of men; and assumes a common agreement amongst the members of a state to live and act together for purposes of self-defence and mutual advantage in obedience to laws and an executive authority which the theory supposes to have emanated originally from themselves, and to be invalid without their consent. Similar to this are the &lsquo;laws of war&rsquo;, which give the conqueror certain rights over the conquered, amongst them that of enslaving, and result from a sort of international compact, or universal agreement.

						<p>On the passage which in MS A^{c} concludes this section, and is printed in the note of the Oxford reprint of Bekker's 1st ed., see in Introd. p. 201, and the note. It is omitted by Bekker. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">On the Rhetoric</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Bav. Trans.</hi> 1851, p. 51, thinks that it is an extract from some other treatise on Rhetoric, introduced by the transcribers. The last sentence at all events must be corrupt, being as it stands devoid of meaning and connexion with the preceding. Brandis in his tract in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi>, IV i. p. 43, informs us that his Anonymous Annotator found the passage in the MSS that he used, though he thinks that Victorius was right in rejecting it as an interpolation. Victorius, a man whose judgment is to be relied on, writes thus. &lsquo;Delevi autem quia adulterinos putavi; aut enim ex alio scriptore artis haec pars sumta est (<hi rend="italic">so Spengel</hi>), aut Scholion olim fuit quod importune post in contextum verborum Aristotelis translatum sit;...Qui accurate quae supra a philosopho iam tradita erant perpendit ipsius haec non esse manifesto intelligit; cuncta enim ille quae ad quaestiones pertinentia dicere voluerat iam explicaverat; sententia vero quae his viribus exponitur superioribus continetur; vox etiam iuncta illic est quae sermonem Aristotelis non redolet, viz. <foreign lang="greek">liqo/dermos</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">this applies still more strongly to</hi> <foreign lang="greek">kataqar)r(ei=n</foreign>); et omnis denique haec locutio, e. c. <foreign lang="greek">tai=s yuxai=s o)/ntes dunatoi/</foreign>, locutionis Aristotelicae dissimilis videtur&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nti\ xrhma/twn</lemma>] is, setting a pecuniary value upon the oath (estimating it <hi rend="italic">against</hi> money, at so much money value), which is degrading to the dignity and sanctity of the oath, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> it is that you refuse to take it, and not from any baser motive. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">katwmo/sato] katomnu/nai</lemma> (<foreign lang="greek">o(/rkon</foreign>) occurs in Arist.

The middle voice is found again in Herod. VI 65, but in a different sense &lsquo;to swear against&rsquo;, with a genitive following. Here, and in the two other cases quoted above, the <foreign lang="greek">kata/</foreign> seems to have an intensive force, expressing the &lsquo;binding force&rsquo; of an oath. This sense of <foreign lang="greek">kata/</foreign> comes from the original, physical, notion of &lsquo;keeping <hi rend="italic">down</hi>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>For the interpretation of this obscure topic, see Introd. p. 203.

(with full stop instead of colon). There is a considerably closer connexion between the two clauses which he separates by a full stop, than there is between the two which are divided only by a colon. </p>
						<p>The intention of the topic is to shew the purity and disinterestedness of the speaker's motives in refusing to take the oath. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ to\ tou= *cenofa/nous</lemma>] Xenophanes of Colophon, the founder of the Eleatic school of Philosophy (Plat. Soph. 242 D, <foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ par) h(mi=n *)eleatiko\n e&lt;*&gt;qnos, a)po\ *cenofa/nous...a)rca/menon</foreign>)&mdash;of which Parmenides his follower was the most distinguished representative, who converted the theological conception of universal being, represented by Xenophanes as God, into the metaphysical conception of the Universe as One,  <foreign lang="greek">e(\n to\ o)/n</foreign>&mdash; appears to have conveyed his philosophical doctrines in hexameter verse, an example subsequently followed by Parmenides and Empedocles. He also wrote elegies and iambics, the latter directed against Homer and Hesiod, whose manner of speaking about the Gods he disapproved, Diog. Laert. IX 2. 18. The verse quoted <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is a trochaic tetrameter; on which Mullach remarks, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Phil. Gr.</hi> Xenoph. Fr. 25, p. 106, note, &lsquo;cuius versiculi hiatus in voce <foreign lang="greek">au(/th</foreign> caesurae excusationem habet, prima autem syllaba in <foreign lang="greek">a)sebei=</foreign> producitur ad aliorum nominum velut <foreign lang="greek">a)qa/natos</foreign> similitudinem&rsquo;. So Karsten, <hi rend="italic">Xenophanes</hi>, p. 79. The work which contained this verse is unknown. Mullach and Karsten agree in the opinion that this verse is all that belongs to Xenophanes in Aristotle's reference; the succeeding illustration is his own. All that is repeated in the converse of Xenophanes' maxim, &sect; 30, is what is contained in the verse itself. I have no doubt they are right. On Xenophanes and his philosophy, besides the two works already referred to, which contain collections of the surviving fragments, see the histories of Greek Philosophy, by Brandis, Zeller, Ritter, Butler, with Dr Thompson's notes and the rest; also Grote's Plato, Vol. I. pp. 16&mdash;19. <pb n="289"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ll'  o(moi/a kai\ ei)</lemma>] In this illustration of Xenophanes' dictum, the parallel case proposed by Aristotle, the strong man is the unscrupulous or godless man, who is ready to swear anything, true or false; he has the same advantage over the scrupulous, godfearing man, in a challenge to swear, as the strong man would have over the weak in a challenge to fight. </p>

As supplementary and auxiliary to the direct logical arguments this indirect ethical mode of persuasion is indispensable to the success of the speech. People are hardly likely to be convinced by a speaker who sets them against him. </p>
					<p>On the order of the subjects of the work in general, and the connexion of the contents of this Chapter, I refer as before to the Introduction [p. 245]. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c1s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)k ti/nwn...tau=t'  e)sti/n</lemma>] This is a confusion of two constructions: the grammar requires either <foreign lang="greek">e)k ti/nwn ei)/rhtai</foreign> (or something similar), or else <foreign lang="greek">e)c w(=n tau=t'  e)sti/</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">poi=ai</foreign> in the second clause shews that the first of the two was the one predominant in the writer's mind, which is carelessly varied at the end. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">do/cai kai\ prota/seis</lemma>] These two are in fact the same. The current popular opinions are converted by the artist into premisses of rhetorical enthymemes. They are united again, c. 18 &sect; 2, comp. Topic. A 10, 104 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">ei)si\ de\ prota/seis dialektikai\ kai\ ta\ toi=s e)ndo/cois o(/moia...kai\ o(/sai do/cai kata\ te/xnas ei)si\ ta\s eu(rhme/nas</foreign>.

He sets the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> above the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> in point of its importance and value to the orator as a means of persuasion; Aristotle, admitting this in forensic speaking, takes the opposite view in the deliberative kind; &sect; 4<note anchored="yes">The reason of this is, that when a man has to recommend or dissuade a certain course of action, his character and the opinion entertained of it must give great weight to his advice: and it is not in the law-court, but in public life, in quelling the seditious riot, that Virgil's <hi rend="italic">vir pietate gravis ac meritis</hi> (in the famous simile, Aen.

						<p>A valuable commentary on this explanation of the cause of anger, the coincidence between the two being manifestly accidental, is to be found in Prof. Bain's work on <hi rend="italic">The Emotions and the Will</hi>, p. 166, ch. ix. &sect; 3, on the &lsquo;irascible emotion&rsquo;. &ldquo;These two facts both pertain,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to the nature of true anger, the discomposure of mind from the circumstance of <pb n="11"/> another man's intention in working evil against us, and the cure of this discomposure by the submission or suffering of the agent.&rdquo; I will only add one remark upon this interesting subject; that when Aristotle assigns <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign>, the contempt and indifference to our feelings and sense of personal dignity implied in the notion of &lsquo;slight&rsquo;, as the main cause of the emotion of anger, he is thinking only of the angry passion as excited against a fellow man. Yet we are angry with a dog that bites, or a cat that scratches us<note anchored="yes">On the manner in which anger vents itself upon all sorts of objects indiscriminately, see Plut. de cohibenda ira, p. 455 D, <foreign lang="greek">qumw=| d'  a)/qikton ou)de\n ou)d) a)nepixei/rhton: a)ll) o)rgizo/meqa kai\ polemi/ois kai\ fi/lois kai\ te/knois kai\ goneu=si, kai\ qeoi=s nh\ *di/a, kai\ qhri/ois, kai\ a)yu/xois skeu/esi</foreign>, which is further illustrated by some examples.</note>, and here there cannot in all cases be any sense of undeserved contempt or indifference to provoke the angry feeling; though perhaps sometimes it may be increased by such an act of aggression, if the animal happen to be a pet or favourite, in which case we may extend (by analogy) human feelings to the brute, comparing him unconsciously with a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> who has injured us, and forgetting the intellectual and moral differences of the two, which aggravate the offence in the <hi rend="italic">human</hi> subject.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou= o)ligwrei=n mh\ prosh/kontos</lemma><note anchored="yes" n="2">This appears likewise in the Stoic definition quoted above. I believe it has not hitherto been noticed that the four terms usually employed in Greek to express the notion of duty or obligation may be distinguished as implying four different sources of obligation, and represent appeals to four different principles by which our actions are guided. The four are <foreign lang="greek">prosh/kei, dei=, xrh/, pre/pei</foreign>. The first, <foreign lang="greek">to\ prosh=kon</foreign>, expresses a natural connexion or relationship, and hence a law of <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, the prescriptions of <foreign lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign>; as <foreign lang="greek">oi( prosh/kontes</foreign> are our <hi rend="italic">natural relations.</hi> This, therefore, is the form of obligation that nature imposes upon us, or natural propriety. The second, <foreign lang="greek">dei=</foreign>, is of course connected with <foreign lang="greek">dei=n</foreign>, &lsquo;to bind&rsquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">desmo/s</foreign>, and denotes the &lsquo;binding nature of an ob-<hi rend="italic">ligation</hi>&rsquo;, which is equally suggested by the Lat. ob<hi rend="italic">ligatio.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">to\ de/on</foreign> is therefore the <hi rend="italic">moral bond</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">binding</hi> engagement, by which we are <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to do what is right. The third, <foreign lang="greek">xrh/, to\ xrew/n</foreign>, appeals to the principle of utility or expediency, <foreign lang="greek">xrh=sqai, xrei/a</foreign>, by which human conduct is directed as a principle of action, and accordingly expresses the obligation of a man's duty to himself, and the necessary regard for his own interest which the law of self-preservation requires. Besides these, we have <foreign lang="greek">pre/pei, to\ pre/pon</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">decorum, quod decet</hi>, Cic. de Off. 1. 27, <hi rend="italic">quod</hi> aptum <hi rend="italic">est in omni vita;</hi> the befitting, the becoming; which represents the general notion of <hi rend="italic">fitness</hi> or <hi rend="italic">propriety:</hi> that principle of <foreign lang="greek">a(rmoni/a</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">kosmio/ths</foreign> (and the <foreign lang="greek">ko/smos</foreign>), of harmony and adaptation, which Dr Clarke selected as the basis of all morality, and styled &lsquo;the fitness of things&rsquo;. Our English words <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> and <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, expressive of moral obligation in general, are both of them borrowed from the notion of &lsquo;a debt,&rsquo; which is &lsquo;owed&rsquo; in the one case, and &lsquo;due&rsquo; from us in the other, to our neighbour; comp. <foreign lang="greek">o)fei/lein, w)/felon</foreign>. &ldquo;Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.&rdquo;</note>, the last term of the definition, adds to <pb n="12"/> the offence at the slight which provokes anger the consciousness or feeling that the slight is something which is not our <hi rend="italic">due:</hi> by a slight the sense of personal dignity is offended: we know that we do not deserve it, and are the more enraged. This is a necessary qualification&mdash;a <foreign lang="greek">sumbebhko\s kaq'  au(to/</foreign>, and therefore added to the <hi rend="italic">definition</hi>&mdash;because there may be cases in which an insult or injury arouses no angry feeling, when the person insulted is very far inferior in rank and condition to the offender or of a very abject and submissive temper, or if the power of the aggressor is so great and imposing, that the injured person is terrified and daunted instead of angry, II 3. 10. So at least Aristotle: but I am more inclined to agree with Seneca on this point, who to a supposed objection to his definition, <hi rend="italic">cupiditas ulciscendi</hi>, replies thus, de Ira, I 3. 2, <hi rend="italic">Primum diximus cupiditatem esse poenae exigendae, non facultatem: concupiscunt autem komines et quae non possunt. Deinde nemo tam humilis est, qui poenam vel summi hominis sperare non possit: ad nocendum potentes sumus.</hi> And anger is apt to be blind and unreasonable. This is an answer to I 11. 9, already referred to. </p>
						<p>The definition therefore of anger in full, is as follows: &lsquo;an impulsive desire, accompanied by pain (and also pleasure, as is afterwards added), of vengeance (punishment of, and compensation for, an offence) visible or evident (in its result), due to a manifest (and unmistakeable) slight (consisting, or shewn) in (insults, indignities, wrongs) directed against ourselves, or (any) of our friends, when (we feel that) the slight is undeserved&rsquo;; or literally, &lsquo;is not naturally and properly belonging to us&rsquo;, not our <hi rend="italic">due</hi>, in consideration of our rank and importance or of our personal merits and qualifications. </p>
						<p>Bacon's Essay, <hi rend="italic">Of Anger</hi>, has one point at least in common with Aristotle's delineation of it. &ldquo;The causes and motives of anger are chiefly three. First to be too sensible of <hi rend="italic">hurt;</hi> for no man is angry that feels not himself hurt... The next is, the apprehension and construction of the injury offered to be, in the circumstances thereof, full of <hi rend="italic">contempt:</hi> for contempt is that which putteth an edge upon anger, as much or more than the hurt itself.&rdquo; &ldquo;For raising and appeasing anger in another; it is done chiefly by choosing of times, when men are forwardest and worst disposed, to incense them. Again, by gathering all that you can find out to aggravate the contempt.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>Anger is directed against the individual, not the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">species</hi> (comp. c. 3. 16): that is, it is excited by a definite, concrete, single individual, and by a distinct provocation, not by a mere mental abstraction, or a whole class of objects. This is one of the characteristics which distinguish it from <foreign lang="greek">mi=sos</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">e)/xqra</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 4, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ h\( me\n o)rgh\ a)ei\ peri\ ta\ kaq)</foreign> <pb n="13"/> <foreign lang="greek">e(/kasta, oi(=on *kalli/a| h)\ *swkra/tei, to\ de\ mi=sos kai\ pro\s ta\ ge/nh| to\n ga\r kle/pthn misei= kai\ to\n sukofa/nthn a(/pas</foreign>. [For <foreign lang="greek">*kle/wni</foreign>, see III 5. 2.] Add to these, national antipathies, family feuds, class prejudices, religious and political enmities, the <hi rend="italic">odium theologicum</hi>, &amp;c. On the ordinary <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of anger, Prof. Bain says, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 163, &ldquo;The <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of irascible feeling are chiefly persons; but inanimate things may occasionally cause an imperfect form of it to arise.&rdquo; Aristotle omits this. Mr Bain, more correctly than Aristotle, includes under the same head, &lsquo;the irascible emotion&rsquo;, hatred, revenge, antipathy and resentment, or righteous indignation (<foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign>) with anger, as mere varieties of the same <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> or emotion. </p>
						<p>Again, it is provoked by any injury (or insult) committed or intended, <foreign lang="greek">h)\ pepoi/hke/ tis h)\ h)/mellen</foreign>, either against ourselves, or any of our relations, friends, dependants, anyone in whose welfare we are interested. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Thirdly, (as we gather from the terms of the definition, <foreign lang="greek">o)/recis timwri/as</foreign>,) every angry emotion is accompanied by a feeling of pleasure, that, namely (<foreign lang="greek">th\n</foreign> Bekk. <foreign lang="greek">th=s</foreign> A^{c}), which arises from the hope of vengeance upon, or of punishing (both are included in <foreign lang="greek">timwri/a</foreign>), (the person who has offended us)&rsquo;. First of all revenge is in itself pleasant: <foreign lang="greek">kai\ to\ timwrei=sqai h(du/: ou(= ga\r to\ mh\ tugxa/nein luphro\n to\ tugxa/nein h(du/: oi( d'  o)rgizo/menoi lupou=ntai a)nuperblh/tws mh\ timwrou/menoi, e)lpi/zontes de\ xai/rousin</foreign>. Comp. Eth. Nic.

He always supposes that he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> obtain the object of his desire, the punishment of the offender, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> even in his anger he feels pleasure in the prospective satisfaction. The first of the two following lines of Homer, Il. <foreign lang="greek">*s</foreign> 109, has been already quoted in illustration of the same topic, the pleasure of anger in the prospect of revenge, I 11. 9. In the passage quoted above from Seneca, de Ira, I 3. 2, what is here said, <foreign lang="greek">ou)dei\s tw=n fainome/nwn a)duna/twn e)fi/etai au(tw=|</foreign>, may seem at first sight to be contradicted. The two statements are however different: Seneca says that a man may <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> for what is quite beyond his reach; Aristotle says that he never <hi rend="italic">aims at it</hi>, never uses any exertion to attain to that which he knows to be <pb n="14"/> <hi rend="italic">un</hi>attainable: which is equally true. No one ever deliberates about things which are not under his own control. (For a list of such things see Eth. Nic. III 5, sub init.) </p>
						<p>But this anticipation of the <hi rend="italic">future</hi> is not the only source of the pleasure which we feel in an angry mood: &lsquo;it as accompanied by yet another pleasure, the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> pleasure of dwelling in the mind on the prospective vengeance: it is the fancy that then arises (presents itself) that produces the pleasure in us, just like that of dreams&rsquo;. On the pleasures of the <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> itself, see again I 11. 6, 7, and the notes there. </p>
						<p>Schrader refers to an excellent illustration of this pleasure of dwelling on the prospect of vengeance, in Terent. Adelph. III 2. 12, seq. beginning, <hi rend="italic">me miserum, vix sum compos animi, ita ardeo iracundia</hi><note anchored="yes">See also &lsquo;on the pleasure of irascible emotion,&rsquo; Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, c. ix. &sect; 4. Mr Bain acknowledges, though he regards it as anomalous, the painful fact that pleasure at the sight of suffering inflicted, especially under circumstances of violent excitement when the passions are already inflamed, as at the sack of a captured town, is in reality a phenomenon of human nature. Other examples of this are the notoriously cruel habits of children in their treatment of animals, and in their ordinary sports; the pleasure found in gladiatorial combats, bull fights, bear baiting, cock and quail fights, and all the other cruel exhibitions which have <hi rend="italic">amused</hi> the most civilized as well as barbarous spectators. He traces this to three sources, of which the principal is the love of power. I will venture to add three more possible elements of the emotion, which may contribute, without superseding the others, to the production of it. First, the sense of contrast between the suffering which we are witnessing in another and our own present immunity: this is the principle implied in Lucretius' <hi rend="italic">Suave mari magno</hi>, and is illustrated in I 11. 8, of this work. Secondly, it may be partly traced to curiosity&mdash;the pleasure of learning, as Aristotle calls it&mdash;and the stimulus of surprise or wonder which we feel at any exciting spectacle; another source of pleasure mentioned by Aristotle in the same chapter. And thirdly, <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>, a distorted and perverted sympathy (this is an ordinary source of pleasure), which gives us an <hi rend="italic">independent interest</hi> in the sufferings of any creature whose feelings, and consequent liability to suffering, we share&mdash;that is, of all <hi rend="italic">animated</hi> beings; with inanimate objects there can be no sympathy.</note>. </p>

First, &lsquo;contempt involves <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign>; because people <hi rend="italic">despise</hi> men and things that they regard as <hi rend="italic">worthless</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign>, slight esteem, contemptuous indifference, is directed to the same objects&rsquo;, whence it appears that they have a common element, and that <foreign lang="greek">katafro/nhsis</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a tis</foreign>, a <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of slight. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c2s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>A second kind of <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">e)phreasmo/s</foreign>, spiteful opposition to, <hi rend="italic">wanton</hi> interference with, the plans and wishes (<foreign lang="greek">tais boulh/sesi</foreign>) of others, in order to thwart them, where you gain no advantage to yourself by doing so; where the motive is the mere malicious pleasure of disconcerting some one, and thereby shewing your power over them: which is the root of the wanton love of mischief inherent in human nature: comp. &sect; 6. &lsquo;This is an inclination to <hi rend="italic">thwart</hi> or interfere with the wishes of another, not for any advantage that you expect to derive from it yourself, but merely for the mischievous satisfaction of depriving him of it. The slight regard therefore is shewn in the wantonness of the offence; for it is plain that there is no intention (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> supposition) of injury in a slight&mdash; that would imply fear, not merely indifference&mdash;nor of doing him any service, none at least worth speaking of&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign> excludes the notion of good as well as bad, it is mere indifference; &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ga\r ta\ kaka\ kai\ ta)gaqa\ a)/cia oi)o/meqa spoudh=s ei)=nai k.t.l.</foreign>); &lsquo;for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> (doing him service) would imply care for him, solicitude for his welfare, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> again <pb n="16"/> friendship,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;for (in that case) he would have shewn that he cared for him, and therefore (so that <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>. it would follow) that he was his friend&rsquo;. The argument of <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\ ou)=n&mdash;fi/los ei)=nai</foreign> is this. The <hi rend="italic">wantonness</hi> of the mischief which is the effect of <foreign lang="greek">e)phreasmo/s</foreign>, (spiteful interference with your neighbour's inclinations,) shews that <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign> enters into it in this, that it must proceed from a contemptuous indifference as to the person and character of the victim; for the very wantonness of the act, that it is done for mere amusement, and without any prospect of advantage, shews the slight regard that the perpetrator has for the sufferer; that he neither fears him as he must have done if he wished to hurt or injure him by thwarting his schemes, nor esteems and respects him as a friend, as would necessarily be the case if he intended to interfere with and oppose his plans and inclinations for the other's benefit: and therefore the indifference that he does manifest must be indicative of contempt. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)phreasmo/s</lemma>] appears to be almost a <foreign lang="greek">a(/pac lego/menon</foreign>; only two examples are given in Steph. Lex., one from Diodorus and the other from Pollux&mdash;no great authorities. [It is also found <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 4 &sect; 30.] The usual form of it in the ordinary language is <foreign lang="greek">e)ph/reia</foreign>, which occurs in much the same sense; as also <foreign lang="greek">e)phrea/zein</foreign> frequently in Demosthenes, and less frequently elsewhere, as in Xenophon and the Comic Poets. Thucyd. I 26 is a good instance as a commentary upon Aristotle's text, and illustrative of his interpretation: of the Corcyreans, during their war with the Corinthians, it is said that after the surrender of their colony Epidamnus to the Corinthians, they took this to heart, and despatched a force of 25 ships, to demand amongst other things the restitution of the Epidamnian exiles; and this they did <foreign lang="greek">kat'  e)ph/reian</foreign>, &lsquo;they bade them <hi rend="italic">out of mere spite and wantonness</hi>&rsquo; without any prospect of benefit to themselves, merely for the purpose of annoying the others. Comp. <foreign lang="greek">e)phrea/zein</foreign>, Dem. c. Mid. p. 519, of Midias' vexatious annoyance, <foreign lang="greek">e)ph/reia</foreign> ib. p. 522 ult. where it is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, the wanton outrage on the sacred <hi rend="italic">person</hi> of the choragus. See also de Cor. p. 229, lines 8, 14 in both of which it is applied to spiteful, wantonly offensive <hi rend="italic">language;</hi> whereas in Aristotle it is <foreign lang="greek">e)mpodismo\s tai=s boulh/sesin</foreign>, and in Plut. Reip. Ger. Praec. p. 816 C, it is applied to <hi rend="italic">acts</hi> of this character, <foreign lang="greek">h)\ pra/cesin e)xou/sais filotimi/an e)phrea/zwn</foreign>; as in Ar. Pol. III 16, 1287 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 38, <foreign lang="greek">polla\ pro\s e)ph/reian kai\ xa/rin ei)w/qasi pra/ttein</foreign>; which also marks the &lsquo;wantonness&rsquo; characteristic of it by the addition of <foreign lang="greek">pro\s xa/rin</foreign>. In Plut. Coriol. 334 D, <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)pi\ ke/rdesin a)lla\ di) u(/brin kai\ perifro/nhsin toi=s pe/nhsin e)phrea/zwn</foreign>, which marks the wanton character of the acts of oppression. These passages from Plutarch with some others from the same author are to be found in Wyttenbach's note on Plutarch, p. 135 D. He renders it <hi rend="italic">vexantes, infestantes, per invidiam et contumeliam.</hi> The only other instance that I will refer to, occurs in Herod. VI 9, where the word seems at first sight to bear a different meaning, &lsquo;threatening&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">ta/de sfi le/gete e)phrea/zontes ta/ per sfe/as kate/cei</foreign>, (and so Schweigh&auml;user's Lexicon &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">minitari</hi>&rsquo;). But by comparing the word as here used with its use and explanation in other authors, we see that the sense of <hi rend="italic">the threat</hi> is only <pb n="17"/> implied, and that the prominent and characteristic signification is, as elsewhere, &lsquo;insult or spite them by telling them the fate that will overtake them&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/ste fi/los ei)=nai</lemma>] is an instance of a not unfrequent attraction of a substantive or adjective, ordinarily in the accusative, within a grammatical bracket, as it were, to the subject of the verb without it&mdash;here <foreign lang="greek">e)fro/ntize</foreign>&mdash;and hence expressed in the nominative.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(/bris</lemma>] which corresponds with the preceding in some points, while it differs in others, is &lsquo;an injury or annoyance inflicted, involving disgrace to the sufferer; for no <hi rend="italic">benefit</hi> that is expected to accrue to the aggressor except the mere fact of its having been done, in other words the <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi> of doing it: for <hi rend="italic">retaliation</hi> is not wanton outrage but vengeance or punishment&rsquo;. This is the <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> for the explanation of <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, so important in the Orators and the Athenian law. See note on I 12. 26, where it is examined from this point of view. The outraged personal dignity, the wounded honour, which gives its special sting to an act of <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, and distinguishes it from a mere assault, <foreign lang="greek">ai)ki/a</foreign>, is noted in the text by the phrase <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  oi(=s ai)sxu/nh e)sti\ tw=| pa/sxonti</foreign>, and the rest of the definition describes the &lsquo;wantonness&rsquo; of the aggression, which <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> has in common with <foreign lang="greek">e)phreasmo/s</foreign>, and in which the <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign> is shewn.

Some illustrations of acts of <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> are to be found in Polit. VIII (V), 10, 1311 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33.

This character and tendency of youth is also expressed in one of the two opposite senses of the derivatives <foreign lang="greek">neani/as, neanieu/esqai, neaniko/s</foreign>. The two last convey, in different contexts, the two sides of the youthful character, and the good and bad qualities by which it is specially distinguished. On the one hand, they represent the gallant, spirited, vigorous, impetuous, nature of youth (<foreign lang="greek">eu)= kai\ gennai/ws, a(/te ne/os w)/n</foreign>, Plat. Soph. 239 B), on the other the petulousness, wantonness, insolence, which sometimes characterises it&mdash;<hi rend="italic">protervus, ferox, superbus</hi>, Ast, <hi rend="italic">Lex.

Crimes are hereby divided into two classes, crimes on a great and on a petty scale; highminded crimes of violence and audacity, outrages which imply a sense of power and superiority in those who commit them; and sneaking, underhand crimes, of fraud and low villany, which are the crimes which the poor and mean are especially inclined to. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(pere/xein ga\r oi)/ontai u(bri/zontes</lemma>] This, as we have already seen, is a general tendency of human nature: but besides this general inclination, there is in the case of the young a special desire and a special inclination to assert their superiority to others, which is shewn in the love of <hi rend="italic">victory</hi>, or getting the better of an opponent in the mimic combats and contests of their <hi rend="italic">games;</hi> and also in their love of honour or spirit of ambition; <foreign lang="greek">u(peroxh=s ga\r e)piqumei= h( neo/ths, h( de\ ni/kh u(peroxh/ tis</foreign>, II 12. 6. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Again, <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> is a mark of disrespect, inflicts disgrace or indignity, and this again is a mark of slight esteem; and this feeling of disrespect, and the disgrace and dishonour to the sufferer that accompany it, shew that the object of them is considered of no worth or value, because he has no <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> (but the contrary), which is as much as to say that he is of no <hi rend="italic">value</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">timh/</foreign> having the double sense), worth nothing either for good or for evil&rsquo;, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> is the object of the contemptuous <hi rend="italic">indifference</hi> which is the sting of <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign>. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xleua/zein</lemma>, probably connected with <foreign lang="greek">xei=los</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">xe/los</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">xelu/nh</foreign>) &lsquo;the lip&rsquo; (so Valck.), &lsquo;to shoot out the lips&rsquo; in mockery and derision.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">skw/ptein</lemma>, is not easily distinguished from the preceding, except by the greater frequency of its occurrence. It expresses an ill-natured joke, sneering, taunting, gibing at, another, for the purpose of bringing him into ridicule. This is the &lsquo;scornful jest&rsquo;, which, as Pope says, is &lsquo;most bitter&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">skw=mma</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">skw=yis</foreign> is therefore opposed to <foreign lang="greek">eu)trapeli/a</foreign>, the easy well-bred pleasantry which distinguishes the conversation and compoposition of the accomplished gentleman. The ill-natured intention implied in <foreign lang="greek">skw/ptein</foreign> appears incidentally in the phrase <foreign lang="greek">lupei=n to\n skwpto/menon</foreign>, which indicates that it is always attended with pain to the object of it, Eth.

It occurs, as might be expected, constantly in Aristophanes, who dealt more largely in the commodity itself than most other writers. An examination of the passages where it is used by this author will help to confirm what I have said of the ill-natured use of it; for instance, Pac. 740, <foreign lang="greek">e)s ta\ r(a/kia skw/ptontas a)ei\ kai\ toi=s fqeirsi\n polemou=ntas</foreign>, Nub. 540, <foreign lang="greek">ou)d'  e)/skwpte tou\s falakrou/s</foreign>, and so of the rest. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">toi=s fi/lois</lemma>] Comp. &sect; 15, and note. &lsquo;We are angry with friends if they <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> speak of us, and treat us, well, and still more if they do the contrary; and if, when we are in want of anything, they don't perceive it (don't find it out before we tell them of it)&rsquo;&mdash;this manifests their <hi rend="italic">indifference</hi> to us and our wants, which is a kind of <hi rend="italic">contempt</hi>, and the sting of <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;as Antiphon's Plexippus was (angry with, <foreign lang="greek">w)rgi/zeto</foreign>) with his (<foreign lang="greek">tw=|</foreign>) Meleager: for this want of perception (or attention) is a token of slight; because, when we do care for any one, (things of this kind) don't escape us&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">w(=n ga\r fronti/zomen</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ou) lanqa/nei</foreign>. This is expressed in the <hi rend="italic">abstract</hi> neuter of all <hi rend="italic">things;</hi> meaning of course <hi rend="italic">persons.</hi> There were two poets named Antiphon: one a writer of the New Comedy, (Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Com. Gr.</hi> I 489, <foreign lang="greek">poihth\s kainh=s kwmw|di/as *)antifw=n *)aqhnai=os</foreign>, B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Corp. Inscr.</hi> I p. 767): and the other, a tragic writer, mentioned by Athenaeus as a <foreign lang="greek">tragw|dopoio/s</foreign>, together with his character, Plexippus, XV 673 F. This second Antiphon is again referred to, Rhet. II 6. 27, <foreign lang="greek">*)antifw=n o( poihth/s</foreign>, and his play Meleager, Ib. 23. 20, where two lines are quoted from it. Besides Antiphon's play, there were several others with the same title, and on the same subject, the Calydonian boar-hunt and its tragic consequences, by poets comic as well as tragic, Sophocles, Euripides, Sosiphanes, (Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr. Fragm.</hi> III 179,) Antiphanes, and Philetaerus, Mein., u. s., I 315, 349. (The Meleager of Antiphanes is doubtful, the names of Antiphon and Antiphanes being often interchanged, Mein.) See also Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr. Fragm.</hi> III 113. </p>
						<p>Victorius notes on this allusion: &lsquo;Plexippus was brother of Althea, Meleager's mother, and with his brother Toxeus was put to death by Meleager, because they expressed indignation at his bestowing the prize, the boarskin, which he had received for the destruction of the Calydonian boar, upon his mistress Atalanta. Perhaps it was this very circumstance that Antiphon indicated: he may have represented Plexippus as expressing his vexation at Meleager's <hi rend="italic">insensibility to his want</hi>, to his great anxiety, namely, to possess the boarskin, which his nephew (Meleager) had, <pb n="29"/> regardless of the claims of consanguinity, bestowed nevertheless on Atalanta&rsquo;. (I have altered the second sentence for the sake of clearness.) </p>
						<p>The story of Meleager and the Caledonian boarhunt, is told by Ovid, Metamorph. VIII. The offence of the Thestiadae, Toxeus and Plexippus, and their death by the hand of their nephew, are described in 428&mdash;444: from which Victorius apparently derived his account. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And to those who have done us more kindness and service (than they have received from us)&rsquo;. The explanation of this is not given because it is too clear to require one.

						<p>&lsquo;And those who beg for anything and deprecate our wrath or resentment&rsquo;&mdash;both of these are confessions of inferiority, we acknowledge that we are in want of something, a deficiency which they can supply, and this shews superiority&mdash;&lsquo;for they are humbler&rsquo; (than they would otherwise be, if they <hi rend="italic">didn't</hi> want anything). </p>

It is however a not unnatural observation to make here. Up to this point Aristotle has been going over very nearly the same ground as the topics of the last chapter; when he has got thus far, the resemblance strikes him, and he says by way of a note: &ldquo;but in fact this is true as a general rule, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the topics of <foreign lang="greek">prao/ths</foreign> may be derived by merely reversing them from those of <foreign lang="greek">o)rgh/</foreign>&rdquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;And again a more violent animosity conceived against one person is appeased by punishment previously exacted from another (who may not have excited it so strongly): and therefore the saying of Philocrates was to the point, when some one asked at a time of popular excitement against him, &lsquo;why do not you defend yourself?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, not yet&rsquo;, he replied. &lsquo;Well, but when?&rsquo; &lsquo;As soon as I have seen some one else under accusation&rsquo;, (or &lsquo;under a similar suspicion&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">diaba/llein</foreign>, &lsquo;to set two people at variance&rsquo;, being specially applied to &lsquo;calumny&rsquo;). &lsquo;For men recover their calmness and evenness of temper, as soon as they have expended their anger upon another object&rsquo;.

						<p>On Philocrates, of the Attic deme Hagnus (<foreign lang="greek">*(agnou/sios</foreign>), a contemporary and political rival of Demosthenes, see two columns of references from the Orators, chiefly Demosthenes and Aeschines, in Baiter and Sauppe's excellent <hi rend="italic">Index nominum</hi>, appended to their edition of the Greek Orators, III 137 seq. [See also Arnold Schaefer's <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes und seine Zeit</hi>, II 345 and elsewhere. S.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As happened in the case of Ergophilus; for though they (the Athenian assembly) were more indignant with him than with Callisthenes, they let him off, because they had condemned Callisthenes to death the day before&rsquo;. Callisthenes and Ergophilus were both of them Athenian generals commanding in the Chersonese, B. C. 362. See Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of</hi> <pb n="39"/> <hi rend="italic">Gr.</hi> X 508, 511, and the references in Baiter and Sauppe, u. s. pp. 45 and 73 [also A.

						<p>&lsquo;Sympathy or compassion calms angry feeling; and if the offence (which has aroused their indignation) has been visited by a heavier punishment than those who are thus angry would themselves have inflicted (their anger is appeased); for they think they have received a sort of (<foreign lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign>) satisfaction (for the injury)&rsquo;, or &lsquo;exacted as it were a penalty (for the offence)&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>

						<p>&lsquo;Or again, if they think that they are themselves in fault, and are suffering no more than they deserve; for justice, &lsquo;reciprocity&rsquo;, or fair retaliation, excites no anger: and so they no longer think that the treatment they receive is in violation of their natural rights, and this, as we said, is essential to (or the notion of) anger&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">h)=n</foreign> &lsquo;was&mdash;when we said it&rsquo;: that is, in the definition II 2. 1. On <foreign lang="greek">prosh=kon</foreign>, the appeal to <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> as the basis of <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi>, see note on <foreign lang="greek">mh\ prosh/kontos</foreign> (on II 2. 1 at the end). &lsquo;And therefore punishment should always be preceded by <hi rend="italic">the</hi> (appropriate, <foreign lang="greek">tw=|</foreign>) explanation (of the nature of the offence and the justice of the punishment); for even slaves are less vexed at being punished (when treated in this way)&rsquo;. This is Muretus' interpretation, against Victorius. It is no doubt the natural and correct explanation. [&lsquo;Decet verbis castigare, antequam puniamus.&rsquo; Spengel.] </p>

					<div3 id="b2c3s16" type="section" n="16">
						<p>&lsquo;(And men in anger are more easily pacified) if they think that (those that they desire to punish) will never find out that the punishment is due to them (that they are the authors of it) and that it is in compensation for their own injuries&rsquo;; (this is the <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nh o)ligwri/a</foreign> of the defi<pb n="40"/> nition: see note on p. 10,) &lsquo;for anger is always directed against individuals, (II 2. 2, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> 4. 31, where this is made the characteristic of <hi rend="italic">anger</hi>, as opposed to <hi rend="italic">hatred</hi>,) as appears from the definition&rsquo;. This <hi rend="italic">inference from the definition</hi> is drawn from the <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nh timwri/a</foreign> which is the object of the angry man. If the punishment is to be such as <hi rend="italic">can be actually seen</hi>, the anger cannot be directed against abstractions like classes or kinds, but must have a single, palpable, concrete, and also animated object; something that can <hi rend="italic">feel</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> that it is hurt. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore (the trait of character, the representation, in) the verse&rsquo; (of Homer, Odys. IX 504) &lsquo;is right and true (to nature, rightly conceived and expressed), &ldquo;Tell him that it is <hi rend="italic">Ulysses</hi> waster of cities (that blinded him)&rdquo;&mdash;as though his revenge was not complete&rsquo; (i. e. the revenge of Ulysses, or of the character in Homer; which is the suppressed nomin. to <foreign lang="greek">pepoi/htai</foreign>, and with which <foreign lang="greek">tetimwrhme/nos</foreign> agrees: <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> the character is rightly represented in the verses as not fully avenged) &lsquo;unless the other (the Cyclops) was aware by whom and for what&rsquo; (the blindness was inflicted). </p>
						<p>The passage runs thus: <foreign lang="greek">*ku/klwy, ai)/ ke/n ti/s se kataqnhtw=n a)nqrw/pwn o)fqalmou= ei)/rhtai a)eikeli/hn a)lawtu/n, fa/sqai *)odussh=a ptolipo/rqion e)calaw=sai, ui(o\n *lae/rtew, *)iqa/kh| e)/ni oi)ki/) e)/xonta</foreign>. &lsquo;So that men are not angry with <hi rend="italic">all the rest</hi> (all besides those who are actually within reach), who are out of sight (far away, for instance), nor any more with the dead&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">e)/ti</foreign>, they do not <hi rend="italic">retain</hi> their anger beyond the grave) &lsquo;as with those who have endured the last extremity, and are no longer susceptible of pain, nor indeed of any feeling, which (to give the other pain and to make him <hi rend="italic">feel</hi>) is what the angry man aims at. And therefore the poet (Homer, Iliad, <foreign lang="greek">*w</foreign> 54) has well said of Hector, wishing to represent Achilles as ceasing from his anger against the dead (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> wishing to put a stop to his anger, i. e. <hi rend="italic">represent it as ceasing</hi>): &ldquo;For in truth it is but dumb (senseless) earth that he is outraging in his wrath.&rdquo;&rsquo; Or rather, <foreign lang="greek">pau=sai boulo/menos</foreign> means to suggest or assign a reason or motive for Achilles' ceasing from his anger: the words being those of Apollo, who is haranguing the <pb n="41"/> Gods on the propriety of permitting Hector's body to be buried, and concludes his speech very emphatically with this line. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pau=sai boulo/menos</lemma>] These words, applied to the poet himself instead of the character Apollo, <hi rend="italic">represented</hi> in the poem, are an instance of a not unfrequent confusion in expressions of this kind. It is the substitution of the author himself for his personage or character; or the conversion of the doctrine of a given philosopher or school into the philosopher or school that holds it. Plat.

Similarly the Eleatics, Ib. 157 A, are called <foreign lang="greek">oi(/ i(/stantes</foreign>, &lsquo;the stationers&rsquo;, meaning those who represent every thing as stationary or at rest. So Soph. 252 A, the opposition <hi rend="italic">school</hi>, of Heraclitus, receives the name of <foreign lang="greek">oi( r(e/ontes</foreign>, &lsquo;the fluent philosophers&rsquo;, &lsquo;the flowing gentry&rsquo;, instead of their theory: and compare Theaet. 181 A, <foreign lang="greek">tw=n ta\ a)ki/nhta kinou/ntwn</foreign>.

And this purpose it may answer very well without being a real opposite of <foreign lang="greek">o)rgh/</foreign> or indeed a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> at all. If we compare <foreign lang="greek">prao/ths</foreign> with the other <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> analysed in this second book, we find that it differs from all of them in this respect&mdash;that the rest are emotions, instinctive and <hi rend="italic">active</hi>, and tend to some positive result; whereas <foreign lang="greek">prao/ths</foreign> is inactive and leads to nothing but the allaying, subduing, lowering, of the angry passion, which it reduces to a particular state, the right or mean state of temper. It seems plain therefore that it is in reality, what it is stated to be in the Ethics, a <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign>, not a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, of the <hi rend="italic">temper;</hi> an acquired and settled state of one of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, viz. <foreign lang="greek">o)rgh/</foreign>, in the mean state (or due measure) of which (the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>) all virtue resides. It is accordingly represented in the Ethics as a virtue, the mean between irascibility and insensibility, the due measure of the passionate element or emotion of our nature; and as a virtue it is the control or regulation of our temper. The true <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> is the <foreign lang="greek">o)rgh/</foreign>, the instinctive capacity of angry feeling, which may be cultivated by habit and education and developed in either direction, for good or evil; till it becomes <foreign lang="greek">o)rgilo/ths</foreign> irascibility, or <foreign lang="greek">a)orghsi/a</foreign> insensibility&mdash;if it take a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> direction&mdash;or else settles into the mean state of a calm and placid temper. And this is the view that is taken of it in Nic. Eth. IV 11, init. <foreign lang="greek">prao/ths</foreign> is <foreign lang="greek">meso/ths peri\ o)rga/s</foreign>; Ib. 1125 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 30, <foreign lang="greek">to\ me\n ga\r pa/qos e)sti\n o)rgh/</foreign>; line 34, <foreign lang="greek">bou/letai ga\r o( pra=os a)ta/raxos ei)=nai kai\ mh\ a)/gesqai u(po\ tou= pa/qous, a)ll'  w(s a)\n o( lo/gos ta/ch| ou(/tw kai\ e)pi\ tou/tois kai\ e)pi\ tosou=ton xro/non xalepai/nein</foreign>. This is doubtless the correct view; and the other, though no doubt <hi rend="italic">subsequent</hi> to that of the Ethics, is adopted in the Rhetoric merely for convenience, philosophical accuracy not being required.

This makes the nearest approach to a regular definition of <foreign lang="greek">fili/a</foreign> in the Ethics, and is constantly recognised as the principle of love through<pb n="43"/> out the treatise on <foreign lang="greek">fili/a</foreign>, in Books VIII and IX. It represents the desire or the inclination of doing good to the object of your affection, which is naturally, or has become by habit, instinctive, and therefore a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>. In both definitions <foreign lang="greek">bou/lesqai</foreign> is prominent and characteristic. Love is a feeling, a sort of appetite, the wish to do good; the power and the means of doing good being alike accidental and non-essential, though it is true (which is here added to the definition) that the inclination is always present, and will be gratified when the means are forthcoming. The words <foreign lang="greek">e)kei/nou e(/neka a)lla\ mh\ au(tou=</foreign> express the unselfishness, the disinterested character, of the emotion. <foreign lang="greek">o( de\ boulo/meno/s tin'  eu)pragei=n e)lpi/da e)/xwn eu)pori/as di) e)kei/nou, ou)k e)/oik) eu)/nous e)kei/nw| ei)=nai, a)lla\ ma=llon e(autw=|, kaqa/per ou)de\ fi/los, ei) qerapeu/ei au)to\n dia/ tina xrh=sin</foreign> (Eth.

						<p>&lsquo;From this assumption the necessary consequence is that a friend is one who sympathizes with us in our joys and sorrows, rejoicing at the good that befals us, and grieved at that which gives us pain, not with any ulterior motive; but solely on our friend's account. For all feel joy in obtaining the object of their wishes, and pain at the reverse, so that the pleasures and pains that they feel are an indication of the nature of their wish&rsquo;. The pleasure or pain felt on the occasion of a friend's good or bad fortune is the test of the nature of their wishes, and therefore of their friendship or hatred. And also, as every one feels pleasure at <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> success and pain at disappointment, so by the rule <foreign lang="greek">fi/los a)/llos au)to/s, e(/teros au)to/s</foreign>, &lsquo;a friend is a second self&rsquo;, (Eth.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ oi( e)pi/decioi</lemma>] Arist. has changed his construction from the accus. to the nomin., from the <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">subjects</hi> of <hi rend="italic">liking</hi>&mdash;for <hi rend="italic">love</hi> is here out of the question: these are men who are popular and agreeable in society. We may supply <foreign lang="greek">filou=ntai</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">r(adi/ws fi/loi gi/gnontai</foreign>. &lsquo;And those who are dexterous at replying and submitting to raillery&mdash;who can take, as well as give, a joke, gibe&mdash;&rsquo; (for here again there is community of sentiment, another instance of fellow-feeling <foreign lang="greek">tau)to\ fai/netai a)gaqo/n</foreign>, the foundation of friendship) &lsquo;for the mind of each party is set upon (their efforts are directed to, <foreign lang="greek">speu/dousi</foreign>) the same thing (mutual amusement, a friendly reciprocity in amusing each other) as (that of) his neighbour, (the <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> in the &lsquo;wit-combat&rsquo; or jesting-match), and each of them is equally capable of taking a joke, and returning the taunt, but <hi rend="italic">neatly</hi>, gracefully, with propriety&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pide/cios</lemma> is one of those adjectives compounded with <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/</foreign>, in which the preposition expresses either the <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> or inclination (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> direction), or the <hi rend="italic">liability</hi> to anything, which is defined in the second part of the <pb n="49"/> compound. <foreign lang="greek">e)pide/cios</foreign> is a man that has a tendency to the use of his <hi rend="italic">right hand</hi>, the sign of skill and <hi rend="italic">dexterity;</hi> the right and left hand being severally the symbols of dexterity or cleverness and awkwardness; <hi rend="italic">dexter, laevus;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">decio/s, decio/ths, skaio/s, a)ristero/s</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">gauche.</hi> </p>
						<p>Another secondary notion, propitious and unpropitious, belonging to these terms, is derived from the observations of augury, according as the omens appear on the right or left hand: but in Latin, at all events, the notion of &lsquo;awkwardness&rsquo; conveyed by <hi rend="italic">laevus</hi>, and the opposite by <hi rend="italic">dexter</hi>, cannot have been suggested by this, because in their practice omens <hi rend="italic">on the left, laeva, sinistra</hi>, were <hi rend="italic">favourable.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pide/cios</lemma> is therefore one who has a tendency to <foreign lang="greek">decio/ths</foreign>, and follows the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">e)piki/ndunos, e)piqa/natos</foreign> (liable to danger and death), <foreign lang="greek">e)pai/tios, e)pi/dikos, e)pi/kairos</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">e)pikai/rios, e)pilh/smwn, e)pizh/mios, e)pi/momfos, e)pi/lupos, e)pi/nosos, e)pi/klopos, e)pimelh/s, e)pi/maxos, e)panagkh/s, e)pieikh/s, e)pi/docos</foreign> (&lsquo;one who is expected to&rsquo;... <hi rend="italic">liable to</hi> that expectation, Isocr. Areop. &sect; 48). <foreign lang="greek">u(po/</foreign> in comp. has very nearly the same signification, derived from the &lsquo;subjection&rsquo; which it implies. So <foreign lang="greek">u(peu/qunos</foreign> (subject or liable to a scrutiny), <foreign lang="greek">u(po/dikos, u(po/logos</foreign> (amenable to an account, accountable, responsible), by metaphor from the analogy of <foreign lang="greek">u(po/skios</foreign> &lsquo;under the shade of&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">u(/posmos</foreign>, Arist. de Anima, II 9, 421 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12. <foreign lang="greek">u(po/stegos, u(pai/qrios, u(/pombros, u(po/foros, u(po/spondos</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">twqa/zein</lemma> is a variety of <foreign lang="greek">skw/ptein</foreign>, to gird at, mock, jeer at, some one in particular; both of them (as well as others of the same class) being distinguished from other forms of wit or pleasantry by their personal direction, or <hi rend="italic">personality.</hi> The word occurs in Plato and Aristophanes, Vesp. 1362 and 1368, and once in Herodotus [II 60]. It is plain from the application of it, for instance in the passages of Aristophanes, that its special meaning is what we now call &lsquo;chaffing&rsquo; or &lsquo;poking fun at&rsquo;, the repartees, or witticisms, mostly of a highly personal character, which pass between the combatants in what is also nowadays called &lsquo;a slanging match&rsquo;. This is confirmed by the use of the word in Arist. Pol. IV (VII) 17, 1336 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17. The author is there condemning the practice of <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxrologi/a</foreign>, &lsquo;indecent language&rsquo;, which should not be tolerated in a model state. An exception however is made in favour of certain seasons of especial licence, as at the Eleusinian mysteries, and the orgies of particular deities to whose worship this <foreign lang="greek">twqasmo/s</foreign> &lsquo;licentious raillery&rsquo; was appropriate, and permitted by law, <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s kai\ to\n twqasmo\n a)podi/dwsin o( no/mos:</foreign> such were Dionysus during the celebration of the Bacchanalia, Aphrodite, Priapus, Hermaphroditus, Ilythia, and others; see Schneider ad loc. Comp. Addenda p. 509, and Eaton. </p>
						<p>All this is abundantly illustrated in the Chorus of the Ranae, 316&mdash; 430. It is descriptive of the wild license that prevailed, and of the indecent language of the <foreign lang="greek">twqasmo/s</foreign> that was then allowed&mdash;see particularly the <hi rend="italic">application</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">twqasmo/s</foreign>, in the shape of <hi rend="italic">indecent personalities</hi>, 416&mdash;430; and the <foreign lang="greek">twqasmo/s</foreign> is there represented by various phrases indicative of its character, <foreign lang="greek">ta\n a)ko/laston filapai/gmona tima/n, 334; bwmolo/xois e)/pesi</foreign>, &lsquo;scurrilous&rsquo; phrases, 358; <foreign lang="greek">ka)piskw/ptwn kai\ pai/zwn kai\ xleua/zw&lt;*&gt;, 375; pai/santa kai\ skw/yanta</foreign>; and finally (as already mentioned) by the  <pb n="50"/> <hi rend="italic">specimen</hi> given at the end. Comp. Vesp. 1362, <foreign lang="greek">i(/n'  au)to\n twqa/sw neanikw=s oi(/ois poq) ou(=tos e)me\ pro\ tw=n musthri/wn</foreign>. This license of language, allowed during the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, reached its height at the bridge over the Cephissus, which was crossed and recrossed by the initiated on their way to and from Eleusis; where they were doubtless also awaited by a very numerous mob quite ready to take part in the fun. Hence <foreign lang="greek">gefuri/zein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">gefurismo/s, e)c a(ma/chs le/gein</foreign>. Bentl. Phal. I p. 335, Monk's Ed. [p. 307, ed. Wagner]. See on this also M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gk. Lit.</hi> c. XI &sect; 5, p. 132, Engl. Tr. </p>
						<p>A similar license of language and conduct was permitted at the Roman Saturnalia, &lsquo;the slaves' holiday&rsquo;: and was also illustrated by the <hi rend="italic">Fescennina</hi>, or Fescennine verses (Liv. VII 2), in which the countryfolk (and afterwards the townsfolk) assailed and ridiculed one another in extemporaneous verses. <hi rend="italic">Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem, versibus alternis</hi> opprobria rustica <hi rend="italic">fudit</hi>, Hor.

						<p>&lsquo;We like also those that praise our virtues and accomplishments (the goods we have, and those in particular of which the possession is doubtful (which we are afraid we do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> possess)&rsquo;. Praise is the test of virtue, (I 9, and Introd. Appendix B, p. 212,) and the acknowledgment of others that we do actually possess the excellences of which we are ourselves in doubt. This confirmation of our hesitating opinion as to our own merits must of course be gratifying, and we accordingly like those that praise us. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Cleanliness and neatness in the face and general appearance, and in the dress, and in fact (as it is exhibited) in the whole life&rsquo;; in a man's habits, and all that he does in his daily life. &ldquo;Cleanliness&rdquo; is said to be &ldquo;next to Godliness&rdquo;; and there is no doubt that neat and cleanly habits and appearance in person and dress, some of which also heighten personal attractions, are <hi rend="italic">prepossessing</hi>, and apt to inspire a <hi rend="italic">liking</hi> for a man. We (English) also apply the same terms to the build or frame of the body of men and animals&mdash;to denote the absence of all <hi rend="italic">impurity</hi> and imperfection, the superfluities, excrescences, deformities, which, like the dirt that overlies and disguises and deforms the true surface underneath, mar the symmetry and harmonious proportions of the body&mdash;&lsquo;clean built&rsquo;, &lsquo;clean made&rsquo;, &lsquo;neatly built and made&rsquo;.

And besides this, cleanliness of person and neatness in dress, implying a regard for personal appearance, imply also thereby attention to and regard for the opinion of <pb n="51"/> others&mdash;whereas a solitary or savage would never think it worth while&mdash; and thus establish a sort of claim upon our regard. The excess of this attention to the person, shewn in the coxcomb and the <hi rend="italic">petit ma&icirc;tre</hi>, is a sign of egotism and vanity, and consequently displeasing. </p>

						<p>This is an answer to the question <foreign lang="greek">pw=s diakei/menoi qarrale/oi ei)si/n</foreign> &sect; 16. &lsquo;The feelings and dispositions in ourselves indicative of confidence, are, the opinion which we entertain of great success in our previous undertakings, and of having hitherto been exempt from injury, or if we have often run into danger and escaped&rsquo;: all of these are apt to make men sanguine as regards the future. Comp. Virg. Aen. I 198, <hi rend="italic">O socii, neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum, O passi graviora, dabit deus his quoque finem. Vos et Scyllaeam rabiem...revocate animos maestumque timorem mittite, forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit...illic fas regna resurgere Troiae. Durate et vosmet rebus servate secundis.</hi> Hor. Od. I 7. 30, <hi rend="italic">O fortes, peioraque passi mecum saepe viri, nunc vino</hi> <pb n="69"/> <hi rend="italic">pellite curas, cras ingens iterabimus aequor.</hi> &lsquo;For there are two things which make men insensible (to danger), either never to have experienced it (from ignorance, which inspires confidence) or to have plenty of helps, resources, means of defence, to resist and overcome it; as in dangers at sea, those who have never had experience of a storm are confident as to the future, and those who have derived from their experience plenty of resources&rsquo;. What is said here of the inexperience of men at sea tending to confidence seems to be contradicted by the observation in Eth. Nic. III 9, 1115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">ou)x ou(/tw de\ w(s oi( qala/ttioi: oi( me\n ga\r a)pegnw/kasi th\n swthpi/an kai\ to\n qa/naton to\n toiou=ton dusxerai/nousin, oi( d'  eu)e/lpide/s ei)si para\ th\n e)mpeiri/an</foreign>. Victorius thus reconciles the apparently conflicting statements: in the passage of the Ethics the brave men, who have had no experience, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> keep up their courage though they despair of safety, and are indignant at such a death as that of drowning; the death which they covet being death on the field of battle: the sailors on the contrary are sanguine by reason of the resources which their experience has taught them. Still the contradiction is not removed by this explanation; for in the Rhetoric the inexperienced are confident, in the Ethics they are in despair, though their courage may not fail. In fact the two cases are not identical, nor intended to be so. In the Ethics the virtue of courage is displayed in the extremest danger, in the other there is no virtue at all; the ignorance of the. danger inspires confidence&mdash;not courage&mdash;and that is all. The passage of the Rhetoric is explained by another in Magn. Mor.

						<p>&lsquo;For the angry feeling is accompanied with confidence, and to abstain from wrong oneself and yet to be wronged by others is provocative of anger, and the divine power is supposed to aid (side with) the injured&rsquo;. The argument is this, Innocence of wrong is a ground of confidence: but this may be extended to the general (<foreign lang="greek">o(/lws</foreign>) case of the divine favour, and the feeling of confidence is heightened if we believe that we have heaven on our side, which we argue from favourable omens and oracles. This divine authority strengthens our conviction of our innocence, of our having right on our side (so Victorius), and therefore our confidence. Another reason for this increase of confidence is the <hi rend="italic">angry feeling</hi> which is excited in us by the sense of unjust treatment from others to whom we have done no wrong, for anger always implies confidence; and at the same time we feel ourselves under the protection of heaven, which is always supposed to take the part of the innocent and injured. <foreign lang="greek">qar)r(ale/on h( o)rgh/</foreign>.

					<p>On shame or modesty, and shamelessness or impudence and effrontery. </p>
					<p>Prof. Bain's remarks on shame&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 142&mdash;are so brief that they may here be quoted entire. It falls under the general head of Emotions of Self, and in the subordinate division under that of self-love. &ldquo;The feeling of shame is resolved by a reference to the dread of being condemned, or ill-thought of, by others. Declared censure and public infliction, by inviting the concurrent hostile regards of a wide circle of spectators, constitute an open shame. One is also put to shame by falling into any act that people are accustomed to disapprove, and will certainly censure in their own minds, although they may refrain from actually pronouncing condemnation. This is the most frequent case in common society. Knowing the hard judgments passed upon all breaches of conventional decorum, it is a source of mortification to any one to be caught in a slip; they can too easily imagine the sentence that they do not actually hear. The character of the pain of all such situations exactly accords with the pains of expressed disapprobation.&rdquo; [Chap. XI &sect; 16, ed. 1875.] </p>
					<div3 id="b2c6s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The exciting causes of shame and shamelessness, the objects of them, i.e. the persons to whom they are directed, and the dispositions or states of mind that they represent, will be clear from the following analysis&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">poi=a</foreign> here is generally expressed by <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ poi/ois</foreign>, of the exciting causes, which occurs in &sect; 3. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign>, as a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, the sense of shame, see Arist. Eth. Nic. II 7, and more at large, IV 15. There, as here, no distinction is made between <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</foreign>. On the distinctions which may and may not be made between them, see Trench, <hi rend="italic">N. T. Syn.</hi> [&sect; XIX] p. 73; and on <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign> contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, ib. &sect; XX. p. 76. They differ as the Latin <hi rend="italic">verecundia</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign>), and <hi rend="italic">pudor</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</foreign>): the first is a subjective feeling or principle of honour, Germ. <hi rend="italic">scheu</hi>; the second presents this in its objective aspect, as the fear of disgrace (from others, external) consequent on something already done, Germ. <hi rend="italic">schaam</hi> and <hi rend="italic">schande.</hi> D&ouml;derl. <hi rend="italic">Lat. Syn.</hi> Vol. III. p. 201. <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign> precedes and prevents the shameful act, <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</foreign> reflects upon its conse<pb n="72"/> quences in the <hi rend="italic">shame</hi> it brings with it. This latter conception of <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</foreign> corresponds to Aristotle's definition here, and in Eth. N. IV 15 init. <foreign lang="greek">fo/bos tis a)doci/as</foreign>. On <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign>, as a principle of action, and <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign>, the two primary notions of duty, duty to oneself, and duty to others or justice, see an interesting note of Sir A. Grant, on Eth. N. II 7. 14. In Soph. Aj. 1073&mdash;1086, the two fundamental principles, by which human conduct should be regulated, the foundations of law, justice, and military discipline, are <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">deo/s</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">fo/bos. deo\s ga\r w(=| pro/sestin ai)sxu/nh q'  o(mou= swthri/an e)/xonta to/nd) e)pi/staso</foreign>. See Schneidewin's note on line 1079. </p>
						<p>Aristotle both here and in the Ethics represents <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</foreign>, and consequently the opposite, as <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, instinctive emotions; and Bain by classing shame amongst the emotions takes the same view. Eth. N. IV 15, init. <foreign lang="greek">peri\ de\ ai)dou=s w(/s tinos a)reth=s ou) prosh/kei le/gein: pa/qei ga\r ma=llon e)/oiken h)\ e(/cei. o(ri/zetai gou=n fo/bos</foreign> (which is a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">th=s a)doci/as, a)potelei=tai de\ tw=| peri\ ta\ deina\ fo/bw| paraplh/sion: e)ruqrai/nontai ga\r oi( ai)sxuno/menoi, oi( de\ to\n qa/naton fobou/menoi w)xriw=sin. swmatika\ dh\ fai/netai/ pws ei)=nai a)mfo/tera, o(/per dokei= pa/qous ma=llon h)\ e(/cews ei)=nai</foreign>. This view of &lsquo;shame&rsquo; or &lsquo;modesty&rsquo; as a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> and not a <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign>, an emotion and not a moral state or virtue, is commented on and criticized by Alexander Aphrodisiensis in his <foreign lang="greek">a)pori/ai kai\ lu/seis</foreign>, Bk. <foreign lang="greek">*d</foreign> c. <foreign lang="greek">ka/</foreign> (21), <foreign lang="greek">peri\ ai)dou=s</foreign>. The chapter opens with a reference to the two passages of the Nic. Ethics in which the subject is treated, and after an examination and criticism of the definition, he proceeds thus; <foreign lang="greek">h( ga\r ai)dw\s ou)k e)/oiken a(plw=s ei)=nai fo/bos a)doci/as, a)lla\ polu\ pro/teron a)llotrio/ths pro\s ta\ ai)sxra/, di) h(\n oi( ou(/tws e)/xontes fobou=ntai th\n e)p'  au)toi=s a)doci/an. ei) de/ e)sti toiou=ton h( ai)dw/s, ou)k e)/t) a)\n ou)de\ pa/qos a(plw=s ei)/h, a)ll) e(/cis tis kai\ dia/qesis, h(=| to\ proeirhme/non e(/petai pa/qos</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The character of the <foreign lang="greek">a)nai/sxuntos</foreign>, as depicted by Theophrastus, Charact. c. <foreign lang="greek">q/. peri\ a)naisxunti/as</foreign>, has not much in common with the analysis of Aristotle. One common feature appears in &sect; 6 of this chapter, <foreign lang="greek">to\ kerdai/nein a)po\ mikrw=n h)\ a)p'  ai)sxrw=n</foreign>; Theophrastus' definition of <foreign lang="greek">a)naisxunti/a</foreign> being <foreign lang="greek">katafro/nhsis do/chs ai)sxrou= e(/neka ke/rdous</foreign>. But the completest portrait of the <foreign lang="greek">a)nai/sxuntos</foreign> that Greek antiquity has bequeathed to us, is doubtless the <foreign lang="greek">a)llantopw/lhs</foreign> of Aristophanes' Knights. In this character the ideal of &lsquo;shameless impudence&rsquo; seems to be reached, and human nature can go no further. </p>

We know nothing from any other source of Euripides having ever been employed on any other occasion in any public capacity; but as Aeschylus fought at Marathon, and Sophocles was one of the ten generals who conducted the exhibition against Samos under Pericles, there seems to be no <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> objection to the employment of another tragic poet in a similar public service. That Euripides could speak in public we learn from a reference of Aristotle to another answer of his, Rhet. III 15. 8. Nevertheless the objection has been held fatal to the soundness of the reading, and Ruhnken, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Crit.</hi> (ap. Buhle), has proposed to substitute <foreign lang="greek">*(uperi/dou</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">*eu)ripi/dou</foreign> in our text, the one name being constantly confounded by transcribers with the other. Sauppe <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> Vol. III. p. 216, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Oratt.</hi> XV argues the question, and decides (rightly, I think) in favour of the vulgate. There is in fact no reason whatsoever, except our ignorance, for denying that Euripides could have been sent ambassador to Syracuse. Sauppe thinks that the occasion probably was the negociations carried on between Athens and Sicily from 427&mdash;415, previous to the Sicilian expedition. His note ends with an inquiry whether another Euripides, Xenophon's father, Thuc. II 70, 79, may possibly be meant here. The extreme appositeness of the answer to Aristotle's topic, which seems to have suggested the suspicion of manufacture for the special occasion, tells in reality at least as much in favour of its genuineness; it is because it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so appropriate, that Aristotle remembers and quotes it. </p>

						<p>This section is the commencement of the third division of the analysis of shame and its opposite; the <hi rend="italic">subjective</hi> view of them, shewing how they appear in the persons themselves who are affected by them. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The likely subjects of shame themselves are, first of all men of such a disposition, or in such a state of mind, as if they had certain others standing to them in the same relation as those of whom we said they stand in awe&rsquo;. Such are persons whom they respect and admire, whom they regard as <hi rend="italic">authorities</hi>, whose judgment and opinions they look up to. A somewhat complicated assemblage of words to express this simple meaning, that the disposition to shame is the same state of mind as that which has been before described as felt in the presence of certain classes of persons of whom we stand in awe; which are immediately specified. &lsquo;These were (i. e. <hi rend="italic">are</hi>, as we described them, <foreign lang="greek">w(=n tis th=s do/chs fronti/zei, tw=n qauma/zontwn, kai\ ou(\s qauma/zei k.t.l.</foreign> <hi rend="italic">ante</hi> &sect;&sect; 14, 15) either those that we admire, or that admire us, or by whom we wish to be admired, or those from whom we require any aid or service which we shall not obtain if we <pb n="85"/> lose our credit with them; and these either as actually looking on, actual spectators (of what we say or do), of which Cydias&rsquo; harangue on the allotment of Samos furnishes an example&mdash;for he required them to imagine the entire Greek people to be standing round the Athenians in a circle, as actual spectators, and not mere (future or expectant) listeners, of the decree they are about to make&mdash;or if such be near at hand, or likely to be listeners&rsquo; (to what we have to say: this especially for the <hi rend="italic">deliberative speaker</hi>). </p>
						<p>The <foreign lang="greek">*sa/mou klhrouxi/a</foreign> here referred to is not the allotment of the Samian lands amongst Athenian citizens after the revolt of the island and its subsequent reduction by Pericles in 440 B.C. Thucydides, who gives an account of the treatment of the Samians after their defeat, I 117, makes no mention of any such allotment. It is referred by Ruhnken, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Crit.</hi>, and by Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gr.</hi> X 407 and note, 408, to Timotheus' conquest of Samos in 366, and the subsequent Athenian settlement there in 352; of the former of which Cornelius Nepos speaks, Vit. Timoth. c. 1, ap. Clinton <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> sub anno 440. It was against this allotment of Samos that Cydias (of whom nothing seems to be known beyond this notice, his name does not even occur in Baiter and Sauppe's list of Orators,) made his appeal to the Athenian assembly, and invited them to decide the question of spoliation, as though all Greece were standing round them looking on. Isocrates, Paneg. &sect; 107, is obliged to defend his countrymen from the reproach (<foreign lang="greek">o)neidi/zein</foreign>) of this and similar practices, not specially named, by the plea that the appropriation of the territory was not due to rapacity, but solely to the desire of securing the safety of the desolated properties by planting a colony to defend them. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore also men in misfortune don't like (are ashamed) to be seen by their <hi rend="italic">quondam</hi> rivals or emulators, because these are admirers&rsquo;; and therefore, by the rule previously laid down, they are ashamed to appear before them in this undignified and melancholy condition. </p>

					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xa/ris</lemma>, the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, or instinctive emotion, of which this Chapter treats, represents the tendency or inclination to benevolence, to do a grace, favour, or service, spontaneous and disinterested (&sect;&sect; 2, 5) to another, or to our fellow-man.

					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c7s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;Let us then assume benevolence to be that, in accordance with (under the influence of) which he who has the feeling is said to do a service to one who is in want of it, not in return for anything (as a compensation or payment)&rsquo;&mdash;it must be spontaneous as an instinct&mdash;&lsquo;nor for his own benefit, but for the advantage of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> party (to the transaction, <foreign lang="greek">e)kei/nw|</foreign>): the favour is great if it be (conferred on) one who is in extreme need of it, or if (the benefit it confers) be of great value or difficult (of attainment), on occasions of the like kind (<foreign lang="greek">mega/lois kai\ xalepoi=s</foreign>), or if it be unique&rsquo; (a solitary instance of such a service, the only time it ever was conferred: supply <foreign lang="greek">h)\ a)\n mo/nos o( u(pourgw=n u(pourgh/sh|</foreign> or simply <foreign lang="greek">xari/shtai</foreign>), &lsquo;or the first of its kind or the most important of its kind (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> more than any one else has ever done)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>A passage of Cicero, de Invent. XXXVIII. 112, will serve as a commentary on this. <hi rend="italic">Beneficia ex sua vi, ex tempore, ex animo eius qui facit, ex casu, considerantur.</hi> (The character of acts of benevolence is gathered or determined from these four considerations.) <hi rend="italic">Ex sua vi quaerentur hoc modo: magna an parua, facilia an difficilia, singularia sint an vulgaria, vera an falsa, quanam exornatione honestentur: ex tempore autem, si tum quum indigeremus, quum ceteri non possent, aut nollent, opitulari, si tum quum spes deseruisset: ex animo, si non sui commodi causa, si eo consilio fecit omnia ut hoc conficere posset: ex casu, si non fortuna sed industria factum videbitur aut si industria fortuna obstitisse.</hi> From this close resemblance I should infer, not that Cicero had Aristotle's work before him when he wrote the <hi rend="italic">de Inventione</hi>, but rather that it had been handed down, perhaps from him in the first instance, as a common-place in the ordinary books of Rhetoric. </p>
						<p>It was a disputed question, says Ar. again, Eth. Nic.

The amount of pains, labour, risk, or sacrifice incurred by the conferrer of the benefit here seems to be regarded as the <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> of his &lsquo;beneficence&rsquo;.</note> of the doer of it: the former being always inclined in the estimate of its value to underrate, the latter to overrate it. <foreign lang="greek">oi( me\n ga\r paqo/ntes toiau=ta/ fasi labei=n para\ tw=n eu)ergetw=n a(\ mikra\ h)=n e)kei/nois kai\ e)ch=n par'  e(te/rwn labei=n, katasmikri/zontes: oi( d) a)na/palin ta\ me/gista tw=n par) au(toi=s kai\ a(\ par) a)/llwn ou)k h)=n, kai\ e)n kindu/nois h)\ toiau/tais xrei/ais</foreign>. <pb n="89"/> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mh\ a)nti/ tinos</lemma>] This might seem at first sight to exclude <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi> from the notion of <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign>; but this I believe cannot be intended; though gratitude and ingratitude are not distinctly noticed in the chapter. The case is this. <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> in this chapter is employed exclusively in its <hi rend="italic">subjective</hi> sense (see the Lexx.), to denote one of the instinctive feelings: when therefore it is applied to express <hi rend="italic">gratitude</hi>, it is the feeling only, and not the actual return of the favour, which is taken into account. This is expressed by the words <foreign lang="greek">mh\ a)nti/ tinos</foreign>, which signify that it is &lsquo;independent of the actual requital of the benefit conferred&rsquo;: and, indeed, gratitude may be equally felt when the receiver of the favour has no means of repaying it in kind. This independent or subjective feeling of gratitude is therefore opposed in the words <foreign lang="greek">mh\ a)nti/ tinos</foreign> to the notion of a <foreign lang="greek">misqo/s</foreign>, the &lsquo;payment&rsquo; or wages which a workman receives in fulfilment of an implied contract; where there is no feeling of gratitude or obligation remaining on either side after the work is done and paid for. Whereas gratitude is a permanent feeling, and the sense of obligation still remains after the requital or repayment of the service. The opposite to this is <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti a)pe/dwkan a)ll'  ou)k e)/dwkan</foreign>, &sect; 5. It may be argued in certain cases that what appears to proceed from gratitude or spontaneous benevolence, is in reality nothing but the repayment of an obligation, with which <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> is not concerned. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;All our natural impulses are <hi rend="italic">wants</hi>, and of these those especially which are accompanied by pain at the non-attainment (<foreign lang="greek">mh\ gignome/nou</foreign>) of their object: such are the appetites and desires, as love&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">o)/recis</foreign> see p. 9, note on II 2. 1. The connexion of this remark is with the <foreign lang="greek">deome/nw|</foreign> of the preceding definition. The feeling (and the consequent act) of benevolence always implies the satisfaction of some want in the recipient of the favour; if he did not <hi rend="italic">want</hi> it, it would be no favour. And besides this, the magnitude of the want is a measure of the magnitude of the favour and of the benevolence that prompts it. Aristotle therefore proceeds to notice some of the principal wants, in the satisfaction of which <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> is manifested in the highest degree. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> our natural impulses imply wants&mdash;the <foreign lang="greek">o)re/ceis</foreign>, the &lsquo;conative&rsquo; or striving faculties, all aim at some object which they desire to attain. To the &lsquo;impulsive&rsquo; element of our nature, <foreign lang="greek">to\ o)rektiko/n</foreign>, belong the appetites and desires such as love (the animal passion). (Besides these the <foreign lang="greek">o)/recis</foreign> includes <foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign> &lsquo;the will&rsquo;.) These appetites and desires, being always accompanied with pain when thwarted or failing to attain their object, are for this reason &lsquo;wants in the highest degree&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ma/lista deh/seis</foreign>. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ka/kwsis</lemma>, in its ordinary use, and especially in its legal application, denotes a particular kind of injury or suffering, viz. ill-treatment.

						<p>&lsquo;And therefore it is, that those who stand by (assist or succour, <foreign lang="greek">parista/menoi</foreign>) a man in poverty or exile, however slight the service they render, by reason of the magnitude of the want and the occasion, confer a great favour&rsquo; (or, &lsquo;are very agreeable, acceptable&rsquo;. The word seems to include both senses); &lsquo;like the man who lent the mat <foreign lang="greek">e)n *lukei/w|</foreign>&rsquo;. <hi rend="italic">A friend in need is a friend indeed.</hi> </p>
						<p>I have not attempted to translate the word <foreign lang="greek">*lukei/w|</foreign>. We do not even know whether it is the name of a man or a place: it might also be the title of a play or a speech, from which the instance was borrowed. Victorius says, &lsquo;historia ignota mihi est;&rsquo; Schrader, &lsquo;quis, cui, quando dederit, incertum (rather <hi rend="italic">ignotum</hi>) est.&rsquo; The meaning is plain enough: it is a case like that of Sir Philip Sidney's cup of cold water, in which circumstances of time and place enormously enhance the value and importance of something which in ordinary circumstances is trifling and worthless [cf. Vol. I. pp. 84, 144]. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Accordingly, the service that is received&rsquo; (by the recipients, which seems to be the subject of <foreign lang="greek">e)/xein</foreign>) &lsquo;must be especially directed to these same things&rsquo; (viz. the satisfaction of the more urgent wants and desires.

And therefore, now that the times, circumstances, and dispositions of mind, which give rise to benevolent feeling, have been pointed out, it is plain that it is from these sources that we must provide our materials (for producing it in our audience), by shewing that the one party (the recipient in the transaction) either is <pb n="91"/> or has been<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">gegenhme/nous</foreign>.

If the word here be translated literally, the notion of &lsquo;becoming&rsquo; must be rendered by &lsquo;having come to be in, or fallen into, such want&rsquo;.</note> in want or pain such (as has been described), and the other either has done or is doing a service in a case of need, the service and the need being each of the kind mentioned&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;It is plain too from what sources (or topics) may be derived the materials for depriving (those who have conferred a favour) of (the credit of) this kindly and benevolent feeling, and making them (and their act appear, representing them as) devoid of all such feeling and intention&rsquo;. This is Victorius' interpretation, and I think more consistent with what follows than that of Schrader, who understands it of the audience, and not of the benefactor; and explains it, &ldquo;facere ut affectu illo, qui ad gratiam habendam referendamve fertur, vacui fiant auditores.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">a)xa/ristos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)xa/ritos</foreign>, &lsquo;without grace&rsquo;, stand in the first instance for &lsquo;unpleasing, disagreeable&rsquo;,&mdash;so in Homer, Theognis, Herodotus&mdash; and express the opposite of <foreign lang="greek">kexarisme/nos</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 3: and this, with the substitution of the special sense of <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> as a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> for the general sense of grace, beauty, favour, is the meaning given to the words by Aristotle here: &lsquo;without grace&rsquo; is here to be understood &lsquo;without this kindly feeling&rsquo;. The ordinary use of the word for &lsquo;ungrateful&rsquo; is founded upon a third sense of <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign>, viz. gratitude. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For (we may argue) either that the (boasted) service is, or was, done from motives of self-interest, and this, as we said, (<foreign lang="greek">h)=n</foreign>, by definition, &sect; 2,) is not benevolent feeling, or that the service was an accident of coincidence, or done under constraint, or that it was a payment and not a free gift, whether the party was aware (of his obligation to the other, so Victorius) or not<note anchored="yes" n="2">If I understand Aristotle aright, I cannot see how the alternative <foreign lang="greek">ei)/te mh\ ei)do/tes</foreign> can be fairly and properly included in this topic; though it might of course be employed by an unscrupulous speaker to delude an unintelligent audience. It seems to me that the forgetfulness or ignorance that anything is due to the person who receives the favour does alter the character of the transaction; that the gift in such a case may be a free gift, and the feeling that prompts it <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign>, disinterested benevolence, and that the <foreign lang="greek">ti\ a)nti/ tinos</foreign> does not here fairly apply.</note>: for in both cases (whether conscious or unconscious) it was a mere barter or exchange, and therefore again in this respect no benevolence&rsquo;. <pb n="92"/> </p>

Compare <foreign lang="greek">sumpie/zein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">sumpilei=n</foreign> (Plat. Tim.). </p>
						<p>In illustration of the topic <foreign lang="greek">a)pe/dwkan a)ll'  ou)k e)/dwkan</foreign>, Victorius very appositely cites the case of Demosthenes and Halonnesus referred to by Aeschines <foreign lang="greek">kata\ *kthsifw=ntos &sect; 83. *(alo/nnhson e)di/dou</foreign> (Philip offered to <hi rend="italic">give</hi>, make us a present of Halonnesus), <foreign lang="greek">o( d)</foreign> (Demosthenes) <foreign lang="greek">a)phgo/reue mh\ lamba/nein, ei) di/dwsin a)lla\ mh\ a)podi/dwsin</foreign> (if the offer is to be regarded as a free gift instead of a repayment), <foreign lang="greek">peri\ sullabw=n diafero/menos</foreign>: and (in Athenaeus VI 223 D&mdash;224 B) by the orator Cothocides; and the Comic Poets, Antiphanes (<foreign lang="greek">e)n *neotti/di</foreign>), Alexis (<foreign lang="greek">e)n *stratiw/th|</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)n *)adelfoi=s</foreign>), Anaxilas (<foreign lang="greek">e)n *eu)andri/a|</foreign>), and Timocles (<foreign lang="greek">e)n *(/hrwsin</foreign>), who ridicule the objection as a mere verbal quibble. The phrase seems to have passed almost into a proverb. Victorius truly observes, &ldquo;maioris tamen ponderis res erat quam videbatur, ut ex hoc quoque loco intelligitur.&rdquo; Demosthenes seems to have advised his Athenians to refuse the offer as a <hi rend="italic">gift</hi>, and only to accept it as a <hi rend="italic">repayment</hi> of an outstanding obligation. The argument derived from Aristotle's topic when applied to the case would be different. This offer is prompted by no <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> or kindly feeling, as Philip represents it; for it is no free gift but the mere payment of a debt. Consequently he is <foreign lang="greek">a)xa/ristos</foreign>, and we owe him no <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign>, or gratitude, in return. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c7s6" type="section" n="6">
						<p>&lsquo;And (in estimating the value of the feeling or act of benevolence) we must examine it under all the Categories; for <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> may be referred to that of substance (the fact) or quantity, or quality, or time, or place&rsquo;. Schrader has illustrated the first three of these, but examples are hardly necessary where they so readily suggest themselves. Brandis, in the tract so often cited [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i], p. 26, observes on this passage, that though there can be no doubt that when Aristotle wrote this he had the list of categories lying before him, whether or no the <hi rend="italic">book</hi> was then written cannot be decided. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And it is a sign (of the <foreign lang="greek">a)xaristi/a</foreign>, the absence of benevolent feeling, that there was no intention of obliging us, and that we therefore owe <pb n="93"/> them no thanks), if people have previously refused a smaller service<note anchored="yes">Toup, quoted by Gaisford, very unnecessarily conjectures <foreign lang="greek">ei) e)/latton me\n</foreign>, &lsquo;si minus dederint quam par esset.&rsquo;</note>&rsquo;, because it is clear that they must have had some interested motive in conferring the greater, which destroys the favour: &lsquo;or if they have done the same or equal or greater to our enemies; for it is plain that here again the service was not disinterested&rsquo;, was not done for our sake. &lsquo;Or if the service was worthless, and the doer of it knew it to be so&rsquo;;&mdash;(like the &lsquo;Calabrian host&rsquo; and his pears, <hi rend="italic">porcis comedenda</hi>, which he tries to force upon his unwilling guest; Hor.

						<p>Pity, according to the popular definition, which is all that Rhetoric requires, is a feeling of pain that arises on the occasion of any evil, or suffering, manifest, evident (<hi rend="italic">apparent</hi>, to the eye or ear), deadly or (short of that) painful, when unmerited; and also of such a kind as we may expect to happen either to ourselves or to those near and dear to us, and that when it seems to be near at hand: for it is plain that any one who is capable of feeling (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> is to feel) the emotion of pity must be such as to suppose himself liable to suffer evil of some kind or other, himself or his friends; and evil of that kind which has been stated in the definition, or like it, or nearly like it. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nw|</foreign> = <foreign lang="greek">fanerw=|</foreign>, evident, unmistakable, see note on p. 10 (II 2. 1). Victorius understands it to mean &ldquo;quod nobis malum videatur: possemus enim in hoc falli, atque eam miseriam esse iudicare quae minime sit.&rdquo; But this surely would be expressed by <foreign lang="greek">dokei=n</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">fai/nesqai</foreign>: and to say nothing of the numerous examples by which the other interpretation is supported, (some of which are given in the note above referred to,) this seems to be more appropriate to what follows, and to the nature of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> itself: for the feeling of pity is strong in proportion to the vividness with which the suffering is brought home to us<note anchored="yes" n="2">A remark of Lessing, at the end of the first section of his <hi rend="italic">Laokoon</hi>, will serve as a commentary on Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nw|</foreign>. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Alles stoische ist untheatralisch; und unser mitleiden ist allezeit dem leiden gleichm&auml;ssig welches der interessirende gegenstand &auml;ussert. Sieht man ihn sein elend mit grosser seele ertragen, so wird diese gross seele zwar unsere bewunderung erwecken, aber die bewunderung ist ein kalter affekt, dessen unth&auml;tiges staunen jede andere w&auml;rmere leidenschaft, so wie jede andere deutliche vorstellung, ausschliesset.</hi>&rdquo;</note>. The actual sight of it, when we <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the effect of the injury (and perhaps also a graphic description of it from an eye-witness), gives it a reality and a force which <pb n="94"/> intensify our sympathy. That this is Aristotle's meaning appears most clearly from a subsequent passage, &sect; 8, where these painful things are enumerated, and are found to be all of them bodily affections: and still more perhaps from &sect; 14, where the effect of <foreign lang="greek">pro\ o)mma/twn poiei=n</foreign> is described. Aristotle has omitted, designedly or not, all mention of mental suffering: perhaps he thought that not being actually <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> it was incapable of exciting pity. See further on this in note on II 8. 8. </p>
						<p>Again, this view of the meaning of the word is in exact agreement with a preceding observation upon pain, II 4. 31, that &lsquo;all painful things are objects of sense, (that is, all feelings which can properly be called painful are excited by sensible objects,)<note anchored="yes">This however seems to require some qualification: it is true of course of all bodily pain; but are not certain mental states, as doubt, suspense, uncertainty, disappointment, also painful? In the case of <foreign lang="greek">e)/leos</foreign>, Ar. probably means that at least some sensible image, a mental representative, or <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>, proceeding from some object of sense, is required to excite the painful feeling. But surely we can pity the mental as well as the bodily sufferings of a friend, provided he makes them sufficiently distinct and intelligible to us.</note> and the greatest evils, as wickedness and folly, are the least sensible; for the presence of vice causes no pain&rsquo;. Victorius, who however does not refer to this passage, has pointed out that the kind of evil which excites pity is distinguished and limited by the epithets <foreign lang="greek">fqartikw=| kai\ luphrw=|</foreign>; which upon the principle laid down in c. 4. 31 excludes the greatest evils, moral and intellectual, as objects of pity. </p>
						<p>With <foreign lang="greek">tou= a)naci/ou tugxa/nein</foreign> comp. II 9. 1, <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/keitai tw=| e)leei=n...o(\ kalou=si nemesa=|n: tw=| ga\r lupei=sqai e)pi\ tai=s a)naci/ais kakopragi/ais k.t.l.</foreign> When a bad man suffers we look upon it as a deserved punishment, and feel no pity, unless we deem the punishment to be excessive. &lsquo;Alas&rsquo;, says Carlyle, of the end of the Girondins, &lsquo;whatever quarrel we had with them, has not cruel fate abolished it? Pity only survives.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, Pt. III. Bk. IV. c. 8, ult. </p>
						<p>The last clause of the definition, <foreign lang="greek">o(\ ka)\n au)to/s k.t.l.</foreign>, expresses the compassion, sympathy with the sufferer, the fellow-feeling, implied in pity. <hi rend="italic">Haud ignara mali miseris succurrere disco.</hi> It is only in this form, as &lsquo;compassion&rsquo;, that the emotion enters into Mr Bain's list; <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 112, [chap. VII &sect; 22, ed. 1875]. Compassion, according to him, is one of the benevolent affections, a group subordinate to the family of Tender Emotions. This appears to be a juster view of the nature and connexion of the feeling than the account given by Aristotle. The fact is, as I have elsewhere stated<note anchored="yes" n="2"><hi rend="italic">Review of Aristotle's System of Ethics</hi>, 1867, p. 52.</note>, that the conception of general benevolence and love and duty to our fellow-creatures, is of modern and Christian origin, and finds no place in Aristotle's Ethical System: the <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> of the preceding chapter includes but <pb n="95"/> a small part of it, being in fact confined to doing a service to a friend in need. Again the limitation of pity to those sufferings to which we ourselves or our friends are exposed, ascribes a selfishness to the emotion which seems not necessarily to belong to it. In fact if this were true, the God of the Christian, and the gods of the heathen would be alike incapable of it. Hobbes, in accordance with his theory of universal selfishness, goes beyond Aristotle in attributing the feeling solely to self-love. <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, Pt. I. c. 6, &lsquo;Grief for the calamity of another is Pity; and ariseth from the imagination that the like calamity may befall himself; and therefore is called also Compassion, and in the phrase of this present time a Fellow-feeling. And therefore&rsquo; (he continues, another point of contact with Aristotle,) &lsquo;for calamity arising from great wickedness the best men have the least pity; and for the same calamity those have pity that think themselves least obnoxious to the same.&rsquo; [Hobbes, as is well known, analysed Aristotle's treatise in his <hi rend="italic">Brief of the Art of Rhetorick</hi>, first printed <hi rend="italic">with</hi> date in 1681. The <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> was published in 1651. S.] </p>
						<p>The Stoic definition, quoted by Victorius from Diog. Laert., Zeno, VII 1, is in partial agreement with that of Aristotle, but omits the last clause; <foreign lang="greek">e)/leo/s e)sti lu/ph w(s e)pi\ a)naci/ws kakopaqou=nti</foreign>. Whence Cicero, Tusc. Disp. IV 8. 18, <hi rend="italic">misericordia est aegritudo ex miseria alterius iniuria laborantis.</hi> But the Stoics, though they thus defined pity, nevertheless condemned the exercise of it: Diog.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ diapefeugo/tes</lemma>] This is a remarkable exemplification of that rule of Rhetoric, that every question has two sides, of which either may be maintained indifferently according to circumstances, and that all its materials and reasonings are confined to the sphere of the probable.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi( deilo/teroi ma=llon</lemma>] It is quite possible to find a distinct meaning for both these comparatives and not regard them as mere tautology. The comparative in Greek, Latin, English, when it stands alone, with the object of comparison suppressed, has two distinguishable significations; <foreign lang="greek">ma=llon</foreign>, for example, is either (1) <foreign lang="greek">ma=llon tou= de/ontos</foreign>, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">too</hi> much&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">ne quid nimis</hi>), more than it ought to be; or (2), what we express by &lsquo;rather&rsquo;, (itself a comparative of <hi rend="italic">rathe</hi> &lsquo;early&rsquo;&mdash;comp.

						<p>&lsquo;We have now stated the moods of mind in which men are inclined to pity; what the objects of pity are, is plain to be seen from the definition: that is, of things which cause pain and suffering all are pitiable that are also destructive, and (in fact) everything that is destructive and ruinous; and all evils of which chance is the cause, provided they be of sufficient magnitude&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">luphra\ kai\ o)dunhra/</foreign>, Victorius and Schrader are agreed, that <foreign lang="greek">luphro/s</foreign> represents <hi rend="italic">mental</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">o)dunhro/s</foreign> <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi>, pain or suffering. But it is certain that in ordinary usage either of them can be applied to both. That <foreign lang="greek">lu/ph</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">luphro/s</foreign> include bodily pain appears from the regular opposition of <foreign lang="greek">h(donh/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">lu/ph</foreign> expressing pleasure and pain <hi rend="italic">in general:</hi> equally so in Aristotle's psychology, where <foreign lang="greek">h(donh/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">lu/ph</foreign> are the necessary accompaniments of sensation <hi rend="italic">in all animals;</hi> and in Plato's moral philosophy (Gorgias, Phaedo, Philebus, &amp;c.), where they most unmistakably include all kinds of pleasures and pains. <foreign lang="greek">o)du/nh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o)dunhro/s</foreign>, though most frequently perhaps applied to pain of body (as especially in Homer, also in Plato and in Soph. Phil. 827, <foreign lang="greek">o)du/nh</foreign> <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi>, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">a)/lgos</foreign> <hi rend="italic">mental</hi>, pain), can also be used to express <hi rend="italic">mental</hi> suffering, as may be seen by consulting Rost and Palm's Lexicon. <foreign lang="greek">*)odu/nh</foreign>, proprie corporis......transfertur ad animi dolorem (Ellendt, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Soph.</hi> s. v.). The derivation of <foreign lang="greek">o)du/nh</foreign> from a root <hi rend="italic">ed</hi> &lsquo;eat&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">e)/dw, e)sqi/w</foreign> <hi rend="italic">edo</hi>, and of <foreign lang="greek">lu/ph</foreign> from a root <hi rend="italic">lup</hi> &lsquo;to break&rsquo;, (Curtius, <hi rend="italic">Grundz. der Gr. Etym.</hi> I. pp. 218, 240,) throws no light upon <pb n="100"/> the distinction between them: both, according to the natural growth of language, have a physical origin, and are transferred by metaphor to the expression of mental affections. But, read by the light of the explanatory &sect; 8, the difficulty is at once cleared up. Only <foreign lang="greek">o)dunhra/</foreign> is repeated, which shews that the difference between this and <foreign lang="greek">luphra/</foreign> is&mdash;here at all events&mdash; one of expression merely and not of conception. This is confirmed by the details of things painful which are enumerated in &sect; 8, all of them evils affecting the body alone. And this is in fact an explanation of the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nw| kakw=|</foreign> in the definition, that being most evident or palpable which is presented immediately to the sense. Comp. note on <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nw|</foreign> &sect; 1. </p>
						<p>Of <foreign lang="greek">a)nairetika/</foreign> Victorius says that it is not in itself precisely distinguishable in sense from <foreign lang="greek">fqartika/</foreign>, but (as I have expressed in the translation) the latter term applies only to some particular cases of <foreign lang="greek">luphra/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o)dunhra/</foreign>, whilst <foreign lang="greek">a)naipetika/</foreign> is extended to <hi rend="italic">all things</hi> destructive. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c8s9" type="section" n="9">
						<p>&lsquo;Painful and destructive are, death&rsquo; (in its various forms, plur. <hi rend="italic">sundry kinds of death</hi>) &lsquo;and personal injuries&rsquo; (such as wounds or blows inflicted in an <hi rend="italic">assault</hi>&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">di/kh ai)ki/as</foreign> is an action of &lsquo;assault and battery&rsquo; under the Athenian law) &lsquo;and all bodily suffering or damage&rsquo; (of any kind, see <hi rend="italic">ante</hi> II 7. 3, and note), &lsquo;and old age, and disease, and want of food&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c8s10" type="section" n="10">
						<p>&lsquo;The evils which are due to chance (accident or fortune) are the entire lack, or scarcity, of friends&mdash;and therefore also to be severed&rsquo; (parted, divorced, torn away, <hi rend="italic">divelli, distrahi, ab aliquo</hi>, Cicero,) &lsquo;from friends and familiars is pitiable&mdash;personal ugliness or deformity, weakness of body, mutilation&rsquo; (or any maimed crippled condition of body, which prevents a man from taking an active part in the service of the state, and discharging his duties as a citizen). </p>
						<p>The three last of the evils mentioned, <foreign lang="greek">ai)=sxos, a)sqe/neia, a)naphri/a</foreign>, occur again, as Victorius notes (without the reference, which is also omitted by Gaisford who quotes him), Eth. N. III 7, 1114 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 22, seq., in a passage (which will serve as a partial commentary on the text of the Rhetoric) in which the distinction is drawn between defects and injuries bodily and mental as <hi rend="italic">misfortunes</hi>, due to nature or accident, and the same when we have brought them on ourselves by carelessness or vice. Thus <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxro/ths</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ai)=sxos</foreign> may be due to nature, <foreign lang="greek">dia\ fu/sin</foreign>, or to the neglect of athletic exercises, <foreign lang="greek">a)gumnasi/an</foreign>, or carelessness in general, <foreign lang="greek">a)me/leian</foreign>: in the former case it is the object not of censure but of pity; in the latter it is to be blamed. The same may be said of <foreign lang="greek">a)sqe/neia</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">ph/rwsis</foreign>, the equivalent of <foreign lang="greek">a)naphri/a</foreign> in the Rhetoric; the instance of the mutilation or crippled condition there given is <hi rend="italic">blindness;</hi> &lsquo;no one would reproach a man blinded either by nature or disease or a blow, but would rather pity him; but if <pb n="101"/> the blindness proceeded from drunkenness or any other form of licentiousness every one would condemn it&rsquo;. We have here the necessary qualification supplied which limits and distinguishes the cases in which ugliness, weakness and mutilation are really pitiable. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And when an ill result follows from what might naturally have been expected to lead to good&rsquo;, i. e. when in any enterprise or course of action, we have done everything that seemed likely to ensure success, and yet fail (or &lsquo;come to grief&rsquo;) in spite of all our endeavours, this again is a misfortune, or piece of <hi rend="italic">ill-luck:</hi> &lsquo;and the frequent repetition of accidents of this kind&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>Somewhat similar is the very common transition from dative to accusative, and especially when the adjective or participle is joined with an infinitive mood as the subject; in which case it may be considered as a kind of attraction: so Sympos. 176 D, <foreign lang="greek">ou)/te au)to\s e)qelh/saimi a)\n piei=n, ou)/te a)/llw| sumbouleu/saimi, a)/llws te kai\ kraipalw=nta e)/ti e)k th=s proterai/as</foreign>; where the participle is attracted back to <foreign lang="greek">piei=n</foreign>.

Instances of a change (without such attraction expressed, but apparently derived from it by analogy,) from dative (or genitive) to accusative may be found in Elmsley's note on Eur. Heracl. 693. Two of these are, Aesch. Choeph. 408, <foreign lang="greek">moi\ klu/ousan</foreign>, and Soph. El. 479, <foreign lang="greek">u(/pesti/ moi qra/sos...klu/ousan</foreign>. Add Plat. Rep.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*diopei/qei</lemma>] This reference to the death of Diopeithes, commander of the Athenian troops who defended the Thracian Chersonese against the incursions of Philip, B.C. 342&mdash;341, see Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gr.</hi> [Chap. 90] Vol. XI p. 622 seq., furnishes one additional item of evidence, hitherto I believe unnoticed, as to the date of publication of the Rhetoric. Demosthenes defended Diopeithes and his conduct against the Philippizing party at Athens in the speeches <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tw=n e)n *xerronh/sw|</foreign> and the third Philippic, both spoken in the last half of 341. Grote, u. s., p. 624. The earliest date assignable to the death of Diopeithes is consequently 340 B.C. This may be added to the passages, which go to fix the date of this work, cited in the Introd. p. 37 seq. Little more is known of Diopeithes: the references to him in Demosthenes are collected by Baiter and Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom.</hi> p. 40. Most of them occur in the two speeches above mentioned: he is referred to again in the letter attributed to Philip (Orat. 12), and de Cor. &sect; 70, as the author of a certain <foreign lang="greek">yh/fisma</foreign> together with Eubulus and Aristophon. In the Schol. on Demosth. (Baiter and Sauppe, u. s., III p. 72 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17) <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tw=n e)n *xerronh/sw|</foreign>, we have the following notice, <foreign lang="greek">ou(=tos o( *diopei/qhs</foreign> (there are three others named in the Orators) <foreign lang="greek">path\r h)=n *mena/ndrou tou= kwmikou= o( de\ *me/nandros fi/los h)=n *dhmosqe/nous, di) o(\n u(pe\r *diopei/qous bouleu/etai</foreign>.

III.). Diodorus apud Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici</hi>, p. 315: on Ochus, ib. p. 316. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c8s12" type="section" n="12">
						<p>&lsquo;These and the like are the things (the ills or sufferings) that we pity: the objects of pity (persons) are our friends and acquaintance&mdash;provided they are not very closely connected with us; for in regard of the latter we are in the same state of mind&rsquo; (have the same feelings, i. e. in this case the feeling of anxiety and alarm) &lsquo;as we are about ourselves when threatened with (the like disaster)&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">me/llontas</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">tau)ta\ pei/sesqai</foreign>). &lsquo;And for this reason it was that Amasis, as is reported, wept, not at the sight of his son led away to death, but of his friend begging: for this is a spectacle of pity, that of terror: for the terrible is distinct from the pitiable, nay, it is exclusive of pity, and often serviceable for the excitement of the opposite feeling&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The king of Egypt, here by an oversight called Amasis, was in reality Psammenitus, his successor on the throne. The horrible story of Cambyses' ferocious cruelty here alluded to is told by Herodotus III 14, with his accustomed naivet&eacute;, as if there was nothing in it at all extraordinary or unusual. It will be sufficient to quote in the way of illustration Psammenitus' answer to Cambyses' inquiry, why he acted as Aristotle describes, which will likewise serve as a commentary on <foreign lang="greek">oi)keio/thti</foreign> in our text. <foreign lang="greek">w)= pai= *ku/rou, ta\ me\n oi)kh/i+a h)=n me/zw kaka\ h)\ w(/ste a)naklai/ein, to\ de\ tou= e(tai/rou pe/nqos a)/cion h)=n dakru/wn: o(\s e)k pollw=n kai\ eu)daimo/nwn e)kpesw\n ei) ptwxhi+/hn a)pi/ktai e)pi\ gh/raos ou)dw=|. ta\ oi)kh/i+a</foreign> are, his <hi rend="italic">son's</hi> death, and his <hi rend="italic">daughter's</hi> humiliation. As to the substitution of Amasis for Psammenitus, Victorius and Buhle think it may be explained either by a slip of memory on Aristotle's part, or by a variation in the story in the account given by other authorities. I have no doubt myself that the true explanation is the former. We have already seen that our author is very liable to misquotation, as I believe to be the case with all or most of those who, having a wide range of reading and an unusually retentive memory, are accustomed to rely too confidently upon the latter faculty. The vague <foreign lang="greek">w(s fasi/n</foreign> confirms this view. If Aristotle had remembered as he set down his example that he had it from Herodotus, it seems to me quite certain that he would have mentioned his name. </p>

He quotes Eth. Nic. III 15, sub fin., (<foreign lang="greek">ai( e)piqumi/ai</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">a)\n mega/lai kai\ sfodrai\ w)=sin, kai\ to\n logismo\n e)kkrou/ousin</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xrh/simon</lemma>] seems to refer to the rhetorical <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of the topic, rather than to the promotion of the feeling itself, to which the word is less appropriate. On the mutual exclusiveness of terror and pity compare I 14. 5 (note), and &sect; 5 of this chapter. The pity and terror therefore, which it is the object of tragedy to excite and purify, Poet. VI 2, can never be simultaneous. </p>
						<p>I will just observe here in passing that these two emotions are appealed to in that branch of Rhetoric which was collectively called <hi rend="italic">affectus</hi> and divided into <hi rend="italic">indignatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">miseratio</hi>, technically <foreign lang="greek">dei/nwsis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)/leos; dei/nwsis</foreign> is otherwise called <foreign lang="greek">sxetliasmo/s</foreign> (Rhet. II 21. 10). Though they might be scattered over the whole speech, the proper place for them is the conclusion, the <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/logos</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">peroratio</hi>, because the impression is then most vivid and intense, and is &lsquo;left behind&rsquo;, like the bee's sting, in the minds of the audience, <foreign lang="greek">to\ ke/ntron e)gkate/leipe toi=s a)krowme/nois</foreign> (Eupolis, of Pericles). </p>

					<p>The subject of the following chapter, <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign>, is briefly noticed by Aristotle, Eth. Nic. II 7 sub fin., together with <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign>, as a <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, an instinctive emotion, which approaches nearly to a virtue, and may therefore be included in a list of virtues. The detailed description of it, which ought to have followed that of <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign> in IV 15, is lost, together probably with some concluding observations leading up to the separate discussion of justice in Bk. V., and justifying its connexion with the other virtues and conformity to the law of the &lsquo;mean&rsquo;, which is barely mentioned in the fifth book as it stands at present. <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> is defined in Eth. N. II 7, as here, <foreign lang="greek">o( nemeshtiko\s lupei=tai e)pi\ toi=s a)naci/ws eu)= pra/ttousin</foreign>, and is placed in the scheme as a mean, or virtuous state of feeling, between <foreign lang="greek">fqo/nos</foreign> the excess, and <foreign lang="greek">e)pixairekaki/a</foreign> the defect, of indignation. Of this we shall have to speak further in the explanation of &sect;&sect; 2&mdash;5, which reads like a criticism and retraction of the misstatement of the Ethics, and very much strengthens the evidence of the later composition, as well as publication, of the Rhetoric. See Introd. p. 48. A definition of <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">fqo/nos</foreign> is found likewise in Top. B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 36, <foreign lang="greek">fqo/nos e)sti\ lu/ph e)pi\ fainome/nh| eu)pragi/a| tw=n e)pieikw=n tino/s</foreign>, and again, p. 110 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1, <foreign lang="greek">fqonero\s o( lupou/menos e)pi\ tai=s tw=n a)gaqw=n eu)pragi/ais, nemeshtiko\s d'  o( lupou/menos e)pi\ tai=s tw=n kakw=n eu)pragi/ais</foreign>.

					<p>Of the earlier notion of <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign>, alluded to in the foregoing passage, viz. that of divine vengeance or retribution, or the power that exercises it, a good description is found in a fragment of Euripides, Fr. Inc. 181 (Dind.), <foreign lang="greek">o(/tan d'  i)/dh|s pro\s u(/yos h)rme/non tina/, lamprw=| te plou/tw| kai\ ge/nei gaurou/menon, o)fru=n te mei/zw th=s tu/xhs e)phrko/ta: tou/tou taxei=an ne/mesin eu)qu\ prosdo/ka: e)pai/retai ga\r mei=zon i(/na mei=zon pe/sh|</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">tolluntur in altum, ut lapsu graviore ruant.</hi> Claudian, in Rufinum, I 22.]. </p>
					<p>This doctrine of the <foreign lang="greek">a)rxai=oi</foreign> is well illustrated by two stories in Herodotus, that of the interview between Solon and Croesus, I 29&mdash;33, and <pb n="108"/> what followed it c. 34, <foreign lang="greek">meta\ de\ *so/lwna oi)xo/menon, e)/labe e)k qeou= ne/mesis mega/lh *kroi=son: w(s ei)ka/sai, o(/ti e)no/mize e(wuto\n ei)=nai a)nqrw/pwn a(pa/ntwn o)lbiw/taton</foreign>: and the story of Polycrates, III 39&mdash;43. On these two stories see the remarks in Grote's <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gr.</hi> IV 263, and 325 [Chap. XI and XXXIII]. </p>
					<p>Compare also Hom. Od. XIV 283, <foreign lang="greek">*dio\s d'  w)pi/zeto mh=nin ceini/ou, o(/ste ma/lista nemessa=tai kaka\ e)/rga</foreign>. Herodotus says in another place, VII 10, <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r e)a=| frone/ein a)/llon me/ga o( *qeo\s h)\ e(wuto/n</foreign>. Aeschylus (Fr. Inc. 281, Dind.) has presented <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> in its human aspect as the natural indignation which is felt at undeserved good fortune, <foreign lang="greek">kakoi\ ga\r eu)= pra/ssontes ou)k a)nasxetoi/</foreign>. Fr. Inc. 243, line 3, <foreign lang="greek">h(mw=n ge me/ntoi *ne/mesis e)sq'  u(perte/ra, kai\ tou= qano/ntos h( di/kh pra/ssei ko/ton</foreign>. </p>
					<p>According to Aristotle's definition of <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> &lsquo;a feeling of pain at undeserved good fortune&rsquo;, it represents the &lsquo;righteous indignation&rsquo;, arising from a sense of the claims of justice and desert, which is aroused in us by the contemplation of success without merit, and a consequent pleasure in the punishment of one who is thus undeservedly prosperous. It is no selfish feeling, &sect; 3; if it had any reference to oneself and one's own interests it would be <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> of evil consequences arising to us from the other's prosperity, and not <hi rend="italic">indignation.</hi> It implies also its opposite, the feeling of pleasure at deserved success or prosperity. In this narrow sense it is treated in the present chapter. It is in fact one form in which &lsquo;moral disapprobation&rsquo;, founded upon the distinction of right and wrong, shews itself in our nature. Aristotle, in classing it with the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, makes it <hi rend="italic">instinctive;</hi> not therefore a virtue, nor necessarily requiring moral cultivation. Of moral approbation and disapprobation see the account given by Butler, at the commencement of his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Nature of Virtue.</hi> He also seems to regard these two as natural instincts, when he says of them, &ldquo;we naturally and unavoidably approve of some actions under the peculiar view of their being virtuous and of good desert; and disapprove others as vicious and of ill desert.&rdquo; See also Serm. VIII. &lsquo;On deliberate anger or resentment.&rsquo; Prof. Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 321, [Chap. XV &sect; 22, ed. 1875], in treating of &lsquo;moral disapprobation&rsquo;, expresses himself thus; &ldquo;the feeling that rises up towards that person (a guilty agent) is a strong feeling of displeasure or dislike, proportioned to the strength of our regard to the violated duty. There arises a moral resentment, or a disposition to inflict punishment upon the offender,&rdquo; &amp;c. But such an instinctive sense of right and wrong has a much wider scope and sphere of action than Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign>, which is confined to one particular class of cases upon which this moral instinct or faculty operates. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c9s1" type="section" n="1">

Aj. 136, <foreign lang="greek">se\ me\n eu)= pra/ssont'  e)pixai/rw</foreign>. Eur. Hippol. 1355, <foreign lang="greek">tou\s ga\r eu)sebei=s qeoi\ qnh/skontas ou) xai/rousin</foreign>, where the dying are just as much the objects of the joy (or the absence of it) as the murderers are of the pain in the passage before us. Similarly <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nesqai</foreign>, (frequent in the Rhet. and elsewhere,) as in Eur. Ion 1074, where <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nomai to\n polu/umnon qeo/n</foreign>, is to feel awe <hi rend="italic">in the presence of</hi> the god; who is the object of this feeling of shame, just as the murderers are of the painful feeling. Victorius thinks that the prepos. <foreign lang="greek">dia/</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">understood</hi>, &lsquo;as it often is in the Attic writers, such as Thucydides, Lysias, Aristophanes&rsquo;! He contents himself however with the general assertion, and quotes no example. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And all these (<foreign lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign> is explained by <foreign lang="greek">o( ga/r</foreign>, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich</hi>&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">k.t.l.</foreign>) belong to the same kind of character (or disposition), and their opposites <pb n="112"/> to the opposite temper; that is to say, it is the same sort of man that takes a malicious pleasure in mischief and that is given to envy; for whenever the acquisition or possession of anything (by another) is painful to a man (envy), he must needs feel pleasure at the privation or destruction of the same (<foreign lang="greek">e)pixairekaki/a</foreign>)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ste/rhsis</lemma>, Categ. 10, is one of the four kinds of opposites, relative opposites, contraries (as black and white), state and privation (<foreign lang="greek">e(/cis, ste/rhsis</foreign>), affirmation and negation. <foreign lang="greek">ste/rhsis</foreign> is defined ib. 12 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26 seq. It is the absence or want of a state which is <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> and usual to that in which the state resides, as sight to the eye: <foreign lang="greek">tuflo\n ou) to\ mh\ e)/xon o)/yin, a/lla\ to\ mh\ e)/xein o(/te pe/fuken e)/xein</foreign>. A man's blindness is a <foreign lang="greek">ste/rhsis</foreign>, because with him sight is natural: the term is not applicable to animals born without eyes, <foreign lang="greek">e)k geneth=s ou)k o)/yin e)/xonta</foreign>: these cannot properly be said to be deprived of sight, which they never had. <foreign lang="greek">ste/rhsis</foreign> therefore in the present passage implies a loss of some good which had been previously gained or possessed, and is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">fqora/</foreign>, as privation or loss from ruin or destruction. Victorius understands <foreign lang="greek">fqora=|</foreign> of destruction, decay, as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">gene/sei</foreign> which is implied in <foreign lang="greek">gignome/nw|</foreign>; a man may be deprived of or lose a <hi rend="italic">possession</hi>, that which grows may decay and come to nothing, &lsquo;Interitus manifesto generationi alicuius rei contrarius est.&rsquo; I cannot think this interpretation as appropriate as the other: <foreign lang="greek">gi/gnesqai</foreign>, to come to the possession of something, to gain or acquire it, is properly opposed to <foreign lang="greek">u(pa/rxein</foreign>, to have it already in possession, long-standing and settled. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore all these feelings (<foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis, fqo/nos, e)pixairekaki/a</foreign>) are obstructive of pity, but different (in other respects) for the reasons already stated; so that they are all alike serviceable for making things appear not pitiable&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The introduction of these episodical remarks, &sect;&sect; 3&mdash;5, upon the connexion and distinctions of the three <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> above mentioned, otherwise not easy to explain, may possibly be accounted for, as I have already suggested, by referring them to the statements of Eth. Nic. II 7, 1108 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 4, which Ar. now sees must be retracted. There they are reduced to the law of the mean by making <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> the mean state of the pleasure and pain felt at our neighbour's good or ill fortune; of which <foreign lang="greek">fqo/nos</foreign> is the excess, the pain being felt at all good fortune deserved or undeserved, and <foreign lang="greek">e)pixairekaki/a</foreign> the defect &lsquo;because the feeling falls so short of pain that it is actually pleasure&rsquo;. The words of &sect; 5, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e)/sti tou= h)/qous...o( ga\r au)to\s e)sti\n e)pixaire/kakos kai\ fqonero/s, k.t.l.</foreign> are, whether they are intended for it or not, a correction of the blunder made in the Ethics. It is plain enough, as we are here told in the Rhetoric, that the two <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> in question are but two different phases of the same <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> or mental disposition: the same man who feels pain at his neighbour's good fortune <pb n="113"/> will feel pleasure at his misfortunes, and the two cannot be opposed as extremes. Again, the description of <foreign lang="greek">e)pixairekaki/a</foreign> as a defect of <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> and opposite of <foreign lang="greek">fqo/nos</foreign> cannot be sustained: the <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of the two feelings are different: <hi rend="italic">envy</hi> is directed against the <hi rend="italic">good</hi> fortune of another, the <hi rend="italic">malicious pleasure</hi> of the other is excited by his <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> fortune. See also Grant's note on the above passage of the Ethics. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Let us begin then with an account of righteous indignation, who, that is, are the objects of it, the occasions that give rise to it, and the states of mind of the subjects of it, and then pass on to the rest (of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, to what remains to be said of them)&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c9s7" type="section" n="7">
						<p>&lsquo;The first of these is plain from what has been already said, for if righteous indignation is (as it has been defined) a feeling of pain which is roused against any one who appears to enjoy unmerited prosperity, it is clear first of all that this indignation cannot possibly be applied (directed) to every kind of good&rsquo;; (virtue for example and the virtues are exceptions.) </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c9s8" type="section" n="8">
						<p>&lsquo;For no one is likely to feel indignant with one who becomes just, or brave, or acquires any virtue in general&rsquo;, (that is, one who by exercise and cultivation attains to any special virtue, or to a virtuous character in general)&mdash;&lsquo;nor indeed is compassion&rsquo; (the plur. <foreign lang="greek">e)/leoi</foreign> indicates the various acts, states, moments of the feeling) &lsquo;bestowed upon (applied to) the opposites of these&rsquo; (vices, namely, which ought to be the case, if the others were true)&mdash;&lsquo;but to wealth and power and such like, all such things, namely, to speak in general terms (without mentioning possible exceptions, <foreign lang="greek">a(plw=s</foreign> opposed to <foreign lang="greek">kaq'  e(/kaston</foreign>), as the good (alone) deserve&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>So far the meaning is clear; the good as a general rule are entitled to the enjoyment of wealth and power and the like, and when they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> acquire them we feel no indignation because we know they deserve them; it is upon the undeserving that our indignation is bestowed. But as the text stands, and as far as I can see there is no other way of understanding it, there is another class of persons, viz. those who are endowed with natural or personal advantages, such as birth or beauty, which, being independent of themselves and mere gifts of nature, cannot be objects of moral indignation, though they may be of envy, who are coupled with the morally good as deserving <pb n="114"/> of wealth and power. This however cannot possibly be Aristotle's meaning: birth and beauty certainly have no claim <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> to any other advantages. When a bad man makes his way to wealth or power, we infer that they have been acquired by fraud or injustice, and thence that he is undeserving of them, which excites our indignation; but no such inference can be drawn from the possession of birth or beauty, there is no such thing as illicit, or undeserved possession of them. Aristotle seems to have meant, what Victorius attributes to him, that, besides moral excellence, <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> gifts and excellences are also exempt from righteous indignation, for the reason above given&mdash;that they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> gifts of nature, and the possessors are in no way responsible for them: and this is fully confirmed by the connexion of what immediately follows. Bekker, Spengel, Buhle and the rest are alike silent upon the difficulty, and Victorius, though he puts what is probably the right interpretation upon the passage, has not one word to shew how such interpretation can be extracted from the received text. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And seeing that antiquity (possession of long standing) appears to be a near approach to a natural gift or endowment&rsquo; (i. e. to carry with it a claim or right, nearly approaching to that conferred by nature), &lsquo;of two parties, that have possession of the same good, the one that has come by it recently, and thereby attained his prosperity, provokes the higher degree of indignation: for the <hi rend="italic">nouveaux riches</hi> give more offence than those whose wealth is transmitted from olden time and by right of family (or inheritance): and the like may be said of magistracies (offices of state), of power (in general), of abundance of friends, of happiness in children (a fair and virtuous family), and anything else of the same sort. Or again, any other good that accrues to them, due to the same causes; for in fact in this case again the newly enriched who have obtained office by their wealth (been promoted in consequence of their wealth) give more pain (or offence) than those whose wealth is hereditary. And the like in all similar cases&rsquo;. Comp.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ma/lista me\n ou)=n</lemma>] The <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> in this phrase is the ordinary correlative of <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> in the next sentence, <foreign lang="greek">ei) de\ mh/</foreign><note anchored="yes">I will venture here to express my conviction that Dr Donaldson is right in the account he gives of these two particles, <hi rend="italic">New Crat.</hi> &sect;&sect; 154, 155; that <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> viz. is the neut. of an older form <foreign lang="greek">mei/s, mi/a, me/n</foreign>, of which <foreign lang="greek">mi/a</foreign> alone remains in the language, the numeral &lsquo;one&rsquo;; and <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> connected with <foreign lang="greek">du/o</foreign> &lsquo;two&rsquo;; though as far as I know he stands alone in the opinion; the origin usually assigned to it being that it is a weaker form of <foreign lang="greek">dh/</foreign>. Donaldson's view of the primary meaning and derivation of these particles is so completely in accordance with all their actual usages, and is so simple and natural, that it seems to me to carry with it its own evidence, and to need no further proof of its truth.</note>. The other particle, <foreign lang="greek">ou)=n</foreign>, though its <pb n="117"/> precise meaning in this context may not be quite certain, and it is somewhat unusual in this collocation, is nevertheless fully justified by similar examples to be quoted immediately. The origin of the particle is, as it seems to me, as yet unexplained. It has been traced to various roots, as may be seen by consulting Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi> &sect; 189, Klotz on Devar. <hi rend="italic">de Partic.</hi> p. 717 seq., Hartung, <hi rend="italic">Partikell.</hi> II 8, Doderlein, and Rost, in Rost and Palm's <hi rend="italic">Lex.</hi>, but in none of these derivations have I been able to find any intelligible connexion with the actual senses of the word. Yet until we know the root of the word and its affinities, we shall hardly be able to trace historically the various senses which diverge from its primary meaning. It is a connective particle, which draws an inference or conclusion from something preceding, &lsquo;then, accordingly&rsquo;, (1) logically in an argument, and (2) in the continuation of a narrative, the <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> primarily implied having passed into the mere notion of what is <hi rend="italic">subsequent</hi>, &lsquo;that which <hi rend="italic">follows</hi>&rsquo;, in both its senses. Hence in all Greek authors <foreign lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign> is habitually employed in this second sense, like the French &lsquo;or&rsquo;, and our &lsquo;now&rsquo; or &lsquo;then&rsquo;, to impart a slight degree of liveliness and animation to a continuous narrative or discussion. From the first or inferential signification, it acquires this intermediate sense of, &lsquo;so then&rsquo;, &lsquo;well then&rsquo;, &lsquo;accordingly&rsquo;, which lies halfway between the logical and the temporal application; just like our &lsquo;then&rsquo;, which has both these senses, only derived in the reverse order, the particle of time in the English &lsquo;then&rsquo;, passing from the temporal to the logical use. For this <foreign lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign> at the commencement of a new paragraph the orators&mdash;Demosthenes in particular, with whom <foreign lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign> is comparatively rare, Aeschines in a less degree&mdash;often substitute <foreign lang="greek">toi/nun</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">me\n toi/nun</foreign>, which is used precisely in the same way. &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign>, in continuando sermone cum quadam <hi rend="italic">conclusionis</hi> significatione usurpatur.&rdquo; Hermann ad Viger. note 342. </p>
						<p>The other prevailing signification of <foreign lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign> when used in combination, which, though by no means confined to them, is found chiefly in dialogues as those of Plato and Aristophanes&mdash;in the former most frequently in the familiar <foreign lang="greek">pa/nu me\n ou)=n</foreign>&mdash;has a negative corrective sense conveying an emphatic assertion, sometimes to be rendered by a negative; being employed to correct, in the way of strengthening or heightening, a previous statement or assertion; and while it assents to a proposition indicates an advance beyond it. Dem. de Cor. &sect; 316, <foreign lang="greek">dia\ ta\s eu)ergesi/as, ou)/sas u(permege/qeis, ou) me\n ou)=n ei)/poi tis a)\n h(li/kas</foreign>.

In all these cases it may be translated &lsquo;nay more&rsquo;, or &lsquo;nay rather&rsquo;.

In all these cases it may be rendered &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">immo</hi>&rsquo;, &lsquo;nay rather&rsquo;. Herm. ad Vig. n. 343. In the same <pb n="118"/> sense it appears in the Aristophanic <foreign lang="greek">e)mou= me\n ou)=n, e)mou= me\n ou)=n</foreign>, &lsquo;no, mine; no mine&rsquo;, in answer to Cleon's nauseous offer to the Demus, Equit. 911; and elsewhere. <foreign lang="greek">pa/nu me\n ou)=n</foreign> is to be explained thus; I not only assent to what you say, but I go farther, I am absolutely convinced of it; &lsquo;nay more (or nay rather), absolutely so&rsquo;. The <foreign lang="greek">ou)=n</foreign> in all these instances, and others like them, conveying thus a strong emphasis, at the same time may be considered to retain its consequential sense, &lsquo;conclusionis significationem&rsquo;, indicative of what <hi rend="italic">follows</hi>, something else, &lsquo;accordingly&rsquo;, which is contained in the assent to the preceding statement, and thus the two usages of it are connected. The <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> in the combination of the two particles is explained by Dr Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi> &sect; 154&mdash;rightly I think &mdash;by a tacit reference to some suppressed sentence with the correlative <foreign lang="greek">de/, me/n</foreign> being always opposed to <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> expressed or understood. <foreign lang="greek">pa/nu me\n ou)=n</foreign> would imply <foreign lang="greek">a)/llws de\ ou)/</foreign>. (Donaldson supplies <foreign lang="greek">ti/ d'  e)/peita</foreign>; &lsquo;but what then?&rsquo;) Following this explanation we may render <foreign lang="greek">ma/lista me\n ou)=n</foreign> in our text &lsquo;nay more, most of all, in the highest degree&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Whence also this saying&rsquo;. Here follow two hexameter lines as an illustration of the foregoing topic; Cebriones, who knew that the divine vengeance falls upon those who attack their superiors, &lsquo;avoided the encounter of Ajax son of Telamon&rsquo;. Il. XI 542. This is followed by a line which is rejected by the recent editors from the text of Homer, but appears again in the Life of Homer, attributed to Plutarch. See Paley's note ad loc. &lsquo;(Chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> art, profession, or pursuit), <pb n="119"/> or if not in the same, any case whatsoever of competition of inferior with superior (understand <foreign lang="greek">a)mfisbhth=|</foreign>); of a musician, for instance, with a just man (&ldquo;ut si musicus cum iusto viro <hi rend="italic">de dignitate</hi> contendat.&rdquo; Victorius); because justice is better than music&rsquo;. The claims of the two are unequal, of which the inferior ought to be sensible. &lsquo;So now from all this it is clear what are the objects and occasions of righteous indignation; such they are (as we have described them) and such-like&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi(=s kai\ di) a(/,...dh=lon</lemma>] There is an inaccuracy here in the language, <foreign lang="greek">dh=lon</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">dh=loi</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">dh=la</foreign> in agreement with one or other of the antecedents to the relatives; or else <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> should be <foreign lang="greek">ti/sin</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">di) a(/, dia\ ti/na</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">poi=a</foreign>.

But here at all events it cannot have this meaning, for there is no alternative in Aristotle's text; and without it he is made to say, that it is <hi rend="italic">only</hi> &lsquo;seeming&rsquo; prosperity that gives rise to the feeling. See note on II 2. 1. Again he and Schrader both understand <foreign lang="greek">mh\ i(/na ti au)tw=|</foreign>[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], &lsquo;not from any dread of loss or danger, or prospect of advantage to oneself, from the other's good fortune&rsquo;, the second of which only is contained in <foreign lang="greek">i(/na ti au)tw=|</foreign>; the first would require <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">i(/na</foreign>; and also is contradictory to what was said in c. 9 &sect; 3, <foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ mh\ o(/ti au)tw=| ti sumbh/setai e(/teron,&mdash;ou) ga\r e)/ti e)/stai to\ me\n ne/mesis to\ de\ fqo/nos, a)lla\ fo/bos, e)a\n dia\ tou=to h( lu/ph u(pa/rxh| kai\ h( taraxh/, o(/ti au)tw=| ti e)/stai fau=lon a)po\ th=s e)kei/nou eu)praci/as</foreign>. </p>

					<p>Envy seems to have been regarded by the ancients as the worst and most distressing of all the painful emotions. <hi rend="italic">Invidia Siculi non invenere tyranni maius tormentum</hi>, says Horace, Epist. I 2. 58. <foreign lang="greek">*swkra/ths to\n fqo/non e)/fh yuxh=s ei)nai pri/ona</foreign>; and Menander, <foreign lang="greek">o( de\ to\ ka/kiston tw=n kakw=n pa/ntwn fqo/nos</foreign>, Men. Fr.

Hor.). &ldquo;Of all other affections (envy) is the most importune and continual......It is also the vilest affection and the most <pb n="122"/> depraved; for which cause it is the proper attribute of the devil,&rdquo; &amp;c. Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, Of Envy, sub fin. </p>
					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*fqo/non de\ skopw=n</lemma> (<foreign lang="greek">o( *swkra/ths</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">o(/ ti ei)/h, lu/phn me/n tina e)ceu/risken au)to\n o)/nta, ou)/te me/ntoi th\n e)pi\ fi/lwn a)tuxi/ais ou)/te th\n e)p'  e)xqrw=n eu)tuxi/ais gignome/nhn: a)lla\ mo/nous e)/fh fqonei=n tou\s e)pi\ tai=s tw=n fi/lwn eu)praci/ais a)niwme/nous</foreign>. Xen. Mem. III 9. 8 (quoted by Gaisford). Socrates defends this view of envy in the next sentence against the charge of paradox, by asserting that the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> is true, however paradoxical it may appear: still none but simpletons, <foreign lang="greek">h)liqi/ous</foreign>, are liable to the feeling, no wise man, <foreign lang="greek">fro/nimos</foreign>, is capable of it. This is in accordance with the doctrine that virtue is nothing but knowledge. However it is plain that it is a mistake to confine the feeling to the good fortune of <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> or those we love; and Aristotle has doubtless improved upon it by substituting his <foreign lang="greek">tou\s o(moi/ous</foreign>. The so-called Platonic <foreign lang="greek">o(/ros</foreign> runs thus, following Socrates, <foreign lang="greek">lu/ph e)pi\ fi/lwn a)gaqoi=s h)\ ou)=sin h)\ gegenhme/nois. *(/oroi</foreign>, 416 D. </p>
					<p>The Stoic definition, <foreign lang="greek">lu/phn e)p'  a)llotri/ois a)gaqoi=s</foreign>, Diog. Laert., Zeno, VII 111, which does not define the <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of the feeling, seems to have been the prevailing form of it. It is repeated by Cicero as Zeno's with additions, Tusc. Disp. IV 8. 17, <hi rend="italic">Invidentiam esse dicunt</hi> (Stoici) <hi rend="italic">aegritudinem susceptam propter alterius res secundas, quae nihil noceant invidenti. Nam si quis doleat eius rebus secundis a quo ipse laedatur, non recte dicatur invidere; ut si Hectori Agamemno: qui autem cui alterius commoda nihil noceant tamen eum doleat his frui, is invidet profecto.</hi> This leaves the objects of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> unlimited, which seems to be the true account of it. So Horace, Ep. I 2. 57, <hi rend="italic">Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis.</hi> </p>
					<p>I will conclude this note with two or three more modern definitions. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Grief</hi> for the success of a competitor in wealth, honour, or other good, if it be joined with endeavour to enforce our own abilities to equal or exceed him, is called Emulation: but joined with endeavour to supplant or hinder a competitor, Envy.&rdquo; Hobbes, <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, Of the Passions, Pt. 1, ch. 6. Envy and Emulation, <foreign lang="greek">zh=los</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">aemulatio</hi>, usually go together in a classification of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, being evidently closely connected. See the passages in Diog. Laert. and Cic. above quoted; and so also Aristotle. This definition very nearly approaches to that of Ar., only omitting the <foreign lang="greek">mh\ i(/na ti au)tw=|</foreign>. </p>
					<p>&ldquo;Envy&rdquo;, says Locke, <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, &amp;c., Bk. II. Ch. 20, <hi rend="italic">Of modes of pleasure and pain</hi>, &ldquo;is an uneasiness of the mind, caused by the consideration of a good we desire, obtained by one we think should not have had it before us.&rdquo; Here again the notion of &lsquo;competition&rsquo; enters into the definition. </p>
					<p>Lastly, Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, Ch. VII, classes this under the general head of emotions of self, and connects it, like his predecessors, with Emulation, &sect; 9 [p. 105, ed. 2, 1865]. Comparison and the desire of Superiority, lie at the bottom of both Emotions. &ldquo;The feeling of <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi> is much more general in its application. Referring to everything that is desirable in the condition of some more fortunate personage, there is <pb n="123"/> combined a strong wish for the like good to self, with an element of malevolence towards the favoured party.&rdquo; This differs from Aristotle in the introduction of the selfish and the malevolent elements, and removes the unnecessary restriction to cases of competition, by which he has limited its objects and scope. It is I believe a much truer and more philosophical account of the Emotion. </p>
					<p>Bacon's <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, Of Envy, has some points in common with Aristotle. Bacon places the sting of envy in the want of something which another possesses. &ldquo;A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth virtue in others. For men's minds will either feed upon their own good or upon others' evil; and who <hi rend="italic">wanteth</hi> the one will prey upon the other; and whoso is out of hope to attain to another's virtue will seek to come at even hand by depressing another's fortune.&rdquo; This introduces Aristotle's principle of rivalry and competition as the foundation of envy. Again, with &sect;&sect; 2 and 5, may be compared, &ldquo;Lastly, near kinsfolk and fellows in office and those that have been bred together, are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised. For it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes; and pointeth at them, and cometh oftener into their remembrance, and incurreth likewise more into the note of others: and envy ever redoubleth from speech and fame.&rdquo; This arises from their constant association, which gives frequent occasion to envy. &ldquo;Again, envy is ever joined with the comparing of a man's self; and where there is no comparison, no envy; and therefore kings are not envied but by kings;&rdquo; compared with the end of &sect; 5. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c10s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The occasions, objects, and mental dispositions, that give rise to envy may be clearly gathered from the definition of it; that it is, viz. a feeling of pain occasioned by manifest or conspicuous good fortune, the accession, that is, of any one of the good things previously mentioned, (chiefly) in the case of any one of those like us, for no personal advantage or gain to ourselves that is likely to accrue from it, but simply on their account: for such as have, or think they have, any like them, i. e. persons similar to themselves, in such things as are likely to bring them into rivalry and competition, will be most subject to the feeling of envy&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c10s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;By <hi rend="italic">like</hi> or <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> I mean, those who are of the same race (or are alike in stock), of the same family (relatives), alike in age, in states&rsquo;, mental and bodily (virtues of all kinds, accomplishments, acquirements, and excellences of mind and body, when developed, confirmed and permanent are <foreign lang="greek">e(/ceis</foreign>: <hi rend="italic">qui artibus scientiis et huiusmodi rebus pares sunt</hi>, Victorius: this may be included in the other, more general, meaning), &lsquo;in reputation, in property or possessions&rsquo; (of any kind, <hi rend="italic">patrimonio ac re familiari</hi>, Victorius). This is well illustrated by a passage of Cic. Brutus, c. XLII &sect; 156, quoted by Victorius on &sect; 5. <hi rend="italic">Simul illud gaudeo, quod et aequalitas vestra, et pares honorum gradus, et artium studiorumque finitima vicinitas, tantum abest ab obtrectatione invidiae, quae solet</hi> <pb n="124"/> <hi rend="italic">lacerare plerosque, uti ea non modo exulcerare vestram gratiam sed etiam conciliare videatur.</hi> </p>
						<p>In reality envy is not <hi rend="italic">confined</hi>, as Aristotle seems to say, to these classes of people as objects; nor even to those with whom we are likely to come into competition; it seems rather that there is no limit, within the circle of humanity, to the objects on which it may be exercised. A man may envy a baby its innocence, its health, its rosy cheeks, or the poorest and meanest his health and strength: the feeling of pain which belongs to envy no doubt proceeds from an involuntary comparison of oneself with another, who <hi rend="italic">has</hi> some valuable possession which we happen to <hi rend="italic">want;</hi> and the unsatisfied desire, contrasted with the gratification of it in some one else, friend or foe, good or bad, high or low, in a malevolent disposition&mdash;not in the <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> man, as Socrates has it&mdash;breeds the feeling of pain. Aristotle's definition may be thus summed up: envy is a feeling of pain, excited, usually if not always, by the successful competition of a real or supposed rival. &lsquo;Those also&rsquo; are disposed to it &lsquo;who (have nearly attained to) want but little of complete satisfaction (of possessing every thing desirable)&rsquo;. A long and uninterrupted course of success and prosperity, and the attainment of <hi rend="italic">nearly all</hi> that is desirable, seems to give them a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to what still remains deficient; and the envy which they would in any case feel of the possession of it by another, gains strength by the contrast with their own deficiency. Here again it is the competition and the comparison of our own condition with that of another, the want and the inferiority, that add a sting to envy. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And this is the reason why those who undertake great enterprises&mdash; engage in great actions&mdash;and the successful are envious: because they think that all such are carrying off what properly belong to themselves&rsquo;, i. e. the profits, honours, and distinctions to which they are entitled. The difference between this feeling and that of <foreign lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> is confined to this, that the latter distinguishes between the deserving and undeserving, the former does not.

						<p>&lsquo;And those who have a pre-eminent reputation for anything, and especially for wisdom or happiness&rsquo;. The latter, says Victorius, on account of its extreme rarity. These three classes, desiring to engross all the success, credit, good fortune, themselves, grudge the acquisition or possession of them by their competitors, or any others. &lsquo;And the ambitious are more prone to envy than the unambitious&rsquo;: because they set a higher value upon honours and distinctions. &lsquo;And the pretenders to wisdom and learning&rsquo; (like the Sophists, <foreign lang="greek">o( sofisth\s xrhmatisth\s a)po\ fainome/nhs sofi/as a)ll'  ou)k ou)/shs</foreign>, de Soph.

						<p>&lsquo;For everything of which men covet the reputation, or of which they are ambitious&mdash;be they deeds done or possessions acquired&mdash; striving after fame (the credit of the achievements and acquirements), and every kind of good fortune (successes and acquirements due to fortune, and not, like the others, to a man's own exertions),&mdash;with all these, as one may say, envy is concerned; and most of all, the objects of our own aspirations, or whatever we think we have a right to ourselves, or things of which the acquisition confers a slight superiority or a slight inferiority&rsquo;. A very great superiority or inferiority places a man beyond the reach of envy. It is when the competition is close, and the difference between the competitors small, that the apparent value of the good competed for is greatly enhanced, and the envy excited by the success of the opponent proportionately strong. </p>

						<p>In this last section there are two or three points requiring consideration which it will be as well to dispatch before proceeding to the translation. The first is, whether we are to read <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  oi(=s</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> without the prepos.; and then, what do <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  oi(=s</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si</foreign>, severally represent. Spengel, following MS A^{c} retains <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  oi(=s</foreign>; Bekker in his third ed., for once departs from that MS and reads <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign>, although, as it seems, none of the MSS give any various reading. It seems therefore on this ground preferable to retain <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  oi(=s</foreign> if we can; and we have next to consider how it is to be interpreted, and how distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si. e)f'  oi(=s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> are equally irregular after <foreign lang="greek">dh=lon</foreign> (see note on II 9. 11, at the end), and the grammar therefore throws no light upon the reading. As far as the grammar and interpretation are concerned there seems to be no objection to retaining <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/</foreign>. </p>
						<p>We have then to decide whether <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ti/si</foreign> stands for persons or things; either of which is possible. However if the choice is to be made between them, <foreign lang="greek">ti/si</foreign> seems the more natural representative of persons, and <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> of things; and so in general, throughout these analyses of the feelings, Aristotle is accustomed to designate the <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> who are the objects of them by the pronoun <foreign lang="greek">ti/nes</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Thirdly, there is no objection to <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si xai/rousin</foreign> in the sense of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">at</hi>&rsquo; or &lsquo;by whom they are pleased&rsquo; (lit. <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> whom their pleasure is bestowed or directed), &lsquo;in whom they find pleasure&rsquo;, though the bare <foreign lang="greek">ti/si</foreign> is more usual (possibly this may be Bekker's reason for his alteration [of <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  oi(=s</foreign>]); and if there were any doubt about it, it would be sufficiently supported by <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ poi/ois</foreign> (what sort of <hi rend="italic">persons</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">xai/rein</foreign>, c. 9. 16. Consequently, as I can see no sufficient reason for altering the text contrary to all manuscript authority, I have retained <foreign lang="greek">e)f'  oi(=s</foreign>, understanding it of <hi rend="italic">things</hi>, the occasions of joy or delight; and <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si</foreign> of the <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> who excite the feeling in us. <pb n="130"/> </p>
						<p>The next clause, <foreign lang="greek">w(s ga\r ou)k e)/xontes lupou=ntai, k.t.l.</foreign> presents some difficulty, and Muretus and the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Translatio</hi>, followed by Schrader and Wolf, reject the negative <foreign lang="greek">ou)k</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> as it stood in the MSS employed in the older editions). This however would make the two opposite feelings of pleasure and pain the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> state or disposition of mind, which I think could not possibly have been Aristotle's meaning. Victorius takes what I believe to be the right view on the point. The meaning will then be, that the negative, the contradictory, of pain, i. e. pleasure (the two never co-existing), is excited by the opposite circumstances to those which are productive of the pain of envy; if pain under particular circumstances is excited by the sight of the good fortune of another, substitute the opposite, ill fortune for good fortune in each case, and you will have the appropriate topics for giving rise to the feeling of pleasure in your audience. This, says Victorius, is <foreign lang="greek">e)pixairekaki/a</foreign>, wanton malice, malevolent pleasure in the misfortunes of others. The above interpretation is at all events free from the objection to which Schrader's is liable, namely that it makes Aristotle say that the same mental state or disposition is painful and pleasurable. The choice between the two depends mainly upon the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">oi( toiou=toi</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pw=s e)/xontes</foreign>. I understand by the former the <foreign lang="greek">fqoneroi/</foreign>, the common character of all the classes distinguished in the analysis; Schrader of the members of the several classes, the ambitious, the prosperous and successful; and in his view these classes must fall under the several &lsquo;states of mind&rsquo; designated by <foreign lang="greek">pw=s, w(s, ou(/tws, e)/xontes</foreign>, such as ambition; though how it can be applied to others, such as &lsquo;the prosperous and successful&rsquo;, his second instance, he does not inform us. If by the &lsquo;state of mind&rsquo; the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> or emotion is meant<note anchored="yes">This is certainly so. Take, for instance, the first words of the following chapter, <foreign lang="greek">pw=s d'  e)/xontes zhlou=si</foreign>, the state of mind in which <foreign lang="greek">zh=los</foreign> is shewn, or resides: which identifies <foreign lang="greek">zh=los</foreign> with the <hi rend="italic">state</hi> in question.</note> (which seems to be Spengel's view), it is quite impossible that two such states, one pleasurable and the other painful, can be the same. Schrader, however, appears to take the <foreign lang="greek">pw=s e)/xein</foreign> in a different sense, for the character or habit of mind, the mental constitution, which tends to produce such and such feelings; and in this point of view, though ambition (his first instance) may fairly enough be called a disposition of mind, yet I cannot see how the second, the prosperous and successful men, or prosperity and success, can well be included in the designation. </p>
						<p>In conclusion I will transcribe part of his note, that the reader may have the opportunity of deciding for himself; merely adding that manuscript and editorial authority is against his omission of the negative, and that though his interpretation is very plausible at first sight, I doubt whether it can be right, for the reasons stated. &ldquo;Veritas autem huius lectionis e re ipsa quoque fiet manifesta, si per <foreign lang="greek">prota/seis</foreign> a &sect; 2 ad 9 transeas, et huc illas applices.

						<p>And now to proceed with the translation:&mdash; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;It is plain too what are the occasions, the objects, and the states of mind of such (the envious); that is to say, that the same state of mind which is absent in the painful feeling, will be present in the joy that is excited by the opposite occasions&rsquo; (or thus, &lsquo;whatever may be the state of mind the absence of which manifests itself in, or is accompanied by, pain, the same by its presence on the opposite occasions will give rise to pleasure&rsquo;). &lsquo;Consequently, if we ourselves (i. e. any audience) are brought into that state of mind (envy or jealousy), and those who lay claim to (think themselves deserving of) compassion from us, or any good that they want to obtain from us&rsquo; (as <foreign lang="greek">kritai/</foreign>, judges of any kind, in a disputed claim; but it is equally true of men in general), &lsquo;be such as the above described (i. e. objects of envy), &lsquo;it is plain that they will never meet with compassion&rsquo; (which will apply to <foreign lang="greek">tugxa/nein tino\s a)gaqou=</foreign> as well as to <foreign lang="greek">e)leei=sqai</foreign>) &lsquo;from the masters of the situation&rsquo; (those who have the power to bestow either of them, those with whom the matter rests). </p>

					<p>With envy, as we have seen, is closely connected <foreign lang="greek">zhlos</foreign> or emulation; both of them originating in the desire of superiority, which manifests itself in rivalry and competition with those who so far, and in that sense, resemble us (<foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou\s o(moi/ous</foreign>), that we are necessarily brought into comparison with them. Both of them are painful emotions&mdash;the pain arises from the unsatisfied want which they equally imply&mdash;and the difference between them is this, that envy is malevolent; what the envious man <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> is to deprive his neighbour of some advantage or superiority, and do him harm by reducing him to his own level; the pain of emulation springs from the sense of our own deficiencies and the desire of rising to a higher level of virtue or honour: consequently the one is a virtuous, the other a vicious, feeling; emulation leads to self-improvement, and the practice of virtue; the object of envy is nothing but the degradation or injury of another: or, as Aristotle expresses it, emulation aims at the acquisition of good things, envy at <pb n="132"/> the deprivation of them in another, the infliction of harm and loss on one's neighbour. </p>
					<p>Such is Aristotle's account of emulation; according to him the feeling is one, and that virtuous. The Stoics however, as interpreted by Cicero, Tusc. Disp. IV 8. 17, distinguished two kinds of <hi rend="italic">aemulatio:&mdash;ut et in laude et in vitio nomen hoc sit. Nam et imitatio virtutis aemulatio dicitur: et est aemulatio aegritudo, si eo quod concupierit alius potiatur ipse careat.</hi> And again, c. 26. 56, <hi rend="italic">aemulantis, angi alieno bono quod ipse non habeat.</hi> The two definitions differ also in this, that in Ar.'s all emulation is painful and all virtuous; in that of the Stoics, one form of it is virtuous but not painful, the other painful but not virtuous; and in fact it is difficult to distinguish the latter form of it from envy. </p>
					<p>The Stoic definition of Zeno and (apparently) Chrysippus, Diog. Laert., Zeno, VII 111, gives only the painful and vicious form of <foreign lang="greek">zh=los, lu/phn e)pi\ tw=| a)/llw| parei=nai w(=n au)to\s e)piqumei=</foreign>. Cicero attributes his double definition also to Zeno. </p>
					<p>Hobbes' and Bain's definitions of the affection I have already quoted in the introductory note to Ch. X. Locke, in the chapter there referred to, does not include emulation in his list of &lsquo;Passions&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Modes of pleasure and pain&rsquo;. </p>
					<p>Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Moral Philosophy</hi>, Pt. II. Sect. III. 5, has some remarks upon emulation, which he classes with the desires, and not (as Aristotle and others) with the affections. &ldquo;It is the desire of superiority which is the active principle; and the malevolent affection is only a concomitant circumstance.&rdquo; Here he is in accordance with Aristotle. &ldquo;When emulation is accompanied with malevolent affection, it assumes the name of envy.&rdquo; </p>
					<p>&ldquo;Emulation,&rdquo; says Butler, <hi rend="italic">Sermon I.</hi>, On Human Nature, note 4, &ldquo;is merely the desire and hope of equality with, or superiority over others, with whom we compare ourselves. There does not appear to be <hi rend="italic">any other grief</hi> in the natural passion, but only <hi rend="italic">that want</hi> which is implied in desire. However, this may be so strong as to be the occasion of great <hi rend="italic">grief.</hi> To desire the attainment of this equality or superiority by the <hi rend="italic">particular means</hi> of others being brought down to our own level or below it, is, I think, the distinct notion of envy. From whence it is easy to see that the real end which the natural passion, emulation, and which the unlawful one, envy, aims at, is exactly the same; namely that equality or superiority; and consequently, that to do mischief is not the object of envy, but merely the means it makes use of to attain its end.&rdquo; At all events, the malevolent <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> is a constituent element of the emotion of envy, without which it would not be what it is: though the actual <hi rend="italic">doing mischief</hi> may not be essential to it. </p>
					<p>1. &lsquo;The dispositions of emulation (the states of mind which exhibit it, in which it resides), its occasions and objects, will be clear from what follows&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ta\ poi=a</foreign> here stands for &lsquo;the sort of things&rsquo; which excite emu<pb n="133"/> lation, usually expressed in these analyses by <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ poi/ois</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si</foreign> for the &lsquo;persons&rsquo; or &lsquo;objects&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">upon</hi> whom it lights, i.e. against whom it is directed, which again is more usually conveyed by the simple <foreign lang="greek">ti/si</foreign>. See however c. 10 &sect; 11, <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si</foreign>, and the note there; and <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ poi/ois xai/rein</foreign> c. 9 &sect; 16. &lsquo;If, namely, emulation is a feeling of pain on the occasion of the manifest (unmistakable) presence of good things, highly valued and possible for ourselves to acquire, (<foreign lang="greek">peri/</foreign> in respect of, in the case of, i.e.) belonging to, or acquired by, those who have a natural resemblance to ourselves (in temper, faculties, powers, gifts and accomplishments natural or acquired, or anything which brings them <hi rend="italic">into contrast</hi> with us); not because another has them (which is envy) but because we ourselves have them not (and so, feeling the <hi rend="italic">want</hi>, are anxious to obtain them, in order to raise ourselves to the level of our assumed rival)&mdash; and accordingly, (the latter,) emulation is virtuous and a property of virtuous men, envy on the other hand vicious and of the vicious: for whilst the one is led by his emulation to procure (contrive, manage) for himself the attainment of these goods, the other is led by his envy to manage merely that his neighbour shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have them&rsquo;:&mdash;(This is mere malevolence, the desire of harm or loss to another, without any corresponding advantage to oneself.

That is to say, they start with the assumption that their natural character is virtuous, and then, because wealth and power and such like have a natural connexion with, i.e. are the proper rewards of, virtue, they are eager to obtain them, and vie with their competitors in the pursuit of them<note anchored="yes" n="2">Brandis, in the tract on the Rhet. in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi>, IV i. p. 46, following apparently the opinion of Muretus and Vater, calls the passage a <hi rend="italic">verderbte Stelle</hi>, for which I can see no foundation whatsoever. The sense and connexion are perfectly intelligible, the imperf. <foreign lang="greek">prosh=ke</foreign> has been explained, and <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqw=s</foreign> defended by the use of it in the Topics. Bekker, Ed. III., retains the v. l.

The meaning of this sentence is further elucidated by comparison with what is said in &sect; 7. We are there informed that some kinds of good things, such as those that are due to fortune, or mere good luck, without merit, may be the objects not of emulation but of contempt. <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqa\ a(\ tw=n e)nti/mwn a)/cia/ e)stin a)ndrw=n</foreign> are consequently confined to those good things the acquisition of which implies merit. </p>

The past tense, precisely as in the familiar use of the imperf., &lsquo;so and so <hi rend="italic">is</hi> as I said&rsquo;, referring back to a past statement, here signifies, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">has</hi> a claim, as they were in the habit of believing&rsquo;. I have not thought it worth while to express this in the transl., as the phraseology is Greek and not English.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">logogra/foi</lemma>. This word is used in two distinct senses. In its earlier signification it is applied to the <hi rend="italic">Chroniclers</hi>, the earliest historians and prose writers, predecessors and contemporaries of Herodotus; of whom an account may be found in M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> c. XVIII, and Mure, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gk. Lit.</hi> Bk. IV. ch. 2, 3, Vol. IV, and Dahlmann, <hi rend="italic">Life of Herodotus</hi>, Ch. VI. sect. 2, and foll. In this sense it occurs in Thuc. I 21, upon which Poppo has this note: &ldquo;Aut solutae orationis scriptores universi, aut historici vel etiam <foreign lang="greek">muqogra/foi</foreign>&rdquo; (this early history was often of a mythical and legendary character), &ldquo;denique orationum panegyricarum auctores hoc ambiguo vocabulo significantur.&rdquo; (The later, and most usual, meaning of the word is here omitted.) As this was for some time the only prose literature in existence, the <foreign lang="greek">logogra/foi</foreign> might well be contrasted with the poets, so as to signify &lsquo;prose writers&rsquo; in general. And this, according to Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Technologiae Graecae</hi> s. v., is the sense that it bears here, <hi rend="italic">Dichter und prosaische Schriftsteller.</hi> Isocrates also, Phil. &sect; 109, has the same contrast, <foreign lang="greek">ou)/te tw=n poihtw=n ou)/te tw=n logopoiw=n</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The later and commoner signification, which appears so frequently in the Orators (see examples in Shilleto's note on Dem. de F. L. &sect; 274), dates from the time of Antiphon, who commenced the practice, which <pb n="137"/> became common, and was pursued for instance by Isocrates and Demosthenes, of <hi rend="italic">writing speeches</hi>, for which he received remuneration, for the use of parties in the law-courts. Public feeling at Athens was very much against this supposed prostitution of a man's talents and special knowledge (which may be compared with Plato's horror, expressed in the Phaedrus, of making a trade of teaching), and <foreign lang="greek">logogra/fos</foreign> became a term of reproach. Perhaps the earliest example of this application is the passage of the Phaedrus, 257 C, where Lysias is said to have been taunted with it by a political opponent, <foreign lang="greek">dia\ pa/shs th=s loidori/as e)ka/lei logogra/fon</foreign>. Aeschines applied it very freely to his rival Demosthenes. On this import of the word Gaisford (ad hunc locum) quotes Schol. Plat. p. 63, <foreign lang="greek">logogra/fous e)ka/loun oi( palaioi\ tou\s e)pi\ misqw=| lo/gous gra/fontas, kai\ pipra/skontas au)tou\s ei)s dikasth/ria: r(h/toras de\ tou\s di) e(autw=n le/gontas</foreign>. </p>
						<p>But besides this special sense, <foreign lang="greek">logografi/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">logogra/fos</foreign> are said of speech-writing and speech-writers in general (so Pl. Phaedr. 257 E, 258 B), and especially of panegyrical speeches, like those of Isocrates, and of speeches written to be read in the closet, and not orally delivered in the law-court or public assembly: and as this is the most appropriate to the present passage of Aristotle, who is speaking of <hi rend="italic">eulogies</hi> in poetry and prose; and is likewise the sense in which it is used in two other passages of the Rhetoric, III 7. 7, 12.2, I have little doubt that it is to be so understood here. Hermogenes <foreign lang="greek">peri\ i)dew=n, b</foreign>, chap. 10, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= politikou= lo/gou</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci</hi>, Vol. II. p. 405, 6, and again chap. 12, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= a(plw=s panhgurikou=</foreign>, ib. p. 417, in treating of the <foreign lang="greek">panhguriko\s lo/gos</foreign>, the name by which he designates Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">e)pideiktiko\n ge/nos</foreign>, seems to divide all literature into three branches, poetry, spoken and written speeches; distinguishing <foreign lang="greek">r(h/tores</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">logogra/foi</foreign>, and both of them from <foreign lang="greek">poihtai/; a)/ristos ou)=n kata\ pa/ntwn lo/gwn ei)/dh kai\ poihtw=n a(pa/ntwn kai\ r(hto/rwn kai\ logogra/fwn *(/omhros</foreign> (p. 406, 9, and elsewhere). And (in the second passage above referred to) he includes <foreign lang="greek">i(stori/a</foreign> under the general head of <foreign lang="greek">logografi/a, ou)de\ mh\n h( logografi/a a)lla\ kai\ h( i(stori/a</foreign>, p. 417, and still more expressly <foreign lang="greek">i(stori/as te kai\ th=s a)/llhs logografi/as</foreign>, p. 418. Rhetoric, when treated as the art of <hi rend="italic">composition</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">le/cis</foreign>, may no doubt be considered to embrace all <hi rend="italic">prose literature</hi>, which will so fall into two divisions (1) public and forensic speeches, orally delivered, and (2) all written compositions. [&ldquo;The relation between ancient oratory and ancient prose, philosophical, historical or literary, is necessarily of the closest kind.&rdquo; Jebb's <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi> I. p. lxxi.] In Rhet. III 12. 2, the written style, <foreign lang="greek">le/cis grafikh/</foreign>, is opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">a)gwnistikh/</foreign>, which has to be employed in actual encounter, spoken and acted, not (necessarily) written; and the <foreign lang="greek">sumbouleutikh/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">dikanikh/</foreign> to the <foreign lang="greek">e)pideiktikh/</foreign>. The art of composition therefore, and prose composition in general, may properly be referred to this third branch of Rhetoric, the declamatory or panegyrical, as Hermogenes expressly, and Aristotle tacitly, do refer it: and so <foreign lang="greek">logogra/fos</foreign> may mean either a speech<hi rend="italic">writer</hi> (as opposed to <foreign lang="greek">r(h/twr</foreign>), or a writer of <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> (as opposed to poetry). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The opposites of all these (the foregoing classes of persons) are objects of contempt: for contempt is the opposite of emulation, and the notion of the one to the notion of the other&rsquo; (the substantive in <foreign lang="greek">-is</foreign> denotes the <hi rend="italic">process</hi>, or operation of the feeling; the infin. with <foreign lang="greek">to/</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">abstract conception</hi> of it). &lsquo;And those who are so constituted as to emulate others, <pb n="138"/> or <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> to be the objects of emulation, must necessarily be inclined to feel contempt for all such persons&mdash;and on such occasions (an unnecessary parenthetical <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, which interrupts the construction)&mdash;as lie under the defects and disadvantages opposite to the good things which are the objects of emulation. Hence contempt is often felt for the fortunate, when their luck comes to them without those good things which are really valuable (i.e. which depend in some degree upon merit for their acquisition)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Here ends the account of the means (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> channels, <hi rend="italic">media</hi>) by which the several emotions are engendered and dissolved, (furnishing topics or premisses) from which the arguments (modes of persuasion) that belong to them may be derived&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dialu/etai</lemma>] is here applied to the dissolution, breaking up, and so bringing to an end, of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> themselves. In a former passage on a similar subject, c. 4 &sect; 32, it seems rather to have its logical sense of breaking up, or refuting an argument. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)/rhtai</lemma>] it has been stated, and is now over [Vol. I. p. 225, note]. </p>

					<p>We now enter upon the consideration of the second kind of <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>, which may be employed as a subsidiary proof or instrument of persuasion, to assist the cogency of the logical arguments. This occupies the six following chapters from 12 to 17; in which the salient features or characteristics of the three ages, youth, old age, and manhood or the prime of life; and of the three social conditions of noble birth or family, wealth, and power, are set forth in detail. The import of these chapters, and their connexion with the main subject of the entire work, which explains and justifies their position here, has been already treated in the Introduction, pp. 110&mdash;112, to which the reader is referred. The study of these &lsquo;characters&rsquo; will enable the speaker to accommodate his language and arguments to their several tastes and dispositions. </p>
					<p>The four stages of human life, as described by Horace, Epist. ad Pis. 156 seq., have much more in common with Shakespeare's &lsquo;seven ages&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">As you like it</hi>, Act II. sc. 7 [lines 143&mdash;166],) than with Aristotle's analysis. Horace writes with a view to the use of the <hi rend="italic">poet</hi>, and describes them as they should appear in the drama or the Epic poem: his cha<pb n="139"/> racters are the <hi rend="italic">dramatic characters</hi>: Aristotle writing for the rhetorician applies his analysis to the purposes of <hi rend="italic">argument;</hi> reserving the dramatic expression of character for the third book, where it naturally falls under the treatment of style and expression. Horace's object appears in the lines, <hi rend="italic">Ne forte seniles mandentur iuveni partes pueroque viriles, semper in adiunctis aevoque morabimur aptis</hi> [176]. </p>
					<p>Bacon's <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, Of Youth and Age [XLII], is too well known to need more than a mere reference. Two such observers as Aristotle and Bacon must of course agree in the general outline of the two contrasted characters; but Bacon's is a brief sketch, presenting the leading features of both more particularly as they exhibit themselves in the conduct and management of business, and in public life: Aristotle fills in the details of the picture in a much more complete and comprehensive analysis. </p>
					<p>Plutarch, in the treatise <hi rend="italic">de virtute morali</hi>, c. XI, discussing the moral constitution of the human subject, illustrates his material theory of the origin of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> by reference to the characters of the young and old, which he thus describes; <foreign lang="greek">dio\ ne/oi me\n kai\ o)cei=s kai\ i)tamoi\</foreign> (headlong, hasty, precipitate,) <foreign lang="greek">peri/ te ta\s o)re/ceis dia/puroi kai\ oi)strw/deis ai(/matos plh/qei kai\ qermo/thti: tw=n de\ presbutw=n h( pro\s to\ h(=par a)rxh\ tou= e)piqumhtikou= katasbe/nnutai, kai\ gi/netai mikra\ kai\ a)sqenh/s: i)sxu/ei de\ ma=llon o( lo/gos tou= paqhtikou= tw=| sw/mati sunapomarainome/nou</foreign>.

The curious correspondence of the metaphors in the two authors' description of the hot impetuosity of the one and the cold phlegmatic temper of the other, is accounted for by similarity of theory as to the origin of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>. With both the explanation is physiological, and in the spirit of modern inquiries in the same department. Aristotle's views may be gathered from the de Anima I 1, 403 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3, seq. He there describes them as inseparable from the body and its matter and functions; with the possible exception of <foreign lang="greek">to\ noei=n</foreign> &lsquo;thought and intelligence&rsquo;, which is there included with the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> as a property of &lsquo;life&rsquo;; and they are ranked with sensation in general: <foreign lang="greek">fai/netai de\ tw=n me\n plei/stwn</foreign>&mdash;the independent existence of the intellect, or part of it, being left an open question&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">ou)qe\n a)/neu tou= sw/matos pa/sxein ou)de\ poiei=n, oi(=on o)rgi/zesqai, qar)r(ei=n, e)piqumei=n, o(/lws ai)sqa/nesqai</foreign>. See further, ib. line 16: and ib. line 31, a &lsquo;physical&rsquo; definition of anger (which he seems to accept as correct as far as it goes) is given, <foreign lang="greek">ze/sis tou= peri\ kardi/an ai(/matos kai\ qermou=</foreign>: this is the definition of the <foreign lang="greek">u(/lh</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>.

						<p>Vater raises a difficulty about the connexion of the above passage with the concluding sentence of the last chapter, which he says he cannot understand. &ldquo;How could Aristotle after stating that he had concluded the description of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> immediately add, as though nothing had been said about them, <hi rend="italic">nunc autem qui mores aut animorum motus &mdash;explicemus</hi>&rdquo;<hi rend="italic">?</hi> My answer is that he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say so: the two sentences have reference to two totally different things: at the end of c. 11, he tells us that he has now finished the analysis of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, and shews by the analysis how they can be applied to the purposes of the rhetorician, how to excite and allay them. What he says at the opening of c. 12, is that he is now going to treat of the application of these <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">e(/ceis</foreign> which grow out of them to the characters of certain ages and conditions of life. The Latin words quoted are a mere mistranslation: the <foreign lang="greek">kata/</foreign> is overlooked, and the sentence rendered as if it were <foreign lang="greek">ta\ de\ h)/qh kai\ ta\ pa/qh ...die/lqwmen</foreign>. Vater accordingly on this ground, and also on that of the passage of Quintilian (immediately to be noticed), supposes that something is lost here. </p>
						<p>The passage of Quintilian, V 10. 17, presents a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> difficulty. In referring to Aristotle <hi rend="italic">in secundo de Arte Rhetorica libro</hi>&mdash;which can only <pb n="141"/> mean this place&mdash;he adds to what we actually find in Aristotle several other &lsquo;characters&rsquo; of which no trace is now to be found in his text, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">ut</hi> divitias <hi rend="italic">quid sequatur, aut</hi> ambitum, <hi rend="italic">aut</hi> superstitionem; <hi rend="italic">quid boni probent, quid mali petant, quid</hi> milites, <hi rend="italic">quid rustici; quo quaeque modo res vitari vel appeti soleat.</hi>&rdquo; Both Victorius (Comm. ad II 17. 6, p. 358, ed. 1548), and Spalding (ad loc. Quint.), attribute the discrepancy to a lapse of memory on Quintilian's part, who was here quoting without book. The former, in a sarcastic note, thinks that it is much more probable to suppose that Quintilian, without referring to the text of his author, added <hi rend="italic">de suo</hi> what he thought <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be there, than that anything has been lost in a book which presents no trace of any hiatus. To which Spalding adds, &ldquo;non uno quidem loco vidimus videbimusque Quintilianum memoriae vitio e libris afferentem, quae in iis non plane eadem legerentur. Cf. IV 2. 132.&rdquo; In this explanation I think we must acquiesce. Spengel also, in his tract <hi rend="italic">&uuml;ber die Rhet. des Ar.</hi> (Trans. Bav. Acad. 1851) p. 43, attributes this want of coincidence to a &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; of Quintilian. </p>

Anim., as VII 1. 2, 16, 18, c. 12. 2, and elsewhere: from all which it may be concluded that Aristotle was a believer in it. Plato, Rep. V 460 E, fixes the prime of life in a woman at the age of 20, in a man at 30: in Legg. IV 721 A, and in three other places, the age of marriage is fixed from 30 to 35, though in one of them (VI 772 E) 25 is also named. Compare on this subject Hes. Opp. et D. 695 seq. Xenoph. de Rep. Lac. I 6, (Stallbaum's note on Plato l c). </p>
						<p>But the theory of the virtues of the number seven was carried to a far greater extent, as may be seen in I 6 of Macrobius' Commentary on Cicero's <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis</hi>, of which the sum is given in a quotation from the <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis:&mdash;Cicero de septenario dicit, Qui numerus rerum omnium fere nodus est.</hi> Everything in nature is determined by the number seven. Near the end of the chapter, we are told, in conformity with Aristotle's statement, <hi rend="italic">Notandum vero quod, cum numerus se multiplicat</hi> (at the age of 49, 7 x 7), <hi rend="italic">facit aetatem quae proprie perfecta et habetur et dicitur: adeo ut illius aetatis homo, utpote qui perfectionem et attigerit iam, et necdum praeterierit, et consilio aptus sit, nec ab exercitio virium alienus habeatur.</hi> This is the prime of mind and body together. <hi rend="italic">Quinta</hi> (hebdomas) <hi rend="italic">omne virium</hi> (strength and powers of body alone), <hi rend="italic">quanta esse unicuique, possunt, complet augmentum.</hi> All this came no doubt originally from the Pythagoreans; as may be inferred from Arist. Met. N 6, 1093 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 13, where this number seven, is said to be assigned by them as the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of everything that happened to have this number of members; <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> vowels, <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> chords or harmonies, <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> Pleiads; animals shed their teeth in <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> years&mdash;yes, says Ar., <hi rend="italic">some</hi> do, but some don't&mdash;and <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> champions against Thebes. And from this and similar considerations they inferred some mysterious virtue in the number; and identified it with <foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">kairo/s</foreign>. (Ritter and Preller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Phil.</hi> c. 2, Pythag. &sect; 102, note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>) </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And at the same time, these affections are natural to them, for many are they who require (the aid, the services) of the wealthy&rsquo;. They have an excuse for being thus affected by their wealth; the numerous claimants upon their bounty elate them with a sense of superiority, and at the same time by their servility give them frequent opportunities of exercising at their expense their ostentation and ill manners.

This same story is alluded to by Plato, Rep. VI 489 C, without naming the author of the saying, who indignantly denies its truth. The Scholiast, in supplying the omission, combines the two different versions of Aristotle and Diog. Laert., and describes it as a dialogue between Socrates and Eubulus. Diog. Laert.

				<div2 id="b2c18" type="chapter" n="18">

					<p>The following chapter marks a division of the general subject of the work, and a stage or landing-place, from which we look back to what has been already done, and forwards to what still remains to do. The evident intention of the writer is to give a summary statement of the entire plan, and the main division of his system of Rhetoric, contained in the first two books, which comprise all the intellectual part, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ peri\ th\n dia/noian</foreign>, II 26. 5, all that depends on argument; as opposed to the non-essential and ornamental part, style, action, and arrangement, treated in Bk. III. And it may fairly be supposed that it was also his intention to arrange these divisions in the same order as that which he proposed to follow in the actual treatment of the subject. </p>
					<p>But in the text, at any rate of the first half of the chapter, to <foreign lang="greek">poihte/on</foreign>, this order is not observed; and there is altogether so much irregularity and confusion in the structure of the sentences, and such a mixture of heterogeneous subjects, that it seems tolerably certain that we have not this portion of the chapter in the form in which Aristotle wrote it. First, the long parenthesis about the applicability of the terms <foreign lang="greek">kri/sis</foreign> or decision, and <foreign lang="greek">kri/ths</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">judge</hi> or critic, to all the three branches of Rhetoric, has no natural connexion with the context&mdash;though at the same time it is quite true that the use of the parenthesis, <hi rend="italic">a note</hi> inserted in the <hi rend="italic">text</hi>, is a marked feature of Aristotle's ordinary style: still this would be an exaggeration, or abuse of the peculiarity. Spengel has pointed out (<hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, p. 35), that the whole of this parenthesis, <foreign lang="greek">e)/sti de/&mdash;bouleu/ontai</foreign> [p. 175, line 2, to p. 176, last line], is nothing but an expansion of a preceding passage, <pb n="172"/> I 1. 2, the same notion being here carried out into detail. But although it is so much out of place that it is hardly conceivable that even Aristotle (whose style is not remarkable for its close connexion&mdash;is in fact often rather rambling and incoherent) should have introduced it here, as part of an enormous protasis of which the apodosis or conclusion relates to something entirely different; yet as it bears all the characteristic marks of the author's style, including the irregularity and the heaping of parenthesis upon parenthesis, though it was most probably not written for this place, there is no reason to doubt that it proceeds from the pen of Aristotle. </p>
					<p>The parenthesis ends at <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/ontai</foreign>, and we ought now to resume the interrupted <foreign lang="greek">pro/tasis</foreign>. This appears, according to the ordinary punctuation, (with the full stop at <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign>,) to be carried on as far as <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign>, the conclusion or apodosis being introduced by <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>, as usual. The grammar <foreign lang="greek">e)pei/...w(/ste</foreign> is no objection to this, since we have already seen (note on II 9. 11) that Aristotle is often guilty of this, and even greater grammatical irregularities. But the sense shews that the passage when thus read cannot be sound. There is no real conclusion; for it by no means follows that, because &lsquo;the employment of all persuasive speeches is directed to a <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> of some kind&rsquo;, and because (second member of protasis) &lsquo;the political characters&rsquo; have been described (in I 8), &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> it has been determined how and by what means or materials speeches may be invested with an ethical character&rsquo;. In fact it is a complete <hi rend="italic">non-sequitur.</hi> </p>
					<p>Bekker [ed. 3] and Spengel, in order to establish a connexion between protasis and apodosis, put a comma at <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign>; suppose that the preceding sentence from the beginning of the chapter is left incomplete, without apodosis, at <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/ontai</foreign>; and that <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> marks the conclusion <hi rend="italic">only</hi> from the clause immediately preceding; the meaning then being, that the description of the &lsquo;political characters&rsquo; in I 8 is a sufficient determination of the modes of imparting an ethical character to the speech. But this cannot be right: for not only is the fact alleged quite insufficient in itself to support the conclusion supposed to be deduced from it, but also the two kinds of characters designated are in fact different; and it could not be argued from the mere description of the characters of I 8, that the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=| le/gonti</foreign> had been sufficiently discussed and determined; which is in fact done&mdash;so far as it is done at all&mdash;in II 1, and not in I 8. </p>
					<p>Other proposed alterations and suggested difficulties in the rest of the chapter may be left for discussion to their place in the Commentary: the meaning and connexion of this part are in general perfectly intelligible, though omission, interpolation, and obscurity or error are alleged against this and that phrase; and the order of the actual contents of the work coincides essentially and in the main with that which is here followed. </p>
					<p>I have now to state the views of two recent critics and commentators upon the whole passage, in its connexion with the order of the several divisions of the entire work. </p>
					<p>Spengel's views upon this subject are to be found in his tract <hi rend="italic">&uuml;ber die Rhetorik des Arist.</hi>, in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, <pb n="173"/> pp. 32&mdash;37; a work which I have already had frequent occasion to refer to. He had previously spoken of the order contemplated and adopted by Aristotle, in the arrangement of the three main divisions of his subject; the analysis of the direct proofs, <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>, by logical argument, and the two modes of indirect confirmation of the others, the <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>. The passages which he himself quotes in illustration of the first order in which Aristotle proposes to take them, pp. 25&mdash;27, shew that the order is <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis, h)/qh, pa/qh</foreign>: nevertheless Spengel inverts the two last, p. 30 et seq., omitting the actual treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, as a <hi rend="italic">subsidiary argument</hi> or mode of persuasion in II 1, the true <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=| le/gonti</foreign>; and, as it seems to me, confounding that with a totally different set of characters, which are delineated as an appendix to the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, and consequently <hi rend="italic">after</hi> them in II 12&mdash;17. This I have already pointed out, and explained the real application of the six characters of II 12&mdash;17 to the purposes of Rhetoric, in the Introduction p. 110, foll. and at the commencement of c. 12 in the Commentary. Spengel notices the inconclusive <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> in the apodosis, c. 18. 1 (p. 34), apparently assuming that the passage is corrupt, but throws no further light upon the interpretation or means of correcting the section. Next we have, p. 36 foll., an attempt to prove that <foreign lang="greek">ta\ loipa/</foreign>, in &sect; 5, is to be understood of the treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> contained severally in c. 2&mdash;11 and 12&mdash;17 of Bk. II, and that consequently from the words <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws ta\ loipa\ prosqe/ntes a)podw=men th\n e)c a)rxh=s pro/qesin</foreign> we are to conclude that the order of treatment of the contents of the first two books was as follows; the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis e)c au)tou= tou= lo/gou</foreign> (as if the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> were not equally conveyed <hi rend="italic">by the speech itself</hi>), occupying the first book; next, the four <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign>, and the second part of the logical <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>, II 18&mdash;26; and thirdly, the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> in the first seventeen chapters of Bk. II, which originally formed the conclusion of that book, though now the order of the two parts is inverted. </p>
					<p>Vahlen, in a paper in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Vienna Acad. of Sciences</hi>, Oct. 1861, pp. 59&mdash;148, has gone at some length into the questions that arise out of this eighteenth chapter, where it is compared with other passages in which Aristotle has indicated the order in which he meant to treat the several divisions of his subject. Op. cit. 121&mdash;132. His principal object in writing, he says, p. 122, is to defend against Brandis' criticisms Spengel's view that the original arrangement of Aristotle in treating the subjects of the second book has been subsequently inverted in the order in which they now stand; Aristotle having intended to complete the survey of the logical department of Rhetoric before he entered upon the <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>. He is of opinion (p. 126) that the analysis of the <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign> came next (in accordance with the original plan) to the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> of the first book; and consequently that there is a gap at the opening of the second between the conclusion of the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> and the commencement of the <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>; and that as a further consequence, the words in &sect; 2, <foreign lang="greek">e)/ti d'  e)c w(=n h)qikou/s&mdash;diw/ristai</foreign>, are an interpolation of some editor of Aristotle's work, who introduced them, <hi rend="italic">after the</hi> <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign> <hi rend="italic">had been transferred to their present place</hi>, as a necessary recognition of what had actually been done. His principal object is in fact to establish what he conceives to be the true order of the several parts of <pb n="174"/> the work; and in doing so he deals, as it seems to me, in the most arbitrary manner with Aristotle's text. He assumes a Redactor, or Editor, who has taken various liberties with the text of his author, and has interpolated various passages, chiefly relating to the <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>, to supply what he conceived to be deficient after the order had been changed. How or why the order was changed, neither he nor Spengel gives us any indication; and the supposition of these repeated interpolations has little or no foundation except his own hypothesis of the inseparable connexion of the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign>: for my own part I cannot find in the passages which he quotes in support of this opinion, or elsewhere in Aristotle's Rhetoric, any statement of a necessary connexion between the two, such as to make it imperative that the <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign> should be treated immediately after the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>. The order of treatment which we find in the received text appears to be sufficiently natural and regular to defend it&mdash; in default of the strongest evidence to the contrary&mdash;against the suspicion of dislocation and interpolation, though no doubt the order suggested by Vahlen may be, considered in itself, more strictly logical and consecutive. On the connexion of the clauses of the passage now under consideration (c. 18 &sect; 1), and how and why the long inappropriate parenthesis was introduced <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&mdash;which are, after all, the things that most require explanation&mdash;he leaves us as much in the dark as his predecessor Spengel. His interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">ta\ loipa/</foreign> (which Spengel seems to have misunderstood), and anything else that requires notice, may be left for the notes on the passages to which they belong. </p>
					<p>I have suggested in the Introduction, p. 250, the possibility of the accidental omission of some words or sentences between <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rhtai pro/teron</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste diwrisme/non</foreign>, in order to supply some connexion between protasis and apodosis, and give some significance to the conclusion; but without any great confidence in the success of the attempt to solve the difficulty: to which I am bound to add that it leaves unexplained the introduction of the parenthesis, <foreign lang="greek">e)/sti de/&mdash;bouleu/ontai</foreign>, which, however and whencesoever it may have been introduced, is here most certainly out of place. And I will now proceed to give a summary of the contents of the chapter, as I understand them. </p>
					<p>All speeches which have persuasion for their object are addressed to, or look to, a <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> of some kind. In the two more important branches of Rhetoric, the deliberative and forensic, <foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s politikoi=s a)gw=sin</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">judge</hi> may be understood literally: in the third or epideictic branch, the audience is in some sense also a judge, in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">critic</hi>, being called upon to <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> or pass sentence on the merits of the composition. Still it is only in the first two that the term &lsquo;judge&rsquo; can be applied to the hearer in its absolute, or strict and proper sense (<foreign lang="greek">a(plw=s krith/s</foreign>). Then, as a second member of the protasis, comes a clause which has the appearance of being a continuation or supplement of something which has been lost&mdash;a reference, namely, to the treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> in II 1, which might justify the conclusion that follows, that &lsquo;it has now been determined in what way and by what means speeches may be made to assume an ethical character&rsquo;. Still the sentence and its statements remain incomplete: for if, as it appears, Aristotle's intention was to give an enumeration in detail of the main divisions of his Rhetoric <pb n="175"/> in the order in which he had placed them, the omission of the important department of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> would be quite unaccountable, unless indeed&mdash; which I am myself inclined to believe&mdash;he meant to include the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> under the general head of <foreign lang="greek">h)qikoi\ lo/goi</foreign>; which, as the treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> belongs to Ethics, and the effects of the use of them by the speaker are purely ethical, he was fairly entitled to do. At the same time, if this be admitted, the <hi rend="italic">first part</hi> of the protasis with the parenthesis appended has no sufficient connexion with the conclusive <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>: nor is it clear why the &lsquo;political characters&rsquo;, which do not come under the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> proper, should be especially singled out as one at least of its representatives: though, if I am right in supposing something to be lost which stood before this clause, it might very likely have contained something which led to the mention of these characters, as one of the varieties of <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> which impart an ethical colour to the speech. </p>
					<p>However, let us suppose at least, as we fairly may, that Aristotle's intention, however frustrated by corruption of his manuscript, was to tell us what he had already done from the commencement of the second book, and what he next proposed to do in the remainder of it. He has hitherto been employed (in this book) upon the Ethical branches of the art, by which the character of the speaker himself may be displayed in a favourable light, and the emotions of the audience directed into a channel favourable to the designs of the orator, &sect; 1. </p>
					<p>We now take a fresh start, and from a new protasis, which states that the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, from which the statesman and public speaker, the pleader, and the declaimer, may derive their premisses and proofs, have been analysed under these three branches of Rhetoric, and also the materials, which may serve for imparting an ethical colour (in two senses, as before) to the speech, have been already despatched and determined, we arrive at the conclusion that it is now time to enter upon the subject of the <foreign lang="greek">koinoi/</foreign> or universal topics&mdash;three in number as they are here classified, the possible and impossible, the past and the future, and amplification or exaggeration and depreciation&mdash;which comes next in order; and is accordingly treated in the following chapter. When this has been settled, we must endeavour to find something to say about <hi rend="italic">enthymemes</hi> in general, arguments which may be applied to all the branches of Rhetoric alike, and <hi rend="italic">examples</hi>, the two great departments of rhetorical reasoning or proof, &lsquo;that by the addition of what still remained to be done&rsquo; (that is, by the completion of the logical division of the subject, by the discussion of enthymemes and examples, c. 20, the enthymeme including the <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, c. 21, the varieties of enthymeme, demonstrative and refutative, c. 22, and specimens of these, c. 23, fallacious enthymemes, c. 24, and the solution of them, c. 25, with an appendix, c. 26), &lsquo;we may fulfil the engagement, the task, which we proposed to ourselves at the outset of this work&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The possibility of anything, in respect of being or coming to be, implies the possibility of the contrary: as, for example, if it be possible for a man to be cured, it is possible for him also to fall ill: for there is the same power, faculty, potentiality, i.e. possibility of affecting a subject, in the two contraries, in so far as they are contrary one to another&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(=| e)nanti/a</lemma>] i.e. solely in respect of their being contraries, and excluding all other considerations. As in the instance given, a man is equally liable to be affected by health and sickness in so far as they are contraries, without regard to any properties or qualities in himself, which may render him more or less liable to one or the other. This is Schrader's explanation. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta)nanti/a</lemma>] &lsquo;contraries&rsquo; is one of the four varieties of <foreign lang="greek">a)ntikei/mena</foreign>, &lsquo;opposites&rsquo;. These are (1) <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/fasis</foreign>, &lsquo;contradiction&rsquo; (or contradictories), <foreign lang="greek">kata/fasis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)po/fasis</foreign>, affirmation and negation, affirmative and negative, to be and not to be, yes and no. (2) <foreign lang="greek">ta\ e)nanti/a</foreign>, &lsquo;contraries&rsquo; which are defined as the extreme opposites under the same genus&mdash;good and bad, black and white, long and short, quick and slow, &amp;c.&mdash;which cannot reside in the same subject together. (3) Relative opposites, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ pro/s ti</foreign>, as double and half, master and servant, father and son, &amp;c. And (4) opposites of state and privation, <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ste/rhsis</foreign>, the possession of something and the privation, absence, want, of it; as sight and blindness. (This last term, however, privation, is properly applied only to cases in which the opposite, possession or state, is <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> to the possessor; in which consequently that which <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> it, is <hi rend="italic">deprived</hi>&mdash;defrauded, as it were&mdash;of something to which it has a natural claim: blindness can only be called a <foreign lang="greek">ste/rhsis</foreign> when the individual affected by it belongs to a class <pb n="180"/> </p>

Categ. c. 10, 12 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26 seq.) On &lsquo;opposites&rsquo;, see Categ. cc. 10, 11. Top. B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17&mdash;23.

(where two more kinds are added, unnecessarily, see Bonitz ad loc.) and I 4, 1055 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 38, where the usual four are alone mentioned. Cicero, Topic. XI 47&mdash;49, enumerates and illustrates the same four. Of <foreign lang="greek">e)nanti/a</foreign> he says, <hi rend="italic">Haec, quae ex eodem genere contraria sunt appellantur adversa. Contrarium</hi> with him is Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">a)ntikei/menon</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, or general notion of <hi rend="italic">opposite.</hi> </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">argument</hi> from contraries, as employed here, is this: the possibility of anything <hi rend="italic">being</hi> or becoming the one, implies that of being or becoming the other; only not both at once: a virtuous man may always become (has the capacity, <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, of becoming) vicious, and the converse; but <foreign lang="greek">e)nergei/a|</foreign>, when the one state is actually present, and <hi rend="italic">realised</hi> in the subject, it excludes the other. This reciprocal possibility in contraries arises from the fact that the two contraries belong to the same <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or class. Black and white both fall under the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> colour, of which they are the extremes; they pass from one into the other by insensible gradations of infinite variety, from which we may infer that any surface that admits of colour at all, will admit either of them indifferently apart, but not together; two different colours cannot be shewn on the same surface and at the same time. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c19s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>Again, likeness or resemblance, <foreign lang="greek">to\ o(/moion</foreign>, between two things suggests or implies a common possibility; if one thing can be done, the probability is that anything else <hi rend="italic">like it</hi> can be done equally. </p>
						<p>This is a variety of the argument from <hi rend="italic">analogy.</hi> We have a tendency, which appears to be natural and instinctive, to infer from any manifest or apparent resemblance between two objects, that is, from certain properties or attributes which they are seen or known to possess in common, the common possession of other properties and attributes, which are not otherwise known to belong to them, whereby we are induced to refer them to the same class. So here, the likeness of two things in certain respects, is thought to imply something different, which is also common to both; a common capacity or possibility. The argument being here applied solely to the use of Rhetoric, the things in question are rather actions and their consequences than facts and objects: if it has been found possible to effect something, to gain some political advantage for instance, in several previous cases, we argue that in the similar, parallel case which is under consideration, the like possibility may be expected. </p>
						<p>This however, though the popular view of the argument from analogy, and the ordinary mode of applying it, is not, strictly speaking, the right application of the term. Analogy, <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)na/logon</foreign>, is arithmetical or geometrical proportion, and represents a similarity, not between objects themselves, but between the relations of them. See Sir W. Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Lect. on Logic</hi>, Vol. 11. p. 165&mdash;174, Lect. XXXII, and on this point, p. 170. Whately (<hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> p. 74, c. 1), &ldquo;Analogy, being a resemblance of ratios, that should strictly be called an argument from analogy, in which the two cases (viz. the one <hi rend="italic">from</hi> which, and the one <hi rend="italic">to</hi> which we argue) are not themselves alike, but stand in a similar <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> to something else; or, in other words, that the common genus that they both fall under, consists <pb n="181"/> in a relation.&rdquo; This he illustrates by two examples of analogical reasoning. One of them is, the inferences that may be drawn as to mental qualities and the changes they undergo, from similar changes (i.e. relations) in the physical constitution&mdash;though of course there can be no direct resemblance between them. Hamilton's illustration of analogy proper is derived directly from a numerical proportion: that of analogy in its popular usage is, &ldquo;This disease corresponds in many symptoms with those we have observed in typhus fevers; it will therefore correspond in all, that is, it is a typhus fever,&rdquo; p. 171. </p>
						<p>Buther's <hi rend="italic">Analogy of Natural and Revealed Religion to the constitution and course of Nature</hi> may be regarded as an analogy of relations between them and God the author of both, in the proper sense of the word, though in his Introduction he twice appears to identify analogy with mere likeness or similarity. </p>
						<p>Lastly, the logical description of Analogy is to be found in Thomson's <hi rend="italic">Law of Thought</hi>, &sect; 121, &lsquo;Syllogism of Analogy&rsquo;, p. 250, seq. The author's definition is, p. 252, &ldquo;the same attributes may be assigned to distinct but similar things, provided they can be shewn to accompany the points of resemblance in the things, and not the points of difference.&rdquo; Or &lsquo;when the resemblance is undoubted, and does not depend on one or two external features&rsquo;), &ldquo;when one thing resembles another in known particulars, it will resemble it also in the unknown.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The possibility of the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of anything implies also that of the <hi rend="italic">end:</hi> for nothing impossible comes into being or begins to do so, <pb n="182"/> as for example the commensurability of the diameter (with the side of the square) never either begins to, nor actually does, come into being. <hi rend="italic">To begin implies to end</hi>, says Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Two Voices</hi> [line 339]. In interpreting a rhetorical topic which is to guide men's practice, it is plain that we must keep clear of metaphysics. The beginning and end here have nothing to do with the finite and infinite. Nor is it meant that things that can be begun necessarily admit of being finished: the Tower of Babel, as well as other recorded instances of <hi rend="italic">opera interrupta</hi>, shew that this is not true. And though it may be true of the design or intention, of any attempt, that it always looks forward to an end, immediate or remote, still to the public speaker it is facility and expediency, rather than the mere possibility, of the measure he is recommending, that is likely to be of service in carrying his point. All that is really meant is, that if you want to know whether the end of any course of action, plan, scheme, or indeed of anything&mdash;is possible, you must look to the begining: beginning implies end: if it can be begun, it can also be brought to an end: nothing that is known to be impossible, like squaring the circle, can ever have a beginning, or be brought into being.

Trendelenburg, on de Anima III 6. 1, p. 500, explains this: the diameter of a square is represented by the root of 2, which is irrational, and therefore incommensurable  with the side. He also observes that Aristotle cannot refer to the squaring of the circle; a question which was still in doubt in the time of Archimedes could not be assumed by Aristotle as an example of impossibility. The illustration, which passed into a proverb, <foreign lang="greek">e)k diame/trou a)ntikei=sqai</foreign>, is confined to the side and diameter of the parallelogram. See also Waitz on Anal. Pr. 41 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And when the end is possible, so also is the beginning, because everything takes its origin, is generated, from a beginning&rsquo;. The end implies the beginning: everything that comes into being or is produced &mdash;everything therefore with which the orator has to deal in his sphere of practical life&mdash;has a beginning. Since the beginning is implied in the end, it is clear that if the end be attainable or possible, so likewise must the beginning be. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And if it is possible for the latter, the posterior, the subsequent, of two things, either in substance and essence, or generation, to be brought into being, then also the prior, the antecedent; for instance, if a man <pb n="183"/> can be generated, then a child; for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> (the child) is prior in generation (every man must have been first a boy; this is <foreign lang="greek">e)n gene/sei</foreign>, in the order of growth, in the succession of the natural series of generation or propagation): and if a child, then a man; because this (the child, <foreign lang="greek">e)kei/nh</foreign> being made to agree with <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">pai=s</foreign>,) is a beginning or origin&rsquo;. This latter example is by the rule that every end necessarily implies a beginning; a child stands in the relation to mature man of beginning to end: and therefore every grown man must have passed through the period of childhood; which is also reducible to the other rule, that the possibility of subsequent implies that of antecedent, of which the preceding example is an illustration. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ u(/steron, to\ pro/teron</lemma>] The two principal passages on the various senses in which <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">u(/steron</foreign>, before and after, earlier and later, antecedent and subsequent, prior and posterior, can be applied, are Categ. c. 12, in which five varieties are distinguished, and Met. <foreign lang="greek">*d</foreign> 11, in which there are four. On the former passage Waitz says in his Comm. p. 316, &ldquo;non premendam esse divisionem quam nostro loco tradidit: apparet enim non id agi in his ut ipsa rerum natura exploretur et pervestigetur, sed ut quae usus ferat sermonis quotidiani distinguantur alterum ab altero et explicentur.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>In the Metaphysics, the divisions are four. In the first, prior and posterior refer us to a <hi rend="italic">series</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">order</hi>, established either by nature or by the human will, under which the <foreign lang="greek">th=| gene/sei</foreign> of the Rhetoric will naturally fall. Of this there are five varieties, (1) <foreign lang="greek">kata\ to/pon</foreign>, local (comp. Phys. IV 11, 219 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14, seq.); (2) <foreign lang="greek">kata\ xro/non</foreign>, chronological, the order of time (Phys. IV 14, 223 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, seq.); (3) <foreign lang="greek">kata\ ki/nhsin</foreign>; (4) <foreign lang="greek">kata\ du/namin</foreign>, capacity or power; capacity a natural order, power either of nature or human choice; (5) <foreign lang="greek">kata\ ta/cin</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In the second the order of knowledge is referred to: only in two different applications the meaning of the two terms is inverted: in the order of <hi rend="italic">growth</hi> the particular is prior to the universal, sense and observation to generalisation or induction: in the order of dignity, the universal is prior to the particular, as the whole to the individual parts. The one is <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron pro\s h(ma=s</foreign>, the other, <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron a(plw=s</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The third, <foreign lang="greek">pro/tera le/getai ta\ tw=n prote/rwn pa/qh</foreign>, the priority of the attributes of the prior (in some series), as straightness is prior to smoothness, because the line is prior to the plane or surface&mdash;the notion is that the plane is <hi rend="italic">generated from</hi>, and so, in growth and origin, posterior to the line; and therefore the attribute of the latter is prior to that of the former&mdash;is not, as Bonitz remarks, coordinate with the three others, &ldquo;pendet enim a reliquis, quae suapte natura sunt priora, tamquam accidens a subiecto suo qui inhaeret.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>The fourth, the <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> of the Rhetoric, priority and posteriority in essence or substance, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ kata\ fu/sin kai\ ou)si/an</foreign>; priority in this sense belongs to things <foreign lang="greek">o(/sa e)nde/xetai ei)=nai a)/neu a)/llwn</foreign>: that is, things which are independent of others, whereas the others (the posterior) are dependent on them: the latter imply the former, the former do not necessarily imply the latter. Such is the relation of one and two; two always imply one, <pb n="184"/> one does not necessarily imply two. Similarly the <hi rend="italic">first category</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> substance, is prior to all the others, which express only properties and attributes of the first. This priority is <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>, which is evidently inserted merely because it was suggested by the opposite <foreign lang="greek">ge/nesis</foreign>, and being utterly useless in Rhetoric, from which all nice distinctions and subtleties of all kinds are alien, is accordingly passed over in the illustration. This division of <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> also includes priority of <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, where again the order of growth and of dignity inverts the relation of the two: <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, the capacity, being of course prior in growth or time, the <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">actus</hi>, the realization, or active and perfect condition, being superior in the order of dignity and importance, or in conception, <foreign lang="greek">lo/gw|</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Another division is that of <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a|</foreign> substance, <foreign lang="greek">lo/gw|</foreign> conception, and <foreign lang="greek">xro/nw|</foreign>. Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">*q</foreign> 8, 1049 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, seq. </p>

A whole implies its parts, and the parts a whole. Whole and part are relative terms: neither of them can stand alone, nor has any meaning except in reference to its correlative: hence of course the possibility of the one necessarily implies the possibility of the other. <foreign lang="greek">o(/lon le/getai ou(= mhqe\n a)/pesti me/ros e)c w(=n le/getai o(/lon fu/sei</foreign>, Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">*d</foreign> 26, 1023 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 26.

						<p>Of the parts of a shoe here mentioned we have absolutely no information either in ancient or modern authorities. The explanation of the word <foreign lang="greek">pro/sxisma</foreign>, given by Photius, who refers to Aristophanes for an example of it, <foreign lang="greek">ei)=dos u(podh/matos</foreign>; and by Hesychius, the same words with the <pb n="186"/> addition of <foreign lang="greek">e)sxisme/non e)k tou= e)/mprosqen</foreign>, and Pollux&mdash;will not apply <hi rend="italic">here</hi> at all events, nor to Ar.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pro/sxisma</lemma> is &lsquo;a slit in front&rsquo; of the shoe, with which Aristotle's use of the word in the Problem above quoted exactly agrees.

The <foreign lang="greek">pro/sxisma</foreign> is the slit down the front, which when the shoe is worn has to be laced up. This seems pretty certain; but of <foreign lang="greek">kefali/s</foreign> I can only conjecture from the name, that it is a head-piece, or <hi rend="italic">cap</hi>, covering the <hi rend="italic">toes</hi>, and distinguishing this kind of shoe from those in which the toes were left uncovered, which seems to have been the usual fashion. <foreign lang="greek">xitw/n</foreign>&mdash;guided by a very common use of the word, which extends it from a covering of the body to any covering whatsoever (in Rost and Palm's <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi>, s. v.

Stephens' Lexicon referring to this passage translates <foreign lang="greek">kefali/s</foreign> <hi rend="italic">tegumentum capitis!</hi> Xen. Cyrop. VIII 2. 5, (where <foreign lang="greek">sxi/zwn</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">xitw=nas</foreign> are used in connexion with shoes,) and Schneider's note, throw no additional light upon the exact meaning of these three words. </p>

If Schrader meant by <hi rend="italic">voluit</hi> that <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">wishing</hi>, and that it implies deliberation and purpose, as he certainly seems to say, this is a mistake. I will endeavour to determine the proper signification of <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign> and its distinction from <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign>. </p>
						<p>First, however, it must be admitted that neither of the two terms, <foreign lang="greek">bou/lesqai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumei=n</foreign>, is confined exclusively to its own proper and primary sense: these like other terms of psychology are used with a latitude and indefiniteness which belong to a very early stage of inquiry into the constitution of our inner man. For instance, <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign>, which properly denotes the three bodily appetites, is often extended to the <pb n="190"/> whole class of <hi rend="italic">desires</hi>, mental as well as bodily; and thus becomes identified or confounded with <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign>. </p>
						<p>From a comparison of three passages of our author in which we find notices of <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign>, we draw the inference that it means <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">will. Will</hi> implies <hi rend="italic">purpose;</hi> and we are distinctly told in Eth. Nic. III 4, 1111 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20 seq. that <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign> is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>, deliberate moral purpose, by the absence of this. Further the exercise of <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> is confined to things which are in our power to do or avoid; the wish sometimes is directed to what is impossible or unattainable, to immortality for instance or happiness. It is also directed to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, whereas <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> looks rather to the means of attaining the end. <foreign lang="greek">te/los e)sti\ tw=n praktw=n o(\ di) au(to\ boulo/meqa</foreign>, Eth. Nic. I 1, 1094 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 19. Further it is always directed to what is good, real or supposed, Rhet. I 10. 8. Psychologically considered, it belongs to the family of the <foreign lang="greek">o)re/ceis</foreign>, the instinctive impulses which prompt to action, acting unconsciously and without deliberation. These are three, de Anima II. 3, 414 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2, <foreign lang="greek">o)/recis me\n ga\r e)piqumi/a</foreign> (appetite) <foreign lang="greek">kai\ qumo/s</foreign> (passion, especially anger), <foreign lang="greek">kai\ bou/lhsis</foreign> (wish, the mental desire of good). (<foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign>, Rhet. u. s., is distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign>, by this intellectual character of discrimination between good and bad; <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign> being a mere animal appetite, <foreign lang="greek">a)/logos o)/recis</foreign>). Comp. de Anima I. 5, 411 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 28, <foreign lang="greek">e)/ti de\ to\ e)piqumei=n kai\ bou/lesqai kai\ o(/lws ai( o)re/ceis</foreign>, where the two are again distinguished. And in Rhet. u. s. the three <foreign lang="greek">o)re/ceis</foreign> are divided into <foreign lang="greek">logistikh/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/logoi</foreign>, the former character belonging to <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign>, the latter (irrational) to <foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a. e)piqumi/a</foreign> therefore is bodily appetite, and <foreign lang="greek">e)pequ/mei</foreign> here, as a cause of crime, though not excluding hunger and thirst, refers more particularly to <hi rend="italic">lust.</hi> In the second case, <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumou=sin tw=n e)pieikw=n</foreign>, &lsquo;desire&rsquo; is extended to intellectual impulses, which can distinguish good from bad; and is thus confounded with <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign>, which denotes wishing, but not willing. It is to be observed that the discrimination which is exercised by <foreign lang="greek">bou/lhsis</foreign> in the choice of good, is purely impulsive or instinctive, otherwise it would not be one of the <foreign lang="greek">o)re/ceis</foreign>: it employs no calculation or deliberation like the <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> preparatory to decision, and does not always stimulate to action; as when it is directed to impossibilities. </p>

In any other Greek author one would hardly perhaps venture upon thus supplying an ellipse; but I see no other way of extracting at once sense and Greek from the text. There appears to be no variation in the MSS. Bekker, ed. 3, and Spengel, read <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ei) e)/melle [gi/gnesqai, kai\] poiei=n</foreign>. In &sect; 19, the latter also puts <foreign lang="greek">e)bou/leto kai\</foreign>, and (after <foreign lang="greek">e)kw/luen</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ei) dunato\n</foreign> (so A^{c} for <foreign lang="greek">e)du/nato</foreign>), in brackets, as interpolations. The last three words are also omitted by MS Z^{b}. It seems to me that, in the two latter cases at least, the text is perfectly intelligible and defensible. The only reason alleged for omitting the five words in brackets in &sect; 19 is that, if we retain them, <foreign lang="greek">ei) e)bou/leto...e)kw/luen</foreign> is a mere repetition of the preceding <foreign lang="greek">ei) e)du/nato kai\ e)bou/leto</foreign>. That this is not the case, Victorius has pointed out in his explanation. The former of the two topics, &sect; 18, combines power and wish: both together are certain to produce the act. The latter statement is different; the wish alone is sufficient to produce the act&mdash;provided there are no external impediments in the way: in that case the mere wish, the internal impulse, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sufficient. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For it is natural or likely&mdash;this is all we want for our argument&mdash; that one who is waiting to do something, or on the point of doing it, would also actually carry out his intention, and do it: the probability is that it has been done&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>In this connexion of antecedent and consequent, if it is usual, but not necessary, it is a sign, <foreign lang="greek">shmei=on</foreign>, and uncertain; when necessary, it is a <foreign lang="greek">tekmh/rion</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;And again, if what had been previously (<foreign lang="greek">pefu/kei</foreign>, &lsquo;had always been&rsquo;, the regular accompaniment) the natural antecedent of so and so, (of the assumed event, or imputed act,) or means to a certain end, has happened, (then the ordinary consequent has happened, or the end aimed at been attained); for instance, we infer from the occurrence of thunder that there has been lightning; and from the <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi>, the execution of a crime&rsquo;. By <foreign lang="greek">e)pei/rase</foreign>, says Victorius, is meant&mdash;principally, not exclusively &mdash;<hi rend="italic">stuprum</hi>, &lsquo;seduction&rsquo;, the <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> on a woman's chastity: on this use of the verb <foreign lang="greek">peira=|n</foreign> see Ruhnken ad Tim. s. v. p. 210.

						<p>&lsquo;And (the converse) if what had been the ordinary natural consequent of something else, or the end of certain means (the aim and object of certain actions) has happened, then we infer that the ante<pb n="192"/> cedent in the one case has occurred, the means to the end in the other have been employed, as we infer lightning from thunder, and the attempt from the execution of an act or crime. And of all these cases, in some the connexion is of necessity, in the rest only for the most part&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> antecedent and consequent, as the uniform order of nature, is the <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> connexion: of the uncertain issues of <hi rend="italic">human agency</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ e)f'  h(mi=n</foreign>, actions which depend upon ourselves and our own will, nothing more than probability can be predicated: <foreign lang="greek">a)gaphto\n ou)=n peri\ toiou/twn kai\ e)k toiou/twn le/gontas paxulw=s kai\ tu/pw| ta)lhqe\s e)ndei/knusqai, kai\ peri\ tw=n w(s e)pi\ to\ polu\ kai\ e)k toiou/twn le/gontas toiau=ta kai\ sumperai/nesqai</foreign>: the conclusions of moral and social sciences can but amount to probability (Eth.

						<p>Arguments for the establishment of the probability of future events and consequences clearly may be derived from the same source: for where the power and the wish to do anything are united, the thing will be done; as likewise when desire, anger, and calculation, are accompanied by the power of gratifying the two first, and carrying out the third. Spengel has again, without manuscript authority, bracketed <foreign lang="greek">kai\ logismw=|</foreign> as an interpolation; doubtless because it is not mentioned in &sect;&sect; 18, 19, of which this is a summary. The objection has been already anticipated and answered by Victorius. Calculation or reasoning is implied, he thinks, in the desires of good men, which are always directed to what is good. I cannot think however that this is what Ar. means here by <foreign lang="greek">logismo/s</foreign>. And if we insist upon the strict interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumou=sin</foreign>, as excluding any operation of the intellect, still it is hard to deny the author the opportunity of supplying in &sect; 23 what he has omitted to notice in &sect; 19.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/sti de\ to\ me\n pra/gmata le/gein</lemma>] For <foreign lang="greek">para/deigma</foreign> of the older editions, I accept with Bekker, ed. 3, Spengel's alteration <foreign lang="greek">pra/gmata le/gein</foreign>. It is suggested by MS A^{c} <foreign lang="greek">paradei/gmata le/gein</foreign>, and supported by &sect; 8, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ dia\ tw=n pragma/twn</foreign>; see in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi> Munich 1851, p. 49. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The historical example (<foreign lang="greek">to\ le/gein pra/gmata progegenhme/na</foreign>) is of this kind: as if, for instance (a deliberative speaker) were to say, We must arm against the King&rsquo; (the Great King, the King of Persia, as usual without the article), &lsquo;and not allow him to subdue Egypt: for in fact Darius did not cross (the Aegean to attack us) until he had secured (got possession of) Egypt, but as soon as he had done that, he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> cross; and Xerxes again did not make <hi rend="italic">his</hi> attempt upon us until he had seized it, but crossed as soon as he was master of it: and therefore (the <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> from the two <hi rend="italic">examples</hi> or historical parallels) this King also is likely to cross if he is allowed to seize it, so that we must not permit it&rsquo;. The case here given in illustration is probably an imaginary one, <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ tis le/goi</foreign>; and this seems to be Victorius's opinion. But it is barely possible that the recovery of Egypt by Ochus, <foreign lang="greek">o( metonomasqei\s *)artace/rchs</foreign> (Diod.), about 350 B.C., Clint. <hi rend="italic">Fast. Hell.</hi> 11, p. 316 and note w, may have attracted the attention of the Athenian assembly, and this argument have been used by one of the speakers on the question. Max Schmidt, in his tract <hi rend="italic">On the date of the Rhetoric</hi>, makes use of this passage as helping to fix it, pp. 19&mdash;21. Artaxerxes' expedition to Egypt was undertaken in 351 B. C., and continued through the next year. Both the rival sovereigns, Nectanebus, the reigning king, and Artaxerxes, sent ambassadors to the Greek states for aid, and the subject excited general interest at Athens, as well as in the rest of Greece. It was at this time that Aristotle, who was then employed on his Rhetoric, introduced this illustration, which was suggested by what was actually going on at the time. </p>

On the definition, and various definitions of the &lsquo;parable,&rsquo; see Trench on the Parables, Ch. 1 Introd. The author in defining parable, and distinguishing it from fable, seems to confine himself too exclusively to the New Testament parables, when he says that the latter &ldquo;is constructed to set forth a truth spiritual and heavenly,&rdquo; whereas the fable &ldquo;never lifts itself above the earth&rdquo;; it &ldquo;inculcates maxims of prudential morality, industry, caution, foresight,&rdquo; all its morality being of a <hi rend="italic">worldly</hi> character, p. 2. And again, p. 9, &ldquo;the parable differs from the fable, moving as it does in a spiritual world, and never transgressing the actual order of things natural.&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, to whom Dr Trench does not refer, distinguishes parable <hi rend="italic">in general</hi> from fable by this; that the former depicts <hi rend="italic">human</hi> relations (in which the N. T. parable coincides with it); it <hi rend="italic">invents</hi> analogous cases, which are not <hi rend="italic">historical</hi>, but always such as <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be so; always probable, and corresponding with what actually occurs in real life. The fable is <hi rend="italic">pure fiction</hi>, and its essential characteristic is, that it invests beasts, birds, plants, and even things inanimate with the attributes of humanity.</note> the Socratic practice or method is an example; as for instance if one were to say, that the magistrates ought not to be chosen by lot: for this is analogous to the case of choosing for the athletes (who were to enter the lists) not those who are fitted for the combat, but those upon whom the lot falls; or to choosing the steersman out of a crew of sailors on the principle that it was the man who won the toss, and not the man of knowledge and skill (the man who knows his business), that ought to be chosen&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This very same analogy is ascribed to Socrates by the accuser at his trial, as one of those which he was in the habit of using, Xen. Memor. I 2. 9. And the same mode of inference, from the analogy of the mechanical and other arts, was transmitted by Socrates to Plato, and through him to his pupil Aristotle, in whose writings it constantly appears in illustration of many of his moral and social and political theories. It is to this practice of Socrates that Critias refers, when he and Charicles, during the tyranny of the Thirty, summoned him before them, and forbade him to continue his dialectical practice and intercourse with the young Athenians. Socrates inquires what sort of questions he is ordered to abstain from. Ib.

					<div3 id="b2c20s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>The fable may be exemplified by that of Stesichorus about Phalaris, and that of Aesop, in his defence of the demagogue. </p>
						<p>For when the Himereans had elected Phalaris general with absolute power, and were about to give him a body-guard, Stesichorus, after having finished the rest of his argument (or discussion), told them a fable, &lsquo;how a horse was the sole possessor of a meadow, when a stag came, and desiring to take vengeance upon the stag for spoiling his pasture he asked the man (or a man <foreign lang="greek">tina/</foreign>, MS A^{c}, Spengel) if he could help him to chastise the stag: the other assented, on the condition of his accepting a bit and allowing himself to mount him with his javelins: so when he had agreed and the other had mounted, instead of his revenge he himself became a slave henceforth to the man: so likewise you, said he, see to it that ye do not in your desire of vengeance upon your enemies share the fate of the horse: for the bit ye have already&mdash;when ye elected a general with absolute power, but if ye grant him a body-guard and let him get on your backs, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> henceforward ye <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be Phalaris' slaves.&rsquo; The same fable is briefly told by Horace, Ep. 1. 10. 34, <hi rend="italic">Cervus equum pugna melior communibus herbis pellebat</hi>, &amp;c. </p>
						<p>This fable of Stesichorus, which Aristotle here assigns to the age and case of Phalaris, is by Conon &lsquo;a writer in Julius Caesar's time,&rsquo; Bentley, <hi rend="italic">Phalaris</hi>, Vol. 1. p. 106 (ed. Dyce [p. 101 ed. Wagner]) transferred to that of Gelon; and this latter version is regarded by Bentley as the more probable; &lsquo;the circumstances of Gelon's history seem to countenance Conon.&rsquo; &lsquo;If we suppose then with the Arundel marble that Stesichorus lived Ol. LXXIII 3,&rsquo; (this is highly improbable; it places Stesichorus' <hi rend="italic">floruit</hi> a full century too low, in the year B. C. 486; which should indeed be 485, the year in which Gelon became master of Syracuse, Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici, sub anno</hi>,) &lsquo;it exactly <pb n="200"/> agrees with the age of Gelon, and Conon's account of the story may seem more credible than Aristotle's. And then all the argument that would settle Phalaris' age from the time of Stesichorus, will vanish into nothing&rsquo; (which is probably Bentley's principal reason for maintaining the paradox). Mure, M&uuml;ller and Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H., sub anno</hi> 632, place the date of Stesichorus' birth in B. C. 645, 643 or 632, and 632, severally; &lsquo;so that,&rsquo; says M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">H. G. L.</hi> ch. XIV 4, (as he lived over 80) &lsquo;he might be a contemporary of the Agrigentine tyrant Phalaris, against whose ambitious projects he is said by Aristotle to have warned his fellow-citizens (he was a native of Himera) in an ingenious fable.&rsquo; Mure likewise, Vol. III. p. 226, follows Aristotle. Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi>, places Phalaris' accession to the throne of Agrigentum in B. C. 570. On Phalaris, see Mr Bunbury's article in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary.</hi> Mr B. says, it would appear from Aristotle, Rhet. II 20, if there be no mistake in the story there told, that he was at one time master of Himera as well as Agrigentum. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And Aesop in Samos as advocate for a demagogue on his trial for a capital offence, said that a fox in crossing a river was driven into a cleft or chasm (in the bank); being unable to get out, she suffered for a long time, and many dog-ticks fastened upon her. And a hedgehog, in his wanderings, when he saw her, took compassion upon her, and asked her, if he should (was to, <hi rend="italic">optative</hi>) remove the dog-ticks from her. But she would not allow it. And upon his asking her why, she replied, because these are already satiated with me and suck (draw) little blood; but if you remove these, others will come, hungry, and drain me of all the blood that is left. But you too, men of Samos, he continued, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one will do you no more harm, for he has got rich; but if you put him to death, others will come who are poor, and they will waste all your public property by their thefts.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>This fable is referred to also by Plutarch, An seni gerenda respublica p. 790 C, <foreign lang="greek">h( me\n ga\r *ai)sw/peios a)lw/phc to\n e)xi=non ou)k ei)/a tou\s kro/twnas</foreign> <pb n="201"/> <foreign lang="greek">au)th=s a)felei=n boulo/menon, a)\n ga\r tou/tous, e)/fh, mestou\s a)palla/ch|s e(/teroi prosi/asi peinw=ntes</foreign>.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)s fa/ragga</lemma>] <foreign lang="greek">fa/ragc</foreign> has two senses, &lsquo;a cliff&rsquo;, as Alcm.

A fox in attempting to cross a rapid river has been carried down by the torrent, and lodged in a rent or chasm of the precipitous bank, and is there caught as it were in a trap, prevented from getting out by the rapidity of the stream in front. This sense of <foreign lang="greek">fa/ragc</foreign> is illustrated by Thuc. II 76, <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>, where it is used of the pits or clefts in the rocks into which the Athenians threw the bodies of the Spartan ambassadors who had been betrayed into their hands and then murdered, the Lacedaemonians having previously treated Athenian prisoners in the same manner, <foreign lang="greek">a)pe/kteinan pa/ntas kai\ e)s fa/raggas e)ne/balon</foreign>.

						<p>Another of these political &lsquo;fables&rsquo;, of Antisthenes (Socraticus), is referred to by Ar., Pol. III 13, 1284 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15. Speaking of the folly of attempting to control by legislation the born rulers, who, one or more, excel all the rest of the citizens together in virtue, and are like Gods amongst men, he adds, &ldquo;they would very likely reply if the attempt were made, <foreign lang="greek">a(/per *)antisqe/nhs e)/fh tou\s le/ontas dhmhgorou/ntwn tw=n dasupo/dwn</foreign> (hares) <foreign lang="greek">kai\ to\ i)/son a)ciou/ntwn pa/ntas e)/xein</foreign>.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;A maxim is a declaration&mdash;not however of particulars or individuals, as, for instance, what sort of a person Iphicrates is, but universally (a general statement, an universal moral rule or principle)&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">a)po/-</foreign> <pb n="205"/> <foreign lang="greek">fansis</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">a)pofai/nein</foreign>) a &lsquo;declaration&rsquo; or &lsquo;utterance&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)pofai/nesqai</lemma> seems to have some special connexion with <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> in its ordinary signification as well as this technical application. See Heindorf on Gorg. &sect; 48, p. 466 C. In several passages which the quotes the same verb is used for <hi rend="italic">declaring</hi> a <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, in the sense of <hi rend="italic">opinion.</hi> [&ldquo;So Protag. 336 D, <foreign lang="greek">th\n e(autou= gnw/mhn a)pofai/nesqai</foreign>; ib. 340 B.&rdquo; Dr Thompson on Gorg. 1. c.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And not of all universals, as, for example, that straight is opposed to crooked, but only of those which are concerned with (human) actions, and are to be chosen or avoided in respect of action.&rsquo; This concern with human action&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">pra=cis</foreign> can only be predicated of human beings&mdash;gives the <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> its <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> character. See, for instance, the beginning of the second chapter of Eth. Nic. II. Of actions it is said, 1104 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 31, <foreign lang="greek">au(=tai ga/r: ei)si ku/riai kai\ tou= poia\s gene/sqai ta\s e(/ceis</foreign>; they determine the moral character. And so frequently elsewhere. This moral character of the <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> however, though it undoubtedly predominates in the description and illustration of it through the remainder of the chapter, is not absolutely exclusive: the <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> may be applied likewise to all practical business of life, and all objects of human interest, as health in &sect; 5; and <foreign lang="greek">pra/ceis</foreign> must be supposed virtually to include these. With this definition that of Auct. ad Heren. IV 17. 24 deserves to be compared: it is not so complete as Aristotle's, but may be regarded as supplementary to it: <hi rend="italic">Sententia</hi> (i. e. <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, which is also the term by which Quintilian expresses it, Inst. Orat. VIII 5) <hi rend="italic">est oratio sumpta de vita, quae aut quid sit aut quid esse oporteat in vita breviter ostendit, hoc pacto;</hi> it is there illustrated to the end of the chapter. One useful precept for the guidance of the rhetorician in the employment of the <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> may be quoted here, especially as Aristotle has omitted it. <hi rend="italic">Sententias interponi raro convenit, ut rei actores, non vivendi praeceptores videamur esse.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">gnw=mai</foreign> often take the form of &lsquo;precepts&rsquo;. Harris, u. s, p. 182. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore since rhetorical enthymemes are as one may say&rsquo; <pb n="206"/> (<foreign lang="greek">sxedo/n</foreign> &lsquo;pretty nearly&rsquo;, that is, not absolutely, but generally, making allowance for some which are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> concerned with the practical business of life&mdash;so Victorius) &lsquo;the logical mode of reasoning or inference on these subjects (the business of life and human actions), when this syllogistic process is withdrawn (and the major premiss or conclusion is left alone), the conclusions and major premisses of enthymemes are <foreign lang="greek">gnw=mai</foreign>&rsquo;. These premisses and conclusions taken by themselves are mere <hi rend="italic">enunciations</hi> of some general principle: they do not become enthymemes, i. e. inferences or processes of <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi>, till <hi rend="italic">the reason</hi> is added&mdash;sententia <hi rend="italic">cum ratione</hi>, Quint. and Auct. ad Heren., Introd. p. 257&mdash;which is stated in the next sentence. <hi rend="italic">Hanc quidem partem enthymematis quidam initium aut clausulam epichirematis esse dixerunt: et est aliquando, non tamen semper.</hi> Quint. VIII 5. 4 (de Sententiis, VIII 5. 1&mdash;8, q. v.). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For instance, &ldquo;No man that is of sound mind ought ever to have his children over-educated to excess in learning,&rdquo; (Eur. Med. 294). Now this is a maxim (moral precept, the <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> of the enthymeme): but the addition of the reason, and the why (the <foreign lang="greek">ai)ti/a</foreign> or cause) makes the whole an enthymeme, for example, &ldquo;for besides the idle habits which they thereby contract to boot&rdquo; (into the bargain&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">comparative</hi> <foreign lang="greek">a)/llos</foreign>, other, in this common, but illogical use of the word, brings two heterogeneous things into illicit comparison: see [p. 46 <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> and note on III 1. 9]) &ldquo;they reap (gain as their reward) hostile jealousy from the citizens.&rdquo; The <foreign lang="greek">a)rgi/a</foreign> here is the literary indolence, or inactivity, the withdrawal from active life and the consequent neglect of their duties as citizens, into which they are led by their studious habits. This is what provokes the jealousy and hostility of the citizens. Plato's unpopularity at Athens was due to the same cause. Plato justifies himself against these charges of his enemies in four well known passages, in the Republic [VI 484&mdash;497], Theaetetus [172 C] and Gorgias [527]; and in the seventh Epistle, if that be his [see Introd. to Dr Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, pp. xii&mdash;xiv]. </p>
						<p>These lines are put into the enthymematic form, as an argument, in &sect; 7. It is a specimen of a <hi rend="italic">practical syllogism</hi>, or enthymeme, logic applied to action or conduct. As a syllogism it would run thus: All <pb n="207"/> ought to avoid, or no man should be rendered liable to, idle habits and the hatred of his fellow-citizens: children who are over-educated do become idle and unpopular; therefore children ought not to be overeducated. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, &ldquo;There is no man who is altogether happy&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;Eur. Fragm. Sthenel. I (Dind., Wagn.). The <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>, which converts it into an enthymeme, is supplied by Aristoph. Ran. 1217, <foreign lang="greek">h)\ ga\r pefukw\s e)sqlo\s ou)k e)/xei bi/on, h)\ dusgenh\s w)/n</foreign>, (he is here interrupted by Aeschylus who finishes the verse for him with <foreign lang="greek">lhku/qion a)pw/lesen</foreign>: but the Schol. supplies the conclusion,) <foreign lang="greek">plousi/an a)roi= pla/ka</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And another, &ldquo;there is none of mankind that is free&rdquo;&rsquo; is a <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, but with the addition of the next verse (<foreign lang="greek">tw=| e)xome/nw| e)/pei</foreign>) it becomes an enthymeme, &lsquo;&ldquo;for he is the slave either of money or fortune.&rdquo;&rsquo; From Eur. Hec. 864. Our texts have <foreign lang="greek">qnhtw=n</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrw=n</foreign>: doubtless it is one of Ar.'s ordinary slips of memory in quotation, and a very unimportant one. But I think as a general rule, it is quite unsafe to rely upon our author's quotations in correction of any reading in more ancient writers. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c21s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p>&lsquo;If then a <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> is what has been described, there must necessarily be four kinds of <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>: either with, or without, an appendage or supplement (containing the reason)&rsquo;. It is first put forward independently as a <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, and then, if it is not generally acceptable, and a reason is required, this is added, and it becomes an enthymeme. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Those that require proof (<foreign lang="greek">a)po/deicis</foreign> &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo;, as before, used loosely for proof of any kind) are all such as state anything paradoxical (contrary to received opinion; or surprising, unexpected, contrary to expectation, and to anything that you ever heard before) or anything which is questioned (or open to question): those that have nothing unexpected about them (may be stated, <foreign lang="greek">le/gontai</foreign>) without a supplement&rsquo;.

						<p>The first two kinds are those which require no supplement. &lsquo;Of these, some must require no supplement owing to their being already well known, as, &ldquo;best of all is wealth for a man, at least in my opinion;&rdquo; because most people think so&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The line here quoted is of uncertain origin. There was a famous <foreign lang="greek">sko/lion</foreign>, drinking-song or catch, usually attributed to Simonides, which Athen., XV 694 E, has preserved amongst several that he there quotes; and it is also to be found in Bergk's Collection, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Lyr. Gr.</hi> Scolia, <pb n="208"/> 13. It runs thus: <foreign lang="greek">u(giai/nein me\n a)/riston a)ndri\ qnatw=|, deu/teron de\ kalo\n fu/an gene/sqai, to\ tri/ton de\ ploutei=n a)do/lws, kai\ to\ te/tarton h(ba=|n meta\ tw=n fi/lwn</foreign>. This is repeated by Anaxandrides in some iambics of his Thesaurus, Fragm. I (Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Comm. Gr.</hi> III 169), and quoted by Athen. immediately after the <foreign lang="greek">sko/lion</foreign> as a parallel or illustration. Anaxandrides does not know the author; <foreign lang="greek">o( to\ sko/lion eu(rw\n e)kei=nos, o(/stis h)=n</foreign>. Plato has likewise quoted it in Gorg. 451 E, and elsewhere (see Stallbaum's note). The Scholiast on this passage says, <foreign lang="greek">to\ sko/lion tou=to oi( me\n *simwni/dou fasi/n, oi( de\ *)epixa/rmou</foreign>. On which Meineke, u. s., note, says &lsquo;Nonne igitur pro <foreign lang="greek">h(mi=n</foreign> legendum <foreign lang="greek">e)mi/n</foreign>, et ipse ille versus, <foreign lang="greek">a)ndri\ d'  u(giai/nein k.t.l.</foreign>, Epicharmo tribuendus?&rsquo; The trochaic metre is doubtless in favour of this supposition, but that shews on the other hand that it could not have formed part of the scolion above quoted, which is in quite a different measure: and also, supposing it to be taken from that, it would be a most improbable and unmeaning repetition of the first line. If therefore Meineke is right in attributing it to Epicharmus, it must have belonged to another and independent scolion. Another scholium in Cramer, Anecd. Paris. on Ar. Rhet. has <foreign lang="greek">to\ &ldquo;a)ndri\ d'  u(giai/nein a)/riston&rdquo; *simwni/dou e)sti\n a)po\ tw=n skoliw=n au)tou= e)pw=n. oi(\ d) *)epixa/rmou</foreign>. Meineke, u. s. Simonides at all events has something like it, <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\ kala=s sofi/as xa/ris, ei) mh/ tis e)/xei semna\n u(gi/eian</foreign>. This places health at the head of the list of goods: another distich, quoted in Ar. Eth. Nic. I 9, Eth. Eudem. init., as &lsquo;the Delian inscription&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ to\ propu/laion tou= *lhtw/|ou</foreign> (Eth. Eud.), Theogn. 255, and (in iambics) Soph. Fragm. Creus. (Stob. CIII 15, Dind. Fr. 326), places health second in the order, or rather, perhaps, leaves the question open. Ariphron of Sicyon (Athen. XV 702 A) wrote a hymn to Health, beginning <foreign lang="greek">u(gi/eia presbi/sta maka/rwn</foreign>; he also regards it as the greatest of all blessings, <foreign lang="greek">se/qen de\ xwri\s ou)/tis eu)dai/mwn e)/fu</foreign>, line 8.

						<p>&lsquo;Of those which have the supplement (these are the two kinds <pb n="209"/> of the second division), some are part of an enthymeme, as &ldquo;no man of sound mind ought,&rdquo; (the commencement of the verses of Euripides in &sect; 2), and the rest have an enthymematic character, but are not part of an enthymeme: which (the latter) are in fact the most popular&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">ai( me\n e)nqumh/matos me/ros</foreign> may be thought to be a careless expression, contradictory to the description of enthymeme in I 2. 13: since it is characteristic of the enthymeme that it omits at least one of the premisses (see on the enthymeme Introd. p. 104), and therefore a <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> with the reason appended represents a conclusion with one premiss, which is an enthymeme. The explanation seems to be that an enthymeme is an <hi rend="italic">assumed</hi> syllogism: the inference which it draws rests upon the possibility of constructing a syllogism out of it: if that cannot be done, the inference is not valid. So that in one sense the enthymeme is a true and complete syllogism, in another, in so far as it <hi rend="italic">expresses</hi> only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> premiss, it may be called <hi rend="italic">a part</hi> of it, and incomplete. And this serves to explain the statement of I 2. 13, <foreign lang="greek">to\ d'  e)nqu/mhma sullogismo/n</foreign> (i. e. a mode of syllogistic reasoning), <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e)c o)li/gwn te kai\ polla/kis e)latto/nwn h)\ e)c w(=n o( prw=tos sullogismo/s</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And all those have this (latter) character in which the reason of the (general) statement is made to appear, as in this, &ldquo;mortal as thou art, guard, keep (cherish), not immortal anger;&rdquo; for, to say &ldquo;that a man ought not to keep his anger for ever&rdquo; is a <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>; but the addition, &ldquo;as a mortal&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">because</hi> he is a mortal), states the (reason) <hi rend="italic">why.</hi> And like it again is this, &ldquo;Mortal thoughts&rdquo; (or a mortal spirit&mdash;that is, one which confines its aims and aspirations within the limits of its mortal condition), &ldquo;not immortal, become a mortal man.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
						<p>The first of these two quotations is used by Bentley in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Phalaris</hi>, p. 247 [p. 229 ed. Wagner], and foll. He does not attempt to fix the authorship of it, but contents himself with saying &ldquo;this, though the author of it be not named, was probably...borrowed from the stage,&rdquo; p. 247, but afterwards, p. 249 [231], &ldquo;and even that one (the verse in question) is very likely to be taken from the same place&rdquo; (viz. Euripides). Subsequently, p. 262 [243], he speaks of it as from &ldquo;a poet cited by Aristotle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aristotle's poet.&rdquo; He quotes from Euripides' Philoctetes, Fragm. IX (Dind.), XII (Wagner), a parallel passage as having been borrowed by the author of Phalaris, <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper de\ qnhto\n kai\ to\ sw=m'  h(mw=n e)/fu, ou(/tw prosh/kei mhde\ th\n o)rgh\n e)/xein a)qa/naton, o(/stis swfronei=n e)pi/statai</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;The use of maxims, or sententious language, is appropriate in respect of age (time of life) to elders, and as to subjects, should be directed to those in which the speaker has experience; since for one who is not so far advanced in life to employ maxims is as unbecoming as story-telling (i. e. fables, legends, mythical stories), whilst to talk about things that one knows nothing of is a mark of folly and ignorance (or want of cultivation)&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">muqologei=n</foreign> Victorius says, &ldquo;Fabellarum sane auditione delectantur pueri; non tamen ipsis fabulas fingere aut narrare congruit.&rdquo; And this, because young people have as yet had little or no experience of life, and if they pronounce maxims and precepts at all, must do it of things of which they are ignorant: and this shews folly, as well as ignorance. So Quintilian, who supplies the reason for this precept: VIII 5. 8, <hi rend="italic">ne passim</hi> (sententiae) <hi rend="italic">et a quocunque dicantur.

						<p>&lsquo;Maxims may also be cited in opposition to, or in contradiction of, those that have become public property&mdash;by these I mean such as &lsquo;know thyself&rsquo;, &lsquo;avoid excess&rsquo; (the maxims or adages of Solon and Chilon)&mdash;whenever one's character is likely to be put in a more favourable light (thereby), or the <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> has been pronounced in an excited state of feeling (by the opponent who is to be answered); of this &lsquo;pathetic&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> an instance is, if for example a man in a fit of passion were to say that it is false that a man is bound to know himself, &ldquo;this gentleman at any rate, if he knew himself, would never have claimed to be elected general.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Aristotle has said that there are two classes of cases in which a <pb n="217"/> generally accepted or &lsquo;universal&rsquo; maxim&mdash;such as Solon's <foreign lang="greek">gnw=qi seauto/n</foreign>&mdash;may be contradicted <hi rend="italic">with effect.</hi> One of these is, when the <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> itself, including the contradiction of it&mdash;as appears from the example&mdash; is uttered in a state of excited feeling, real or assumed, such as indignation. The example of this is a man <hi rend="italic">in a fit of passion</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">o)rgizo/menos</foreign>, loudly asserting that Solon's universally accepted maxim, or the precept conveyed by it, is untrue, or at any rate liable to exception; for if so and so (some imaginary person) had had a true knowledge of himself (and his own incapacity) he never would have aspired to be a general: but he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> done so, and succeeded in the attempt: and this <hi rend="italic">success</hi> shews the falsity of the rule, as a prudential maxim, at any rate in this case; and also being <hi rend="italic">undeserved</hi> provokes the indignation of the speaker. And it is to be observed that this success without merit is <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> to inspire the feeling, the existence of which is distinctly stated. The case is that of Cleon, Thuc. IV 27 seq. Victorius however understands it in a different sense. According to him the case is that of an Iphicrates, who raised himself from a low condition to the height of power and distinction; Rhet. I 7. 32, <foreign lang="greek">*)ifikra/ths au(to\n e)nekwmi/aze le/gwn e)c w(=n u(ph=rce tau=ta</foreign>; I 9. 31, <foreign lang="greek">e)c oi(/wn ei)s oi(=a</foreign>, (<foreign lang="greek">to\ tou= *)ifikra/tous</foreign>); if Iphicrates had &lsquo;known himself&rsquo;, i. e. remembered his origin, he never could have entered upon such a career. But it seems to me that this is not a proper interpretation of &lsquo;self-knowledge&rsquo;, and that the maxim could not be applied in this sense: the mere recollection of his former low estate surely is not entitled to the name of knowledge of self. Iphicrates, instead of disobeying the precept, conformed to it in the strictest sense; he did <hi rend="italic">know himself</hi> so well, he was so fully aware of his capacity for fulfilling the duties of the office, that he did not hesitate to apply for and exercise the command of an army. Victorius' words are; &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">paqhtikw=s</foreign> dicet, qui ira percitus ita loquetur&rdquo; (but what is the <hi rend="italic">occasion</hi> of the anger, when it is thus interpreted? The mere contradiction of an universal maxim does not give rise to a fit of passion), &ldquo;falsum est omnino, quod aiunt, debere homines seipsos nosse: hic enim profecto si se ipsum cognosset nunquam praetor ducere exercitum voluisset.&rdquo; It may perhaps be meant that the speaker <hi rend="italic">assumes</hi> indignation in order to give force to his contradiction: or really gets into a passion at the thought of the folly of mankind for believing it. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Our character is bettered, men's opinion of our character is improved, by saying for instance (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on ei)/ tis le/goi</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">aut tale aliquid</hi>) that we ought not, as is said, to love as with the prospect of our love being turned into hatred, but rather the reverse, to hate as if that was likely to become love&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fortiko/ths</lemma>, as far as Classical Greek is concerned, appears to be a <foreign lang="greek">a(/pac lego/menon</foreign>: it is found also in Eustathius (Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi> sub v.). <foreign lang="greek">fortiko/s</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">fo/rtos</foreign> a burden or load, burden-like, burden-ish, and hence met. burdensome, oppressive, annoying: especially applied to <hi rend="italic">vulgarity</hi>, in person, manners, or intellect. The last of these senses, intellectual vulgarity, the want of cultivation and refinement, and especially of philosophical cultivation&mdash;a coarse and vulgar habit of mind, which looks merely at the surface of things, with little or no faculty of observation or power of distinction, and contents itself with a mere vulgar knowledge shared with the mass of mankind&mdash;is, if not <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> to Aristotle, at any rate much more commonly found in his writings than in others. In this sense the <foreign lang="greek">fortiko/s</foreign> does not differ much from the <foreign lang="greek">a)pai/deutos</foreign>, and is opposed to the <foreign lang="greek">xariei/s</foreign>, which, in Aristotle, often expresses the <hi rend="italic">highest degree</hi> of <hi rend="italic">grace</hi> and refinement, arising from the study of philosophy. It is in this signification that the word is used here, meaning a want of intelligence and of philosophical or (generally) intellectual training, which disqualifies men for making distinctions and estimating the value of an argument; consequently they measure the validity of a <pb n="219"/> reason not by its logical force or cogency, but by its coincidence with their own previously conceived opinions; which they love to hear exaggerated by the orator, who humours them by these illicit generalisations. The Scholiast explains it <foreign lang="greek">a)groiki/an</foreign>. Victorius has, I think, entirely mistaken the meaning of the word. The <foreign lang="greek">fortiko/ths</foreign> here ascribed to vulgar audiences is much the same as the <foreign lang="greek">moxqhri/a tw=n a)kroatw=n</foreign>, III 1. 5, the vices or defects, which oblige the orator to have recourse to <foreign lang="greek">ta)=lla e)/cw tou= a)podei=cai</foreign> in order to convince them, because they are unable to appreciate logic alone.

						<p>&lsquo;Now that the enthymeme is a kind of syllogism has been already stated (I 2. 8, and 13), and also how (in what respects) it is a syllogism, and wherein it differs from those of dialectics (I 2. 11); for&rsquo;&mdash; these are two of the differences&mdash;&lsquo;we must neither go very far back, nor introduce all the steps (of the regular syllogism), in drawing our inferences; the one is obscure by reason of its length, the other is mere chattering (idle talk, or vain repetition, leading to nothing, III 3. 3), because it states what everybody sees already (what is already evident)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)/te ga\r po/rrwqen k t.l.</lemma>] This is a manifest reference to I 2. 13, where <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of these two things which the rhetorician has to avoid are expressly mentioned. </p>
						<p>First, he must not deduce his inference, the conclusion which he wishes to establish, by a long train of connected syllogisms from a remote distance, <foreign lang="greek">sullogi/zesqai kai\ suna/gein e)k sullelogisme/nwn pro/teron... a)na/gkh mh\ ei)=nai eu)epakolou/qhton dia\ to\ mh=kos, o( ga\r krith\s u(po/keitai ei)=nai a(plou=s</foreign>.

(Comp. Topic. A 11, 105 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 8, where this is extended to dialectical argumentation. A similar precept is given in III 17. 6. <foreign lang="greek">po/rrwqen</foreign> of &lsquo;farfetched&rsquo; metaphors, III 2. 12. Comp. III 3. 4.) This will only puzzle his &lsquo;simple&rsquo; audience, whose powers of perception and memory will be alike unable to keep pace with him. The reasoning of the rhetorician must be as clear and as brief as possible. </p>
						<p>Secondly, he must draw his conclusion without expressing all that <pb n="222"/> belongs to the regular syllogism; this is also for the sake of brevity; the formal syllogism is unsuitable to the orator who has a great deal to say, and is hastening to his conclusion, fearing to weary his audience, because it <hi rend="italic">expresses</hi> a great deal that is self-evident, and may well be left for the hearers themselves to supply. Besides this, the enthymeme which he employs obliges him to omit either one of the two premisses or the conclusion; which of them it is to be, depends upon the degree in which the reasoning will be intelligible without it: anything that is absolutely <foreign lang="greek">fanero/n</foreign> should (in reasoning) be omitted to save time. These are the two points in which the use of the enthymeme differs from that of the dialectical syllogism. </p>
						<p>With respect to the first, the dialectician, whose object is merely to gain the victory in the dispute, and who has an antagonist more or less a match for him, can take his own time, and need not accommodate his reasoning to the intelligence of his opponent: to the rhetorician, the time allowed is generally limited, he has usually an uneducated and perhaps unintelligent audience to address, which he must keep in good humour, and therefore neither puzzle nor weary. The second point conveys the essential difference between the enthymeme and dialectical syllogism, that in the former <foreign lang="greek">ou) pa/nta dei= lamba/nontas suna/gein. pa/nta</foreign> may also include, what Schrader adds, &ldquo;multas propositiones probabiles, communes, intempestivas,&rdquo; which &ldquo;plane omitti debere praecipit.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">a)dolesxi/a</foreign>, see note on III 3. 3. Eth. N. III 13, 1118 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> I. Comp. de Soph. El. c. 3, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 15. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou=to ga/r</lemma>] <foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> here can hardly bear its usual signification, that of &lsquo;a reason assigned&rsquo;: the fact&mdash;that the uneducated are more convincing to a mob than your philosopher&mdash;is not the reason of the preceding statement, but rather the reverse; the previous statement explains (supplies the reason or explanation of) the fact. It must therefore be a case of that use of <foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> which Schleiermacher in his translation of Plato represents by <hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich, videlicet;</hi> a use of the word which frequently occurs in the Platonic dialogues. And so I have translated it: though it is to be observed that if <hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich</hi> always represents the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> (in these special cases), the English &lsquo;namely&rsquo; will not always represent the German <hi rend="italic">n&auml;mlich.</hi> [Comp. note 1 on p. 134, and Shilleto on Thuc. I. 25. 4.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This, <hi rend="italic">namely</hi>, is also the reason why the ignorant (or illiterate) have a greater power of persuading when they are addressing a mob than the highly educated or cultivated (in dialectics and philosophy), as the poets say that the uncultivated are the more accomplished speakers in a crowd&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi( poihtai/</lemma>] is generalised from one, viz. Euripides, who alone is referred to.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mousiko/s</lemma>, has here an unusual sense, which seems to be borrowed from the notion of <hi rend="italic">cultivation</hi>, literary and intellectual, which the term expresses: hence &lsquo;skilled in&rsquo;, &lsquo;highly trained or cultivated&rsquo; in the practice of a <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> art.

						<p>&lsquo;For the one (the <foreign lang="greek">pepaideume/noi</foreign>) talk about generals and universals, the others about (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;from&rsquo;, the materials <hi rend="italic">from</hi> which the speech is derived) what they really know, and things that are near to us (near, that is, to our observation, things sensible; and to our interests, those which nearly concern us)&rsquo;. The <foreign lang="greek">koina\ kai\ kaqo/lou</foreign> are the general or abstract, and universal notions, with which alone the philosopher and man of science care to deal. These are of course remote from popular knowledge and interests. The <hi rend="italic">artist</hi> also is conversant with &lsquo;generals&rsquo; and not with &lsquo;particulars or individuals&rsquo;: the rules of art are all general rules.

						<p>&lsquo;We therefore must not derive our arguments or inferences from all possible opinions&rsquo; (&ldquo;ex omnibus quae probantur, et vera esse videntur.&rdquo; Victorius); &lsquo;but select them out of those which are defined or determined or settled for us (marked off, and separated from the rest, as especially suitable to our purpose) (in some way or other) as, for instance, either by the judges (i. e. their known opinions: this in a law case) or those whose authority they accept&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>That is, there are many truths, such as scientific generalities, which may indeed be included amongst <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi> (because they are <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">known</hi>) but yet are alien to the purposes of Rhetoric, and also many opinions, properly so called, which are unfit for its use, <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)c w(=n e)/tuxen</foreign>, I 2. 11; and besides this, &ldquo;every fool has some opinions&rdquo;, I 2. 11; we must therefore make a selection if we wish to persuade&mdash; we had been already told that though the sphere of Rhetoric, like that of Dialectics, is theoretically unlimited, I 2. 1, yet that in practice it is usually confined to the business of life and human action, and therefore that its materials are in fact drawn from Politics, including Ethics, from political and social philosophy, ib. &sect; 7. </p>
						<p>Here however there is a still further restriction&mdash;we must select out of the vast range of probable opinions those which happen to suit our immediate purpose: for instance, if we are arguing a case in a law-court we must draw our inferences from such opinions as they (the judges) themselves are known to hold, or at any rate such as those whom they regard as authorities are known to approve. <foreign lang="greek">kri/nein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">krith/s</foreign>, as we have seen, II 1. 2; 18. 1, may be extended to the <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> of audiences in all three branches of Rhetoric, the assembly, the judges, and the <foreign lang="greek">qeatai/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">qewroi/</foreign> of an epideixis, and Victorius takes this view. As however <foreign lang="greek">kri/nousin</foreign> is qualified by <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on</foreign>, which shews that there are other analogous cases, the two audiences of indirect <foreign lang="greek">kri/nontes</foreign> may perhaps be left to be understood. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And his inferences should be drawn not only from necessary propositions, but also from those that are only true for the most part&rsquo;, probabilities.

						<p>The construction of the preceding clause <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste&mdash;oi( to/poi</foreign> I understand to be this, though Vahlen [<hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Vienna Acad. of Sciences</hi>, Oct. 1861, p. 131] declares <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">to/pwn</foreign> to be indefensible. <foreign lang="greek">*to/pwn</foreign> is attracted, as usual, to the construction of the relative, for <foreign lang="greek">oi( to/poi e)c w(=n dei= fe/rein ta\ e)nqumh/mata</foreign>: and <foreign lang="greek">oi( to/poi</foreign> is repeated at the <pb n="234"/> end of the clause&mdash;unnecessarily perhaps, but not ungrammatically&mdash; in the second part of it introduced by <foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign>. As to the <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>, readers of Aristotle must have remarked that his <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>'s are not always to be very strictly interpreted; sometimes they almost lose the force of a logical <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi>, and indicate little more than a <hi rend="italic">sequence.</hi> I presume that Vahlen's meaning (which is not explained) is, that <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste k.t.l.</foreign> is a mere repetition, and no consequence at all. But the two things spoken of are not precisely identical, and there is a certain connexion of cause and effect between them: it is first said in general terms that the premisses upon each subject of Rhetoric have been already selected: and from this it may <hi rend="italic">in a sense</hi> be said to <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> that we are supplied <hi rend="italic">in detail</hi>, with topics for our enthymemes, with <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> or special topics under the three branches of Rhetoric, and also for the <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh, pa/qh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e(/ceis</foreign> in Bk. II. </p>
						<p>Vahlen, u. s. pp. 130, 1, for the reasons before mentioned (some account of his views on this subject has been given in the introductory observations on c. 18), condemns the whole of section 16, as the interpolation of an editor, who has inserted (we are not told <hi rend="italic">why</hi>) a sentence &lsquo;without motive, and disturbing&rsquo; the connexion, in which of course, following the <hi rend="italic">altered</hi> arrangement (which is assumed) he has placed the <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> immediately after the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> (as they now stand). </p>
						<p>Besides this he objects to <foreign lang="greek">paqhma/twn</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e(/cewn</foreign>, with which we have next to deal. <foreign lang="greek">pa/qhma</foreign> in this sense for <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, is certainly very rare, perhaps unique. But, <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi>, there are at least four passages where <foreign lang="greek">pa/qhma</foreign> is found in other senses, to express which <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> is always elsewhere employed. Metaph.

Bernays, while admitting that the words are often used loosely, draws the following distinction: <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> <hi rend="italic">ist der Zustand eines</hi> <foreign lang="greek">pa/sxwn</foreign> <hi rend="italic">und bezeichnet den unerwartet ausbrechenden und vor&uuml;bergehendenden Affect;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">pa/qhma</foreign> <hi rend="italic">dagegen ist der Zustand eines</hi> <foreign lang="greek">paqhtiko\s</foreign> <hi rend="italic">und bezeichnet den Affect also inh&auml;rirend der afficirten Person und als jederzeit zum Ausbruche reif.

Baumgart, <hi rend="italic">Pathos und Pathema im Aristotelischen Sprachgebrauch</hi>, K&ouml;nigsberg, 1873, pp. 58.]</note>. <pb n="235"/> </p>
						<p>As to <foreign lang="greek">e(/cewn</foreign>, this, through a deviation from the author's usual phraseology, who generally confines himself to <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, appears again in this connexion, II 12 init., <foreign lang="greek">ta\ d'  h)/qh poi=oi/ tines kata\ ta\ pa/qh kai\ ta\s e(/ceis k.t.l.</foreign> The author there himself tells us his meaning, interpreting <foreign lang="greek">e(/ceis</foreign> by <foreign lang="greek">a)reta\s kai\ kaki/as</foreign>; and I can see no reason for condemning the word, as Vahlen does, except the very insufficient one, that it is unusual<note anchored="yes">I have noticed in many recent German commentators on Aristotle, Brandis being an honourable exception, a disposition to pin down their author to a fixed and particular mode of expression in certain cases from which he is never to be allowed to deviate. Aristotle is the very last writer to whom any such rule should be applied. He is always hasty, often careless; and, as we have seen in so many instances in this work, is very apt to use words in senses either vague and indeterminate, or (properly) inapplicable, or unusual; and his style is loose and careless to a fault, both in construction and expression. He is a writer who more than all others requires a most liberal allowance for irregularities.</note>. The <foreign lang="greek">e(/ceis</foreign> in this sense, do actually enter into, and in fact constitute the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, and I do not see why they should not be specially mentioned, if Aristotle chose to depart from his ordinary practice, and do so. </p>
						<p>So far then we have been occupied with the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, special subjects derived from special sciences, and specially employed each in one of the three departments of Rhetoric&mdash;this is generally, not absolutely true; for though the three ends of Rhetoric, the good or useful, the just, and the noble or right, are more appropriate and more serviceable, each in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the three branches, yet any of them can be, and sometimes is, introduced in them all&mdash;and we must now turn to the topics, the families, classes, of arguments into which enthymemes in <hi rend="italic">general</hi> may be made to fall. This is for convenience of practice, that we may know where to look for them when we want them, and apply that which happens to be appropriate to the particular case. This classification is made in the 23rd chapter, which therefore is the <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi> representative of the far more extensive and minute classification of <hi rend="italic">dialectical</hi> topics, and is the object also of Cicero's Topica. And as the treatise on fallacies, the book <foreign lang="greek">peri\ sofistikw=n e)le/gxwn</foreign>, is appended to the books of the Topics, so we have a similar chapter on rhetorical fallacies (c. 24) added to the analysis of the genuine arguments. </p>
						<p>I will here remark (against Vahlen) that the word <foreign lang="greek">kaqo/lou</foreign> &sect; 17, which contrasts these universal <foreign lang="greek">to/poi</foreign> with the special topics that have preceded, renders the actual mention of them in the foregoing section almost, if not quite, necessary. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c22s17" type="section" n="17">
						<p>&lsquo;Let us now proceed further in another way to take (or find) <pb n="236"/> universal topics about every thing (taken promiscuously, that is, from any of the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, and applied indifferently to any of the three branches of Rhetoric), and add a supplementary note upon the refutative and demonstrative (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">to/pous e)nqumhma/twn</foreign>) topics of enthymemes (the contents of c. 23), and those of apparent&rsquo; (shams, impostors, not genuine), &lsquo;not real, enthymemes; not real, because this is likewise the case with syllogisms (of which enthymemes though mutilated are a copy, and therefore share with the others the fallacious kind)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The literal translation of <foreign lang="greek">ou)k o)/ntwn de\ e)nqumhma/twn, e)pei/ per ou)de\ sullogismw=n</foreign> is, &ldquo;enthymemes not real, because there are also unreal (not-real syllogisms&rdquo;; <foreign lang="greek">ou)de/</foreign>, neither, being broken up into two parts, of which the <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> contrasts <foreign lang="greek">sullogismw=n</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">e)nqumhma/twn</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> negatives the <hi rend="italic">genuineness</hi> (und. from the preceding) of the syllogism, not the syllogism itself. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">parashmaino/menoi</lemma>] is a very oddly chosen word to express the treatment of chapters 23 and 24, which are just as much connected with the subject of the work, and treated with as much care and detail, as the rest. It means according to Victorius (and Rost and Palm's <hi rend="italic">Lex.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">adscribere, adnotare</hi>, applied to something of subordinate interest and importance, or not immediately and closely connected with the subject in hand, as a <hi rend="italic">note</hi> on the margin of a manuscript; &lsquo;noting beside&rsquo; the main subject, <hi rend="italic">a supplementary note.</hi> This is certainly the meaning of it in Top. A 14, 105 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 16, where it is applied to the &lsquo;noting down&rsquo; of the opinions of individual philosophers, &lsquo;beside&rsquo;, as supplementary to, those which are generally accepted: and also, as Victorius thinks, of <foreign lang="greek">para/shma</foreign> in de Soph. El. 20, 177 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6&mdash;this is not quite so certain: [<foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s gegramme/nois para/shma poiou=ntai</foreign> (signa ponunt ad vocabula distinguenda), <hi rend="italic">Index Aristotelicus</hi>]. Alexander Aphrodisiensis in his commentary on the former passage adds <foreign lang="greek">paragra/fein</foreign>, apparently as a synonym, or interpretation of the other. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And after this has been made clear, let us pass on to the determination of solutions and objections, whence they must be brought, from what sources derived, for the refutation of enthymemes&rsquo;.

					<p>In an excellent <hi rend="italic">Review of the study of ancient Rhetoric</hi> [by Spengel], read at the celebration of the eighty-third anniversary of the foundation <pb n="237"/> of the Munich Academy of Sciences, 1842, a clear account is given of the relation of these <foreign lang="greek">to/poi e)nqumhma/twn</foreign> that follow to the <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> of the first book, of which I will give a translation with very slight alterations. </p>
					<p>To the first of these he gives the name of &lsquo;formal&rsquo;, to the second of &lsquo;material&rsquo; proofs. &ldquo;Formal proofs, such as they appear in Dialectics and Rhetoric, are of an universal nature, and therefore applicable alike to all branches of science; they form the collective Topics, which Aristotle has elaborated for Dialectics with wonderful completeness in the most comprehensive of all the works of his Organon; whilst in Rhetoric, not without reference to the other, he has selected and put forward only what is most essential. Material proofs are with him such as are derived from the principles of the special sciences, the knowledge of which the orator must bring with him, ready for any occasion on which it may be properly applied. Aristotle is by no means of opinion that a mere superficial description, without thorough knowledge of the object to be described, and alien to the true spirit of it, can be called &lsquo;rhetorical&rsquo; with propriety; on the contrary, the orator must be thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of his subject, whatever department of knowledge it may happen to belong to, and from this special science bring with him his concrete proofs, for the purpose of convincing. Accordingly, for forensic pleading the accurate study of law is indispensable, for the deliberative speaking or counselling that of Politics, the science of government, and similarly for each kind the special knowledge which belongs to it. But this special knowledge cannot be obtained from Rhetoric itself, otherwise it would carry in itself all knowledge, which is not the case: the office of Rhetoric is, to work up the proofs which the special science offers, to combine them with the &lsquo;formal&rsquo;, and so to bring the subject within the reach of universal comprehension.&rdquo; </p>
					<p>On the contents of this chapter, and its connexion with the Topics, Brandis, ap. Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> [IV i.] p. 18, has the following remarks. &ldquo;We now turn (c. 23) to the universal points of view (topics) most worthy of attention for the formation or refutation of enthymemes, which are briefly discussed. Before passing to this, Aristotle has already pointed out the connexion which exists between this division of the Rhetoric and the Topics (c. 22 &sect; 10). It is perfectly conceivable however that here also (as before, referring to Rhet. I 7,) what in the Topics has met with a detailed discussion in regard of the various modes of applying them, is here only briefly referred to, and with an exclusive view to the application to be made of them in speaking.&rdquo; He then illustrates this at some length from the two works; but it will be more convenient to leave these details till we come to them in the course of the notes on the topics themselves. [On the Topics, see in general Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, ch. IX.] </p>
					<p>Cicero, Topica, first gives a summary classification of the various forms of these arguments under their most general heads, III 11. These are, <hi rend="italic">coniugata, ex genere, ex forma, ex similitudine, ex differentia, ex contrario, ex adiunctis, ex antecedentibus, ex consequentibus, ex repugnantibus, ex caussis, ex effectis, ex comparatione maiorum aut parium aut minorum</hi>, (the last, <hi rend="italic">comp. maiorum et minorum</hi>, are the topics of Rhet. I 7,) which are afterwards described in greater detail and illustrated, cc. IX 38,&mdash;XVIII 71, <hi rend="italic">Haec ego argumenta, quae transferri in multas causas</hi> <pb n="238"/> <hi rend="italic">possunt, locos communes nominamus</hi>, de Inv. II 15. 48. Quintilian treats them, Inst. Orat. V 10, 20&mdash;94, and sums them up thus, &sect; 94; <hi rend="italic">Ergo ut breviter contraham summam, ducuntur argumenta a</hi> personis, causis, locis, tempore (<hi rend="italic">cuius tres partes diximus</hi>, praecedens, coniunctum, insequens), facultatibus (<hi rend="italic">quibus</hi> instrumentum <hi rend="italic">subiecimus</hi>), modo (<hi rend="italic">id est ut quidque sit factum</hi>), finitione, genere, specie, differentibus, propriis, remotione, divisione, initio, incrementis, summa, similibus, dissimilibus, pugnantibus, consequentibus, efficientibus, effectis, eventis, iugatis, comparatione, <hi rend="italic">quae in plures diducitur species. Iugata</hi> are Cicero's <hi rend="italic">coniugata</hi>, Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">su/stoixa</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(/moiai ptw/seis</foreign>. </p>
					<p>These arguments can <hi rend="italic">all</hi>(<hi rend="italic">?</hi>) be turned both ways, and applied to prove either the affirmative <foreign lang="greek">deiktika/, kataskeuastika/</foreign>, constructive, confirmatory; or the negative, <foreign lang="greek">e)legktika/</foreign>, (23. 30); <foreign lang="greek">a)naskeua/zein, a)nairei=n</foreign>; destructive of the proposition maintained by the theorist (in philosophy), the opponent (in dialectics). Rhetoric <foreign lang="greek">ta)nanti/a sullogi/zetai</foreign> [I 1. 12]. Of the first, <foreign lang="greek">e)k tw=n e)nanti/wn</foreign>, this is expressly stated. </p>
					<div3 id="b2c23s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>One class of demonstrative (or affirmative) enthymemes is derived from <hi rend="italic">opposites:</hi> we have to consider, namely, whether the opposite (to the one) belongs to (i. e. can be said, or predicated of) the opposite (to the other). Two pairs of opposites are supposed, as in the example, temperance and licentiousness, good, i. e. profitable, and injurious: the question is whether the two opposed terms or things stand in the same relation to one another, i. e. that one can be predicated of the other, as the two first, to which they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> opposed: if they can, the original proposition may be maintained, or inferred by the enthymeme; if not, it can be confuted or destroyed. The inference in either case is drawn <foreign lang="greek">e)k tw=n e)nanti/wn</foreign>, from the correctness or incorrectness, the truth or falsehood, of the assertion of compatibility or coexistence in the opposites, or that one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be predicated of the other. Thus in the example, if the opposites to the original proposition&mdash;temperance is profitable&mdash; stand in the same relation to one another as the two members of the first, so that the one can be truly predicated of the other&mdash;if the opposite, injurious, is truly predicable of licentiousness&mdash;then, so far, we infer the truth of the first: if not, the proposition may be confuted. The inference, like all other rhetorical inferences, is <hi rend="italic">probable</hi>, not necessary: it can always be contradicted. </p>
						<p>Aristotle, as we have already seen (note on c. 19. 1), distinguishes four kinds of <foreign lang="greek">a)ntikei/mena</foreign>, or opposites; contradictory, contrary (extremes under the same genus, as here <foreign lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)kolasi/a</foreign> are the two extremes, virtue and vice, under the genus <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, moral character), relative, and <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ste/rhsis</foreign>, state and privation. In the Topics all the four kinds in their relation to this form of argument are successively handled; in the Rhetoric, the treatment is confined to the single kind of contraries, as the most useful and plausible, and the rest passed over. See Brandis, u. s., p. 18. The passage in the Topics corresponding to this is B 8, 113 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27, seq. [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I, chap. IX pp. 422, 3]; but compare also B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 17; on the import and limitations of <foreign lang="greek">e)nanti/on</foreign> Ib. c. 7; <foreign lang="greek">*g</foreign> 6, init. on the great advantages and wide extent of these two first topics, viz. this, and the next, <pb n="239"/> <foreign lang="greek">tw=n sustoi/xwn kai\ tw=n ptw/sewn. o(moi/ws ga\r e)/ndocon to\ a)ciw=sai, ei) pa=sa h(donh\ a)gaqo/n, kai\ lu/phn pa=san ei)=nai kako/n k.t.l.</foreign> followed by a series of illustrations: also B 9, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 6. The treatment of opposites in the Topics and Rhetoric corresponds in this, that in both works it has reference solely to the art of reasoning, to the inferences affirmative or negative that may be drawn by constructive, or refutative, syllogisms and enthymemes. </p>
						<p>Cicero (who borrows a good deal from Aristotle), Topic. XI. 47, <hi rend="italic">Deinceps locus est, qui a contrario dicitur. Contrariorum autem genera sunt plura: unum eorum quae in eodem genere plurimum differunt</hi> (Arist.), <hi rend="italic">ut sapientia et stultitia....Haec quae ex eodem genere contraria sunt appellantur adversa.</hi> His instance is, <hi rend="italic">si stultitiam fugimus, sapientiam sequamur</hi> (this in the Aristotelian form would be, If folly is to be shunned, wisdom is to be sought or pursued). He then goes through the three remaining kinds of <hi rend="italic">contraria</hi>, following Aristotle. </p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Ex contrariis, Frugalitas bonum, luxuria</hi> enim <hi rend="italic">malum</hi> (enthym.). <hi rend="italic">Si malorum causa bellum est, erit emendatio pax: si veniam meretur qui imprudens nocuit, non meretur praemium qui imprudens profuit.</hi> Quint. V 10. 73. In the last example, the opposites are, excuse, indulgence (for a fault), and reward (for a service), injury and benefit: the merit or <hi rend="italic">desert</hi> is common to both: only in the one case it takes the form of demerit, which <hi rend="italic">deserves</hi> punishment: as is also the absence of purpose, of good or ill intention. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nairei=n</lemma>, &lsquo;to take up&rsquo;, passes on to the sense of removing, taking away; thence to <hi rend="italic">taking off</hi>, destroying; and so finally, when it comes to logic, is applied to the argument which upsets, subverts, destroys, or refutes the adversary's argument or position. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or (a second example) as it is in the Messeniac speech (of Alcidamas, on which see note on I 13. 2), &ldquo;for if it is the war which is the cause of the present evils, it is by <hi rend="italic">the</hi> peace (which I now propose) that they must be rectified.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">sumbouleu/ei o( *)alkida/mas toi=s *lakedaimoni/ois mh\ katadoulw=sai tou\s e)n *messh/nh|, e)pixeirw=n e)k tou= e)nanti/ou. *ei) ga\r o(</foreign> <pb n="240"/> <foreign lang="greek">po/lemos, fhsi/, prouce/nhse ta/de ta\ kaka/, ei)rh/nh pa/lin tau=ta e)panorqw/setai</foreign> (Scholiast). &lsquo;Verba ipsa Alcidamantis scholiastes videtur conservasse.&rdquo; Sauppe ad Alcid. Fragm. Messen. 2. <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici</hi>, III 154. Quintilian has borrowed this, see above [middle of p. 239]. </p>
						<p>&ldquo;The four lines which follow as a third example are of uncertain authorship: Gaisford attributes them either to Agathon or Theodectes: the enthymeme <hi rend="italic">ex contrario</hi> that it contains would suit either of them, since they both cultivated Rhetoric as well as the dramatic art (Wagner <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr. Fragm.</hi> III 185). To avoid the conjunction of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, Elmsley, ad Med. 87, proposes <foreign lang="greek">e)pei/</foreign>. Reisig, <hi rend="italic">Coniect.</hi> I p. 113 (ap. Pflugk), justly replies that <foreign lang="greek">ei)/per</foreign> is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">e)pei/</foreign>, and therefore admits the same construction. On <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> and the optative, see Appendix (on II 20 &sect; 5) at the end of this book; and on <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> followed by <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, see Appendix C, Vol. I p. 301. For <foreign lang="greek">ou)d a)/n</foreign>, Wagner proposes either <foreign lang="greek">h)/n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a(/n</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Cicero, de Inv. I XXX 46, has adopted this: <hi rend="italic">In contrariis hoc modo; nam si iis qui imprudentes laeserunt ignosci convenit, iis qui necessario profuerunt haberi gratiam non oportet</hi>, and Quintilian, V 10. 73, (above). </p>
						<p>The second quotation (example 4), is from Euripides' Thyestes, Fragm. VII (Wagner). This we learn from the Scholiast, quoted in Wagner's note. Matthiae refers to the similar paradox in Agathon's couplet, Rhet. II 24. 10. </p>

We may therefore argue, says the example, &lsquo;that justice is not all good&rsquo;, taking the negative side, <foreign lang="greek">mh\ u(pa/rxein</foreign>, good is not universally predicable of justice; otherwise good would be predicable of the <foreign lang="greek">ptw=sis, dikai/ws</foreign>, which is not true in all cases; &lsquo;for all good is <foreign lang="greek">ai(reto/n</foreign>, an object of choice; but a just punishment, or to be <hi rend="italic">justly</hi> punished, everybody would allow not to be desirable&rsquo;. This is an application of the topic to its negative, destructive, or refutative use: the inference is that the rule laid down is not true. Compare with this example, I 9. 15, where the same distinction is made: although <foreign lang="greek">ta\ di/kaia</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">dikai/ws e)/rga</foreign> are similarly predicable, yet this is not the case with the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">e)n mo/nh| ga\r</foreign> (this is therefore an exceptional case to which the ordinary rule of <foreign lang="greek">o(/moiai ptw/seis</foreign> does not apply) <foreign lang="greek">tau/th| tw=n a)retw=n ou)k a)ei\ to\ dikai/ws kalo/n, a)ll'  e)pi\ tou= zhmiou=sqai ai)sxro\n to\ dikai/ws ma=llon h)\ to\ a)di/kws</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Brandis u. s. notes on this topic another difference which shews itself between the Topics and the Rhetoric, that whereas in the former the <foreign lang="greek">su/stoixa</foreign> are usually (not always) added to the <foreign lang="greek">ptw/seis</foreign> in the treatment of it, they are here omitted, and the grammatical form of co-ordinates alone taken into account. <pb n="241"/> </p>
						<p>The use of the topic as a dialectical argument is abundantly illustrated in the Topics, in very many places, as may be seen by consulting Waitz's Index ad Organon, s. v. The principal passage on the subject is Top. B 9,&mdash;where the <foreign lang="greek">ptw/seis</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">grammatical</hi> co-ordinates, are properly subordinated to the more extensive <foreign lang="greek">su/stoixa</foreign>, things which are <hi rend="italic">logically</hi> co-ordinate, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34. The latter are exemplified by <foreign lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh, di/kaios, di/kaion, dikai/ws</foreign>. Compare A 15, 106 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 29, on the application of them to ambiguous terms, <foreign lang="greek">pleonaxw=s lego/mena</foreign>, also <foreign lang="greek">*g</foreign> 3, 118 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 34, <foreign lang="greek">*d</foreign> 3, 124 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 10, and the rest, which indicate their various applications<note anchored="yes">If I am not mistaken <foreign lang="greek">o(/moiai ptw/seis</foreign> is a misnomer. If <foreign lang="greek">ptw/seis</foreign> are the various inflexions&mdash;declensions in an extended sense&mdash;of a root-word, the term must be confined to the changes of the <hi rend="italic">terminations:</hi> in these appears, not <hi rend="italic">similarity</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">difference:</hi> the similarity lies, not in the terminations, but in the idea or root common to all the varieties: &lsquo;similar&rsquo; therefore, though it may very well be predicated of the <foreign lang="greek">su/stoixa</foreign>, is not properly applied to <foreign lang="greek">ptw/seis</foreign>.</note>. </p>
						<p>Cicero, Top. IV 12, comp. IX 38, illustrates <hi rend="italic">coniugata</hi>, which is his name for Ar.'s <foreign lang="greek">ptw/seis</foreign>, by <hi rend="italic">sapiens, sapienter, sapientia;</hi> and the argument from it by, <hi rend="italic">Si compascuus ager est, ius est compascere. Haec verborum coniugatio</hi>, he says, <foreign lang="greek">suzugi/a</foreign> <hi rend="italic">dicitur:</hi> on which Spengel (<hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm. in Ar.

						<p>This topic has occurred before, II 19. 12, as one of the topics of &lsquo;the possible&rsquo;: where the parallel passages of Cic. Topic. XI 49, and de Inv. I 30. 47, will be found in the note. On the same, Quintilian, Inst. Or. V 10. 78, <hi rend="italic">Illa quoque quae</hi> ex rebus mutuam confirmationem praestantibus <hi rend="italic">ducuntur</hi> (<hi rend="italic">quae proprii generis videri quidam volunt, et vocant</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e)k tw=n pro\s a)/llhla</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> ex rebus sub eandem rationem venientibus) <hi rend="italic">fortiter consequentibus iunxerim</hi> (I should be bold to add to <hi rend="italic">consequents</hi>): <hi rend="italic">si portorium Rhodiis</hi> locare <hi rend="italic">honestum est et Hermocreonti</hi> conducere<hi rend="italic">; et quod</hi> discere <hi rend="italic">honestum, et</hi> docere (from de Inventione, u. s.). The argument is, &lsquo;If it may be said of one (of the two terms of the relation) that he has <hi rend="italic">done</hi> rightly or justly, then the same terms may be applied to what the other has <hi rend="italic">suffered</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">poiei=n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/sxein</foreign>, agent and patient, are relative opposites<note anchored="yes">The relation of <foreign lang="greek">poiei=n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pa/sxein</foreign>, agent and patient, action and passion, is well illustrated in the argument between Polus and Socrates, Plat. Gorg. c. 32, 476 B, seq. It is there shewn by analogy&mdash;the usual Socratic and Platonic method&mdash;that the relation between the two prevails throughout its various applications, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> that crime and punishment follow the same law, and that justice or desert in the punishment of the criminal or patient implies the like justice in the infliction of it by the agent, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></note>); and similarly (<foreign lang="greek">keleu/ein</foreign> is relative to <foreign lang="greek">pei/qesqai</foreign>) command implies obedience, and the converse (this may be <hi rend="italic">inferred</hi> as the ordinary, probable, not a necessary consequence): as Diomedon the taxcollector argued about the taxes (i. e. the <hi rend="italic">farming</hi> of them) &ldquo;If it is no disgrace to you to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi>, neither is it to us to <hi rend="italic">buy.</hi>&rdquo; </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi(=on w(s</lemma>] This pleonasm occurs again in &sect; 6, <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on w(s *)ifikra/ths</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Of Diomedon, nothing is known but what we learn from the passage. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And if the terms fairly or justly can be applied to the sufferer, then also to the doer (or perpetrator) of the act; and conversely, if to the doer then also to the sufferer&rsquo;. If there be any difference between this and the preceding, <foreign lang="greek">ei) ga\r qate/rw|&mdash;peponqe/nai</foreign>, it is that the first is the general expression of the relation between agent and patient, the second is a particular exemplification of it, in the justification of what would otherwise be a crime. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But this admits of a fallacy: for though it may be true (in general, or in itself) that deserved suffering involves the justice of the punish<pb n="243"/> ment, yet perhaps (it does not always follow that) <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should be the agent of it, that the punishment should be inflicted by <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (any particular individual)&rsquo;. This fallacy is actually illustrated from Theodectes' Orestes, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 24 &sect; 3. The argument is used by Orestes in his trial for the murder of his mother Clytemnestra. In the trial scene of the Eumenides this point is taken into consideration, and the act of Orestes justified by Apollo and Athena on the general ground of the superiority of male to female; the father, the author of his existence, has a higher claim upon the son's affection and duty than the mother, and Orestes was right in avenging his father's death even upon her. Aesch. Eumen. 625 seq., 657 seq., 738&mdash;40. Comp. Eur. Orest. 528, where Tyndareus, Clytemnestra's father, says, <foreign lang="greek">qugath\r d'  e)mh\ qanou=s) e)/pracen e)/ndika: a)ll) ou)xi\ pro\s tou=d) ei)ko\s h)=n au)th\n qanei=n</foreign>: and Orestes, <hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> 546, defends himself on the same grounds as in Aeschylus, <foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ d'  a)no/sio/s ei)mi mhte/ra ktanw/n, o(/sios de/ g) e(/teron o)/noma, timwrw=n patri/. 552, path\r me\n e)fu/teusen me k.t.l. 562, e)pi\ d) e)/qusa mhte/ra, a)no/sia me\n drw=n a)lla\ timwrw=n patri/</foreign>. Electr. 1244, (quoted by Victorius on <foreign lang="greek">fhsi\ d'  a)pokrino/menos&mdash;ktanei=n</foreign>,) the Dioscuri to Orestes, <foreign lang="greek">di/kaia me/n nun h(/d'  e)/xei: su\ d) ou)xi\ dra=|s</foreign>. The case of Orestes and Clytemnestra became one of the stock examples in the rhetorical books. Auct. ad Heren. I 10. 17, I 15. 25, 16. 26. Cic. de Inv. I 13. 18, 22. 31. Quint. Inst. Or. III 11. 4, and 11 seq., VII 4. 8. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And therefore a separate investigation is required, not only whether the sufferer deserved to suffer, but also whether the doer had a right to do it (as, to inflict the punishment), and then make the appropriate use of either: because sometimes there is a difference in cases of this kind (i. e. both kinds of right are not always found together: the punishment may be just, but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may not be the proper person to inflict it), and there is nothing to prevent (the case being) as it is put in Theodectes&rsquo; Alcmaeon (where this &lsquo;division&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">dialabo/nta</foreign>, is actually made): &ldquo;And did no mortal abhor thy mother?&rdquo; This is a question put to Alcmaeon, probably by Alphesiboea (Victorius), whose reply includes the words actually quoted, <foreign lang="greek">a)lla\ dialabo/nta xrh\ skopei=n</foreign>, with, of course, a good deal more about the murder which is omitted. &lsquo;To which (Alcmaeon) says in reply &ldquo;nay but we must first distinguish, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> consider the case.&rdquo;&rsquo; (The <hi rend="italic">division</hi> or <hi rend="italic">distinction</hi> here spoken of is well illustrated by the parallel passage, the case of Orestes, II 24. 3.) &lsquo;And when Alphesiboea asks &ldquo;How?&rdquo;, he replies, &ldquo;To her they adjudged death, (i. e. decided that she was justly slain,) but (decided also) that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should not have been the murderer.&rdquo;&rsquo; From this reply it may be gathered that the judges in Theodoctes' play had made the requisite distinction: the death of Eriphyle they agreed was deserved, but it was not for her son to inflict the penalty. &ldquo;Alcmaeon Eriphylen matrem suam interfecerat, quod haec Amphiarai mariti salutem prodiderat&rdquo; (Alcmaeon's act, like that of <pb n="244"/> Orestes, was justified by the implied murder of his father&mdash;the treachery which caused his death). &ldquo;Alphesiboea fuit Alcmaeonis uxor.&rdquo; Schrader. This fragment is quoted by Wagner, Theodect. Fragm. Alcm. I, but without a word of commentary, III 118. </p>
						<p>On Theodectes of Phaselis, the rhetorician and dramatic poet, the friend of Aristotle, who frequently refers to his compositions in both kinds, and on the rhetorical character of his writings, which is well illustrated here and in II 24. 3, see M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> ch. XXVI &sect; 7, who refers to these passages. Also, <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX Vol. III p. 260 seq.<note anchored="yes">The unwarrantable identification, there supposed, p. 261, of the Theodectea with the <foreign lang="greek">*(rhtorikh\ pro\s *)ale/candron</foreign>, has been sufficiently corrected in Introd. to Rhet. pp. 55&mdash;67, on the Theodectea; where more information will be found about the author and his works.</note> To the passages there quoted on this author, add Theopomp. Hist. Phil. Lib. I, Fr. 26, ap. Fragm. Hist. Gr. (Didot) p. 282; and a ref. to his Philoctetes, Eth. Nic. VII 8, 1150 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9. </p>
						<p>Two other examples follow, but, as Spengel (<hi rend="italic">Tract on the Rhet.</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi>, Munich 1851, p. 46) justly says, they have no connexion with the preceding example from Theodectes, and the division which it exemplifies, but are illustrations of the general topic. Retaining the text (with Bekker) as it stands, we must accordingly understand the words <foreign lang="greek">e)/sti d'  e)n tou/tw|&mdash;mh\ ktanei=n</foreign> as parenthetical, and suppose that the author, after the insertion of this as a <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, proceeds with his exemplification of the general topic. Spengel, u. s., p. 47, suggests that they may have been a later addition by the author himself, a note written on the margin, which has got out of its place. My supposition, of a note, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written on the margin, but embodied in the text as a parenthesis&mdash;which is quite in Ar.'s manner&mdash;will answer the purpose equally well, and save the text in addition. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, another example, the trial of Demosthenes and those who slew Nicanor; for as they were adjudged to have slain him justly (the act), it was held that his death (the passion or suffering) was just&rsquo;. This is cited by Dion. Halicarn., Ep. I ad Amm. c. 12, as a proof that Aristotle was acquainted with and quoted the speeches of Demosthenes, referring it to the case (against Aeschines) for the Crown. In doing so he omits <foreign lang="greek">peri/</foreign>. Of course <foreign lang="greek">h( peri\ *dhmosqe/nous di/kh</foreign> cannot have this meaning: and it is most probable that it is not the Orator that is here referred to, but Thucydides' general, or some other person of the name. <pb n="245"/> Neither is anything known of Nicanor and his murderers. On the use of Demosthenes' name in the Rhetoric, see Introd. p. 46, note 2. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, the case of him that died at Thebes; concerning whom he (the spokesman of the defendants) bade them (the judges) decide whether he (the murdered man) deserved death, since there was no injustice in putting to death one that deserved it&rsquo;. &ldquo;In hanc quoque historiam nunquam incidi.&rdquo; Victorius. Buhle rightly refers it to the case of Euphron, introduced as an episode, and described at length by Xenophon, Hellen. VII 3. There had been one of the usual quarrels between the aristocratical (<foreign lang="greek">oi( be/ltistoi</foreign>) and the popular party at Sicyon, of which Euphron took advantage, with the design of making himself master of the city. But knowing that as long as the Thebans occupied the acropolis he had no chance of success, he collected a large sum of money and went to Thebes with the intention of bribing the Thebans to assist him. Some Sicyonian exiles learning this, followed him to Thebes and murdered him in the acropolis. Here the murderers were brought to trial before the magistrates and council, who were already there assembled. The accusation of the magistrates, and the speech for the defence, are both recorded. All the accused with one exception asserted their innocence: one alone admitted the fact, and in justification of it pleaded for himself and the rest the guilt of the man that had been slain, just as Aristotle here describes it. <foreign lang="greek">*oi( me\n ou)=n *qhbai=oi tau=ta a)kou/santes e)/gnwsan di/kaia to\n *eu)/frona peponqe/nai</foreign>. But the Sicyonians (<foreign lang="greek">oi( poli=tai</foreign>), interpreting the word &lsquo;good&rsquo; in the sense of good to them (<foreign lang="greek">tou\s eu)erge/tas e(autw=n</foreign>), said he was a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> man, and buried him in the market-place, and adore him as the (second) founder of their city (<foreign lang="greek">w(s a)rxhge/thn</foreign>), like Brasidas at Amphipolis (Thuc. V. 11). </p>
						<p>The whole of this section, with the exception of the last example, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ peri\ tou= *qh/bhsin a)poqano/ntos</foreign>, is quoted by Dionysius l. c. in support of his view that Demosthenes' speeches had been delivered before the composition of the Rhetoric, and were accessible to its author. The difference between the text which he seems to have used and that now received is very great, and apparently unaccountable. Besides minor discrepancies, the entire quotation from Theodectes, <foreign lang="greek">e)nio/te ga\r&mdash;ktanei=n</foreign> is omitted; and the clauses preceding and following stand thus, <foreign lang="greek">e)/sti de\ tou=to paralogi/sasqai. ou) ga\r ei) dikai/ws e)/paqen a)/|n, kai\ dikai/ws u(po\ tou/tou pe/ponqen, w(s o( fo/nou a)/cia poih/sas path/r, ei) u(po\ tou= ui(ou= tou= e(autou= th\n e)pi\ qana/tw| a)pa/getai, dei= skopei=n xwri\s......o(pote/rws a)\n a(rmo/tth|. e)nio/te ga\r diafwnei= to\ toiou=ton. w(/sper e)n tw=| *)alkmai/wni tou= *qeode/ktou, kai\ oi(=on h( peri\ *dhmosqe/nous di/kh k.t.l.</foreign> All the alterations seem to be for the worse, and in one of them, <foreign lang="greek">e)/paqen a)/n</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e)/paqe/n ti</foreign>, the grammatical blunder betrays corruption. The additional example of the father and son introduced by Dionysius is, as Spengel observes, not here in point. The very example for the sake of which the extract was made is mutilated, and the explanation, <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\ ga\r&mdash; apoqanei=n</foreign>, omitted: from which Spengel very justly argues that it could <pb n="246"/> not have been in the MS that he used: if he had read it there, he could not have so absurdly misapplied the example to the case for the Crown<hi rend="italic">:</hi> Spengel has reviewed the two passages in connexion in the tract above cited, pp. 44&mdash;47. Our text, which is, when properly explained, perfectly consistent and intelligible, is retained by Bekker and seems to require no alteration: at all events none of Dionysius' variations could be advantageously introduced. </p>

Top. Ib. 115 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 15. Of the first there are four varieties: according as (1) the more or less is predicated of the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> object&mdash;if pleasure is good, then the greater the pleasure the greater the good; and if wrong-doing is bad, the greater the wrong the worse; the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> is to be ascertained by induction&mdash;or (2) when one of two things is predicated (in the way of comparison), if that of which it is more likely to be predicated is without it (any property or quality), the same may be inferred of the less likely; or conversely, if the less likely has it, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> the more likely: or (3) (the reverse of the preceding) when two things are predicated of one, if the more likely is not there, we may infer that the less likely will not, or if the less likely be found there, that the more likely will also: (4) when two things are predicated of two others, if that which is more likely is wanting to the one, the less likely will surely be wanting to the other; or, conversely, if that which is less likely to be present to the one is there, the other will be sure to have that which is more likely [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I. p. 425]. These nice distinctions, though appropriate to Dialectics, are unnecessary in Rhetoric, and are therefore here omitted; but the examples will suggest the proper use of the topic. The inference in all these cases is plain and will be acknowledged by the audience, and that is all that is required. </p>
						<p>The inference from greater to less, or from more to less likely or probable, is commonly called the <hi rend="italic">argumentum a fortiori;</hi> the rule <hi rend="italic">omne maius continet in se minus</hi> may also be referred to the same principle, though the two are not absolutely coextensive. </p>
						<p>Cic.Topic. III 11, <hi rend="italic">Alia</hi> (ducuntur argumenta) <hi rend="italic">ex comparatione maiorum aut parium aut minorum.</hi> This is well exemplified in IV 23. XVIII 68, <hi rend="italic">Reliquus est comparationis locus cuius...nunc explicanda tractatio est. Comparantur igitur ea quae aut maiora aut minora aut paria dicuntur: in quibus spectantur haec, numerus, species, vis, quaedam etiam ad res aliquas affectio.</hi> These four modes of application are clearly explained and illustrated in the following sections, 69&mdash;71. </p>
						<p>De Orat. II 40. 172, <hi rend="italic">Maiora autem et minora et paria comparabimus sic: ex maiore; si bona existimatio divitiis praestat et pecunia tanto opere expetitur, quanto gloria magis est expetenda: ex minore; Hic</hi> <pb n="247"/> <hi rend="italic">parvae consuetudinis causa huius mortem fert tam familiariter; Quid si ipse amasset? quid hic mihi faciet patri?</hi> (Terent.

						<p>&lsquo;Another from the more or less, as for instance, &ldquo;if not even the gods are omniscient, surely men can hardly be supposed to be so:&rdquo; for that is as much as to say, if that to which something is more likely to belong wants it, plainly that which is less likely must want it too. Again (the argument) that a man who was capable of striking his father would also strike his neighbours, follows (is derived from) the (general rule or principle), that the less involves or implies the (possible existence, or capacity, <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, of the) greater; in whichever way we are required to argue (the inference is required to be drawn), whether the affirmative or the negative&rsquo;. This last example, as an exemplification of the inference from less to greater, has been looked upon as an error, and various corrections have been proposed, as by Vater, and Spengel in <hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm. ad Ar. Rhet.</hi> II c. 23, p. 12, 1844. The latter has subsequently altered his opinion, and in 1851 (<hi rend="italic">Trans. of Bav.

No doubt, according to the ordinary interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">ma=llon</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">h(=tton</foreign> in one of these comparisons, where the greater and less are referred to the <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> and <hi rend="italic">importance</hi> of the crime, the argument is <foreign lang="greek">e)k tou= ma=llon</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ex maiore ad minus:</hi> the man who would strike his father (the greater) would <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> strike an ordinary acquaintance. But Ar. has here departed from this usual application of the topic, and makes the comparison in respect of the <hi rend="italic">frequency</hi> of the crime: as it is less usual to strike one's father than one's neighbour, a man that could be guilty of the former, is much <hi rend="italic">more likely</hi> to commit the latter and lesser offence: and the inference is from the less to the greater <hi rend="italic">in this sense.</hi> &ldquo;Aristoteles, cum boni viri officium sit nemini vim afferre, cumque iniuria ab omni abesse debeat, si tamen ibi manet ubi minus esse debebat, illic etiam existet ubi frequentius esse consuevit: et haec causa est cur <foreign lang="greek">ei) to\ h(=tton u(pa/rxei</foreign> appellarit, <hi rend="italic">a minore</hi> que eam significari voluerit.&rdquo; Victorius. </p>

						<p>The second branch of these inferences from comparison, is that of parallel cases. This is the argument from analogy, the foundation of induction, the observation of resemblances in things diverse, leading to the establishment of a general rule: the Socratic and Platonic Method: comp. c. 20. 4, note. <hi rend="italic">Ex pari</hi>, Cic. de Inv. I 30. 47, <hi rend="italic">ut locus in mari sine portu navibus esse non potest tutus, sic animus sine fide stabilis amicis non potest esse.</hi> On the argument from analogy in general, see note on c. 19. 2. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Again if the comparison is not of greater and less, (but of things equal or parallel): whence the saying, &ldquo;Thy father too is to be pitied for the loss of his children. And is not Oeneus then, for the loss of his illustrious offspring?&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">a)/ra</foreign> marks the inference. &ldquo;Par infortunium parem misericordiam meretur.&rdquo; Schrader. The verses are supposed (by Victorius, Welcker, <hi rend="italic">Trag. Gr.</hi> p. 1012, and Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Trag. Gr.</hi> III 185) to be taken from Antiphon's Meleager, which is quoted again &sect; 20, and at II 2. 19. (Antiphon, a Tragic Poet contemporary with the Elder Dionysius, Rhet. II 6. 19, Clinton <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> Vol. II. Praef. XXXIII, flourished at the end of the fifth cent. B. C. Compare note on II 2. 19.) </p>
						<p>The first of the two verses&mdash;if the story is that of Meleager&mdash;refers to the death of the two sons of Thestius, Toxeus and Plexippus, by the hand of their nephew Meleager: Oeneus was the father of Meleager, whom he too had now lost. The words are those of some one who is consoling Althea, Oeneus' wife, and perhaps belong (says Victorius) to Oeneus himself. The meaning then would be, (Oeneus to his wife,) You speak of the losses of your father whose sons are slain&mdash;are not mine as great as his, in the loss of my famous son Meleager? and do we not <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> equally deserve pity? The story is told in Diod. Sic. IV 34 (Schrader), and Ov. Met. VIII. See 86, 87, <hi rend="italic">An felix Oeneus nato victore fruetur, Thestius orbus erit? melius lugebitis ambo.</hi> </p>
						<p>The conduct of Alexander or Paris in the abduction of Helen is next justified by the <hi rend="italic">parallel case</hi> of Theseus, who did the same; Isocr. <pb n="249"/> Helen. &sect;&sect; 18&mdash;20; and every one&mdash;and more especially an <hi rend="italic">Athenian</hi> audience&mdash;must allow that he was a good man and could do no wrong (<foreign lang="greek">ou)k h)di/khsen</foreign>); and of the Tyndaridae, Castor and Pollux, who carried off the two daughters of Leucippus, Phoebe and Eleaera (or Hilaira, Propert. I 2. 15), Ov. Fast. V 699, Theocr. Id. XXII 137, and these were demigods; and if Hector is not blamed for the death of Patroclus, neither should Paris be censured for that of Achilles. This is from some <foreign lang="greek">e)gkw/mion</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)pologi/a *)aleca/ndrou</foreign>, of an unknown rhetorician, similar to Isocrates' Helen. It is referred to again, &sect; 8, and 24 &sect;&sect; 7, 9. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And if no other artists (professors of any art or science) are mean or contemptible, neither are philosophers: and if generals are not to be held cheap because they are often defeated, neither are the sophists (when their sophistical dialectics are at fault)&rsquo;. From some speech in defence of philosophy, and of the Sophists. </p>
						<p>The following is an argument, urged by an Athenian orator upon the general assembly, from the analogy of the relation of a private citizen to the state of which he is a member, to that of the same state as an individual member of the great community of the entire Greek race to the whole of which it is a part: if it be the duty of an individual Athenian to pay attention to, to <hi rend="italic">study</hi>, the glory of his own country, then it is the duty of you, the collective Athenians whose representatives I am now addressing, to study in like manner the glory of the entire Greek community. Or it might be used by the <hi rend="italic">epideictic</hi> orator in a Panegyric (<foreign lang="greek">panhguriko/s lo/gos</foreign>, delivered in a <foreign lang="greek">panh/guris</foreign>), pleading, like Isocrates, for the united action of the Greeks against the Barbarian. </p>

						<p>Top. V. The consideration of time. This kind of argument, though important in Rhetoric, is inappropriate in Dialectics, and therefore receives only a passing notice in the Topics, B 4, III <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 24, <foreign lang="greek">e)/ti e)pi\ to\n xro/non e)pible/pein, ei)/ pou diafwnei=</foreign>, where the word <foreign lang="greek">e)pible/pein</foreign> shews that it is a mere passing glance, a cursory observation, that it requires: and in Cicero's Topics it is altogether omitted [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I p. 418]. The application of it in Top. B 11, 115 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, referred to by Brandis, is different, and indeed unsuited to rhetorical purposes. </p>
						<p>On this topic of time, and its importance in Rhetoric, Quintilian, Inst. Orat. V 10. 42 seq., after a preliminary division of time into (1) general (now, formerly, hereafter,) and (2) special or particular time, proceeds, <hi rend="italic">Quorum utrorumque ratio et in consiliis</hi> (genus deliberativum) <hi rend="italic">quidem, et in illo demonstrativo</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">tw=| e)pideiktikw=| ge/nei</foreign>) <hi rend="italic">genere versatur; sed in iudiciis frequentissima est. Nam et iuris quaestiones facit, et qualitatem distinguit, et ad coniecturam plurimum confert</hi> (contributes very greatly to the establishment of the fact&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">status coniecturalis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> of fact&mdash; <pb n="250"/> and especially to the refutation of the assertion of an alleged fact: this is illustrated by the cases following); <hi rend="italic">ut quum interim probationes inexpugnabiles afferat, quales sunt, si dicatur</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ut supra posui</hi>) <hi rend="italic">signator, qui ante diem tabularum decessit: aut commisisse aliquid, vel quum infans esset, vel quum omnino natus non esset.</hi> Further, &sect;&sect; 45&mdash;48, arguments may be readily drawn <hi rend="italic">ex iis quae ante rem facta sunt, aut ex coniunctis rei, aut insequentibus</hi>, or from time past, present (<hi rend="italic">instans</hi>), and future: and these three are then illustrated. Inferences may be drawn from what is past or present, to the future, from cause to effect; and conversely from present to past, from effect to cause. It seems that the two principal modes of applying the topic of time to Rhetoric are (1) that described by Quintilian, in establishing, or, more frequently, refuting the assertion of a fact, which is the chief use that is made of it in the <hi rend="italic">forensic</hi> branch&mdash;this is again referred to, II 24. 11, on which see Introd. p. 274&mdash;the consideration of probabilities of time in matters of fact: and (2) the <foreign lang="greek">kairo/s</foreign>, the right time, the appropriate occasion, which may be employed by the <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi> orator or politician in estimating the expediency, immediate or prospective, of an act or course of policy; and by the <hi rend="italic">panegyrist</hi> to enhance the value and importance of any action of his hero, or of anything else which may be the object of his encomium. On this use of <foreign lang="greek">kairo/s</foreign> comp. I 7. 32, I 9.38, and the notes. For illustrations, see Top. <foreign lang="greek">*g</foreign> 2, 117 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 26&mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another from the consideration of time, as Iphicrates said in the case (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">di/kh|</foreign>) against Harmodius, &ldquo;Had I before the deed was done laid claim to the statue, provided I did it, you would have granted it me; will you then (the inference) refuse to grant it me now that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done it? Do not, then, first make the promise in anticipation, and then, when you have received the benefit, defraud me of it.&rdquo;&rsquo; The case, or speech, as it is here called &lsquo;against Harmodius&rsquo;, is also known by the name of <foreign lang="greek">h( peri\ th=s ei)ko/nos</foreign>: this was the statue which was granted him in commemoration of the famous defeat of the Lacedaemonian <foreign lang="greek">mo/ra</foreign> in B. C. 392. Aesch. c. Ctesiph. &sect; 243, Ask the judges why they made the presents, and set up the statues, to Chabrias, Iphicrates, and Timotheus. The answer is, <foreign lang="greek">*)ifikra/tei o(/ti mo/ran *lakedaimoni/wn a)pe/kteinen</foreign>. [Dem. <hi rend="italic">Lept.</hi> 482 &sect; 84, <foreign lang="greek">timw=nte/s pote *)ifikra/thn ou) mo/non au)to\n e)timh/sate</foreign>...<hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> &sect; 86, <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\ ga\r u(mi=n a(rmo/ttei dokei=n para\ me\n ta\s eu)ergesi/as ou(/tw proxei/rws e)/xein, w(/ste mh\ mo/non au)tou\s tou\s eu)erge/tas tima=n, a)lla\ kai\ tou\s e)kei/nwn fi/lous, e)peida\n de\ xro/nos die/lqh| braxu/s, kai\ o(/sa au)toi=s de/dwkate tau=t'  a)fairei=sqai</foreign>]. The speech here referred to was attributed by some &mdash;as Pseudo-Plutarch vit. Lys. <foreign lang="greek">sune/graye de\ lo/gon kai\ *)ifikra/tei: to\n me\n pro\s *(armo/dion</foreign>&mdash;to Lysias<note anchored="yes">See on this and two other speeches of Iphicrates attributed to Lysias, Sauppe, ad Fragm. Lys. XVIII and LXV. <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici</hi> III 178 and 190; [also Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, p. 335].</note>, which is denied by Dionysius, de Lysia <pb n="251"/> Iud. c. 12, on two grounds, first the inferiority of the style, which was unworthy of Lysias; and secondly, because Lysias died seven years before the deed for which the statue was granted. Aristotle plainly ascribes it to Iphicrates himself. The speech <foreign lang="greek">peri\ th=s ei)ko/nos</foreign>, is quoted again, &sect; 8. See also Clinton <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici</hi> II 113, <hi rend="italic">sub anno</hi> 371. It was not till after Iphicrates had resigned his military command, and retired into private life, <foreign lang="greek">a)podou\s ta\ strateu/mata i)diw/ths gi/netai</foreign>, that he claimed his statue, <foreign lang="greek">meta\ *)alkisqe/nhn a)/rxonta</foreign>, i. e. in the archonship of Pharsiclides, B. C. 371. The grant was opposed by Harmodius, a political antagonist. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again to induce the Thebans to allow Philip to pass through their territories into Attica, it is argued that, &ldquo;had he made the claim (or preferred the request) before he helped them against the Phocians (when they wanted his aid), they would have promised to do so; and therefore it would be monstrous for them <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to refuse it, because he threw away his chance (<hi rend="italic">then</hi>)&rsquo;;&mdash;behaved liberally or with reckless generosity (so Vict.) on that occasion, and neglected to avail himself of his opportunity, (see the lexicons, s. v. <foreign lang="greek">proi/esqai</foreign>)&mdash;&lsquo;and trusted to their honour and good faith&rsquo;. The former event occurred in B. C. 346, when Philip allied himself with the Thebans and overran Phocis, and so put an end to the Phocian war. An embassy was sent to the Thebans after the capture of Elataea B. C. 339, to request that Philip's troops might be allowed to march through their territory to attack Attica; but was met by a counter-embassy from Athens, proposed and accompanied by Demosthenes, who prevailed upon the Thebans to refuse the request, and conclude an alliance with Athens. <foreign lang="greek">kata\ *lusimaxi/dhn a)/rxonta</foreign>, Dionys, Ep. 1 ad Amm. c. 11. On this embassy and the proposals there made, see Demosthenes himself, de Cor. &sect;&sect; 311, 313, from which it would seem that the words here quoted are not Philip's, but an argument used by his ambassadors. Comp. also &sect; 146, <foreign lang="greek">ou)/t'  ei)s th\n *)attikh\n e)lqei=n dunato/s... mh/te *qhbai/wn diie/ntwn</foreign>: and Aesch. c.

Schmidt (<hi rend="italic">On the date of the Rhet.</hi> Halle, 1837, p. 16) uses this passage in fixing the date of Ar.'s work. [See Introd. p. 38.] </p>
						<p>Dionys., ad Amm. c. 11, cites the whole of this topic.

						<p>Top. VI. This topic, &ldquo;the retort which turns the point of what has been said against ourselves upon him who said it,&rdquo; viz. the adverse <pb n="252"/> party in the law-court or assembly, belongs, as Brandis also remarks, u. s., p. 19, exclusively to Rhetoric. &ldquo;Cum argumentum ducitur ex iis quae ex moribus vitaque ipsorum dicta sunt, admodumque ipsis congruunt, adversus illum ipsum qui dixit: eminet autem, inquit, hic inter alios, ac vim maximam semper habere existimatus est.&rdquo; Victorius. That <foreign lang="greek">kata/</foreign> in the definition means &lsquo;against&rsquo; and not &lsquo;of&rsquo; (in respect of) appears from the example. Iphicrates asks Aristophon, who had accused him of taking bribes to betray the fleet, &ldquo;Would you have done it yourself? No; I am not like <hi rend="italic">you.</hi> Well then, as you admit that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Aristophon, are incapable of it, must not I, Iphicrates, (your superior in virtue and everything else,) be still more incapable of it?&rdquo; As Ar. adds, the argument is worth nothing unless the person who uses it is conscious of his own moral superiority, and knows that the audience whom he addresses shares his conviction: employed against an &lsquo;Aristides the Just&rsquo;, it would be simply ridiculous. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">diafe/rei de\ o( tro/pos k.t.l.</lemma>] This is interpreted by Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm.</hi> u. s., p. 16 [and ed. 1867], &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Mores</hi> sunt qui in hac re in discrimen vocantur; mores enim et vita eminet et litigantes discernit.&rdquo; I doubt if <foreign lang="greek">tro/pos</foreign>, standing thus alone, can mean <hi rend="italic">mores:</hi> nor, I think, is the mention of character and manners appropriate in this place: further on it would be suitable. Gaisford's explanation and connexion seem to be upon the whole most satisfactory. &ldquo;Verba <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on e)n tw=| *teu/krw|&mdash;ei)/peien</foreign> puto esse <foreign lang="greek">dia\ me/sou</foreign>. His certe seclusis belle procedunt omnia.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi(=on e)n tw=| *teu/krw|</lemma>] This is no doubt Sophocles' tragedy of that name: of which four fragments (and one doubtful one) still survive. See Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Tr. Gr.</hi> 1 388, 9. &ldquo;Quum Ar. ubi poetarum nomina omisit tantummodo clarissimos quosque respexerit, facile inducimur ut eum Sophoclis Teucrum dixisse credamus.&rdquo; And Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Spec. Comm.</hi> u. s., p. 16 [and ed.] &ldquo;Sophoclis puto; si alius esset, nomen addidisset.&rdquo; The same play is quoted again, III 15. 9, whence it appears that Ulysses was one of the characters. In an altercation with Teucer, the latter must be supposed to have used a similar argument, or retort, founded upon his own acknowledged superiority in moral character<note anchored="yes">Ulysses may be supposed to have accused Teucer of the murder of his brother&mdash; comp. Aj. 1012 seq. and 1021, where such a suspicion is hinted at: If <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Ulysses, are shocked at such a crime, do you suppose that <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, Teucer, could have been guilty of it? The same argument was employed by Euripides in his Telephus. Fragm. XII, Dindorf, ap. Arist. Acharn. 554. Wagner, II p. 364. Fr.

See Wagner l. c. <pb n="253"/> who gives a long account of the subject of the play, and compares it with Pacuvius' play of the same name, supposed to be borrowed from Sophocles. </p>
						<p>Aristophon was already celebrated as an orator in 403 B. C. (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H., sub anno.</hi>) His fame may be inferred from the frequent and respectful mention of him by Demosthenes especially (see for instance, de Cor. &sect; 219, de Fals. Leg. &sect; 339), Aeschines and Dinarchus. See Baiter et Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att., Ind. Nom.</hi> s. v., p. 21, Vol. III. He was an Azenian, <foreign lang="greek">*)azhnieu/s</foreign>, and thereby distinguished from his namesake of Collytus, de Cor. &sect; 93. The speech to which Iphicrates here replies was delivered in &ldquo;the prosecution of Iphicrates by him and Chares for his failure in the last campaign of the Social war, Diod. XVI 15. 21,&rdquo; (Clint. <hi rend="italic">F. H. sub anno</hi>,) in the year 355 B. C., at an already advanced age. See also Sauppe, Fragm. Lys. 65, <hi rend="italic">Or.

						<p>Top. VII. Definition. The definition of terms is the basis of all sound argument, and the ambiguity of terms one of the most abundant sources of fallacy and misunderstanding. A clear definition is therefore necessary for intelligible reasoning. To establish definitions, and so come to a clear understanding of the thing in controversy, was, as Aristotle tells us, the end and object of the Socratic method. The use of the definition in dialectics is treated in the Topics, A 15, 107 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 36 &mdash;<hi rend="italic">b</hi> 5 [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I p. 404], B 2, 109 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 13 seq. and 30 seq. Cic. Topic. V 26&mdash;VII 32. De Inv. II 17. 53&mdash;56. Orat. Part. XII 41. De Orat. II 39. 164. Quint. V 10. 36, and 54 seq. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> example of the argument from definition, is the inference drawn by Socrates at his trial from the definition of <foreign lang="greek">to\ daimo/nion</foreign>, Plat. Apol. Socr. c. 15. Meletus accuses him of teaching his young associates not to believe in the gods recognized by the state, and introducing other new divinities, <foreign lang="greek">e(/tera daimo/nia kaina/</foreign>, in their place. Socrates argues that upon Meletus' own admission he believes in <foreign lang="greek">daimo/nia</foreign> divine things (27 C); but divine things or works imply a workman; and therefore a belief in <foreign lang="greek">daimo/nia</foreign> necessarily implies a belief in the authors of those works, viz. <foreign lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign>. But <foreign lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign> are universally held to be either <foreign lang="greek">qeoi/</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">qew=n pai=des</foreign> (27 D), and therefore in either case a belief in <foreign lang="greek">daimo/nia</foreign> still implies a belief in the gods. The conclusion is <foreign lang="greek">tou= au)tou= ei)=nai daimo/nia kai\ qei=a h(gei=sqai</foreign> (E). </p>
						<p>In Xenophon's apology this argument is entirely omitted; and Socrates is represented as interpreting the <foreign lang="greek">kaina\ daimo/nia</foreign> (which he is accused of introducing) of <foreign lang="greek">to\ daimo/nion</foreign>, the divine sign which checked him when he was about to do wrong; and this is referred to the class of divine communications&mdash;oracles, omens, divination and so forth. </p>
						<p>As to the status of the <foreign lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign> opinions varied: but the usual conception of them was, as appears in Hesiod, Op. et D. 121, and many passages of Plato, Timaeus, Laws (VIII 848 D, <foreign lang="greek">qew=n te kai\ tw=n e(pome/nwn qeoi=s daimo/nwn</foreign>), IV 713 B, <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)nqrw/pous a)lla\ ge/nous qeiote/rou te kai\ a)mei/nonos, dai/monas</foreign>, and elsewhere, that they were an order of beings, like angels, intermediate between men and gods, and having the office of tutelary deities or guardian angels to the human race. So Hesiod, u. s., Theogn. 1348 (of Ganymede), Plat. Phaedo 108 B, 107 D, 113 D. Aristotle seems to imply the same distinction when he says, de Div. per Somn. 1 2, init., that dreams are not <foreign lang="greek">qe)pempta</foreign>, because they are natural, <foreign lang="greek">daimo/nia me/ntoi: h( ga\r</foreign> <pb n="256"/> <foreign lang="greek">fu/sis daimoni/a, a)ll'  ou) qei/a</foreign>. This argument of Socrates is repeated, III 18. 2, more at length, and with some difference of detail. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> example is taken from Iphicrates' speech upon the prosecution of Harmodius, the <foreign lang="greek">di/kh pro\s *(armo/dion</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 6, &ldquo;cum Harmodius generis obscuritatem obiiceret, definitione <hi rend="italic">generosi</hi> et <hi rend="italic">propinqui</hi> fastum adversarii repressit et decus suum defendit.&rdquo; Schrader. Harmodius had evidently been boasting of his descent from the famous Harmodius, and contrasting his own noble birth with the low origin of Iphicrates. The latter replies, by defining true nobility to be merit, and not mere family distinction (comp. II 15, and the motto of Trinity College, <hi rend="italic">virtus vera nobilitas</hi> [Iuv. VIII. 20 <hi rend="italic">nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus</hi>]); &lsquo;for Harmodius (himself) and Aristogeiton had no <hi rend="italic">nobility</hi> anterior to their noble <hi rend="italic">deed</hi>&rsquo;. Next as to the relationship which Harmodius claimed: he himself is in reality more nearly related to Harmodius than his own descendant: true kinsmanship is shewn in similarity of actions: &lsquo;at all events my <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi> are more nearly akin to those of Harmodius and Aristogeiton than thine&rsquo;. This is still more pointedly expressed in Plutarch's version, <foreign lang="greek">*)apofqe/gmata basile/wn kai\ strathgw=n</foreign> Iphicr. <foreign lang="greek">e/</foreign>, p. 187 B, <foreign lang="greek">pro\s de\ *(armo/dion, to\n tou= palaiou= *(armodi/ou a)po/gonon, ei)s dusge/neian au)tw=| loidorou/menon e)/fh: to\ me\n e)mo\n a)p'  e)mou= ge/nos a)/rxetai, to\ de\ so\n e)n soi\ pau/etai</foreign>. This seems to be taken, with alterations, from a speech of Lysias, ap. Stob. flor. 86. 15, quoted by Sauppe, Fragm. Lys. XVIII. <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III 180. Another form of Iphicrates' saying, briefer still, is found in Pseudo-Plut. <foreign lang="greek">peri\ eu)genei/as</foreign> c. 21 (ap. Sauppe u. s.), <foreign lang="greek">*)ifikra/ths o)neidizo/menos ei)s dusge/neian: e)gw\ a)/rcw, ei)=pe, tou= ge/nous</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is taken from the Alexander of some unknown apologist, quoted before, &sect; 5, and &sect; 12; and c. 24. 7 and 9. On this Schrader; &ldquo;sententia illius videtur haec esse: Paridem intemperantem habendum non esse, una quippe Helena contentum. Argumentum e definitione temperantis (temperantiae) petitum.&rdquo; Similarly Victorius, &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">mh\ ko/smios</foreign> est qui una contentus non est...sed quot videt formosas mulieres tot amat. Cum sola Helena ipse contentus vixerit, non debet intemperans vocari.&rdquo; </p>

N. I 3, sub init., <foreign lang="greek">o( a)polaustiko\s bi/os</foreign>, the life of a Sardanapalus. Ib.

						<p>The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> is, the reason that Socrates gave for refusing to go to pay a visit to Archelaus; that it would be ignominious to him, to receive favours from a man, and then not to have the power of requiting the benefits (good treatment) in the same way as one would injuries (ill treatment). This was a new definition, or an extension of the ordinary one, of <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, which is &ldquo;wanton outrage,&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> II 2. 5, an <hi rend="italic">act</hi> of aggression. <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> usually implies hostility on the part of him who inflicts it; in this case the offer of a supposed benefit is construed as inflicting the ignominy. </p>
						<p>The abstract <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, for the concrete <foreign lang="greek">u(bristiko/n</foreign>, occurs often elsewhere, as in Soph. Oed. Col. 883, <foreign lang="greek">a)=r'  ou)x u(/bris ta/d)</foreign>; KP. <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris: a)ll'  a)nekte/a</foreign>. Arist. Ran. 21, <foreign lang="greek">ei)=t'  ou)x u(/bris tau=t) e)sti/</foreign>; Lysistr. 658, Nub. 1299. Similarly Ter. Andr.

						<p>The contempt of Archelaus implied in this refusal is noticed by Diog. Laert., Vit. Socr. II 5. 25, <foreign lang="greek">u(perefro/nhse de\ kai\ *)arxela/ou tou= *makedo/nos...mh/te par'  au)tou\s a)pelqw/n</foreign>; and see Schneider's note on Xenophon, Apol.

On Archelaus and his usurpation of the throne of Macedonia, and his tyranny and crimes, see Plato Gorg. c. XXVI p. 470 C&mdash;471 C. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For all these first define the term (they are about to use), and then, having found its true essence and nature, they proceed to draw their inference (conclude) from it on the point that they are arguing. The <foreign lang="greek">o(/ros</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">o(rismo/s</foreign>, &lsquo;definition&rsquo;, is itself defined at length, Metaph. <foreign lang="greek">*d</foreign> 12, 1037 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25, seq.: and more briefly Top. A 8, 103 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 15, 101 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 39, Z 6, 143 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20. The definition of a thing is its <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos, to\ ti/ h)=n ei)=nai shmai/nwn</foreign>, that which expresses the <hi rend="italic">formal cause</hi> of a thing; the <hi rend="italic">what it was to be;</hi> the essence of it, or that which makes it what it is. Only <foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> or species can, strictly speaking, be defined: the definition of the <foreign lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign> gives the <foreign lang="greek">ge/nos</foreign>, the essentials, together with the <foreign lang="greek">diafora/</foreign>, or specific difference: and these two constitute the definition; which is here accordingly said to express <foreign lang="greek">to\ ti/ e)sti/</foreign>, &lsquo;the, what the thing really is&rsquo;. On the definition see Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Organ.</hi> II p. 398, and Trend. <hi rend="italic">El. Log. Ar.</hi> &sect; 54, et seq.

						<p>Top. VIII. <foreign lang="greek">e)k tou= posaxw=s</foreign>] Between the topics of definition and division (&sect; 10) is introduced this topic of ambiguous terms, or words <pb n="258"/> that are susceptible of many and various senses, such as <hi rend="italic">good</hi> (Top.

The exhaustive treatment bestowed upon it in the Topics supersedes the necessity of dwelling on it here; and we are accordingly referred to that treatise for illustration of it. Brandis, u.s., p. 19, objects to <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= o)rqw=s</foreign>, &ldquo;that there is nothing in the Topics which throws any light upon the enigmatical <foreign lang="greek">o)rqw=s</foreign>;&rdquo; and proposes <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= ei) o)rqw=s</foreign> &lsquo;upon the right use of the terms&rsquo;, i. e. whether it can be applied properly in any one of its various senses or not. But surely the reading of the text may be interpreted as it stands in precisely the same meaning: <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on e)n topikoi=s</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">le/lektai</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">diw/ristai</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= o)rqw=s</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">xrh=sqai au)tw=|</foreign>), &lsquo;as in the Topics (we have treated) of the right use of the terms&rsquo;. Muretus has omitted the words in his transl. as a gloss: and Victorius, followed by Schrader and Buhle, understands it as a reference, not directly to the Topics, but to the &lsquo;dialectical art&rsquo;, as elsewhere, II 22. 10, for instance&mdash; see Schrader's note on II 25. 3. &ldquo;Disciplina Topica intelligenda est.&rdquo; Buhle.

						<p>Ismenias, whose name likewise is wanting in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict.</hi>, was in all probability the one somewhat celebrated in Theban history, as leader, with Autoclides, of the anti-Lacedaemonian party at Thebes, mentioned by Xenophon, Hellen.

						<p>&lsquo;And another instance from Theodectes' &ldquo;law&rdquo;&mdash;if to those who have mismanaged other people's horses we don't entrust horses of our own, or (our ships) to those who have upset the ships of others; then, if the rule hold universally, those who have ill guarded or maintained the safety and well-being of others, are not to be employed in (entrusted with) the preservation of our own&rsquo;. Sauppe, Fragm. Theod. <foreign lang="greek">*no/mos</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III <pb n="261"/> 247), thinks with every appearance of probability that Theodectes' &lsquo;law&rsquo; &ldquo;(<hi rend="italic">declamationem</hi>) ad rationes militum mercenariorum lege ab Atheniensibus accurate ordinandas pertinuisse.&rdquo; Both the fragments quoted by Aristotle, here, and again &sect; 17, agree perfectly with this view. The extract here stigmatizes the folly shewn by the Athenians in entrusting their interests to mercenaries&mdash;like Charidemus and his fellows&mdash;who have already shewn their incapacity and untrustworthiness whilst in the employment of others&mdash;foreign princes and states&mdash;who have used their services. The other extract, &sect; 17, is to shew that by their gross misconduct and the mischief they have already done, most of them&mdash;with the exception perhaps of men like Strabax and Charidemus&mdash;have entirely disqualified themselves for employment. From the example in Theodectes' &lsquo;law&rsquo;, the <hi rend="italic">general principle</hi> may be inferred, that it is folly to entrust with the care of our own interests and the management of our affairs such as have already shewn themselves incapable by previous failures in like cases. The argument from the analogy of trades and professions is quite in the manner of Socrates and Plato. </p>

Accordingly Bekker, Ed. 3, Spengel and Vahlen now read <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti *)aq</foreign>. preceded by the mark of something omitted. And in fact, as Spengel observes, what follows is not a proper continuation of the preceding quotation from Alcidamas, but a new example of the general topic of induction. The general rule which is derived from the two following instances has fallen out, or something suggesting it, to which <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> refers, has been omitted either by a copyist, or possibly in his haste by the author himself. Aristotle is capable of this; continuing perhaps to quote from Alcidamas, he may have neglected to supply the proper connexion. The general principle that is to be inferred from the induction may be the Platonic paradox that the true statesmen are philosophers: this appears from the three examples, &lsquo;that the Athenians flourished and were happy under the laws of Solon, and the Lacedaemonians under those of Lycurgus; and at Thebes, the prosperity (or flourishing condition) of the city was coeval with the accession of its leaders to philosophy&rsquo;. I have rendered the last words thus to express <foreign lang="greek">e)ge/nonto</foreign>. But the meaning of the whole is doubtless as Victorius gives it, that the happiness of Thebes, that is, its virtue and glory, began and ended with the philosophy of its leaders. This is inadequately expressed by <foreign lang="greek">e)ge/nonto</foreign>, which only conveys the beginning of the coincidence: and, if the explanation of the suppressed rule be right, would have been better represented by <foreign lang="greek">a(/ma oi( filo/sofoi prosta/tai e)ge/nonto</foreign>. The last word is a correction of Victorius from MS A^{c} for the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e)le/gonto</foreign>.

						<p>The appearance of the <foreign lang="greek">semnai\ qeai/</foreign> as prosecutors in the court of the Areopagus is of course a reference to their prosecution of Orestes in Aeschylus' Eumenides. Of Mixidemides we know but the name. Autocles was a much more important personage. He was an Athenian, son of Strombichides, Xen. Hellen. VI 3. 2, one of the seven ambassadors sent to the congress at Sparta in 371 B.C., in the spring before the battle of Leuctra, Xen. l. c., who reports his speech &sect; 7. Xenophon (u. s. &sect; 7) calls him <foreign lang="greek">ma/la e)pistrefh\s r(h/twr</foreign>, &lsquo;a very careful orator&rsquo; (so Sturz, Lex. Xen. and Lexx. but I think rather, &lsquo;dexterous&rsquo;, one who could readily <hi rend="italic">turn himself about</hi> to anything, &lsquo;versatile&rsquo;: and so apparently Suidas, who renders it <foreign lang="greek">a)gxi/nous</foreign>). Autocles was again employed in 362&mdash;361 &ldquo;in place of Ergophilus (Rhet. II 3. 13) to carry on war for Athens in the Hellespont and Bosporus.&rdquo; (Grote.) Xenophon's Hellenics do not reach this date. His operations against Cotys in the Chersonese, and subsequent trial, are mentioned by Demosth. c. Aristocr. &sect; 104 and c. Polycl. &sect; 12, and his name occurs, pro Phorm. &sect; 53 [A. Schaefer's <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi> I pp. 64, 134 and III 2. p. 158]. See Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> X 223 [c.

						<p>&lsquo;Or (another example) Sappho's saying, that death must be an evil: for the gods have so decided; else they would have died themselves&rsquo;: using the gods as an <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> for the truth of her dictum. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or again, as Aristippus to Plato, when he pronounced upon some point in&mdash;as he, Aristippus, thought&mdash;a somewhat too authoritative tone, &ldquo;Nay but,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our friend&rdquo;&mdash;meaning Socrates&mdash;&ldquo;never used to speak like that.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Aristippus draws an inference from the <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> of their common master&mdash;who never dictated, but left every question open to free discussion, always assuming his own ignorance, and desire to be instructed rather than to instruct&mdash;to the proper rule in conducting philosophical discussion. On Aristippus see Grote's Plato, Vol. III. p. 530, seq. ch. XXXVIII. </p>
						<p>On this passage, see Grote, Plato, III 471, and note. In qualification of what is there said of Plato's &lsquo;arrogance&rsquo;, so far as it can be gathered <pb n="266"/> from our text, take Victorius' commentary on <foreign lang="greek">w(s w)/|eto</foreign>, with which I entirely agree: &ldquo;quae sequuntur verba modestiam Platonis defendunt, et paene declarant sine causa Aristippum arrogantiae eum insumulasse: addit enim <foreign lang="greek">w(s w)/|eto</foreign>, ut opinio illius erat.&rdquo; I will not however deny that Plato may even in conversation have been occasionally guilty of dogmatizing: in his latest writings, such as the Timaeus and Laws, and to a less degree in the Republic, such a tendency undoubtedly shews itself: but by far the larger portion of his dialogues, which represent probably nearly three-fourths of his entire life, are pervaded by a directly opposite spirit, and are the very impersonation of intellectual freedom. Following the method and practice of his master, he submits every question as it arises to the freest dialectical discussion, so that it is often impossible to decide which way (at the period of writing any particular dialogue) his own opinion inclines; and always presents in the strongest light any objections and difficulties in the thesis which he is maintaining. I think at all events with Victorius that Aristotle at any rate lends no countenance here to Aristippus' charge of dogmatic assumption. So far as his outward bearing and demeanour were concerned, I can conceive that he may have been haughty and reserved, possibly even morose: but a habit of &lsquo;laying down the law&rsquo;, or of undue assumption and pretension in lecturing and discussion&mdash;which is what Aristippus appears here to attribute to him&mdash;seems to me to be inconsistent with what we known from his dialogues to have been the ordinary habit of his mind, at least until he was already advanced in life<note anchored="yes">I have expressed my opinion upon some points of Plato's character, in contrast with that of Aristotle, in Introd. to transl. of Gorgias p. xxvii, and note; to which I venture here to refer.</note>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)paggeltikw/teron] e)pagge/llesqai</lemma> is to &lsquo;announce&rsquo;, &lsquo;make public profession of&rsquo;, as of an art, pursuit, business, practice. Xen. Memor. I 2. 7, <foreign lang="greek">e)p'  a)reth/n</foreign>, of the Sophists, who &lsquo;made a profession of teaching virtue&rsquo;. So <foreign lang="greek">*prwtago/rou e)pa/ggelma</foreign>, Rhet. II 24. 11. This &lsquo;profession&rsquo; may or may not carry with it the notion of pretension without performance, imposture, sham, <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nh sofi/a</foreign>, show without substance: and it is by the context and the other associations that the particular meaning must be determined. Thus when Protagoras says of himself, <foreign lang="greek">tou=to/ e)stin, w)= *s., to\ e)pa/ggelma o(\ e)pagge/llomai</foreign>, he certainly does not mean to imply that he is an impostor: when Aristotle l. c. applies the term to him, this is by no means so certain; judging by his account of the Sophists, de Soph. El. I, 165 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 19 seq. Instances of both usages may be found in Ast, Lex. Plat. There can be no doubt that undue <hi rend="italic">assumption</hi> or pretension is meant to be conveyed by Aristippus in applying the word to Plato's tone and manner. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Agesipolis repeated the inquiry of the God at Delphi, which he had previously made (of the God) at Olympia (Apollo at Delphi, Zeus at Olympia), whether his opinion coincided with his father's; <pb n="267"/> assuming or inferring&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> sc. from the obvious duty of respecting the authority of a father) &lsquo;the disgracefulness of pronouncing the contrary&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>For v. l. <foreign lang="greek">*(hgh/sippos</foreign> Victorius and Muretus had proposed to substitute <foreign lang="greek">*)aghsi/polis</foreign>, from Xen. Hellen.

Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, p. 53. Gaisford in <hi rend="italic">Not. Var.</hi> and Victorius. Xenophon in the passage cited tells the whole story. Agesipolis is the first of the three kings of Sparta of that name, who came to the throne in 394 B.C. (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> II p. 205). His expedition into Argolis, to which the consultation of the oracle was preparatory, was in 390 (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H. sub anno</hi>). This Agesipolis has been not unnaturally confounded with his more distinguished fellow-citizen and contemporary Agesilaus, to whom Plutarch, Reg. et Imper. Apophthegm., Agesilaus 7, p. 191 B, erroneously ascribes this saying as an <hi rend="italic">apophthegm</hi> (Gaisford).

						<p>Top. XII. <foreign lang="greek">e)k tw=n merw=n</foreign>] the argument from the parts to the whole. This topic, so briefly dispatched here, is much more clearly and fully set forth in the Topics, B 4, 111 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33 seq. [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I p. 417], to which we are referred; the same example being given in both. The parts and whole, are the species and genus. Anything of which the genus or whole can be predicated must likewise fall under one of its species, because the species taken together make up the genus; if knowledge for instance be predicable of something, then some one of its parts or branches&mdash;grammar, music or some other species of knowledge&mdash;must needs be predicable of the same; otherwise it is no part of knowledge. And the same applies to the declensions&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">parwnu/mws lego/mena</foreign>, the same root or notion with altered terminations&mdash;of the words representing the genus; what is true of <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mh</foreign> &amp;c. is equally true of <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mwn, grammatiko/s, mousiko/s</foreign>. If then all the parts of the genus are or can be known (this is assumed in the text), we have to consider when any thesis is proposed, such as, the soul is in motion (<foreign lang="greek">th\n yuxh\n kinei=sqai</foreign>, meaning, that the soul <hi rend="italic">is</hi> motion), what the kinds of motion are, and whether the soul is capable of being moved in any of them; if not, we <hi rend="italic">infer</hi>, &lsquo;from part to whole&rsquo;, that the genus motion is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> predicable of soul, or that the soul is devoid of motion. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ki/nhsis</lemma> is usually divided by Aristotle into four kinds, (1) <foreign lang="greek">fora/</foreign>, motion of translation, motion proper; (2) <foreign lang="greek">a)lloi/wsis</foreign>, alteration; (3) <foreign lang="greek">au)/chsis</foreign>, growth; and (4) <foreign lang="greek">fqi/sis</foreign>, decay.

Plato gives two, Parmen. 138 C, (1) motion proper or of translation and (2) change. To which, p. 162 E, is added as a distinct kind the motion of revolution or rotation, (1) <foreign lang="greek">a)lloiou=sqai</foreign>, alteration, change of character, <foreign lang="greek">kata\ to\ pa/qos, to\ poio/n</foreign>; (2) <foreign lang="greek">metabai/nein</foreign>, change of place; and (3) <foreign lang="greek">stre/fesqai</foreign>, revolution. And in Legg. X c. 6, 893 B seq., where the distinctions are derived from <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> considerations, ten is the total number, 894 C. (Comp. Bonitz ad loc. Metaph., Waitz ad l. Categ.) Cicero treats this topic of argument, under the general head of <hi rend="italic">definitio</hi>, Top. V 26, seq., afterwards subdivided into <hi rend="italic">partitio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">divisio;</hi> and under the latter speaks of the process of dividing the genus into its species, which he calls <hi rend="italic">formae; Formae sunt hae, in quas genus sine ullius praetermissione dividitur: ut si quis ius in legem, morem, aequitatem dividat</hi>, &sect; 31: but does not go further into the argument to be derived from it. </p>
						<p>Quintilian, V 10. 55, seq., follows Cicero in placing <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">species</hi> under the head <hi rend="italic">finitio</hi>, &sect; 55, comp. &sect; 62; in distinguishing <hi rend="italic">partitio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">divisio</hi>, as subordinate modes of <hi rend="italic">finitio</hi> &sect; 63; and points out the mode of drawing inferences, affirmative or negative, from the division of the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> into its parts or <hi rend="italic">species</hi>, as to whether anything proposed <pb n="269"/> can or can not be included under it, &sect; 65.

						<p>&lsquo;Example from Theodectes' Socrates: &ldquo;What temple has he profaned? To which of the gods that the city believes in (recognises, accepts) has he failed to pay the honour due?&rdquo;&rsquo; The phrase <foreign lang="greek">a)sebei=n ei)s to\ i(ero\n to\ e)n *delfoi=s</foreign> occurs twice (as Victorius notes) in Aesch. c. Ctes. &sect;&sect; 106, 107. Theodectes' &ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; which is (most probably) quoted again without the author's name &sect; 18, was one of the numerous <foreign lang="greek">a)pologi/ai *swkra/tous</foreign> of which those of Plato and Xenophon alone are still in existence. We read also (Isocr. Busiris &sect; 4) of a paradoxical <foreign lang="greek">kathgori/a *swkra/tous</foreign> by Polycrates (one of the early Sophistical Rhetoricians, Spengel <hi rend="italic">Art. Script.</hi> pp. 75&mdash;7. <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX vol. III 281&mdash;2), which was answered by an <foreign lang="greek">a)pologi/a *swkra/tous</foreign> from Lysias, Speng. op. cit. p. 141. On this see Sauppe, Lys. Fragm. CXIII <hi rend="italic">Or.

						<p>Theodectes is here answering the charge of Meletus, <foreign lang="greek">ou(\s me\n h( po/lis nomi/zei qeou\s ou) nomi/zwn</foreign>, Xen. Mem. I 1. 1, Apol. Socr. &sect; 11, Plat. Ap.

The difference of the mode of treatment severally adopted by the two disciples in the defence of their master is remarkable. The <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> implied in Theod.'s argument is this:&mdash;You accuse Socrates of impiety and disbelief in the gods. Has he ever profaned a temple? Has he neglected to worship them and do them honour, by sacrifice and other outward observances? The indignant question, implying that the speaker defies the other to contradict him and prove his charge, assumes the negative. But such offences as these are the <hi rend="italic">parts</hi> of impiety which indicate disbelief in the gods&mdash;the orator in his excitement takes for granted that the enumeration is complete, that there is nothing else which could prove disbelief in the gods&mdash;and if he is not guilty of any of them, neither can he be guilty of the impiety which includes these, and these alone, as its parts; the whole or genus is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> predicable of him<note anchored="yes">This argument may possibly be suitable to a sophist and declaimer, but the use of it in a court of justice would certainly be exposed to the &lsquo;danger&rsquo; against which Quintilian warns those who employ the topic in general.</note>. <pb n="270"/> </p>
						<p>&sect;&sect; 14, 15. Top. XIII. <hi rend="italic">Argumentum ex consequentibus;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e)k tw=n e(pome/nwn tini\ a)gaqw=n h)\ kakw=n</foreign>, which Vict. found <hi rend="italic">as a title</hi> to the topic in one of his MSS. On <foreign lang="greek">e(/pesqai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)kolouqei=n</foreign>, and their various senses, dialectical and in the ordinary language, see note on I 6. 3. The general meaning of them seems to be &lsquo;concomitant&rsquo;; that which constantly waits or attends upon something, either as antecedent, simultaneous, or subsequent. </p>
						<p>There are two topics of consequents, XIII and XIV. The first is simple. Most things have some good and some bad consequent usually or inseparably attached to them, as wisdom and the envy of fellow-citizens are the ordinary results of education. In exhortation, defence, and encomium (the three branches of Rhetoric) we urge the favourable consequence&mdash;the resulting wisdom in the case proposed&mdash;if we have to dissuade, to accuse, to censure, the unfavourable; each as the occasion may require. The second is somewhat more complex. Here we have two opposites (<foreign lang="greek">peri\ duoi=n kai\ a)ntikeime/noin</foreign>) to deal with&mdash;in the example public speaking falls into the two alternatives of true and fair speaking, and false and unfair. These are to be treated &lsquo;in the way before mentioned&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">tw=| pro/teron ei)rhme/nw| tro/pw|</foreign>: that is, in exhorting or recommending we take the favourable consequent, in dissuading the unfavourable. But the difference between the two topics lies in this (<foreign lang="greek">diafe/rei de/</foreign>); that in the former the opposition (that must be the opposition of the good and bad consequent, for there is no other) is <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>&mdash;that is, as appears in the example, there is no relation or logical connexion between wisdom and envy; they may be compared in respect of their value and importance as motives to action, but are not logical opposites&mdash;but in the latter, the good and the bad consequences are two contraries (<foreign lang="greek">ta)nanti/a</foreign>) love and hatred, divine and human. In the example of the second topic, the dissuasive argument which comes first assigns evil consequences (<hi rend="italic">hatred</hi>) to both alternatives of public speaking: that in recommendation, the contrary, <hi rend="italic">love.</hi> The topic of consequences, in the general sense, as above explained, has been already applied in estimating the value of goods <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi>, I 6.3; and in the comparison of good things, I 7.5. In Dialectics it does not appear in this simple shape, though it is virtually contained in the application of it to the four modes of <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/qesis</foreign> or opposition, Top. B 8; and in the <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi> of two good things, Top. <foreign lang="greek">*g</foreign> 2, 117 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 5&mdash;15. Brandis u. s. [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV 1] observes of the two Rhetorical topics, that they could not find an independent place and treatment in the Topics. </p>
						<p>Cicero speaks of the general topic of consequence <hi rend="italic">dialecticorum proprius ex consequentibus antecedentibus et repugnantibus</hi>, omitting the <pb n="271"/> simple form in which it appears in Rhetoric. His <hi rend="italic">consequentia</hi> are <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> concomitants, <hi rend="italic">quae rem necessario consequuntur.</hi> Top. XII 53. The mode of handling it is illustrated, XIII 53. </p>
						<p>Quint. V 10. 74, Ex consequentibus <hi rend="italic">sive</hi> adiunctis; <hi rend="italic">Si est bonum iustitia, recte iudicandum: si malum perfidia, non est fallendum. Idem retro.</hi> &sect; 75, <hi rend="italic">sed haec</hi> consequentia <hi rend="italic">dico</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">a)kolouqa/</foreign>; <hi rend="italic">est enim consequens</hi> (in Cicero's sense) <hi rend="italic">sapientiae bonitas; illa</hi> sequentia, <foreign lang="greek">parepo/mena</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">quae postea facta sunt aut futura.</hi> And two other examples of the application of the argument, &sect;&sect; 76, 77. Quintilian naturally, like Aristotle, gives only the rhetorical, and omits the dialectical use of the topic. </p>
						<p>Note by the way the redundant <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> in <foreign lang="greek">sumbai/nei w(/sq'  e(/pesqai</foreign>. See Monk on Eur. Hippol. 1323, <foreign lang="greek">*ku/pris ga\r h)/qel'  w(/ste gi/gnesqai ta/de</foreign>. And add to the examples there given, Thuc.

						<p>The example of Top. is taken from the passage of Eur. Med. 294, already employed in illustration of a <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, II 21. 2. Education of children has for its inseparable attendants wisdom or learning as a good, and the envy of one's fellow-citizens as an evil: we may therefore take our choice between them, and argue either for or against it, persuading or dissuading. (Note a good instance of <foreign lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign>, as a negative (usually) corrective, &lsquo;nay rather&rsquo;; this of course comes from the opponent who is arguing on the other side, that education is advantageous. Also in &sect; 15.) </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The illustration of this topic constitutes the entire art of Callippus&mdash; with the addition (no doubt) of the possible, (the <foreign lang="greek">koino\s to/pos</foreign> of that name,) and all the rest (of the <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign>, three in number), as has been said&rsquo;, in c. 19, namely. </p>
						<p>The two notices of Callippus and his art of Rhetoric in this passage and &sect; 21, are all that is known to us of that rhetorician. He is not to be confounded with the Callippus mentioned in I 12. 29. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Art. Script.</hi> 148&mdash;9, contents himself with quoting the two passages of this chapter on the subject. He was one of the early writers on the art of Rhetoric; and it is possible that a person of that name referred to by <pb n="272"/> Isocrates&mdash;who was born in 436 B. C.&mdash;as one of his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> pupils, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ a)ntido/sews</foreign> &sect; 93, may have been this same Rhetorician Callippus. </p>

						<p>This second topic of consequences differs from the preceding in these particulars. In the first, which is simple, the consequences of the thing which is in question are twofold&mdash;bad and good, and these are unconnected by any reciprocal relation between them. The second is more complicated, and offers contrary alternatives, which are set in opposition <foreign lang="greek">a)ntiti/qetai ta)nanti/a</foreign>, as <foreign lang="greek">di/kaia</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/dika le/gein</foreign> in the example&mdash;and then, &lsquo;proceed as before&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">tw=| pro/teron ei)rhme/nw| tro/pw|</foreign>; that is, state the consequence of each, (favourable in exhortation or recommendation, unfavourable in dissuasion,) and bring the two into comparison in order to strike the balance of advantage or disadvantage between them. In public speaking, for instance, the alternatives are, true and fair, and false and unfair, words and arguments: if your object is to dissuade from it, you adduce the ill consequences of both, and contrast them, so as to shew which is the greater. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But that is all one with the proverb, to buy the marsh with the salt&rsquo;: i. e. to take the fat with the lean; the bad with the good; the unprofitable and unwholesome marsh (<hi rend="italic">palus inamabilis</hi>, Virg. G. IV 479, Aen. VI 438) with the profitable salt which is inseparably connected with it. An argument pro and con, but only of the first kind, Top. XIII, by comparing the good and the bad consequence, according as you are for or against the purchase. An Italian proverb to the same effect is quoted in Buhle's note, <hi rend="italic">comprare il mel con le mosche;</hi> and the opposite, the good <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the bad, appears in the Latin, <hi rend="italic">sine sacris haereditas</hi>, Plaut. Capt. IV 1. 5 (Schrad.). [We may also contrast the proverb <foreign lang="greek">mhde\ me/li, mhde\ meli/ssas</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ tw=n mh\ boulome/nwn paqei=n ti a)gaqo\n meta\ a)peuktou=</foreign> (Diogenianus, <hi rend="italic">cent.</hi> vi, 58). Cf. Sappho, fragm. 113.] <pb n="273"/> </p>
						<p>There is an evident intention in the association of <foreign lang="greek">e(/los</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a(/las</foreign>: the alliterative jingle, as in so many other proverbs (<foreign lang="greek">paqh/mata maqh/mata</foreign>, safe bind safe find), sharpens the point, and helps its hold on the memory. </p>
						<p>Some MSS have <foreign lang="greek">e)/laion</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e(/los</foreign>, which is expressed in the Vet. Tr. Lat., &lsquo;olim (oleum) emi et sales,&rsquo; and by other interpreters; and also adopted by Erasmus, <hi rend="italic">Adag.</hi>, oleum et salem oportet emere; &lsquo;to be in want of oil and salt,&rsquo; implying insanity, against which this mixture was supposed to be a specific. Victorius, referring to the Schol. on Arist. Nub. 1237, <foreign lang="greek">a(lsi\n diasmhxqei\s o)/nait'  a)\n ou(tosi/</foreign>, who notes <foreign lang="greek">tou\s parafronou=ntas a(lsi\ kai\ e)lai/w| die/brexon, kai\ w)felou=nto</foreign>, supposes that some copyist having this in his mind altered <foreign lang="greek">e(/los</foreign> into <foreign lang="greek">e)/laion</foreign>. At all events the proverb in this interpretation has no meaning or applicability here. </p>
						<p>In the following paragraph (<foreign lang="greek">kai\ h( blai/swsis...e(kate/rois</foreign>) the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign>, the application of the metaphor, and its connexion with what follows, which appears to be intended as an exemplification or explanation of the use of <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign>, are, and are likely to remain, alike unintelligible. The Commentators and Lexicographers are equally at fault; Spengel in his recent commentary passes the passage over in absolute silence: Victorius, who reasonably supposes that <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> (metaphorically) represents some figure of rhetorical argument, candidly admits that nothing whatsoever is known of its meaning and use, and affords no help either in the explanation of the metaphor, or its connexion with what seems to be the interpretation of it. Buhle, and W. Dindorf, ap. Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi> s. v. <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio;</hi> Vet. Lat. Tr. <hi rend="italic">claudicatio;</hi> Riccoboni <hi rend="italic">inversio.</hi> Vater discreetly says nothing; and Schrader that which amounts to nothing. After all these failures I cannot hope for any better success; and I will merely offer a few remarks upon the passage, with a view to assist others as far as I can in their search for a solution. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">blaiso/s</lemma> and <foreign lang="greek">r(aibo/s</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">valgus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">varus</hi>, all of them express a deformity or divergence from the right line, or standard shape, in the legs and feet. The first (which is not always explained in the same way<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">blaiso/s</foreign>...bandy-legged, <hi rend="italic">opposed to</hi> <foreign lang="greek">r(aibo/s. r(aibo/s</foreign>, crooked, bent, <hi rend="italic">esp. of</hi> bandy legs. Liddell and Scott's Lex. sub vv.</note>) seems to correspond to our &lsquo;bow-legged&rsquo;, that is having the leg and foot bent outwards: for it was applied to the hind legs of frogs, <foreign lang="greek">blaisopo/dhs ba/traxos</foreign>, poet. ap. Suidam. And Etym. M. (conf. Poll. 2. 193,) interprets it, <foreign lang="greek">o( tou\s po/das ei)s ta\ e)/cw diestramme/nos</foreign> (with his feet distorted so as to turn outwards) <foreign lang="greek">kai\ tw=| *l stoixei/w| e)oikw/s</foreign>; so that it seems that it may represent the act of straddling. The adj. itself and some derivatives not unfrequently occur in Ar.'s works on Nat. Hist.; likewise in Galen, once in Xenophon, de re Eq. I 3, and, rarely in other authors; but <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> appears to be a <foreign lang="greek">a(/pac lego/menon. r(aibo/s</foreign> is the opposite defect to this, &lsquo;bandy-legged&rsquo;, where the legs turn inwards. And to these correspond <hi rend="italic">valgus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">varus:</hi> the first, <hi rend="italic">qui suras et crura habet extrorsum intortas</hi>, of which Petronius says, <hi rend="italic">crura in orbem pandit;</hi> and Martial, <hi rend="italic">crura... simulant quae cornua lunae.</hi> Huic contrarius est <hi rend="italic">varus</hi>, qui introrsus <pb n="274"/> pedes et crura obtorta habet. &ldquo;Vari dicuntur incurva crura habentes.&rdquo; Festus (ap. Facc.). Heindorf ad Hor. Sat. I. 3, 47. G. Dindorf (in Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi>) explains it by <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio</hi>, quoting Cic. Orat. Partit. XXXVI 126, (praevaricator definitur) <hi rend="italic">ex nomine ipso, quod significat eum qui in contrariis caussis quasi vare</hi> (Edd. varie) <hi rend="italic">esse positus videatur</hi><note anchored="yes">Compare the whole passage &sect;&sect; 124&mdash;126, in illustration of <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio.</hi></note>. If we revert to the derivation, and apparently the original meaning, of the word, following Cicero, and understand it as &lsquo;a deviation from the right&rsquo; course or path, by a metaphor from bent or distorted legs, <hi rend="italic">praevaricatio</hi> might be taken as expressing by a similar metaphor the general meaning of <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign>; but in its ordinary acceptation of &lsquo;the betrayal of his client by an advocate, and collusion with his opponent&rsquo;&mdash;in which Buhle and the Translators must be supposed to understand it, since they offer no other explanation&mdash;it seems altogether inappropriate. So however Rost and Palm, in their <hi rend="italic">Lexicon.</hi> </p>
						<p>The translation, as the passage stands, is &lsquo;and the <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> is, or consists in, this, when each (either) of two contraries is followed (accompanied) by a good and an ill consequence, each contrary to each&rsquo;, (as in a proposition of Euclid). This is a generalisation of the example in Top. XIV: the two contraries are the fair and unfair speaking; each of which has its favourable and unfavourable consequence; truth, the love of God and hatred of men; falsehood, the love of men and hatred of God. But how this is connected with <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> I confess myself unable to discover. The nearest approach I have been able to make to it&mdash;which I only mention to condemn&mdash;is to understand <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> of the <hi rend="italic">straddling</hi> of the legs, the <foreign lang="greek">*l</foreign> of the Etymol. M., which might possibly represent the <hi rend="italic">divergence</hi> of the two inferences pro and con deducible from the topic of consequences: but not only is this common to all rhetorical argumentation, and certainly not characteristic of this particular topic, but it also loses sight of the deviation from a true standard, which we have supposed this metaphorical application of the term to imply. </p>

						<p>Top. XV. This Topic is derived from the habit men have, which may be assumed to be almost universal, of concealing their real opinions and wishes in respect of things good and bad, which are always directed to their own interests, under the outward show and profession of noble and generous sentiments and of a high and pure morality. Thus, to take two examples from de Soph. El. c. 12, they openly profess that a noble death is preferable to a life of pleasure; that poverty and rectitude, is better than ill-got gains, than wealth accompanied with disgrace: but secretly they think and wish the contrary. These contrary views and inclinations can always be played off one against the other in argument, and the opponent made to seem to be asserting a paradox: you infer the one or the other as the occasion requires. This is in fact the most effective (<foreign lang="greek">kuriw/tatos</foreign>) of all topics for bringing about this result. The mode of dealing with the topic is thus described in de Soph. El. l. c. 173 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, &ldquo;If the thesis is in accordance with their real desires, the <pb n="275"/> respondent should be confronted with their public professions; if it is in accordance with them [the latter], he should be confronted with their real desires. In either case he must fall into paradox, and contradict either their publicly expressed, or secret opinions.&rdquo; Poste, Transl. p. 43. This is for dialectics: but it may be applied equally well to rhetorical practice, in which there is nearly always a real or (as in the epideictic branch) imaginary opponent. The author proceeds, Ib. 173 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 7, further to illustrate this by the familiar opposition of <foreign lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">no/mos</foreign>, nature and convention or custom, which is to be handled in the same way as the preceding, and is <foreign lang="greek">plei=stos to/pos tou= ta\ para/doca le/gein</foreign>: referring to Callicles' well-known exposition of the true doctrine of justice conventional and natural, in Plato's Gorgias, c. 38, foll. </p>
						<p>This topic does not occur in Cicero's tract, which is confined to dialectics; nor is it found amongst the rhetorical topics of Quintilian's tenth chapter of Book V, which has supplied us with so many illustrations of Aristotle. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another; whereas in public and in secret men praise not the same things, but openly most highly extol what is just and right, yet secretly (privately, in their hearts,) prefer their own interest and advantage, from these (i. e. from premisses derived from the one or the other of these two modes of thought and expression, whichever it be that the opponent has given utterance to,) we must endeavour to infer the other: for of all <hi rend="italic">paradoxical</hi> topics (topics that lead to paradox, which enable us to represent the opponent as guilty of it,) this is the most effective (most powerful, mightiest, most authoritative)&rsquo;. If the opponent has been indulging in some high-flown moral commonplaces about virtue and honour, by an appeal to the real but <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> feelings of the audience on such matters, we must shew that such sentiments are paradoxical, or contrary to common opinion; or conversely, if we have occasion to assume the high moral tone, make our appeal to those opinions which they openly profess, and shew that it is a paradox to assume with the opponent that men are incapable of any other motives than such as are suggested by sordid self-interest. </p>

						<p>Top. XVI. &lsquo;Another (inference may be drawn) from the <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of so and so (<foreign lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign>)&rsquo;. This is the argument from analogy in its strict and proper sense, the &lsquo;analogy of relations&rsquo;. See Sir W. Hamilton, quoted at II 19. 2, and on the argument from analogy in general. The analogy or proportion here is the literal, numerical or geometrical, proportion, 2 : 4 :: 8 : 16. &ldquo;Analogy or proportion is the similitude of ratios.&rdquo; Eucl. El. Bk. v def. 8. </p>
						<p>This topic also does not appear in the dialectical treatise, where it is inappropriate; nor in Cicero and Quintilian, except so far as the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">popular</hi> analogy (see again the note above referred to) <pb n="276"/> is recognised under the names of <hi rend="italic">similitudo</hi> (C) and <hi rend="italic">similia</hi> (Q). Similitude is between two, proportion requires four terms. Eth. N. V 6, 1131 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 32, <foreign lang="greek">h( ga\r a)nalogi/a i)so/ths e)sti\ lo/gwn</foreign> (equality or parity of ratios), <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e)n te/tarsin e)laxi/stois</foreign>. And comp. the explanation of the &lsquo;proportional&rsquo; metaphor in Poet. XXI 11, and the examples, &sect;&sect; 12, 13. Accordingly of the two examples each has four terms, and the inference is drawn from the similitude of the two ratios. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As Iphicrates, when they (the assembly, <foreign lang="greek">yhfiou=ntai</foreign>,) wanted to force upon his son the discharge of one of the liturgies&rsquo; (pecuniary contributions to the service of the state, ordinary and extraordinary, of a very onerous character), &lsquo;because he was tall, though he was younger than <hi rend="italic">the</hi> age (required by law), said that if they suppose tall boys to be men, they will have to vote short men to be boys&rsquo;: the proportion being, Tall boys : men :: short men : boys. Two ratios of equality. The argument is a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum.</hi> The first ratio is hypothetical. If tall boys are really to be regarded as men, then by the same ratio, &amp;c. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Theodectes, in the &ldquo;law&rdquo;&rsquo; (which he proposes, in his declamation, for the reform of the mercenary service, see above &sect; 11, note) &lsquo;you make citizens of your mercenaries, such as Strabax and Charidemus, for their respectability and virtue, and won't you (by the same proportion) make exiles of those who have been guilty of such desperate (<foreign lang="greek">a)nh/kesta</foreign>) atrocities?&rsquo; </p>
						<p>Of these &lsquo;mercenaries&rsquo; who swarmed in Greece from the beginning of the fourth century onwards, the causes of their growth, their character and conduct, and the injury they brought upon Greece, see an account in Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> Vol. XI p. 392 seq. [chap. LXXXVII]. </p>
						<p>Charidemus, of Oreus in Euboea, in the middle of that century, was perhaps the most celebrated of their leaders. He was a brave and successful soldier, but faithless, and profligate and reckless in personal character. Theopomp. ap. Athen. X 436 B. C. Theopomp. Fr. 155, Fragm. Hist. Gr., ed. C. and Th. M&uuml;ller, p. 384 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (Firmin Didot). <foreign lang="greek">dia\ th\n e)piei/keian</foreign>, therefore, is not to be taken as an exact description of Charidemus' character, but is the assumption upon which the Athenians acted when they conferred these rewards. His only real merit was the service he had done them. He plays a leading part in Demosthenes' speech, c. Aristocratem; who mentions several times, &sect;&sect; 23, 65, 89, the citizenship conferred on him by the Athenians in acknowledgment of his services, as well as&mdash;somewhat later&mdash;a golden crown, &sect; 145, <foreign lang="greek">prw=ton poli/ths, ei)=ta pa/lin xrusoi=s stefa/nois w(s eu)erge/ths stefa/nwtai</foreign>, &sect; 157, <pb n="277"/> presents, and the name of &lsquo;benefactor&rsquo;, 185, and 188. Besides the Athenians, he was employed by Cotys and his son Cersobleptes, kings of Thrace, and by Memnon and Mentor in Asia. A complete account of him and his doings is to be found in Weber's Proleg. ad Dem. c. Aristocr. pp. LX&mdash;LXXXIII. </p>
						<p>Of the other mercenary leader, Strabax, all that we know is derived from Dem. c. Lept. &sect; 84, that through the intervention or by the recommendation (<foreign lang="greek">dia\</foreign>) of Iphicrates he received a certain &lsquo;honour&rsquo; from the Athenians, to which Theodectes' extract here adds that this was the citizenship. We learn further from Harpocration and Suidas that Strabax is&mdash;an <foreign lang="greek">o)/noma ku/rion</foreign>. &ldquo;De commendatione Iphicratis, ornatus Strabax videri potest Iphicratis in eodem bello (sc.

						<p>&lsquo;And in fact, as a general rule, we may always assume&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">dei=, xrh/</foreign>, <pb n="278"/> <hi rend="italic">aut tale aliquid</hi>) the result of either of two things to be the same with that of the other (<foreign lang="greek">e(kate/rou</foreign>), (or with <foreign lang="greek">e(ka/stou</foreign>, as A^{c}, adopted by Spengel, the result of <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>, i. e. any things, two or more, that we have to argue about) &lsquo;as in the example, &ldquo;what you are about to decide upon is not Isocrates, but a study and practice, whether or not philosophy deserves to be studied.&rdquo;&rsquo; Whether you decide upon Isocrates or his pursuit and study, the inference or result <hi rend="italic">is the same</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">tau)to/n</foreign>), and can be deduced equally from both. I have here adopted Spengel's emendation of Isocrates for Socrates, &ldquo;quam emendationem,&rdquo; as Spengel modestly says, &ldquo;Victorius si integram vidisset Antidosin nobis non reliquisset&rdquo;. It is given in his <hi rend="italic">Specim. Comm. in Ar. Rhet.</hi>, Munich, 1839, p. 37.

Even Bekker has accepted it. At the same time the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">*swkra/tous</foreign>, as Victorius interprets it, yields a very sufficient sense, thus more briefly expressed by Schrader, &ldquo;Socrate damnato simul damnabitur studium sapientiae: Socrate servato servabuntur sapientiae studia;&rdquo; Socrates and his study or pursuit stand or fall together; to condemn Socrates, is to condemn philosophy: and might even be thought to be confirmed by <foreign lang="greek">kri/nein</foreign>, which more immediately suggests a <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> decision. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that (the result, effect, consequence of) <hi rend="italic">giving earth and water</hi> is the same as, equivalent to, slavery&rsquo;. The demand of &lsquo;earth and water&rsquo; by the Persian monarchs from a conquered prince or state, in token of submission, and as a symbol of absolute dominion or complete possession of the soil&mdash;therefore equivalent to slavery, <foreign lang="greek">douleu/ein</foreign>&mdash;is referred to frequently by Herodotus, IV 126, Darius to Idanthyrsus, the Scythian king, <foreign lang="greek">despo/th| tw=| sw=| dw=ra fe/rwn gh=n te kai\ u(/dwr</foreign>.

The <foreign lang="greek">koinh\ ei)rh/nh</foreign>, and the <foreign lang="greek">sunqh=kai pro\s *)ale/c</foreign>. both denote the convention at Corinth of the deputies of all the Greek states, with the exception of the Lacedaemonians who refused to appear, in 336 B. C., &ldquo;which recognised Hellas as a confederacy under the Macedonian prince (Alexander, not Philip) as imperator, president, or executive head and arm.&rdquo; Grote, u. s. p. 18. The speech <foreign lang="greek">p. t. p. *)ale/c. s.</foreign>, according to the same authority, p. 21, was delivered in 335. But neither Aristotle's quotation, nor the Scholiast's comment, can refer to this speech, as Spengel himself observes. If the Scholiast is right in describing the opposition of Demosthenes as directed against <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi>, it must be referred to a different speech delivered by him against the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> agreement of a similar kind with Philip, after Chaeronea, which took place two years earlier than that with Alexander, in 338.

						<p>&lsquo;Of the two alternatives (the affirmative or negative side, whether the result is or is not the same, either may be taken, whichever happens to be serviceable&rsquo;.

XVIII. &lsquo;Another (is derived from the natural habit or tendency of mankind) that the same men don't always choose the same things&rsquo; (Spengel omits <foreign lang="greek">tou\s au)tou\s</foreign> with A^{c}; Bekker, as usual, retains it) &lsquo;after as before (something intermediate, act, occurrence, period), but conversely&rsquo; (i. e. <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the second time what they have avoided the first, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>); &lsquo;of which the following enthymeme is an example&rsquo;. </p>

This seems to be the required sense: and so I think Victorius understands it, &ldquo;non eadem iidem homines diversis temporibus sequuntur.&rdquo; The same meaning is very awkwardly expressed, if indeed it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> expressed, by rendering <foreign lang="greek">h)/</foreign> &lsquo;or&rsquo;. In that case <foreign lang="greek">u(/steron</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign> must be &lsquo;at one time or another&rsquo;: Riccobon &lsquo;posterius vel prius&rsquo; &lsquo;after or before&rsquo;: &lsquo;sooner or later&rsquo;. I will put the question, and leave it to the judgment of others. Which is the more natural expression, the more usual Greek, and more in accordance with the example? &lsquo;The same men don't always choose the same things after as before&rsquo;, i. e. the second time, when they have to repeat some action or the like, as the first time, when the circumstances are perhaps different: or, if <foreign lang="greek">h)/</foreign> be <hi rend="italic">or</hi>, &lsquo;men don't always choose the same things after <hi rend="italic">or</hi> before, sooner <hi rend="italic">or</hi> later&rsquo;.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)nqu/mhma</lemma>] Victorius interprets this &ldquo;argumentum <hi rend="italic">ex contrariis</hi> conclusum:&rdquo; on which see Introd. pp. 104, 5, Cic. Top. XIII 55. This is the <pb n="280"/> sense in which it is found in the Rhet. ad Alex., Cicero and Quintilian, and was in fact the <hi rend="italic">common</hi> usage of it. But, as far as I can recollect, it <hi rend="italic">never</hi> occurs in this special sense, at all events, in Aristotle's Rhetoric; and is in fact one of the leading distinctions between it and the Rhet. ad Alex. Neither was there any occasion to depart here from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> ordinary use of the term: for enthymemes, i. e. rhetorical inferences in general, are exactly what he is employed in illustrating throughout this chapter. </p>

We were eager to fight before (this was, as will appear afterwards, with the Lacedaemonians who aided the Thirty), shall we now after our restoration shrink from it? The <hi rend="italic">example</hi> is an instance of what men are in the habit of doing, viz. changing their minds without reason: the argument, that it is unreasonable, and monstrous at all events to do it now. </p>

Aesch. Choeph. 3, and his own commentary, Arist. Ran. 1163&mdash;5. </p>
						<p>This is followed by Aristotle's explanation, which is certainly more obscure than what it professes to explain. &lsquo;That is to say (<foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign>), at one time (before) they preferred staying (where they were, &lsquo;maintaining their ground&rsquo;) at the price of fighting; at another (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> their restoration) not fighting at the expense of not staying&rsquo;, i. e. the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> time, they preferred <hi rend="italic">not staying</hi>, quitting the city, to avoid fighting. It is necessary to interpret <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/</foreign> in this way, not &lsquo;instead of&rsquo;&mdash;if the reading be sound, to bring the explanation into conformity with the example; and thus no alteration is required. </p>
						<p>The words quoted by Ar. are taken from a speech of Lysias, of which Dionysius, de Lys. Iud. c. 33, has preserved a long fragment; printed amongst Lysias' speeches as Orat. 34. Baiter et Sauppe <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> I 147. [Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi> I p.441 and Jebb's <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi> I p. 211.] Dion. gives an account of the occasion of it in the preceding chapter. He doubts if it was ever actually delivered. The title of it is, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= mh\ katalu=sai th\n pa/trion politei/an *)aqh/nh|si</foreign>; and its object was to prevent the carrying into effect of a proposal of one Phormisius, one of the restored exiles <foreign lang="greek">meta\ tou= dh/mou</foreign>,&mdash;this was after the expulsion of the Thirty in 403 B. C., when the demus had been restored and recovered its authority, and the other party were now in exile&mdash;to permit the return of the present exiles, but to accompany this by a constitutional change, which should exclude from political rights all but the possessors of land; a measure which would have disfranchised 5000 citizens. The passage here quoted refers to a somewhat different subject. The Lace<pb n="281"/> daemonians, who were at hand with their troops, were trying to impose the measure upon them by force, dictating, and ordering, <foreign lang="greek">keleu/ousin, prosta/ttousin</foreign>, &sect; 6, and apparently preparing to interfere with arms. Lysias is accordingly exhorting the Athenians to resist manfully, and not to give way and quit the city again, after their restoration, for fear of having to fight: and Aristotle&mdash;and this is a most striking instance of the difficulty that so frequently arises from Aristotle's haste and carelessness in writing, and also of his constant liability to lapses of memory&mdash;quoting from memory, and quoting wrong, and neglecting to mention the occasion of the speech and the name of the author, which he had probably forgotten for the time,&mdash;has both altered the words and omitted precisely the two things&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">deino\n a)\n ei)/h</foreign>, which shows what the <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> is intended to be, and <foreign lang="greek">*lakedaimoni/ois</foreign>&mdash;which would have enabled his readers to understand his meaning. The passage of Lysias runs thus: <foreign lang="greek">deino\n ga\r a)\n ei)/h, w)= *)aqhnai=oi, ei) o(/te me\n e)feu/gomen, e)maxo/meqa *lakedaimoni/ois i(/na kate/lqwmen, katelqo/ntes de\ feuco/meqa i(/na mh\ maxw/meqa</foreign>. And it is now pretty clear what the intention of the writer of the fragment was, namely to stimulate the Athenian assembly not to submit to the dictation of the Lacedaemonians and to encounter them if it were necessary in battle, by urging the inconsistency and absurdity of which they would be guilty, if, whilst they were ready to fight before their restoration to their city, now that they were in actual possession of it they should quit it and return into exile, merely to avoid fighting. </p>

Here is an ostensible motive&mdash;a <hi rend="italic">gift</hi> being usually intended to cause pleasure&mdash;which <pb n="282"/> conceals the real motive, which is to cause pain; and this is the inference, you infer from the apparent fact or possible motive to the real one; the object of the topic being to assign a motive which suits your argument. Such then is the general meaning of the topic: the examples are all of the possible concealed <hi rend="italic">motive</hi> or <hi rend="italic">intention</hi>&mdash;which may be bad or good as your argument requires&mdash;that being the form in which it is more likely to be of use in Rhetoric. <foreign lang="greek">ou(= e(/nek'  a)\n ei)/h h)\ ge/noito</foreign> &lsquo;that for which so and so would, could, or might be, or be done&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">would</hi> be naturally or generally, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be possibly,) expresses the conditionality or possibility of the fact, motive, or intention, a meaning which is confirmed by <foreign lang="greek">e)nde/xetai ga/r k.t.l.</foreign>, in the explanation of the third example. (I call it the <hi rend="italic">third</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on ei) doi/h a)/n&mdash;luph/sh|</foreign> being an illustration.) </p>
						<p>On Victorius' interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">ei) mh\ ge/noito</foreign>, &lsquo;cuius rei caussa aliquid esse potest, <hi rend="italic">quamvis factum non sit</hi>,&rsquo; Vater says, &ldquo;sed hoc <hi rend="italic">quamvis factum non sit</hi>, ad rem non satis facit, neque in exemplis quae sequuntur eo respicitur an haec caussa vera sit necne:&rdquo; but whether that be so or not, I think that a still better reason may be given for rejecting it, that <foreign lang="greek">ei) mh\ ge/noito</foreign> <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be rendered <hi rend="italic">quamvis</hi> &amp;c., which would require <foreign lang="greek">ei) kai/</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ei)</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">kei)</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">mh\ ge/noito</foreign>. Victorius seems to mean, though the Greek (even independently of <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> for <hi rend="italic">quamvis</hi>) would hardly I think bear such an interpretation, &lsquo;to assert that what <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be the cause of a thing (i. e. an act) really is so, although it has not been (or, were not) done at all&rsquo;; in other words, &lsquo;though it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>&rsquo;: and this, though I cannot think it the right rendering, can scarcely be said to be altogether &lsquo;beside the point.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">ei) doi/h a)/n</foreign>, see Appendix on <foreign lang="greek">ei) du/nait'  a)/n</foreign>, c.20.5, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">On</hi> <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> <hi rend="italic">with Optative after certain particles</hi>&rsquo; [printed at the end of the notes to this Book]. </p>
						<p>In conformity with the explanation there given, <foreign lang="greek">doi/h a)/n</foreign>, the conditional, is joined with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, just as the future might be, of which in fact the conditional (as the <hi rend="italic">tense</hi> is in French and Italian) is a mere modification. </p>
						<p>The first example, from an unknown Tragic poet (Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Tragic. Gr.</hi> III 186), warns us that &lsquo;Heaven bestows on many great successes or prosperity, which it offers not out of good will, with no kind or benevolent intent, but that the disasters that they (afterwards) meet with may be more marked and conspicuous&rsquo;&mdash;a contrast of the apparent with the real intention, from which an inference may be drawn and applied to a parallel case. Victorius compares Caes. de B. G. I 14 (ad Helvet. legatum) <hi rend="italic">Consuesse deos immortales, quo gravius homines ex commutatione rerum doleant, quos pro scelere eorum ulcisci velint, his secundiores interdum res et diuturniorem impunitatem concedere.</hi> [Cf. Claudian's <hi rend="italic">tolluntur in altum, ut lapsu graviore ruant</hi> (in Rufinum I. 22, 23).] <pb n="283"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And another from Antiphon's Meleager&rsquo;. Referred to above, II 2. 19, where some account is given of the author, and the story of his play. The author of the Meleager is Antiphon the <hi rend="italic">Tragic</hi> poet. See also note on II 23. 5, where the lines quoted are probably from some play. Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Tr. Gr.</hi> III 113. Antiph. Fr. 3. Conf. Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Com. Gr.</hi> I 315. He suggests <foreign lang="greek">ka/nwsi</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">kta/nwsi</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">kai/nein</foreign> is found several times in Soph., twice in Aesch., and once in Xen. Cyrop.): Gaisford, <hi rend="italic">Not.

Fortissimi quique Graecorum heroes (ita fere apud poetam fuisse videtur) convenerunt, non quo ipsi aprum Calydonium interficiant, sed ut Meleagri virtutem Graecis testificentur.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>A third from Theodectes' Ajax (Aj. Frag. 1, Wagner, u. s., p. 118); cited again &sect; 24, and III 15. 10, where the same passage of the play is referred to. It is there employed in illustration of the interpretation of a fact or a motive, favourable or unfavourable according to the requirements of the argument; exactly as in the topic now under consideration. Ar. there explains in much plainer terms its use and application: <foreign lang="greek">koino\n de\ tw=| diaba/llonti kai\ tw=| a)poluome/nw|, e)peidh\ to\ au)to\ e)nde/xetai pleio/nwn e(/neka praxqh=nai, tw=| me\n diaba/llonti kakohqiste/on e)pi\ to\ xei=ron e)klamba/nonti</foreign> (putting an unfavourable construction upon the act and its motive), <foreign lang="greek">tw=| de\ a)poluome/nw| e)pi\ to\ beltion</foreign> (the reverse). The same explanation will apply to both quotations alike. Theodectes' play contained no doubt a rhetorical contest&mdash;which would be quite in his manner, like Ovid's&mdash; between Ajax and Ulysses for the arms of Achilles, in which the argument from the construction of motives would be applied to the fact, by the competitors, in the two opposite senses. Ulysses would refer to the &lsquo;preference&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">proei/leto</foreign> occurs in both the passages), shewing a sense of his superior merit, implied by Diomede when he chose him out of all the Greeks to be his companion in the hazardous exploring expedition to Troy by night (Hom. Il. K. 227 seq. Ovid. Met. XIII 238 seq. <hi rend="italic">Est aliquid de tot Graiorum millibus unum A Diomede legi</hi>, line 241); Ajax would retort that this was not the real motive of Diomede's choice, but it was that &lsquo;the attendant might be inferior to himself&rsquo; (II 23. 20) or (as it is expressed in III 15. 10,) &lsquo;because he alone was too mean to be his rival&rsquo;, to compete with him in his achievements, and to share in the renown to be thereby acquired. </p>

						<p>Top. XX. &lsquo;Another, common to counsellors (in deliberative rhet.) as well as the two parties in forensic pleadings&rsquo;. This seems to imply that the preceding topic is confined to the forensic branch; and to this, of the three, it is no doubt, most applicable; the suggestion and construction of motives and intentions being there most of all in request. Still in an encounter of two opponents in the public assembly, as in that of Dem. and Aesch., it is almost equally available; and in the remaining branch even more so, as a topic of panegyric or censure. The present topic, like the five preceding, with the partial exception of Top. XV, which appears also amongst the &lsquo;fallacies&rsquo; of the de Soph. El., is applicable to Rhetoric alone and does not appear in the dialectical treatise. </p>
						<p>It embraces arguments, which may be used in the deliberative kind in exhorting to some act or course of policy, or dissuading from it; and in judicial practice in the way of accusation or defence; in which &lsquo;we have to inquire, first what are the motives and incentives to action, and what things on the contrary deter men from acting. The things which, if they be on our side or are favourable to us, <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n u(pa/rxh|</foreign>, supply motives for action, are such as possibility, facility, advantage, either to self or friends, (of accomplishing or effecting anything); or anything injurious (hurtful, damaging: that is, the power of injuring) and&rsquo; (bringing loss <hi rend="italic">upon</hi>, on this form of adj. see note on I 4.9) &lsquo;involving loss to enemies, or (if or when) the (legal) penalty (for doing something) is less than the thing (that is, the thing done, the success of the deed and the profit of it&rsquo;, (&lsquo;fructus voluptasque quae inde percipitur&rsquo;: &lsquo;quod cupiebant quod sequebantur et optabant.&rsquo; Victorius). The construction of the last words, <foreign lang="greek">h)\ e)lattwn h( zhmi/a tou= pra/gmatos</foreign> seems to be, if <hi rend="italic">construction</hi> it can be called, that <foreign lang="greek">h( zhmi/a</foreign> is continued as an apposition to the preceding nominatives; &lsquo;the penalty being less than the profit&rsquo; is another incentive to action. &lsquo;From such cases as these, arguments of exhortation or encouragement are drawn, dissuasive from their contraries (impossibility, difficulty, disadvantage, injury, &amp;c.). From these same are derived arguments for accusation and defence: from dissuasives or deterrents, of defence; from persuasives, of accusation&rsquo;. That is to say, in defending a client from a charge of wrong-doing, you collect all the difficulties, dangers, disadvantages and so on, to which the accused would be exposed in doing what he is charged with, and <hi rend="italic">infer</hi> from them the improbability of his guilt: in accusing, you urge all or any of the opposite incitements to commit a crime, above enumerated. To these last, the inducements to the com<pb n="285"/> mission of crime, may be added the topic <hi rend="italic">cui bono</hi>, &lsquo;Cassianum illud&rsquo; [Cic. Phil. II &sect; 35]. Compare with this the passage upon the various motives and inducements to crime and wrong-doing, in I 10. 5 seq., which is there mixed up with a general classification of all sources and causes of action. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And of this topic the entire &ldquo;art&rdquo; of Pamphilus and Callippus is made up&rsquo;. Of Callippus it has been already stated, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> &sect; 14, that nothing is known but these two notices of Aristotle. It is likely, as I have there pointed out [pp. 271&mdash;2], that he was one of the earliest pupils of Isocrates mentioned in his <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/dosis</foreign>, &sect; 93. </p>
						<p>Pamphilus, the rhetorician, is mentioned by Cicero, de Orat. III 21. 82, together with Corax, in somewhat contemptuous terms, <hi rend="italic">Pamphilum nescio quem</hi>, and of his Rhetoric, it is said, (tantam rem) <hi rend="italic">tamquam pueriles delicias aliquas depingere.</hi> It is plain therefore that Pamphilus, like Callippus, belonged to the early school of Rhetoricians of the age of Gorgias and the Sophists, and treated his art like them in a &lsquo;puerile&rsquo; and unworthy manner. Another, and very brief notice of him occurs in Quintilian, III 6. 34, a chapter on the <hi rend="italic">status</hi> or <foreign lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign>; he rejected <hi rend="italic">finitio</hi>, the <foreign lang="greek">o(rikh\ sta/sis</foreign>. Spalding in his note describes the contents of Pamphilus' &lsquo;art&rsquo; from the passage of the Rhet., and then discusses, without coming to a conclusion, the question whether or no this Pamphilus can be identified with a painter of the same name, mentioned in Quint. XII 10. 6, Pliny in several places, and Aristoph. Plut. 385, and the Schol. Spalding has no doubt that Quint.'s Pamphilus, III 6. 34, is the rhetorician. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Art. Script.</hi> p. 149, note 83, thinks that he cannot be the same as Aristotle's, (erat itaque ille P. non ante Hermagorae tempora,) in consequence of his acquaintance with <foreign lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign>, which were of much later invention, and the name of them unknown even to Ar. The same doubt occurred to myself: but I laid the evil spirit by the consideration that though Aristotle was unacquainted with the technical terms and classification of the <foreign lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign>, he yet was familiar with the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>, which he frequently refers to; and the <hi rend="italic">technical expression</hi> may belong to Quintilian and not to Pamphilus. Nine times the name of Pamphilus occurs in the Orators, (Sauppe, Ind. Nom. p. 109, ad <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> vol. III,) but the rhetorician is not among them. </p>

						<p>Top. XXI. The object of this topic is (says Brandis, u. s., p. 20) to weaken the force of arguments from probability. &ldquo;In incredibilibus provocatur ad effectum, qui si conspicuus sit, resisti non potest quin, quod incredibile videbatur, iam probabile quoque esse fateamur.&rdquo; Schrader. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another (class of arguments) is derived from things which are believed to come to pass (<foreign lang="greek">gi/gnesqai</foreign>, actually to take place or happen) <pb n="286"/> but (still) are beyond (ordinary) belief, (you argue, namely) that they would not have been believed at all, had they not actually been or nearly so&rsquo;: i. e. either <hi rend="italic">been</hi> in existence, or come so near to it, made so near an approach to it, as to enable us by a slight stretch of imagination to realize it so as to be convinced of its existence. Any case of very close analogy, for instance, to the thing in question might produce this conviction. <foreign lang="greek">h)\ e)ggu/s</foreign> is a saving clause; &lsquo;fact or nearly so&rsquo;. Rhetorical argument does not aim at absolute truth and certainty: it is content with a near approach to it within the sphere of the probable, which is enough for complete persuasion. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Nay even more&rsquo;, (we may further argue that these at first sight incredible things are even <hi rend="italic">more</hi> likely to be true than those that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> at first sight probable. Supply <foreign lang="greek">dokou=nta/ e)sti</foreign> for the constr. and (<foreign lang="greek">ma=llon</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">a)lhqh=</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">o)/nta e)sti/ tw=n ei)ko/twn kai\ piqanw=n</foreign> for the sense): &lsquo;because men believe in (suppose, assume the existence of,) things either actual, real or probable: if then it (the thing in question) be incredible and not probable, it must be true; because its probability and plausibility are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the ground of our belief in it&rsquo;. The argument of the last clause is an exemplification of Topic IX, &sect; 10, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, see note there. It is an inference <foreign lang="greek">e)k diaire/sews</foreign>, &lsquo;from division&rsquo;; a <hi rend="italic">disjunctive judgment.</hi> All belief is directed to the true <hi rend="italic">or</hi> the probable: there is no other alternative. All that is believed&mdash;and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is believed&mdash;must therefore be either true or probable: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not probable; therefore it must be true. <foreign lang="greek">a)lhqe/s</foreign> <hi rend="italic">more antiquae philosophiae</hi> identifies truth and being: <foreign lang="greek">a)lhqe/s</foreign> here = <foreign lang="greek">o)/n</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In other words, the antecedent improbability of anything may furnish a still stronger argument for its reality than its probability. Anything absolutely incredible is denied at once, unless there be some unusually strong evidence of its being a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, however paradoxical. That the belief of it is actually entertained is the strongest proof that it is a fact: for since no one would have supposed it to be true without the strongest evidence, the evidence of it, of whatever kind, must be unusually strong. The instance given is an exemplification of the topic in its first and simplest form. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As Androcles of Pitthus&rsquo; (or Pithus, whence <foreign lang="greek">o( *piqeu/s</foreign>; an Attic deme, of the tribe Cecropis) &lsquo;replied in the charge he brought against the law, to the clamour with which he was assailed by them&rsquo; (the assembly, before which he was arraigning the existing state of the law) &lsquo;for saying &ldquo;the laws require a law to correct them and set them right&rdquo; which they thought highly improbable&mdash;&ldquo;why so do fish require salt (to keep them from corruption), though it is neither probable nor plausible that bred as they are in brine (the salt sea) they should require salt: and so does <pb n="287"/> oil-cake&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">ste/mfula</foreign>, the cake or mass of olives remaining after the oil has been pressed out) &lsquo;require oil (for the same reason), though it is highly improbable that the very thing that produces oil should require oil itself&rsquo;. Here we have an improbable statement which is shewn by two close analogies to be after all very near (<foreign lang="greek">e)ggu/s</foreign>) the truth. </p>
						<p>Of Androcles, and the time and circumstances of his proposed alteration of the laws, nothing is known but what appears in our text. The names of three Androcleses occur in the Orators, (Sauppe, Ind. Nom. p. 13, <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III) of which the first, mentioned by Andocides <foreign lang="greek">peri\ musthri/wn</foreign> &sect; 27, may possibly be the speaker here referred to. The Androcles of Thuc. VIII 65, (comp. Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> VIII 43 [c. LXII], Plut. Alcib. c. 19,) the accuser and opponent of Alcibiades, assassinated in 411 B. C. by the agents of Pisander and the oligarchical party, is most likely identical with Andocides; the time of the events referred to in both authors being nearly the same. I think upon the whole that it is not improbable that Thucydides, Andocides and Aristotle may mean the same person<note anchored="yes">The writer of the Article <hi rend="italic">Androcles</hi>, in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi>, has no doubt upon this point. He says on this passage, &ldquo;Ar. has preserved a sentence from one of Androcles' speeches, <hi rend="italic">in which he used an incorrect figure!</hi>&rdquo;.</note>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ste/mfula</lemma>] Ar. Nub. 45, Equit. 806, was a common article of food in Attica. It denoted not only the cake of pressed olives, but also of grapes from which the juice had been squeezed. Phrynichus, s. v., has <foreign lang="greek">oi( me\n polloi\ ta\ tw=n botru/wn e)kpie/smata a)maqw=s: oi( d'  *)attikoi/ ste/mfula e)law=n</foreign>.

Lobeck, note. Lobeck settles the matter by quoting Geoponic. VI 12. 435, <foreign lang="greek">ei)de/nai xrh\ o(/ti ste/mfula ou)x, w(/s tines nomi/zousi, tw=n e)laiw=n mo/non e)sti\ purh=nes, a)lla\ kai\ ta\ tw=n stafulw=n gi/garta</foreign>. (<foreign lang="greek">purh=nes</foreign> must surely be a mistake; no amount of pressing could ever convert grape-stones or olive-kernels into an <foreign lang="greek">o)/yon</foreign>, a dainty or relish, and moreover what is here said, that the oil proceeds from the <foreign lang="greek">ste/mfula</foreign>, shews that the cake is made of the olives themselves, and not of the mere stones.)

						<p>&lsquo;Another, for&rsquo; (the benefit of; the <hi rend="italic">dative</hi> seems to follow <foreign lang="greek">le/gein</foreign>;) &lsquo;those that have been previously brought into suspicion or odium, (whether by actual calumny) or suspected&rsquo; (thought to be, having the appearance of being, <foreign lang="greek">dokou=si</foreign>, guilty of something wrong, for some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> reason &mdash;so Vater, reading <foreign lang="greek">h)\ dokou=si</foreign>), &lsquo;both men and things, is to state the reason for the (otherwise) unaccountable circumstance: for there must be <hi rend="italic">some</hi> reason (<foreign lang="greek">di) o(/</foreign> is the <foreign lang="greek">ai)ti/a</foreign>,) for this appearance (of guilt)&rsquo;. MS A^{c} has <foreign lang="greek">mh\ dokou=si</foreign>, which Victorius adopts and defends. All the recent edd. have <foreign lang="greek">h)/</foreign>. Victorius understands by <foreign lang="greek">mh\ dokou=si</foreign> a qualification of <foreign lang="greek">prodiabeblhme/nois</foreign>, to express the unexpected, apparently unreasonable, nature <pb n="289"/> of the calumny or suspicion, which seems to be quite unsuitable to the character and circumstances of the object of it: &ldquo;quae tamen nullo modo haerere ipsis videatur, quod alienae ab ea sint.&rdquo; This agrees extremely well with the <foreign lang="greek">parado/cou</foreign> following, and this reading and explanation is deserving at all events of consideration. It supposes <hi rend="italic">only one</hi> case to be contemplated, that of <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> suspicion and consequent calumny. Vater on the contrary thinks that there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> cases intended, direct calumny, and suspicion <hi rend="italic">for any other reason;</hi> and that this requires <foreign lang="greek">h)\ dokou=si</foreign>. His transl. is, &ldquo;Homines significantur, qui propter calumniam vel alia de caussa videantur aliquo modo affecti esse.&rdquo; This is not very clear; but I suppose his meaning to be what I have said. In this case we must understand <foreign lang="greek">a)dikh=sai</foreign>, or something equivalent, after <foreign lang="greek">dokou=si</foreign>. Spengel, in his recent edition, says that Victorius' reading and interpretation is refuted by the sense of the passage&mdash;which I cannot agree with&mdash;and that <foreign lang="greek">diabeblh=sqai</foreign> must be understood after <foreign lang="greek">h)\ dokou=sin</foreign>. But what is the meaning of &lsquo;apparent&rsquo; calumny? and how is it distinguished from the other? </p>
						<p>There is another point which has hitherto escaped observation, viz. the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">kai\ a)nqrw/pois kai\ pra/gmasi</foreign>. Victorius interprets it as in apposition to <foreign lang="greek">toi=s diabeblhme/nois</foreign>, &lsquo;qui valet ad purgandas aliquas et personas et res,&rsquo; which at first sight seems the most natural and obvious explanation, and I have adopted it in my translation. But then, what are the <hi rend="italic">things</hi> that can be calumniated or brought under suspicion? One might suppose that it means human actions: but Victorius renders it <hi rend="italic">res;</hi> and in fact actions are necessarily included in <foreign lang="greek">toi=s diabeblhme/nois</foreign>; they are <hi rend="italic">the</hi> things that are subject to misinterpretation; and therefore there is no ground for a distinction between <hi rend="italic">men</hi> and their <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>, so far at least as they are subject to calumny. I will venture to suggest, though not with complete confidence, that we might give the words a different construction, and understand them thus, &ldquo;for the benefit of those who have been unjustly&mdash;we must in this case read <foreign lang="greek">mh\ dokou=sin</foreign>, unlikely to be guilty&mdash;subjected to suspicion, <hi rend="italic">by</hi> men (by human agency, directly) or by circumstances&rdquo; (indirectly; which would be equivalent to Vater's second case). At all events it makes very good sense. </p>
						<p>We now come to a still greater difficulty, the interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">u(pobeblhme/nhs</foreign> in the example. A^{c} reads <foreign lang="greek">diabeblhme/nhs tino\s pro\s to\n ui(o/n</foreign> &lsquo;when a certain woman had been brought into suspicion with respect to (i. e. as to her conduct or dealings with) her son&rsquo;, which gives a very sufficient sense, but is rejected by Victorius as well as Bekker and Spengel and modern editors in general. </p>
						<p>Victorius' rendering&mdash;and no other Commentary that I have seen has a word on the subject&mdash;is as follows; I must give it in his own words as it will hardly bear translation. &ldquo;Ceu cum mater quaedam filium subiisset, corporique ipsius corpus suum supposuisset, ut commode eum osculari posset, in eo habitu corporis spectata visa est stuprum cum adolescente exercere.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">u(pobeblhme/nhs</foreign> is translated literally. <pb n="290"/> </p>
						<p>I see no other meaning that can be attached to the words as the text at present stands, but it must be observed that <foreign lang="greek">u(pobeblhme/nhs to\n au(th=s vi(o/n</foreign> is very strange Greek for <hi rend="italic">supposuisse filium corpori suo</hi>, and I do not see how it can be justified. The accus after <foreign lang="greek">u(poba/llein</foreign> represents not the thing <hi rend="italic">under which</hi> you throw something, but the thing that you <hi rend="italic">throw under</hi> something else: and the <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> <foreign lang="greek">u(pobeblhme/nhs</foreign> meaning &lsquo;throwing herself under&rsquo;, is possible perhaps, but by no means usual, Greek. The ordinary construction of <foreign lang="greek">u(poba/llein</foreign> with two objects, appears in these examples. The object <hi rend="italic">thrown</hi> is in the accus.; the object under which it is thrown is either in the dat. or has a prepos. introduced before it. <foreign lang="greek">u(poba/llein pleuroi=s pleura/</foreign>, Eur. Or. 223, <foreign lang="greek">u(pob. a)mfi\ masto\n spodo/n</foreign>, Suppl. 1160. Xen. Oecon. 18. 5, <foreign lang="greek">u(p. ta\ a)/tripta u(po\ tou\s po)das</foreign>. Plut.

On the genit. <foreign lang="greek">u(pobeblhme/nhs</foreign> see note on II 8. 10. </p>
						<p>The general meaning of the whole is, that a mother had been seen in this position which she had assumed for the purpose of embracing her <hi rend="italic">own son</hi>&mdash;which was not known to the witness&mdash;was accordingly subjected to the suspicion of illicit intercourse with him: and we are to suppose further, that her character hitherto had been unimpeachable: when the true reason was explained or stated, the calumny was at once quashed (dissolved or unloosed as a knot).

Cicero, Top. &sect;&sect; 58&mdash;67, treats of cause in general and its varieties: but has nothing exactly corresponding to this, though he speaks of the great importance of the general topic to orators (65&mdash;7).

						<p>&lsquo;Leodamas, for instance, said in his defence, when charged by Thrasybulus with having had his name inscribed on the column (as a mark of infamy) in the Acropolis, only he had struck (or cut) it out in the time of &lsquo;the Thirty&rsquo;, replied that it was impossible; for the Thirty could have trusted him more if the record of his hatred of the <hi rend="italic">people</hi> had remained engraved on the column&rsquo;. The fact is denied on the ground of the absence of a <hi rend="italic">sufficient cause:</hi> an example of the second case, the negative application of the topic, <foreign lang="greek">a)\n mh\ u(pa/rxh|</foreign>. </p>
						<p>On Leodamas, see on I 7. 13, and the reff. Sauppe, ad Orat. Fragm. XVI, <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III 216, thinks it impossible that the two Leodamases mentioned by Ar., here and I 7. 13, can be the same [&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">mit Recht</hi>&rsquo;, A. Schaefer, <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit.</hi> I p. 129 <hi rend="italic">n.</hi>]. He argues that the Leodamas whose name was inscribed on the column as a &lsquo;traitor&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">in proditorum indice inscr.</hi>), according to Thrasybulus, before the domination of the Thirty, that is, not later than 404 B. C. (he says 405), when he must have been about thirty years old<note anchored="yes">Je n'en vois pas la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;.</note>, could not have been the Leodamas mentioned by Demosth. c. Lept. &sect; 146, as one of the Syndics under the Leptinean law, in 355 B.C., and consequently, that the latter, the famous orator of Acharnae, must have been a different person, because he would then have been nearly 90. Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> II 111, sub anno 372&mdash;3, merely says, quoting Rhet. II 23. 25, &ldquo;From this incident it appears that Leodamas was already grown up and capable of the duties of a citizen in B.C. 404, which shews him far advanced in years at the time of the cause of Leptines, in B.C. 355.&rdquo; And this appears to me to be a sufficient account of the matter. Thrasybulus' accusation of Leodamas is mentioned likewise by Lysias, c. Evandr. &sect; 13, et seq. </p>
						<p>The circumstances referred to in this accusation and defence, and the meaning and intention of the inscription which Leodamas is said to have effaced, are not quite clear. The use of the <foreign lang="greek">sth/lh</foreign> or pillar here referred to was twofold: the object of it in either case was the same, to perpetuate the memory of some act or character to all future time. But the fact or character commemorated might be either good or evil; and in the former case it was the name of a public benefactor, in the latter of some signal malefactor or public enemy, that was inscribed. It is usual to apply the latter explanation to the case here in question, which is probably what is meant; and then it seems the story must be this:&mdash;At some uncertain time previous to the expulsion of the thirty tyrants and their Lacedaemonian supporters by Thrasybulus and his friends, the recovery of the city, and restoration of the demus in 403 B.C., the name of Leodamas had been inscribed as a mark of infamy&mdash;as a traitor to his country, as Sauppe u. s. and Herm. <hi rend="italic">Pol. Ant.</hi> &sect; 144. 11 interpret it&mdash;according to custom on a pillar erected in the Acropolis for that purpose. Now if it was &lsquo;hatred to the demus&rsquo; that was engraved on it (<foreign lang="greek">e)ggegramme/nhs</foreign>) as <pb n="292"/> the sign and cause of his imputed infamy, it follows that it must have been erected at some period when the popular party was in the ascendant; Leodamas of course being a supporter of the oligarchs. When his friends were in power and he had the opportunity, Thrasybulus charges him, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> of course, with having &lsquo;struck or cut it out&rsquo; to efface the record. He denies the possibility of their <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> by arguing the absence of all assignable <hi rend="italic">cause</hi>, which could have produced it: for this permanent record of his &lsquo;hostility to the people&rsquo; would have been an additional recommendation to the Thirty, who would have trusted him all the more for it. Thrasybulus, says Victorius, was accusing Leodamas of being an enemy and a traitor to his country; and one of the arguments he brought forward was the existence of this inscription, the subsequent disappearance of which he attempted to explain. He likewise cites in illustration of the use of the topic Cic. pro Mil. &sect; 32, cum ostendere vellet insidiatorem fuisse Clodium. <hi rend="italic">quonam igitur pacto probari potest insidias Miloni fecisse Clodium? satis est quidem in illa tam audaci tam nefaria bellua docere magnam ei caussam, magnam spem in Milonis morte propositam, magnas utilitates fuisse.</hi> And, as Cic. goes on to remark, this is <hi rend="italic">Cassianum illud, cui bono fuerit.</hi> </p>

This is excellently illustrated by Victorius from another passage of Cic. pro Mil. XVI 41. In retorting upon Clodius the charge of lying in wait to assassinate, he first enumerates several favourable opportunities which Milo had previously neglected to avail himself of, and asks whether it was likely that, having acted thus, he should now choose an occasion when time and circumstances were so much less favourable, to carry out such a design: <hi rend="italic">Quem igitur cum omnium gratia noluit</hi> (occidere), <hi rend="italic">hunc voluit cum aliquorum querela? quem iure, quem loco, quem tempore, quem impune non est ausus, hunc iniuria, iniquo loco, alieno tempore, periculo capitis, non dubitavit occidere?</hi> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;For instance, in Carcinus' Medea, the one party (of the disputants in the play) charge her with the death of her children&mdash;at all events (say they) they no where appear: because Medea made a mistake in (in respect of) sending away her children (instead of merely sending them away, they argued that she had made away with them, since they were no where to be found): her defence is, that it was not her children, but Jason, that she would have killed (if she had killed any one); for she would have made a mistake in failing to do this, if she had done the other too&rsquo;: and of such a mistake she never could have been guilty. &ldquo;Quasi dicat, quomodo tam stulta fuissem' (how could I have made such a mistake?) &lsquo;ut innocentes filios necassem; perfidum autem coniugem e&lt;*&gt; auctorem omnium meorum malorum relinquerem?&rdquo; Victorius. </p>

						<p>Quintilian, V 10. 30, 31, thinks that an argument can seldom be drawn from a surname, except in the case of such significant names as are assigned <hi rend="italic">for a reason</hi>, as <hi rend="italic">Sapiens</hi> (Cato and Laelius), <hi rend="italic">Magnus</hi> (Pompey), and <hi rend="italic">Plenus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">?</hi>): or where the name is not significant, but suggests a crime&mdash;as the name Cornelius, in the case of Lentulus, was suggestive of conspiracy (for a reason there given). The use of the name recommended by Aristotle's topic (which he does not mention) is pronounced, in the case of Euripides&mdash;who represents Eteocles as attacking the name of his brother Polynices, <foreign lang="greek">polu\ nei=kos</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ut argumentum morum</hi>&mdash; as insipid and tasteless, <hi rend="italic">frigidum.</hi> It is however &lsquo;a frequent material for jokes; especially in the hands of Cicero, who freely employs it, as in the case of Verres&rsquo;.

It is singular therefore that Elmsley, who had certainly studied the Greek dramatists with care and attention, should, on Bacch. 508, after citing a number of examples, end his note with this almost incredible observation, &ldquo;Haec non modo <foreign lang="greek">yuxra/</foreign> sunt&rdquo; (is the epithet borrowed from Quintilian?), &ldquo;verum etiam tragicos malos fuisse grammaticos. Quid enim commune habent <foreign lang="greek">*)apo/llwn</foreign> et <foreign lang="greek">a)pollu/nai</foreign> praeter soni similitudinem?&rdquo; And this is all that is suggested by Ajax's pathetic exclamation, <foreign lang="greek">ai)= ai)= ti/s a)/n pot'  w)/|et) k.t.l.</foreign> Soph. Aj. 430, and the rest! Elmsley has omitted Aesch. S. c. T. 658, <foreign lang="greek">e)pwnu/mw| de\ ka/rta *polunei/kh le/gw</foreign>, from his list; and Eur. Antiope, Fr. 1 (Dind., Wagner), and Fragm. 2, Ibid. Agath. Fragm. Thyest. 1 ap. Wagn. <hi rend="italic">Fr. Tr. Gr.</hi> III 74. Add from other sources, Dante <hi rend="italic">Div. Com.

The king asks, <hi rend="italic">Can sick men play so nicely with their names? No</hi>, is the reply, <hi rend="italic">misery makes sport to mock itself</hi>, &amp;c.: which is not a bad answer to Elmsley's objection. This tracing of the character or destiny in the name is particularly common in the Hebrew of the Old Test., as the well-known instance of Genesis xxvii. 36, &lsquo;Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath <hi rend="italic">supplanted</hi> me these two times.&rsquo; The practice, which seems to be a suggestion of nature itself, is thus shewn to have prevailed in various times, nations and languages. </p>

It may perhaps refer to the &lsquo;significant names&rsquo; derived from their attributes or occupations, by which deities are designated, and which as special distinctions would naturally occur in the hymns addressed to them. These may sometimes be substituted for their proper names, and may furnish <hi rend="italic">arguments of praise.</hi> </p>
						<p>The Conon and Thrasybulus here mentioned are doubtless, as may be inferred from the absence of any special designation, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Conon, the victor of Cnidus (394 B. C.), and <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Thrasybulus, the expeller of the Thirty and restorer of the demus in 403: though there are several others bearing both of these names in Sauppe's <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad Or. Att.</hi> III. pp. 63, 4, 81, 2. Thrasybulus is named by Demosth., de Cor. &sect; 219, as one of the most distinguished orators among his predecessors, together with Callistratus, Aristophon, and Cephalus; the two first of these we have had mentioned in the Rhetoric. In de F. L. &sect; 320, he is called <foreign lang="greek">tou= dhmotikou=</foreign> (the popular Thrasybulus, the people's friend, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ tou= a)po\ *fulh=s katagago/ntos to\n dh=mon</foreign>. Conon and he were contemporaries. Conon died soon after 392 B. C., Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H. sub anno</hi> 388. 3, Thrasybulus, &ldquo;perhaps in the beginning of B.C. 389.&rdquo; Ib. <hi rend="italic">sub anno</hi> 390. His name, according to Conon, fitly represented the <hi rend="italic">rashness</hi> of his <hi rend="italic">counsels</hi> and character. Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> IX 509 [chap. LXXV.], in describing the character of Thrasybulus, omits to notice this. </p>
						<p>In like manner the name of Thrasymachus, the rhetorician, is significant of the <hi rend="italic">hardihood</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pugnacity</hi> which were combined in his character. The sketch given of him in the first book of Plato's Republic is in exact correspondence with this. &ldquo;Always true to your name,&rdquo; rash and combative, said Herodicus to him, doubtless provoked by some rudeness of the Sophist in the course of a dialectical disputation. There were two Herodicuses, both physicians; see note on I 5. 10. Doubtless this again is the <hi rend="italic">better known</hi> of the two, Herodicus of Selymbria in Thrace; of whose medical practice Plato gives an account, Rep. III 406 A seq. In a similar dispute with Polus, another Sophist and Rhetorician, (whose character, in perfect agreement with this, is likewise sketched by Plato in his Gorgias, where he is said to be <foreign lang="greek">ne/os kai\ o)cu/s</foreign><note anchored="yes">[p. 463 E.] A very brief summary of the leading points of Polus' character as he appears in the Gorgias, is given amongst the &lsquo;dramatis personae&rsquo; of the Introd. to transl. of Gorg. p. lxxvii.</note>,) Herodicus again reminds him of the significance of his name, &ldquo;Colt by <pb n="299"/> name and colt by nature<note anchored="yes">This most ingenious rendering was given by Dr Thompson, then Greek Professor, in a lecture delivered Feb. 6, 1854. [Introd. to ed. of Gorg. p. v.]</note>.&rdquo; And lastly this inveterate punster applies the same process to &lsquo;Dracon the legislator&rsquo;, declaring &lsquo;that his laws were not those of a man, but of <hi rend="italic">a dragon;</hi> so cruel were they&rsquo;. Aristotle, Pol. II 12 <hi rend="italic">sub finem</hi>, says of Draco's laws, that they had nothing peculiar, but <foreign lang="greek">h( xalepo/ths, dia\ to\ th=s zhmi/as me/geqos</foreign>. Nearly every offence was made punishable with death. Hence Demades said of them that they &ldquo;were written not in ink, but in blood.&rdquo; Plut. Sol. 17. Tzetzes, Chil. 5, line 342 sqq. ap.

						<p>The verse that follows is from Eur.'s Troades 990, where Hecuba is answering Helen, who had been arguing the invincible power of Love. &ldquo;All follies are to mortals Aphrodite&rdquo; (are attributed by men to this passion, &lsquo;take the form of Aphrodite&rsquo; in their fancy), &lsquo;and rightly does the goddess' name begin the word <foreign lang="greek">a)frosu/nh.&rsquo; *)afrodi/th</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">*)afrosu/nh</foreign> have the first half of the word in common. </p>

						<p>Probably from Chaeremon's Dionysus, quoted three times in Athenaeus (Elms. ad Eur. Bacch. 508), and also probably, like the Bacchae, on the story of Pentheus.

						<p>The chapter concludes with two observations on enthymemes in general. First, &lsquo;Enthymemes of refutation are more popular and applauded than those of demonstration, because the former is <hi rend="italic">a conclusion of opposites</hi>&rsquo; (the def. of <foreign lang="greek">e)/legxos</foreign>; see Introd. p. 262, note 1) &lsquo;in a small space (or narrow compass), and things are always made clearer to the listener by being placed side by side (close together, so as to admit of immediate comparison)&rsquo;. This is repeated in nearly the same words, III 17. 13. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But of all syllogisms destructive or constructive, such are most applauded as those of which the results are at once (at the very begining, of the argument) foreseen: not because they are superficial (<foreign lang="greek">e)pipolh=s</foreign>, I 15. 22, note ad loc., II 16 1)&mdash;for they (the hearers &lsquo;are pleased themselves also with themselves at the same time&rsquo;) are pleased (not only with the speaker and his enthymeme, but) with themselves also (<foreign lang="greek">a(/ma</foreign>) for their sagacity in anticipating the conclusion: (and therefore they <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> think it superficial)&mdash;and those which they are only just so far behind&mdash;which they can so nearly keep pace with&mdash;as to understand them (step by step) as they are delivered&rsquo;. </p>

					<p>In the preceding chapter a selection has been given of the topics or special classes of enthymemes which are most appropriate and serviceable in the practice of Rhetoric: and these are <foreign lang="greek">ta\ o)/nta e)nqumh/mata</foreign>, c. 24. 11, ult., sound, genuine, logical inferences. But besides these there are, in Rhetoric as well as Dialectics, arguments apparent but not real, fallacious, illogical, which are often employed to mislead and deceive. Now, although we are to abstain from the use of these ourselves, <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r dei= ta\ fau=la pei/qein</foreign>, I 1. 12, it is necessary for the rhetorician to be thoroughly acquainted with them, in order to detect them in others and to refute any unfair reasoning which may be employed against him, (ibidem): and so vindicate the superiority of truth and right to falsehood and wrong. And accordingly we have in the following chapter a selection of the most prominent rhetorical fallacies, and in c. 25 the solution of them; corresponding respectively to the two parts of the de Soph. El. (cc. 1&mdash;15; 16, to the end), which in like manner is appended as a sequel to the Topics in which is expounded and illustrated the genuine and artistic method of the employment of the dialectical syllogism. On Fallacies in <pb n="301"/> general, see Grote's Plato, <hi rend="italic">Euthydemus</hi>, Vol. I. c. xix [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> c.X.] and J. S. Mill, <hi rend="italic">System of Logic</hi>, Vol. II. Bk. V. Whately, <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>, ch. V. </p>
					<p>In the Topics, (de Soph. El.) c. 4, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 23, fallacious arguments are classified under two heads, <foreign lang="greek">para\ th\n le/cin</foreign>, fallacies of language, <hi rend="italic">verbal</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">e)/cw th=s le/cews</foreign>, non-verbal, beyond the sphere of, not dependent upon mere <hi rend="italic">words; logical</hi> fallacies. &ldquo;Alterum vitium positum est in prava verborum interpretatione (<hi rend="italic">wort-verdrehung</hi>), alterum in falsa argumentatione (<hi rend="italic">schluss-fehler</hi>).&rdquo; Waitz ad loc. 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 23. <foreign lang="greek">e)/cw th=s le/cews</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">die</hi> &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">welche in den ausdruck ihren grund nicht haben.</hi>&rdquo; Brandis, u. s.

Verbal fallacies are six in number: (1) <foreign lang="greek">o(mwnumi/a</foreign>, equivocal, ambiguous, <hi rend="italic">terms</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">to\ pleonaxw=s lego/menon</foreign>; (2) <foreign lang="greek">a)mfiboli/a</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">general</hi> ambiguity in <hi rend="italic">language</hi>, ambiguous <hi rend="italic">expressions</hi>, &ldquo;ambiguous <hi rend="italic">propositions</hi>,&rdquo; Poste; (these two may be distinguished as here; or, as in Poet. XXV 21, identified, under the one general term <foreign lang="greek">a)mfiboli/a</foreign>, &lsquo;ambiguity in expression&rsquo;: in the explanation of them, Top. u. s. 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14 seq., we have <foreign lang="greek">h)\ o( lo/gos</foreign> the proposition, or combination of words, <foreign lang="greek">h)\ tou)/noma</foreign>, the single word, the <foreign lang="greek">o(mw/numon</foreign>); (3) <foreign lang="greek">su/nqesis</foreign> and (4) <foreign lang="greek">diai/resis</foreign>, explained and illustrated Top. ibid. 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 22&mdash;38, illicit combination and separation of words; (5) <foreign lang="greek">prosw|di/a</foreign>, accent, pronunciation&mdash;which is of more use in criticising written composition, especially poetry; in Dialectics, where there is no written text, <foreign lang="greek">a)/neu grafh=s</foreign>, it is of little or none. Ibid. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1; and (6th and last), <foreign lang="greek">para\ to\ sxh=ma th=s le/cews</foreign>, &lsquo;in figura dictionis,&rsquo; Waitz, fallacies or ambiguities, arising from the confusion of (assuming the apparent for the real,) different categories&mdash;&ldquo;categories, that is, in their <hi rend="italic">grammatical</hi> acceptation, as predicates, or a classification of the parts of speech; when, owing to similarity of (grammatical) form, a thing is referred to the wrong category&rdquo; (Waitz, note ad loc.). And as this difference of categorical predication is expressed in the <hi rend="italic">termination</hi> of words, it may be otherwise represented as &ldquo;a similarity (or identity) of termination,&rdquo; which leads to fallacy (Poste, Transl. of de Soph. El.). Thus the termination <foreign lang="greek">-ein</foreign> (which marks the infinitive of a verb) in <foreign lang="greek">u(giai/nein</foreign> implies &lsquo;some quality or disposition of a thing&rsquo;, (as we say, it is a <hi rend="italic">neuter</hi> verb), i. e. belongs to the category of <foreign lang="greek">poio/ths e)/xein</foreign>: in <foreign lang="greek">te/mnein</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">oi)kodomei=n</foreign>, it implies action, <foreign lang="greek">poiei=n</foreign>; i. e. it is an active verb; belongs to the category of <foreign lang="greek">poiei=n</foreign>. Similarly from a masculine noun with a feminine termination, or the reverse, and a neuter with either one or the other; Ibid. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 10&mdash;19. &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">falsche grammatische form.</hi>&rdquo; Brandis, u. s. p. 22. </p>
					<p>Of these, accent, division (probably including the opposite), and <foreign lang="greek">a)mfiboli/a</foreign>, including <foreign lang="greek">o(mwnumi/a</foreign>, are illustrated from the poets in Poet. XXV 18&mdash;20. There is a fourth, &sect; 21, <foreign lang="greek">kata\ to\ e)/qos th=s le/cews</foreign>, which may be brought under the more general topic of the dialectical treatise, <foreign lang="greek">para\ to\ sxh=ma th=s le/cews</foreign>. </p>
					<p>Of these dialectical topics four are transferred to Rhetoric: <foreign lang="greek">o(mwnumi/a</foreign>, including <foreign lang="greek">a)mfiboli/a</foreign>, &sect; 2; and <foreign lang="greek">su/nqesis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">diai/resis</foreign>, together, as one topic, &sect; 3. <foreign lang="greek">sxh=ma th=s le/cews</foreign>, &sect; 2, stands for a <hi rend="italic">fallacy of language</hi> quite different to that which bears its name in the Topics. The difference is explained in the note on &sect; 2. </p>
					<p>Fallacies <foreign lang="greek">e)/cw th=s le/cews</foreign>, in the Topics are seven. (1) <foreign lang="greek">para\ to\ sumbebhko/s</foreign>, from the confusion of subject and accident; (2) of absolute <pb n="302"/> (<foreign lang="greek">a(plw=s</foreign>) and particular or qualified (<foreign lang="greek">kata/ ti</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">ph=| h)\ pou= h)\ pote\ h)\ pro/s ti</foreign>) statements; (3) <foreign lang="greek">e)le/gxou a)/gnoia</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ignoratio elenchi</hi>, &ldquo;an inadequate notion of confutation,&rdquo; Poste, &ldquo;inscitiae eorum quae ad redarguendum pertinent,&rdquo; Waitz; (4) <foreign lang="greek">to\ e)n a)rxh=| lamba/nein</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi>, begging the question, assuming the thing to be proved; (5) <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ ai)/tion w(s ai)/tion tiqe/nai</foreign>, &ldquo;in ratione non recte reddita,&rdquo; Waitz, the assumption of not-cause for cause; (6) <foreign lang="greek">para\ to\ e(po/menon</foreign>, the assumption that antecedent and consequent are always and reciprocally convertible: that if B follows A, A must follow B. (The order of these two last is inverted in the explanation; 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1 and 21.) (7) <foreign lang="greek">to\ ta\ du/o e)rwth/mata e(\n poiei=n</foreign>, to put two (or more) questions as one, &lsquo;when it escapes observation that the question is not one but several, and one answer is returned, as though it were one&rsquo;. De Soph.

					<p>Of these (1) &sect; 6 (these two are the same only in <hi rend="italic">name;</hi> see on &sect; 6); (2) &sect;&sect; 9, 10; (5) &sect; 8; and (6) &sect; 7, occur also in the Rhetoric. <foreign lang="greek">e)k shmei/ou</foreign>, &sect; 5, falls under the head of <foreign lang="greek">ta\ e(po/mena</foreign>; de Soph.

The remaining three (3) (4) (7), are found only in the dialectical treatise. Brandis, u. s. p. 22, expresses his surprise at the omission of these three, and thinks that it argues the later date of the de Soph. El.; though of the priority of the Topics there can be no doubt. Vahlen, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Acad. Vien.</hi> Oct. 1861, p. 134, pronounces this to be very doubtful; and proceeds to argue in favour of the earlier date of composition for <hi rend="italic">both</hi> treatises. Besides these we have the purely rhetorical topic of <foreign lang="greek">dei/nwsis</foreign>, aggravation, exaggeration, &sect; 4. The paradox or fallacy, <foreign lang="greek">ei)ko\s kai\ to\ para\ to\ ei)ko/s</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">e)/stai to\ mh\ ei)ko\s ei)ko/s</foreign>, and also <foreign lang="greek">to\ to\n h(/ttw lo/gon krei/ttw poiei=n</foreign>, both come under the head of <foreign lang="greek">para\ to\ a(plw=s kai\ mh\ a(plw=s, a)lla\ ti/</foreign>, No. (2), &sect; 10. </p>

The force of the antithesis and epigram in conversation and discussion is too well known to need further illustration. I have followed Vahlen, who has discussed this sentence at length in his paper, already referred to, <hi rend="italic">zur kritik Arist. Schrift.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Trans. Acad.

He apologises for the anacoluthon, and the repetition of <foreign lang="greek">e)nqu/mhma</foreign> at the end of the sentence, and proposes two expedients for getting rid of them; unnecessarily as it seems to me: accepting the two alterations, as I have done, the sense is perfect, and the expression of it quite in character with the author's hasty and careless style. I pass over the attempted explanations of Vater and others. Victorius has given the sense correctly, though his interpretation does not adhere closely to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> text. Bekker and Spengel leave the passage unaltered. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;A fallacy of this kind seems to arise from the fashion of&rsquo; (the style <pb n="304"/> of) &lsquo;language used&rsquo;, (i. e. the periodical and antithetical construction of the sentences).

Nevertheless Victorius identifies them. Both of them may no doubt be referred to the head of fallacies of language&mdash;in its most general sense; but the dialectical topic is a mistake or misuse of the termination of single words, involving a confusion of categories; the rhetorical is <hi rend="italic">an abuse of language</hi> in a totally different application. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)\ o(/ti to\ mhde/na k.t.l.</lemma>] The meaning of this is obscure. Victorius, merely observing that this is another fallacious inference as to the value of a dog, candidly admits that he cannot explain it.

						<p>&lsquo;And to say that Hermes is the most liberal&rsquo; (communicative of good things to others (so Schrader); or &lsquo;sociable&rsquo;, communicative of himself, <hi rend="italic">superis deorum gratus et imis</hi>,) &lsquo;of all the gods; for he alone goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Common</hi> Hermes&rsquo;. The latter of the two interpretations of <foreign lang="greek">koinwniko/n</foreign> seems to be right, from the comparison of Polit.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">su/nqesis</lemma> and <foreign lang="greek">diai/resis</foreign>, &lsquo;wrong (fallacious) combination, composition, and disjunction, separation, in reading or speaking&rsquo;, which are here taken together as one form of fallacy, are two in de Soph. El. c. 4, 165 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 26, Ib. 166 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 22, and 33. The solution of them is given in c. 20, where &ldquo;Euthydemus' argument&rdquo; is also referred to, and thence no doubt transferred hither. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another is, to pronounce in combination what is (properly, or is intended to be) separated, or the reverse, the combined as separate: for since it seems to be the same either way (when combined or separated, and it is in this appearance, and the advantage taken of it, that the fallacy lies), whichever of the two happens to be more serviceable, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> must be done&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">dei=</foreign> does not here imply a moral obligation; it is not intended to recommend the practice; the only obligation is that which is imposed by the art; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you want to avail yourself of this unfair mode of reasoning (which I don't say I approve, I am only stating what the art requires), this is the way to proceed. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This is Euthydemus' argument. For instance to know that a trireme is in the Piraeus, because he knows each (of two things which are here omitted)&rsquo;. This example, which is unintelligible as it stands here, has some further light (or obscurity) thrown on it by the form in which it occurs in de Soph. El. c. 20, 177 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ o( *eu)qudh/mou de\ lo/gos, a)=r'  oi)=das su\ nu=n ou)/sas e)n *peiraiei= trih/reis e)n *sikeli/a| w)/n</foreign>; but in both much is left to be supplied, the argument alluded to being supposed to be well known, and in every one's recollection. Schrader thus fills up the argument:&mdash;What you know, you know in the Piraeus&mdash;where the two disputants were standing&mdash;this is admitted: but you know also that there are triremes: this also is conceded, because the respondent knows that the Athenians have triremes somewhere; out at sea, or in Sicily, (referring to the expedition of 415 B.C.): whence the conclusion, you know that there are triremes in the Piraeus. The illicit combination (<foreign lang="greek">su/nqesis</foreign>) in this interpretation&mdash; though Schrader does not explain it further&mdash;must lie in the conjunction of the Piraeus with the knowledge of triremes, to which it does not belong in the respondent's interpretation of the question: and <foreign lang="greek">e(/kaston</foreign> will be &lsquo;each of these two pieces of knowledge, the knowledge of what is known in the Piraeus, and of the triremes&rsquo;. They are both known separately, Euthydemus illicitly combines them. </p>
						<p>This seems to be a reasonable explanation of the example <hi rend="italic">so far as it is given in the Rhetoric.</hi> But it seems quite certain that Aristotle is <pb n="308"/> quoting identically the same argument in de Soph. El. The triremes and the Piraeus appear in both, and both are styled <foreign lang="greek">*eu)qudh/mou lo/gos</foreign>, the well-known argument of Euthydemus. Schrader, though he refers to the passage, takes no account of the words <foreign lang="greek">e)n *sikeli/a w)/n</foreign>, which it seems must have formed part of it. Victorius has endeavoured to combine both in his explanation of the fallacy&mdash;I am not at all sure that I understand it: I will therefore transcribe it in his own words <hi rend="italic">verbatim et litteratim.</hi> &ldquo;Tu scis te esse in Piraeo: quod concedebatur ipsi (the respondent), ac verum erat. Scis triremes Atheniensium esse in Sicilia (miserant enim eo classem ut eam insulam occuparent); id quoque non inficiabatur qui interrogatus erat. Tu scis igitur (aiebat ille) in Piraeo triremes esse, in Sicilia existens. Qua captione ipsum in Sicilia, scire triremes esse in Piraeo cogebatur; cum eo namque, scire in Piraeo, coniungebatur triremes esse: a quo remotum primo pronunciatum fuerat: ab illo vero, in Sicilia, cum quo copulatum editum primo fuerat, disiungebatur: atque ita efficiebatur ipsum, in Sicilia cum esset, scire in Piraeo triremes esse. Quod vero hic adiungit <foreign lang="greek">e(/kaston ga\r oi)=den</foreign>: separatim scilicet utrunque nosse intelligit, se in portu Atheniensium tunc esse: triremesque item in Sicilia. E quorum conglutinatione fallax ratio conflata, quae inde vocata est <foreign lang="greek">para\ su/nqesin</foreign>.&rdquo; By this must be meant, that the two statements, existence or knowledge in the Piraeus, and knowledge of triremes in Sicily, which ought to be kept separate, are combined in one statement, and hence the fallacy: true separately, they are not true together. Whether this is a satisfactory version of Euthydemus' fallacy I fear I must leave it to others to decide. My principal difficulty is as to the mode of transition from the Piraeus to Sicily in the two first propositions, which as far as I can see is not satisfactorily accounted for. What is there to connect the &lsquo;knowing that you are in the Piraeus&rsquo;, or &lsquo;knowing in the Piraeus&rsquo;, with knowing or being in Sicily? And yet there must be some connexion, apparent at least if not real, to make the fallacy plausible. This is nevertheless Alexander's solution of it. Comm. ad Top. 177 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 12, <foreign lang="greek">to\n de\ lo/gon h)rw/ta o( *eu)qu/dhmos e)n *peiraiei= tugxa/nwn, o(/te ai( tw=n *)aqhnai/wn trih/reis ei)s *sikeli/an h)=lqon. e)/sti de\ h( tou= sofi/smatos a)gwgh\ toiau/th. &ldquo;a)=ra ge su\ nu=n e)n *peiraiei= ei)=; nai/. a)=r'  oi)=das e)n *sikeli/a| trih/reis ou)/sas; nai/. a)=ra oi)=das su\ nu=n ou)/sas e)n *peiraiei= trih/reis e)n *sikeli/a| w)/n;&rdquo; para\ th\n su/nqesin to\ sofi/sma</foreign>. However this may be, at any rate, if Plato's dialogue is to be trusted, there is no kind of fallacy however silly, transparent, and contemptible, of which Euthydemus and his partner were incapable; and the weight of authority, notwithstanding the utter want of sense, must decide us to accept this explanation. </p>
						<p>Of Euthydemus, and his brother and fellow-sophist Dionysodorus, contemporaries of Socrates, nearly all that we know is derived from Plato's Euthydemus. They had studied and taught the art military, <pb n="309"/> and the forensic branch of Rhetoric, Euthyd. 273, C. D, before entering at an advanced age upon their present profession, viz. that of <foreign lang="greek">e)ristikh/</foreign>, the art of sophistical disputation, and of universal confutation, by which they undertook to reduce any opponent whatsoever to silence. Many examples of their mode of arguing are given in the Platonic dialogue, but Aristotle's instance does not appear among them. See also Grote's Plato, on Euthydemus, Vol. I., ch. xix. The fallacies are exemplified from the dialogue, p. 545 seq. And on Euthydemus and his brother, also Stallbaum's Disp. de Euth. Plat. prefixed to his edition of the dialogues, p. 10 seq. (Ed. I). </p>
						<p>An example of illicit combination is given in the <foreign lang="greek">peri\ *(ermhnei/as</foreign>, the treatise on the proposition or elementary combination of words, c. 11, p. 20 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 35, <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  ou)xi/, ei) skuteu\s kai\ a)gaqo/s, kai\ skuteu\s a)gaqo/s. ei) ga/r, o(/ti e(ka/teron a)lhqe/s, ei)=nai dei= kai\ to\ suna/mfw, polla\ kai\ a)/topa e)/stai</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Another example is that one that knows the letters, knows the whole verse; for the verse is the same thing (as the letters, or elements, of which it is composed)&rsquo;. The reason given, <foreign lang="greek">to\ e)/pos to\ au)to/ e)stin</foreign>, contains the fallacy. It assumes that the things combined are the same as they are separate; which is not true. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (thirdly) to argue, that since twice a certain amount (of food or a drug) is unwholesome, so must also the single portion be: for it is absurd to suppose that if two things separately are good, they can when combined unite into one bad&rsquo;. If the two parts together are unwholesome, neither of them can be wholesome separately, because the combination of two good things can never make one bad, This is a fallacious <hi rend="italic">confutation;</hi> of a physician, may be, who is recommending the use of a drug. You say that your drug is wholesome: now you only administer a certain quantity. Suppose you were to double it, you would not say that it was wholesome <hi rend="italic">then:</hi> but if the two parts together are unwholesome, how can either of them, the component elements being precisely the same in each, be wholesome? two wholesomes could never make an unwholesome. Here the undue combination of the double with the single part produces the fallacy (so Victorius). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Used thus, it serves for refutation, but in the following way for proof (this is, by inverting the preceding): because one good thing cannot be (made up of) two bad&rsquo;. If the whole is good, then the two parts, which is not always true. &lsquo;But the entire topic is fallacious&rsquo;: in whichever way it is applied (Victorius). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, what Polycrates said in his encomium of Thrasybulus, that he put down thirty tyrants: for he puts them all together&rsquo;. This again, which without further elucidation would not be altogether intelligible, is explained by two notices in Quintilian, III 6. 26, VII 4. 44. </p>
						<p>As an illustration of the argument from number, he gives this, <hi rend="italic">An Thrasybulo triginta praemia debeantur, qui tot tyrannos sustulerit?</hi> <pb n="310"/> Whence it appears that Polycrates had argued that he deserved thirty rewards for his services, one for each tyrant that he had expelled; an illicit combination. Spalding ad loc. III. 6, &ldquo;Hoc videtur postulasse Polycrates, qui dixit:&rdquo; quoting this passage. On Polycrates see &sect; 6, <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Or that in Theodectes' Orestes, for it is a fallacy of division: &ldquo;It is just for her that slays her husband&rdquo; to die, and for the son to avenge his father: and accordingly this is what has actually<note anchored="yes">A^{c} and three other MSS have <foreign lang="greek">ou)kou=n kai\ tau=ta kai\ pe/praktai</foreign>. Spengel, ed. 1867, rightly puts the first in brackets and retains the second, which I have followed in the translation.</note> been done: (but this is a fallacy) for it may be that when the two are combined, (the sum-total) is no longer just&rsquo;. Orestes, being the son of her that had slain her husband, was no longer the right person to take vengeance on his murderer. On the use of <foreign lang="greek">ou)ke/ti</foreign>, the opposite of <foreign lang="greek">h)/dh</foreign>, &lsquo;not <hi rend="italic">now</hi> as before, in former cases&rsquo;, see note on I 1. 7, <foreign lang="greek">h)/dh, ou)/pw, ou)ke/ti</foreign>. </p>
						<p>On Theodectes of Phaselis, see note on II 23. 3, and the reff. Also compare the topic of that section with this example from his Orestes, which in all probability is there also referred to. This passage of Aristotle is cited by Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Trag. Graec.</hi> III 122, without comment, as the sole remaining specimen of Theodectes' Orestes. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This may also be explained as the fallacy of omission; for the (person) by whom (the deed was done) is withdrawn&rsquo;. Had it been stated &lsquo;by whom&rsquo; the vengeance was inflicted, the <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi> of it would have been apparent. It is stated generally, the particular circumstances which falsify the statement in this case being omitted. <foreign lang="greek">para\ th\n e)/lleiyin</foreign> is explained in &sect; 9, <foreign lang="greek">th\n e)/lleiyin tou= po/te kai\ pw=s</foreign>, the omission of time and circumstances, which falls under the more general head of <foreign lang="greek">to\ a(plw=s kai\ mh\ a(plw=s</foreign>, &sect; 10, an unqualified, instead of qualified statement.

This might seem to confine the topic to accusation and defence in the forensic branch, and no doubt it is in this that it is most useful and most usual; and also this is its most appropriate sphere as a fallacious <hi rend="italic">argument:</hi> still as a species of one of the <foreign lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign> it must needs be applicable to the other two branches, and in fact in all invectives, and in epideictic oratory, it is essential.

						<p>&lsquo;Another fallacy is derived from the use of the &lsquo;sign&rsquo;: for this also leads to no real conclusion (<hi rend="italic">proves, demonstrates</hi>, nothing)&rsquo;. On the <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> and its logical character and value, see Introd. pp. 161&mdash;3, and the paraphrases of Rhet. I 2. 15&mdash;18, Ibid. pp. 163&mdash;5. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;As for instance if one were to say, &ldquo;Lovers are of service to states; for it was the love of Harmodius and Aristogeiton that put down (put an end to) the tyranny of Hipparchus&rdquo;&rsquo;. This is a mere <hi rend="italic">apparent sign</hi> or possible indication of a connexion between love and the putting down of tyranny: there is no <hi rend="italic">necessary consequence;</hi> it is not a <foreign lang="greek">tekmh/rion</foreign>, a conclusive sign, or indication: no general rule of connexion can be established between them, from which we might infer&mdash;without fallacy&mdash; <pb n="312"/> that the one would always, or for the most part, follow the other. Herein lies the difference between the dialectical <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> and the rhetorical <hi rend="italic">sign.</hi> The converse of this&mdash;from the governor's point of view&mdash;is argued by Pausanias in Plato's Symp. 182 C. <foreign lang="greek">*ou) ga\r, oi)=mai, sumfe/rei toi=s a)/rxousi...fili/as i)sxura\s kai\ koinwni/as</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">e)ggi/nesqai</foreign>): <foreign lang="greek">o(\ dh\ ma/lista filei= ta/ te a)/lla pa/nta kai\ o( e)/rws e)mpoiei=n. e)/rgw| de\ tou=to e)/maqon kai\ oi( e)nqa/de tu/rannoi: o(/ ga\r *)aristogei/tonos e)/rws kai\ *(armodi/ou fili/a be/baios genome/nh kate/lusen au)tw=n th\n a)rxh/n</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;Another, the fallacy of <hi rend="italic">accident</hi>&rsquo;. This is not the same fallacy as that which has the same name in the Topics, the first of the fallacies <foreign lang="greek">e)/cw th=s le/cews</foreign>, de Soph. El. c. 5, 166 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28; &ldquo;Fallacies of accident are those that arise from the assumption that the same things are predicable alike of the thing itself (<foreign lang="greek">to\ pra=gma</foreign>, i.e. the logical subject, <foreign lang="greek">to\ u(pokei/menon</foreign>). For whereas the same subject has many accidents, it is by no means necessary that all that is predicable of the former should also be predicable of the latter.&rdquo; White is an accident, or predicable, of the subject, man: it is by no means true that all that can be predicated of man can also be predicated of white. The confusion of these, the substitution of one for the other, gives rise to the fallacy. The example is the following:&mdash;A Sophist argues that because Socrates is not Coriscus, and Coriscus is a man, Socrates is not a man. Man is the subject, and Socrates and Coriscus are both predicates, attributes, or accidents of man. And if we substitute &lsquo;name&rsquo; for &lsquo;man&rsquo; in the proposition &lsquo;Coriscus is a man&rsquo;, the argument vanishes. But both the examples here are instances of accident for <hi rend="italic">cause</hi>, and not for subject, which is no doubt a more suitable application of it for rhetorical purposes. </p>
						<p>The first example is taken from Polycrates' encomium on mice, quoted above without the name, &sect; 2. One of his topics in praise of them was &ldquo;the aid they lent by gnawing through the bow-strings.&rdquo; Something similar to this is narrated by Herodotus, II 141 (Schrader), but the circumstances do not quite tally. Sennacherib king of the Arabians and <pb n="313"/> Assyria invaded Egypt with a great host, when Sethos the priest was king. The god appeared to him in a dream with promises of succour against the invaders. &ldquo;A flood of field-mice poured over the enemy by night, which devoured their quivers and bows, and besides, the handles of their shields, so that on the following day, flying without arms, many of them fell,&rdquo; &amp;c. At all events, wherever the incident was taken from, Polycrates meant to praise the mice for some <hi rend="italic">service</hi> they had rendered by gnawing the bow-strings: now this service was a mere accident: their intention was, not to do service, but only to satisfy their appetite (Victorius). Polycrates' fallacy therefore consists in assigning as a <hi rend="italic">vera causa</hi> what was only accidental. I do not see how this can be construed as a confusion of <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> and accident. And so Victorius in his explanation; &ldquo;quia quod casu evenit tamquam propter se fuisset sumitur<note anchored="yes">This seems to be the true interpretation; Aristotle has here left it open by not defining the topic. But if this absence of defin, be understood as a tacit reference to the de Soph. El., and we desire to bring the examples here into conformity with the explanation of the topic there, we may understand <foreign lang="greek">to\ pra=gma</foreign> in that passage, not as the logical subject, but as &lsquo;thing&rsquo; in general, and say that the fallacy of the examples in the Rhetoric lies in the substitution of a mere accident for the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> in question, i.e. the real thing, the reality; as in that of the mice, the accidental <hi rend="italic">service</hi>, for the real <hi rend="italic">appetite:</hi> and in Achilles' case, the accidental neglect to invite, for the real disrespect that it implied.</note>.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>Of the declamations of Polycrates, who has been already twice mentioned or referred to, the most celebrated were the <foreign lang="greek">a)pologi/a *bousi/ridos</foreign>, a paradoxical defence of Busiris a mythical king of Egypt, proverbial for inhumanity, <hi rend="italic">illaudatus Busiris</hi>, Virg.

						<p>&lsquo;Or if one were to say that an invitation to dinner is the highest possible honour; because it was the want of an invitation which excited Achilles' wrath against the Achaeans at Tenedos: his anger was really excited by the disrespect, the non-invitation (the form or mode of its manifestation) was a mere accident of it&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ tou=</foreign> &lsquo;on the occasion, in the case of&rsquo;. This is a fallacious inference (drawn either by Arist. himself, or, more likely, by some declaimer) from an incident in a play of Sophocles, the subject of which was this (Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fr. Trag. Gr.</hi>, Soph., <foreign lang="greek">*)axaiw=n *su/llogos</foreign>, Vol. II. p. 230, from Welcker):&mdash;The Greeks on their way to Troy had put in at the island of Tenedos to hold a council as to the best way of attacking the city. Achilles would not attend at the meeting, having taken offence at the neglect, and presumed slight or contempt, of Agamemnon in not inviting him, either not at all, or after the rest, to an entertainment. There are two extant titles of plays by Sophocles, the <foreign lang="greek">*)axaiw=n su/llogos</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">*)axaiw=n su/ndeipnon</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">su/ndeipnoi</foreign>, Plutarch, de discr. adul. et amici, 74 A, Vol. I. p. 280, ed.

						<p>&lsquo;Another from consequence&rsquo;, i. e. from the unduly assumed reciprocal convertibility of antecedent and consequent: just as in the &lsquo;sign&rsquo; (q. v.), between which and this there is no real difference. As we saw in &sect; 5, in the de Soph. El. the sign is spoken of as the rhetorical variety of the general topic of <hi rend="italic">consequence:</hi> and they ought not to be divided here. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;As in the Alexander&rsquo;, i. e. Paris; a declamation of some unknown author, already referred to, c. 23 &sect;&sect; 5, 8, 12; (it is argued) &lsquo;that he is high-minded, because he scorned the society of many&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">quaere</hi> <foreign lang="greek">tw=n pollw=n</foreign> &lsquo;of the vulgar&rsquo;) &lsquo;and dwelt alone in Ida&rsquo;: (the inference being that) &lsquo;because such is the disposition of the high-minded, therefore he might be supposed to be high-minded.&rsquo; This is a fallacy, or logical flaw, as Schrader puts it, &ldquo;quia universalem affirmantem convertit simpliciter, et <pb n="315"/> quia in secunda figura concludit affirmative.&rdquo; Or rather, as this is an illicit consequence, because here antecedent and consequent are not reciprocally convertible: it does not follow, even supposing that all highminded men dwell apart from others, that all lonely-dwellers are highminded men: and to say that so and so, anybody whatsoever, is highminded for that reason and that alone, is as much as to say that the rule is universal. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again (to argue) that so and so is a dandy and roams at night, and therefore a rake, because such are the habits of rakes&rsquo;. This, as before, is to say that because (supposing it to be so) all adulterers are smartly dressed and walk at night, therefore all smart dressers and night-walkers are adulterers. This appears also as an example of the sign, the rhetorical form of the topic <foreign lang="greek">to\ e(po/menon</foreign>, de Soph. El. c. 5, 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9, <foreign lang="greek">boulo/menoi ga\r dei=cai o(/ti moixo/s, to\ e(po/menon e)/labon, o(/ti kallwpisth\s h)\ o(/ti nu/ktwr o(ra=tai planw/menos</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;And another (argument), similar to these (for exalting the condition of poverty and exile), is that beggars sing and dance in the temples, and that exiles are allowed to live where they please&rsquo;: because, these things (enjoyments) being the ordinary accidents or concomitants of apparent happiness, those who have them may also be supposed to be happy&rsquo;. Here again there is an illicit conversion of antecedent and consequent: if singing and dancing, or living where one pleased, were <hi rend="italic">coextensive</hi> with happiness, the inference would be true and the two convertible. As it is, it does not follow that, because these are <hi rend="italic">indications</hi> of happiness, or often accompany (follow) it, all men that sing and dance, or can live where they please, are necessarily happy. This is taken from one of those paradoxical encomiums of poverty and exile to which Isocrates refers, Helen. &sect; 8, <foreign lang="greek">h)/dh tine/s...tolmw=si gra/fein, w(s e)/stin o( tw=n ptwxeuo/ntwn kai\ feugo/ntwn bi/os zhlwto/teros h)\ tw=n a)/llwn a)nqrw/pwn</foreign>; such as Alcidamas' <foreign lang="greek">peni/as e)gkw/mion</foreign> cited above from Menander on &sect; 6.

The beggars dance and sing in the temples to amuse the visitors and obtain an alms; the wealthy and prosperous out of wantonness or exultation, to shew that they have the liberty of doing what is forbidden to humbler people (so Victorius, and Schrader who borrows his note: these may however be mere <hi rend="italic">signs of happiness</hi> in the <foreign lang="greek">eu)dai/mones</foreign>). And again, the exiles <hi rend="italic">are obliged</hi> to live abroad, and would gladly be at home again; the wealthy and prosperous travel for change of scene, to satisfy their curiosity, or (like Herodotus and Plato) their desire of knowledge.

						<p>The fallacy here illustrated is the familiar <hi rend="italic">post hoc ergo propter hoc;</hi> the assumption of a mere chronological sequence as a true cause: to mistake a mere accidental connexion of the order of time, for one of cause and effect.

						<p>&lsquo;Another from the substitution of what is no cause for (the true) cause; for instance (this substitution takes place) by reason of the occurrence of something contemporaneously or subsequently (to that which is presumed to account for it): for it is assumed that what merely follows (in time) is the effect of a cause, and especially by politicians; as Demades, for instance, pronounced Demosthenes' policy to be the cause of all their calamities; because it was <hi rend="italic">after</hi> it that the war (with Philip, and the defeat of Chaeronea) occurred&rsquo;.

The subject of the de Soph.

						<p>&lsquo;Further, as in the eristic branch of dialectics, from the substitution of something as universally or absolutely for that which is so not universally, but only partially, or in <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> cases, an apparent (fallacious) syllogism (i. e. enthymeme, see on I 1. 11) is elicited. As in dialectics for instance, the argument &ldquo;that the non-existent <hi rend="italic">is</hi> (has existence), because non-being <hi rend="italic">is</hi> non-being&rdquo;&rsquo;. (<hi rend="italic">Is</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">e)sti/</foreign>, has two different senses, absolute and relative, or absolute and particular: the Sophist, in the second case, <hi rend="italic">intends</hi> it to be understood in its most general signification <foreign lang="greek">a(plw=s</foreign>, of actual existence: it is in fact a mere copula connecting the one <foreign lang="greek">mh\ o)/n</foreign> with the other, and merely states the identity of those two <hi rend="italic">expressions</hi>, which is no doubt a very <hi rend="italic">partial statement</hi> indeed: it is true, but nothing to the purpose of the argument. Comp. de Soph. El. c. 25, 180 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 33, 4.) &lsquo;Or again that the unknown is an object of knowledge, because the unknown may be known&mdash;that it is unknown&rsquo;. (Here of course the particular that is left out of the account is the <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti a)/gnwston</foreign>; whereby the absolute or universal, &lsquo;the unknown is knowable&rsquo;, is substituted for the partial or particular statement, that what is knowable is only that it cannot be known.) &lsquo;So also in Rhetoric a seeming inference may be drawn from the absolute to merely partial probability&rsquo;. This topic is illustrated in Plat. Euthyd. 293 C seq. See Grote's <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, I 546, 7, and 549; [also Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> I 182, note]. </p>
						<p>The construction of this last sentence which had been obscured by wrong punctuation in Bekker's 4to and first 8vo ed., has in the second been made intelligible and consecutive by removing the full stops at <foreign lang="greek">mh\ o)/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti a)/gnwston</foreign>, and changing all the colons into commas. The <pb n="319"/> correlative of <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper e)n toi=s e)ristikoi=s</foreign> is of course <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw kai\ e)n toi=s r(htorikoi=s</foreign>: and in the intervening sentence <foreign lang="greek">oi(=on e)n me\n toi=s dialektikoi=s</foreign>, the <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> has also reference to an intended <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>, to be inserted when Rhetoric comes to be contrasted with Dialectics, which however is never expressed and the <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> left <hi rend="italic">pendens.</hi> </p>
						<p>The topic is first defined in general terms, as it appears in the dialectical treatise, and illustrated by two examples of its <hi rend="italic">dialectical</hi> use: and then exhibited in its <hi rend="italic">special</hi> application to Rhetoric, the paralogism of absolute and particular probability. The first, as in the dialectical examples, is confounded with, or substituted for, the second. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;This (particular probability, <foreign lang="greek">ti\ ei)ko/s</foreign>,) is not universally (true or applicable), as indeed Agathon says: Perchance just this may be called likely, that many unlikely things befall mortals&rsquo;, Agathon, Fragm. Inc. 5. Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Trag. Gr.</hi> III 78. Of Agathon, see M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> ch. XXVI. &sect; 3. <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX, Vol. III. p. 257. Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Artium Scriptores</hi>, p. 91, merely quotes four fragments from Aristotle. The extant fragments are collected by Wagner, u. s., on p. 73 seq. His style is criticized in Aristoph. Thesm. 55 seq. and imitated or caricatured 101 seq. A specimen of his Rhetoric is given by Plato, Symp. 194 E seq. </p>
						<p>This &lsquo;probable improbable&rsquo; is illustrated in Poet. XVIII 17, 18, from tragedy, by the cunning man cheated, and by the defeat of the brave. <foreign lang="greek">e)/sti de\ tou=to ei)ko/s, w(/sper *)aga/qwn le/gei: ei)ko\s ga\r gi/nesqai polla\ kai\ para\ to\ ei)=kos</foreign>. Comp. XXV 29. On this fallacy the &lsquo;solution&rsquo; in Rhet. ad Alex. 36 (37) &sect; 29, is based. Dion. Ep. I ad Amm. c. 8, <foreign lang="greek">to\ kakourgo/taton tw=n e)pixeirhma/twn...o(/ti kai\ to\ mh\ ei)ko\s gi/netai/ pote ei)ko/s</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For what is contrary to the probable does come to pass, and therefore what is <hi rend="italic">contrary</hi> to probability is also probable (<foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign>, besides what is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> probable). And if so, the improbable will be probable. Yes, but not absolutely (the answer); but as indeed in the case of Dialectics (in the dialectical form of the fallacy), it is the omission of the circumstances (<foreign lang="greek">kata\ ti/</foreign>, in what respect,) and relation and mode that causes the cheat, so here also (in Rhetoric) (the fallacy arises) from the probability assumed not being absolute probability (or probability in general) but <pb n="320"/> some particular, special probability&rsquo;. That which is only probable in particular cases, as in particular times, places, relations, and circumstances in general, is fraudulently represented as probable absolutely, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any such conditions or qualifications. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sukofanti/a</lemma>, in this sense of a logical cheat or deception, transferred from its ordinary meaning, of a false, calumnious information or charge, is not to be found in any of the Lexicons. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Of (the application of) this topic the (whole) &ldquo;art&rdquo; of Corax is composed.&rsquo; &lsquo;This topic&rsquo;, as Ar. afterwards implies, is the topic of <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)ko/s</foreign> in general, and not confined to the fallacious use of it. In the former of the two alternatives of the example from Corax's Art the argument is fair enough; the feeble man may fairly plead that it was not likely that he should be guilty of an assault upon one much stronger than himself. Of course this does not <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> the point, but it would have a considerable effect in <hi rend="italic">persuading</hi> the judges of the accused's innocence, &lsquo;For whether he (the accused) be not liable to the charge, as for instance if (repeat <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> from the preceding) a weak man were to be tried for an assault, (he defends himself upon the ground that, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;it is because,&rsquo;) it is improbable: or if he be liable (under the same circumstances), as for instance if he be a strong man (he argues&mdash;the omission explained as before) that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> improbable because it was likely to <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> probable&rsquo; (and therefore knowing that he would be exposed to the suspicion he was less likely to bring upon himself an almost certain punishment). And in like manner in all other cases: for the accused must be either liable or not liable to the charge: now it is true that both <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> probable, but the one is really so, the other not probable in the abstract (<foreign lang="greek">a(plw=s</foreign> <hi rend="italic">simpliciter</hi>), but in the way that has been already stated&rsquo;, i. e. under the conditions and circumstances before mentioned. </p>
						<p>Of Corax, with Tisias his pupil the founder of Rhetoric, see Cic. Brut. c. 12, Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Artium Scriptores</hi> p. 22 seq., <hi rend="italic">Cambr. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. VII, Vol. III. p. 40 seq., Westerm. <hi rend="italic">Gesch. der Beredt.</hi> &sect; 27, pp. 35&mdash;7, M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> XXXII 3 [and Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi> I. pp. 19, 20]. </p>
						<p>The assault case and its alternatives was evidently one of the stock instances of the rhetorical books. It has been already referred to in I 12. 5, and re-appears in Plat. Phaedr. 223 B, as an extract from Tisias' art. Again in Rhet. ad Alex. 36 (37) &sect; 6. </p>
						<p>The topic <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)ko/s</foreign> which formed the staple of the art of Corax, and was treated in that of Tisias, Plato, l. c., continued in fashion with the <pb n="321"/> early rhetoricians of the Sophistical school, as we may see by the constant notices of it in Plato. Somewhat later it was taken up by Antiphon, a disciple of this school, and appears in his three surviving school exercises, or <foreign lang="greek">mele/tai</foreign>, the Tetralogies. See also de caed. Herod. &sect; 63. On the <foreign lang="greek">to/pos</foreign> of the first of these, see M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. L.</hi> XXXIII &sect; 2. It is to be found also in the Rhet. ad Alex.; and of course in the Orators: and it crept into the Tragedies of Agathon. An amusing instance of the alternative application of the argument is the story of the encounter between Corax and his pupil Tisias in the attempt of the former to recover the fees due for his instruction, which Tisias had withheld. Related at length in <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. VII, Vol. III p. 34. It is likewise told of Protagoras and his wealthy pupil Euathlus. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this is (the meaning of) &ldquo;making the worse appear the better argument:&rdquo;&rsquo; (that is, giving the superior to the inferior, the less <hi rend="italic">probable</hi>) argument, making it prevail over that which is <hi rend="italic">really</hi> superior, and more probable: which is identical with the second, the fallacious alternative of Corax's <foreign lang="greek">to/pos</foreign>. Cic., Brut. VIII 30, extends this profession to all the Sophists. <hi rend="italic">Tum Leontinus Gorgias...Protagoras Abderites ... aliique multi temporibus eisdem docere se profitebantur, arrogantibus sane verbis, quemadmodum causa inferior</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ita enim loquebantur</hi>) <hi rend="italic">dicendo fieri superior posset.</hi> See the dialogue between the <foreign lang="greek">di/kaios</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/dikos lo/gos</foreign>, Arist. Nub. 889&mdash;1104. <foreign lang="greek">tw\ lo/gw&mdash;to\n krei/tton' , o(/stis e)sti/, kai\ to\n h(/ttona, 882. ti/s w)/n; lo/gos. h(/ttwn g) w)/n. a)lla/ se nikw=, to\n e)mou= krei/ttw fa/skont) ei)=nai</foreign>, 893: and he keeps his word. The fair argument is at last forced to own his defeat, and acknowledge the superiority of his unfair competitor. This was one of the articles of charge of Meletus and his coadjutors against Socrates, Plat. Apol. 19 B. Socrates is there made to refer to Aristophanes as its original author. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And hence it was that men were justified in taking offence (in the displeasure, indignation, they felt) at Protagoras' <hi rend="italic">profession:</hi> for it (the mode of arguing that it implies) is false, and not real (true, sound, genuine) but only apparent; and no true art (proceeding by, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;included in,&rsquo; no rule of genuine art), but mere rhetoric and quibbling. And so much for enthymemes, real and apparent&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">au)to\ me\n ou)=n tou=to/ e)stin, e)/fh</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">o( *prwtago/ras</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">w)= *sw/krates, to\ e)pa/ggelma o(\ e)pagge/llomai</foreign>. Plat. Protag. 319 A. </p>
						<p>This distinction of <foreign lang="greek">a)lhqh/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">faino/menos, ei)=nai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">fai/nesqai</foreign>, reality and appearance, the true, genuine, substantial, and the sham, false <pb n="322"/> semblance, is traced in its various applications at the opening of the de Soph. El. The latter is the especial characteristic of the Sophists and their professions and practice, 165 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21, c. 11, 171 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27&mdash;34, and elsewhere. It constantly re-appears in Aristotle's writings. </p>
						<p>The imputation here cast on Protagoras' profession is rather that of logical than of moral obliquity and error, though no doubt the latter may also be implied. </p>

					<p>The account of the genuine and spurious enthymemes or rhetorical inferences in cc. XXIII, XXIV, is followed by a chapter upon <foreign lang="greek">lu/sis</foreign>, the various modes of refuting an adversary's argument; the same order being observed as in the corresponding Dialectics (<foreign lang="greek">a)nti/strofos h( r(htorikh\ th=| dialektikh=|</foreign>), where we have first (in the eight books of the Topics) the art of logical, systematic, argumentation, laid down and analysed; which is supplemented in an Appendix, Top. IX, or de Soph. El., by an account, (in the first fifteen chapters) of sophistical fallacies and paradoxes, and (from c. 16 to 33) the various modes of &lsquo;solving&rsquo; or refuting them [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, chap. X]. The principal difference between them is that the dialectical <foreign lang="greek">lu/sis</foreign> deals only with the refutation of <hi rend="italic">fallacious</hi> arguments, the rhetorical with that of rhetorical inferences or enthymemes in general. The same subject is treated again, more briefly, in III 17, under the head of <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>, the third &lsquo;division of the speech&rsquo;, including the establishment of your own case and the refutation of your opponent's: and in the Rhet. ad Alex. 36 (37), under that of accusation and defence. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;This solution or refutation may be effected either by a countersyllogism (which concludes the negative of the opponent's thesis or conclusion, the regular <foreign lang="greek">e)/legxos</foreign>) or by advancing a (contradictory) <hi rend="italic">instance</hi>, or objection (to one of the premisses proving or indicating a false statement)&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Now these counter-syllogisms may plainly be constructed out of the same topics: for syllogisms&rsquo; (i. e. not all syllogisms, not the scientific and demonstrative, but dialectical syllogisms, and rhetorical enthymemes: note on I 1. 11) &lsquo;are derived from probable materials, and mere (variable) <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi>&rsquo; (what is generally <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>, probabilities;&mdash; truth, the conclusions of science, is constant: and scientific demonstration, the object of which is <foreign lang="greek">a)lh/qeia</foreign>, does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> admit, like Dialectics and Rhetoric, of opposite conclusions, of arguments on <hi rend="italic">either</hi> side of a question), &lsquo;are often contrary to one another, (and therefore can be converted into <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> enthymemes)&rsquo;. </p>

					<div3 id="b2c25s3" type="section" n="3">
						<p>&lsquo;Objections (contradictory instances) are brought (against opposing enthymemes) in four ways, as also in the Topics&rsquo;. Schrader had long ago observed that the words <foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s topikoi=s</foreign> are not a reference to the special treatise of that name, but express the art, or the practice of it, in general; and this explanation he had already applied to other passages, as II 23. 9, <foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s topikoi=s</foreign> and 24. 10, <foreign lang="greek">e)n toi=s e)ristikoi=s</foreign>; unnecessarily in those two, as we have seen. </p>
						<p>Brandis will not allow that &lsquo;the Topics&rsquo; can ever be applied to Dialectics in general, but thinks that it must be confined to the particular book in which Dialectics are treated <hi rend="italic">as Topics</hi> (wherein Vahlen agrees with him). He admits that although the fourfold division of <foreign lang="greek">e)nsta/seis</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">as here given</hi>, is not found in the Topics, as we now have them, (there is a <hi rend="italic">different</hi> division into four,) yet the proper place for them is indicated in Bk. <foreign lang="greek">*q</foreign> c. 10; also, that there are plenty of <hi rend="italic">examples</hi> of these four <foreign lang="greek">e)nsta/seis</foreign> in the Topics; and also that they are found (substantially, not by name and description,) in the Analytics. Nevertheless, he hesitates to suppose that there can be a direct reference to the Topics here and suggests the possibility of an alteration of Bk. <foreign lang="greek">*q</foreign> subsequent to the composition of the Rhetoric, or of an omission of something in our present text.

The reference to the Topics in Rhet. I 2. 9 is a case exactly parallel to this.

						<p>&lsquo;An example of an objection from <hi rend="italic">similars</hi> (is the following), suppose the enthymeme (i. e. the premiss, as before,) to be, that those who have been injured always hate, (it may be met by the objection,) &ldquo;nay but, neither (no more than in the other case) do those who have been well treated always love&rdquo;&rsquo;. This, as Victorius observes, may plainly be taken as an example of the preceding kind of <foreign lang="greek">e)/nstasis a)po\ tou= e)nanti/ou</foreign>. It may also exemplify that of &lsquo;similars&rsquo;, to which Arist. has here applied it. Ill treatment is no necessary proof of hatred, any more than kindness and benefits are necessarily accompanied by love. The premiss, &lsquo;those who are injured always hate&rsquo;, we encounter with the objection, of a <hi rend="italic">similar, parallel</hi>, case, that &lsquo;those who are well treated don't always love&rsquo;. <pb n="326"/> </p>
						<p>Parallel cases are also illustrated in Top. B 10, 114 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 25, but not as objections, though objections might be derived from them. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b2c25s7" type="section" n="7">
						<p>A fourth kind is that of, &lsquo;judgments, or decisions proceeding from distinguished men: as for instance, if the enthymeme be, that drunkards should have allowance made for them (and be punished less severely than if they had been in their sober senses), because they sin in ignorance, an objection may be taken, that then Pittacus is no longer commendable (i. e. loses his due credit; is no longer an <hi rend="italic">authority</hi>, as he is entitled to be); for (if he had been&mdash;on the supposition that the enthymeme objected to is true,) he would not have enacted (as he did) a heavier penalty for an offence committed under the influence of intoxication&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> of Pittacus, which is of course maintained by the objector, is urged in opposition to the general principle laid down by the opponent, that indulgence should be granted to those who committed a crime in a fit of intoxication, because they were then out of their senses and had lost all self-control. </p>
						<p>If this were true, replies the objector, Pittacus, one of the seven &ldquo;wise men,&rdquo; would be no authority&mdash;which cannot be supposed&mdash;for he ruled the direct contrary, that drunkenness aggravated, not extenuated, the offence. The text, with the supplements usually required in translating Aristotle, seems to give a clear and consistent sense. Vahlen however, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Vien. Acad.</hi> Oct. 1861, p. 141, objects to <foreign lang="greek">ai)neto/s</foreign> on two grounds; first, the word itself, as belonging only to <hi rend="italic">poetry;</hi> and secondly as inapplicable here; the meaning required being, that Pittacus is no <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> man, for otherwise he would not have made such an enactment: that we must therefore read <foreign lang="greek">suneto/s</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">ai)neto/s</foreign>. On the second ground I can see no necessity for alteration; for the first objection, there is more to be said. <foreign lang="greek">ai)neto/s</foreign> is a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> rare word: only two examples of it are given in Steph. <hi rend="italic">Thes.</hi> (this place of Aristotle is strangely overlooked) and both from <hi rend="italic">poets</hi>, Antimachus and Alcaeus. Whether this is a sufficient reason for condemning the word in Aristotle I will not take upon me to decide. It is retained by all editors; and Aristotle's writings are not altogether free from irregularities of grammar and expression not sanctioned by the usage of the best Attic writers. For instance, <foreign lang="greek">kunto/taton</foreign> is quoted in Bekker's <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi>, I 101, as occurring in the <foreign lang="greek">peri\ poihtikh=s</foreign>&mdash;doubtless in the lost part of that work. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Enthymemes being derived from four sources, or kinds of materials, probabilities, example, and signs certain and uncertain; in the first enthymemes being <hi rend="italic">gathered</hi> (conclusions <hi rend="italic">collected</hi>) from things which usually happen or seem to do so, that is, from probabilities; in the next (examples) from induction (by an incomplete <hi rend="italic">inductive process</hi>), by means of similar (analogous, parallel) cases, one or more, when you first obtain your universal (the universal major, premiss or proposition, from which the conclusion is drawn) and then conclude (infer) the particular by an example&rsquo; (on this process and its logical validity, see the account of <foreign lang="greek">para/deigma</foreign>, Introd. pp. 105&mdash;107); &lsquo;and (thirdly) by means of&rsquo; (through the channel, medium, instrumentality, <foreign lang="greek">dia/</foreign> with genit.) &lsquo;the necessary and invariable&rsquo; (reading <foreign lang="greek">kai\ a)ei\ o)/ntos</foreign>, &lsquo;that which ever exists&rsquo;, unchanging, permanent, enduring for ever), &lsquo;by <foreign lang="greek">tekmh/rion</foreign> that is; and (fourthly) by signs, universal or particular&rsquo; (see on this, I 2. 16, the two kinds of signs: and the paraphrase of &sect;&sect; 15&mdash;18, Introd. pp. 163&mdash;5), &lsquo;whether (the conclusion be) positive or negative (so Vict.); and <hi rend="italic">the probable</hi>, (of which all these materials of enthymemes consist&mdash; with the solitary exception of the <foreign lang="greek">tekmh/rion</foreign>, which is very rarely used&mdash;) not being what is constant and invariable (always occurring in the same way, uniform) but what is only true <hi rend="italic">for the most part;</hi> it is plain that (the conclusion is that) all such enthymemes as these can be always disproved by bringing an objection: the refutation however is (very often) apparent and not always real; for the objector does not disprove the <hi rend="italic">probability</hi>, but only the necessity, (of the opponent's statement)&rsquo;. As <hi rend="italic">none</hi> of a rhetorician's arguments is more than probable, this can always be done, but in a great many cases it is not fair. </p>
						<p>The words <foreign lang="greek">di) e)pagwgh=s</foreign> are put in brackets by Spengel as an interpolation. With the limitation which I have expressed in the translation, <pb n="328"/> it seems to me that <foreign lang="greek">e)pagwgh=s</foreign> is quite justifiable, and may be retained: <foreign lang="greek">dia/</foreign> is at all events superfluous, and would be better away; Victorius and Buhle had already rejected it. </p>

Bekker, who had adopted the altered punctuation in his 2nd ed., has returned to the original one in his 3rd, whether by mere oversight, or intentionally, who can determine? At all events with the punctuation found in all the editions prior to Bekker's 2nd, the sentences appear to be unintelligible. Vahlen, u.s., pp. 142, 3, has adopted the same alterations with the addition of the not improbable but unnecessary one of <foreign lang="greek">e)a/n te ga\r e)/xwmen e(/n ti</foreign>. The connexion of the passage thus altered is this: There are two ways of meeting and refuting an opponent's example, the rhetorical substitute for a complete induction: first, if we have an adverse or contradictory instance (<foreign lang="greek">ou)x ou(/tw</foreign>) to bring against his general rule&mdash;a case exceptional to the example or examples that he has collected in support of it&mdash;this is refuted, at all events so far as to shew that it is not <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>, even though the majority of cases (<foreign lang="greek">plei/w kai\ pleona/kis</foreign>, &lsquo;more of them and oftener&rsquo;) of the same kind, or examples, are &lsquo;otherwise&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">a)/llws</foreign>, are in another direction, or go to prove the contrary): or, secondly, if the great majority of instances are in conformity with his rule (<foreign lang="greek">ou(/tws</foreign>), and (which must be supplied) we have no instance to the contrary to adduce, we must then contend that the present instance (any one of his examples) is not analogous, not a case in point, that there is some difference either of kind and quality, or of mode, or some other, whatever it may be, between the example and that with which he compares it, which prevents its applicability here. The objection to this connexion and interpretation is of course the combination of <foreign lang="greek">ou)x ou(/tw</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">e)a/n</foreign>; which may perhaps have been Bekker's reason for returning to the original punctuation. But as the sense seems to require the alteration of this, we may perhaps apply to this case Hermann's explanation<note anchored="yes">Review of Elmsley's Medea, vv. 87, 348. [Comp. <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> Vol. I. Appendix C, p. 301.]</note> of the conjunction of <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, the direct negative with the hypothetical <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, which may occur in cases where the negative is immediately connected, so as to form a single negative notion with the thing denied, and does not belong to the hypothesis: so that <foreign lang="greek">ou)x ou(/tws</foreign> being equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">a)/llo</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">e(/teron</foreign> may stand in its place with the hypothetical particle: though no other example of this combination with <foreign lang="greek">e)a/n</foreign> has been produced.

Instead of inferring from this correspondence&mdash;as seems most natural&mdash;the indisputable genuineness of the words in the Rhetoric, Vahlen (see below in text) uses this passage&mdash;to which I suppose he refers&mdash;as an argument <hi rend="italic">against</hi> it; that the (assumed) interpolator borrowed his phrase from Rhet. III 1. 7, and &lsquo;the Poetics&rsquo;.</note>, whence we are to obtain a supply of them, and how refute them, let us be satisfied with what has been already said: style and order (of the parts of the speech) remain for discussion&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Dionys., de Comp. Verb. C. I. divides the art of composition into two branches, <foreign lang="greek">ditth=s ou)/shs a)skh/sews peri\ pa/ntas tou\s lo/gous</foreign>, viz. (1) <foreign lang="greek">o( pragmatiko\s to/pos</foreign>, the facts, or matter&mdash;Ar.'s <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign> (in Rhetoric)&mdash;and (2) <foreign lang="greek">lektiko/s</foreign>, the style or manner. The latter is again subdivided into <foreign lang="greek">su/nqesis</foreign>, &lsquo;composition&rsquo;, combination, construction of words in <hi rend="italic">sentences</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">e)klogh\ tw=n o)noma/twn</foreign>, selection of single words. </p>
						<p>This (with the <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> exception of <foreign lang="greek">ta\ loipa/</foreign> in II 18. 5) is the first notice we have in this work that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> anything to consider in Rhetoric beyond the proofs or <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign> that are to be employed in persuasion; and the omission of any distinct mention of it up to this point is certainly remarkable. Of course those who regard the third book as not belonging to the system of Rhetoric embodied in the two first&mdash; (no one, except Rose, I think, goes so far as to deny the genuineness of the book as a work of Aristotle)&mdash;but as a separate treatise, founded on a different conception of the art, improperly attached to the foregoing, assume that the last words, <foreign lang="greek">loipo\n de\...ta/cews</foreign>, are a subsequent interpolation added to connect the second book with the third. Vahlen, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Vien. Acad.</hi> Oct. 1861, pp. 131, 2, has again shewn that arbitrary and somewhat dogmatical positiveness which characterises his criticism of Aristotle's text. He pronounces, that of the last section, only the words which he alters into <foreign lang="greek">peri\ me\n ou)=n paradeigma/twn&mdash;ei)rh/sqw h(mi=n tosau=ta</foreign> (omitting <foreign lang="greek">kai\ o(/lws tw=n peri\ th\n dia/noian</foreign>)&mdash;that is to say, only those which <pb n="334"/> happen to agree with his theory, that the third book did not form part of the original plan of the work, &ldquo;are to be regarded as genuine Aristotelian.&rdquo; The promised proof of this theory, is, I believe, not yet forthcoming. </p>
						<p>Brandis is much more reasonable, <hi rend="italic">Tract on Rhet.</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i.] p. 7,8. He thinks that the second and third parts (the contents of Bk. III, <foreign lang="greek">le/cis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ta/cis</foreign>) are already presupposed in the conception of the art expressed in the preface to the work. (This is certainly nowhere distinctly stated, and the <foreign lang="greek">prosqh=kai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ta\ e)/cw tou= pra/gmatos</foreign> of I 1. 3 seem rather to refer to the exaggerations and appeals to the feelings and such like topics, of which the &lsquo;arts&rsquo; of the earlier professors were mainly composed. Still, <hi rend="italic">the tricks of style</hi>, introduced by Gorgias and his followers into their arts, may be included with the others, E. M. C). One of the hypotheses suggested by Brandis on the relation of this third book to the two others seems to me highly probable. It is that the third book&mdash; which is in fact complete in itself (E. M. C.)&mdash;was written earlier than the rest, and before the author had arrived at his final conception of Rhetoric in its connexion with Logic; and was afterwards appended to the two others, instead of a new treatise written specially with a view to them; and this would account for the repetitions, such as that of III 17, which certainly are difficult to explain, if the third book be supposed to have been written after, and in connexion with, the first and second. With regard to the references, as in cc. 1 and 10, to one of the preceding books, Brandis thinks they might easily have been introduced <hi rend="italic">after the addition</hi> of the third to the two others. He altogether rejects the notion that any one but Aristotle could have been the author of it. (It has in fact all the characteristics of Aristotle's style, mode of thought and expression, and nothing whatever which is out of character with him: on the other hand let any two sentences in this book and the Rhet. ad Alex. be compared, and it is seen at once that the style, manner, and mode of treatment are all totally different. E. M. C.) Lastly he notes that it is characteristic of Aristotle's writings (this, I think, deserves attention) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give a full account of the contents of the work at the beginning of it; and such omission of style and arrangement was all the more likely in the Rhetoric in so far as it was part of Aristotle's theory of the art that everything but proof direct or indirect was non-essential and completely subordinate. He concludes, &ldquo;I think therefore that I need not retract the expression I ventured on above (<hi rend="italic">Sie ist ein werk aus einem gusse</hi>) that the Rhetoric is, more than most of Aristotle's writings, a work made at one cast.&rdquo;

				<p>Spengel, in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> tract on the Rhetoric, Mun. 1851, (<hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav.

On the connexion of the third book with the others he gives no opinion. In the note to his recent edition, p. 354, he thinks <pb n="335"/> that it may have been added <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the two first were composed.

					<p>In the Introduction, pp. 276&mdash;370, I have already given a complete paraphrase of the contents of this book, exhibiting the main divisions and general principles of arrangement and the connexion of its several parts: and have added, in five appendices, dissertations on some special points which seemed to require a more detailed treatment than they could conveniently receive in mere notes. Referring to this for information on all such general matters, I may confine myself in the commentary to special details of language, allusion, and such like particulars. This book, by the extreme brevity of expression which characterises it, leaving even more than usual to the reader's ingenuity to supply, by the consequent difficulty of translation, and the obscurity of many of the allusions, offers at least as many impediments and stumblingblocks to the embarrassed commentator as either of the two preceding; and it is to be feared that the explanation and illustration are not likely to be much shorter than before, in spite of what has been already done in the Introduction. </p>
					<p>With the end of Book II we finish the treatment of what (according to the Latin division) is termed <hi rend="italic">inventio</hi>, the invention and supply of all the various kinds of arguments, which the orator has to invent, or find for himself; and we now proceed to the analysis of (1) <foreign lang="greek">le/cis</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">elocutio</hi>, verbal style, including <foreign lang="greek">u(po/krisis</foreign>, delivery, <hi rend="italic">pronuntiatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">actio</hi>, (Aristotle omits the latter, at all events in the treatment of it, confining <foreign lang="greek">u(po/krisis</foreign> to <hi rend="italic">the mode of speaking</hi>, declamation, &sect; 4): and (2) <foreign lang="greek">ta/cis</foreign>, the order and disposition, together with the ordinary topics, of the several divisions of the speech. The first is examined in the first twelve chapters, the second from the thirteenth to the end. These three general divisions of the art are expressed by Cicero, Orator &sect; 43, <hi rend="italic">tria videnda sunt oratori, quid dicat</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">quo quidque loco</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">ta/cis</foreign>), <hi rend="italic">et quomodo</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">le/cis</foreign>). </p>

						<p>commences with a partial repetition of the concluding summary of the preceding chapter. The three modes of proof are enumerated, <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis, h)=qos, pa/qos</foreign>: (1) the direct logical proof, by argument; (2) the con<pb n="2"/> veying a favourable impression by the exhibition of character <hi rend="italic">in and by the speech;</hi> and (3), working on the feelings of the audience, so as to bring them to that state of mind which is favourable to the orator's purpose; to excite an angry or a calm temper, love or hatred, envy, jealousy, righteous indignation, and so on, according to circumstances and the immediate occasion. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The enthymemes too have been stated, whence they are to be supplied; for of enthymemes there are special (<foreign lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>) as well as common topics (<foreign lang="greek">to/poi</foreign>)&rsquo;. See the quotation from Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Study of Ancient Rhetoric</hi> prefixed to II 23. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c1s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;The next subject to be treated of is style&rsquo; (the manner of expressing oneself; including not only the language, but the manner of <hi rend="italic">delivery;</hi> both in voice, declamation, the pronunciation, tone, rhythm, &amp;c.; and&mdash;here Aristotle stops, and the Latin rhetoricians add&mdash;<hi rend="italic">action</hi>, the appropriate gesticulation, management of the hands and the body in general, and expecially the features): &lsquo;for it is not sufficient to know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to say, it is necessary also to know <hi rend="italic">how</hi> to say it; and this contributes greatly to the impression conveyed of a certain <hi rend="italic">character</hi> in the speech&rsquo;. The tone of voice, the expression of the features, the gestures employed, the kind of language used, quite independently of the arguments, will materially assist the impression of moral (or any particular) character which the orator wishes to assume, on the minds of the audience. The <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> of III 16.8 is part of this, the moral character imparted by the choice of language, of terms, tone and expression, significant of moral purpose, <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Now first of all, inquiry was naturally directed to that which is first in the natural order, the sources from which things themselves derive their plausibility or power of persuasion&rsquo; (i. e. what are the sources of rhetorical proof of facts themselves; which of course is the basis of the entire art or practice, and therefore &lsquo;first in the order of nature&rsquo;); &lsquo;and secondly, the due setting out (disposal) of these by the language; <pb n="3"/> and thirdly (<foreign lang="greek">tou/twn</foreign>, of such things as these, the divisions of Rhetoric), what has the greatest force (or influence, <hi rend="italic">is especially effective</hi> as a means of persuasion), but has not yet been attempted (regularly, systematically, as an art, no serious attempt has yet been made upon it), that which relates to <hi rend="italic">delivery</hi>&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">diaqe/sqai</lemma>] denotes the &lsquo;disposal&rsquo; or &lsquo;disposition&rsquo;, i. e. the investing of the speech with a certain character, putting it in a certain state, by the use of language: as the <foreign lang="greek">a)kroatai/</foreign> of a speech are said <foreign lang="greek">diati/qesqai/ pws</foreign>, to be brought into such and such a disposition or state of feeling by it: a common use of the verb. It does not mean here distribution, ordering, arrangement, which is not the special office of the graces and proprieties of language or style. There is another sense in which this verb is used by later writers, as Polybius, Dionysius, Diodorus, with <foreign lang="greek">lo/gous</foreign> and the like, <hi rend="italic">disponere, in publicum proponere, in medium proferre</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">dispose</hi> or <hi rend="italic">set out</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">dia/</foreign>), as wares in a market for sale, <hi rend="italic">&eacute;taler;</hi> which may <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> be the meaning here, though, I think, it would be less appropriate. Victorius renders it <hi rend="italic">explanare.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">dia/qesis</foreign>, in Longinus quoted below, seems to correspond to <foreign lang="greek">diati/qesqai</foreign> here in the sense in which I have explained it. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pikexei/rhtai</lemma>] is a striking instance of that abnormal formation of the passive, which I have explained and illustrated in Appendix B on I 12. 22 [Vol. I. p. 297]. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(po/krisis</lemma>, &lsquo;acting&rsquo;, properly includes, besides declamation, the management of the voice, to which Aristotle, as already mentioned, here confines it, &sect; 4, that of the features, arms, hands, and the entire body: and so it is treated by the Latin rhetoricians, Cicero, Quintilian, &amp;c. Longinus, Ars Rhet., (apud Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> I 310,) has a chapter upon it, following another <foreign lang="greek">peri\ le/cews</foreign>. His description of it is, <foreign lang="greek">mi/mhsis tw=n kat'  a)lh/qeian e(ka/stw| paristame/nwn h)qw=n kai\ paqw=n kai\ dia/qesis sw/mato/s te kai\ to/nou fwnh=s pro/sforos toi=s u(pokeime/nois pra/gmasin. du/natai de\ me/giston ei)s pi/stin k.t.l.</foreign> Dionysius, de admirabili vi dicendi in Demosthene, c. 22, p. 1023 (Reiske), says of the great orator, <foreign lang="greek">kosmou=ntos a(/panta kai\ xrhmati/zontos</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">sxhmati/zontos</foreign>, Sylburg) <foreign lang="greek">th=| prepou/sh| u(pokri/sei h(=s deino/tatos a)skhth\s e)ge/neto, w(s a(/pante/s te o(mologou=si kai\ e)c au)tw=n i)dei=n e)/sti tw=n lo/gwn, k.t.l.</foreign> See Quint. XI 3. 5, on the effect of <hi rend="italic">pronuntiatio</hi>, &lsquo;delivery, declamation&rsquo;, where he says that even an indifferent speech set off by the vigour and grace of action will have more weight or effect than the very best without it: in &sect; 6 he quotes the opinion of Demosthenes, who assigned successively the first, second, and third place to declamation (<hi rend="italic">pronuntiatio</hi>), and so on till his questioner stopped. In &sect; 7 he quotes Aeschines' saying to the <pb n="4"/> Rhodians, who were admiring the <hi rend="italic">de Corona</hi> as he recited it to them, <hi rend="italic">Quid si ipsum audissetis? et M. Cicero unam in dicendo actionem dominari putat.</hi> Cic. de Or. III 56. 213, from which the whole passage of Quintilian is taken. Also Brutus, LXVI 234, Lentulus' opinion. XXXVIII 141, 142. XLIII 168 (Spalding ad loc. Quint.). On Demosthenes' dictum, Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, Of Boldnesse, init., has this remark: A strange thing that that part of an Oratour which is but superficiall, and rather the vertue of a Player, should be placed so high above those other noble parts of Invention, Elocution, and the rest; nay almost alone, as if it were all in all. But the reason is plaine. There is in humane Nature generally more of the foole then of the wise; and therefore those faculties by which the foolish part of men's mindes is taken are most potent. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;(And this is not at all surprising) because in fact it was not till late that it made its way into the tragic art and rhapsody; for the poets at first (in the earliest stages of the drama) used to act their tragedies themselves&rsquo; (and therefore, as there was no profession of acting or professional actors, it was not likely that an art of acting should be constructed; the poets acted, as they wrote, as well as they could by the light of nature, without any rules of art). </p>

Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">Theatre of the Greeks</hi>, Ed. vii. p. 59, n. 10. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;It is plain then that there is something of this kind in Rhetoric also as well as in poetry&rsquo; (declamation may be studied and practised for the purposes of Rhetoric, as well as for those of acting in tragedy and comedy or of rhapsodical recitation): &lsquo;which, in fact, (i. e. the &lsquo;poetical&rsquo; declamation), has been dealt with (treated artistically, see note on I 1. 3), besides others, by Glaucon of Teos in particular&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This tautological repetition of <foreign lang="greek">kai/, kai\ peri\ th\n r(htorikh/n, kai\ peri\ th\n poihtikh/n</foreign>, is not unfrequent in Aristotle. Compare Pol.

						<p>Glaucon of Teos, an Ionian city on the coast of Asia Minor, is most probably the same as a Glaucon mentioned by Ion, Plat. Ion 530 D (so Stallbaum's note ad loc.), as following his own profession as a rhapsodist, which seems suitable enough for one who writes on the art of tragic declamation, especially as acting and rhapsodizing are actually coupled <pb n="5"/> together by Aristotle in the preceding sentence. I should be disposed also to identify with him of Teos, the Glaucon quoted in Poet. XXV 23 &mdash;seemingly as a poetical critic, which is also a kindred pursuit. See in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> article on Glaucon. </p>
						<p>Tyrrwhitt ad loc. Poet. seems in favour of the supposition that the three Glaucons are one. A Glaucon who wrote a work on <foreign lang="greek">glw=ssai</foreign> (sic), Athen. XI 480 F, was at all events not far removed from the same studies. Schneider, ad Xen. Conv. III 6. </p>

						<p>Harris, <hi rend="italic">Philol.

III p. 277 ult.]. Whatever Aristotle may have said <hi rend="italic">elsewhere</hi>, it is certain that what he says in the <hi rend="italic">Poetics</hi>, and therefore in this passage which is repeated from it, is what Harris has described: the close connexion of <foreign lang="greek">par'  a)/llou labei=n</foreign> with the following <foreign lang="greek">eu)fui+/a</foreign> shews this unmistakably. Besides this, a remark about borrowing metaphors from other people's speeches or writings is not only trivial in itself, but here altogether out of place: and if it were not, why should metaphors be singled out from all other forms of speech as things that should not be borrowed? Is not purloining your neighbour's thoughts or expressions or <hi rend="italic">bons mots</hi> equally reprehensible in all cases? or may <foreign lang="greek">glw=ttai</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pepoihme/na</foreign> and the rest, all of them be &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo;, and metaphors alone excepted? Victorius, according to Schrader, renders it, &ldquo;non licet <hi rend="italic">semper</hi> sumere ipsam ab alio auctore,&rdquo; which he approves, and interprets, that you musn't be always begging or borrowing your metaphors from others, when you can and ought to invent them yourself. In my copy of Vettori's Commentary [Petri Victorii Commentarii in Opera Aristotelis, 5 vols. folio, published at Florence, 1548&mdash;1583], these words do not occur: the passage is there explained, as it should be, of &lsquo;acquiring metaphors&rsquo; from any one but oneself: they being due to a natural ingenuity. Victorius also says that this remark, upon the inventive power which they presuppose, is introduced as an additional recommendation of metaphors: and refers to one of the topics of Top. III., the degrees of good, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ o(\ mh\ e)/sti par'  a)/llou pori/sasqai h)\ o(\ e)/sti par) a)/llou</foreign>, what can't be procured from another, any <hi rend="italic">native</hi> excellence or advantage, is superior to anything that <hi rend="italic">can.</hi> Also c.

His pride in this distinction would of course have rendered him much more susceptible to the slight conveyed by Iphicrates' ignorant, or malicious, mistake. The substitution of the one word for the other, though evidently interpreted by Callias (from his reply) as a mistake made in ignorance of the distinction between the two&mdash;perhaps wilfully, to save his dignity&mdash;is much more likely to have been intentional and malicious. Callias was a vain foolish man&mdash; see Xenoph. l. c. &sect; 3, ult. and Callias' speech &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 6,&mdash;and Iphicrates, the self-made man, who had risen to distinction by his own merits, <foreign lang="greek">e)c oi(/wn ei)s oi(=a</foreign>, would doubtless have enjoyed a joke at the expense of the pompous and empty &lsquo;descendant of Triptolemus&rsquo; (Xen. l. c.) and hereditary <foreign lang="greek">da|dou=xos</foreign> of the Great Mysteries.

						<p>The next is a case of the same kind; of two possible designations of actors one takes the lowest and most contemptuous, the other the opposite and highest and most complimentary. <foreign lang="greek">*dionusoko/lakes</foreign> represents them as parasites or flatterers, not worthy to be companions or friends of the god; the lowest and most degraded form of <hi rend="italic">service</hi>, of Dionysus the patron deity of the stage and its belongings (Aristophanes <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">texni/tai</foreign> as &lsquo;artists&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">artistes</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;as the lower kind of professional performers, singers, dancers, posture-makers, are fond of calling themselves nowadays by way of dignifying their profession: the term is actually applied to them by Dem. de F.

The distinction is that between true <hi rend="italic">art</hi>, and low buffoonery. This, as far as I can see, is the whole meaning of the passage. </p>
						<p>Victorius however, and Schweigh&auml;user on Athen. VI 249 F, drag in here, wholly as I can conceive beside the point, another sense of <foreign lang="greek">*dionusoko/lakes</foreign> in which it was applied to the flatterers of Dionysius of Syracuse&mdash;of whose filthy and disgusting practices Theophrastus (quoted in Wyttenbach on Plut. p. 53, F) gives some revolting examples&mdash;in a double sense, of Dionysus and Dionysius: see their notes for the explanation of this. (It is supposed by them and Mr Shilleto u. s. to be a joke; if so, it is of a very frigid description.) Wyttenbach says (note ad Plut. l. c.) &ldquo;Actores scenici honesto nomine dicebantur <foreign lang="greek">oi( peri\ *dio/nuson texni=tai</foreign>, per contemptum <foreign lang="greek">*dionusoko/lakes</foreign>&rdquo;: which is no doubt all that is meant here, though he refers to Victorius' note, who makes a great deal more out of it. This special sense of <foreign lang="greek">texni=tai</foreign> is fully confirmed by another passage of Athen.

Gr.</hi> III 300, ed. Spengel), recognised three sources of beauty in words, (1) the appeal to the sight, the direct suggestion of beautiful objects by the words which are associated with them; (2) to the ear, by the sound of the words themselves; and thirdly <foreign lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign>, by the &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; or &lsquo;sense&rsquo;, Licymnius' <foreign lang="greek">shmaino/menon</foreign>, and Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">duna/mei</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">vis</hi>, virtue, force, i. e. significance, its <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of suggestion. These are illustrated by Demetrius, l. c., the first by <foreign lang="greek">r(odo/xroon, a)nqofo/rou xro/as</foreign>: the second by <foreign lang="greek">*kalli/stratos, *)annow=n</foreign>, (the <foreign lang="greek">ll</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">nn</foreign> seem <pb n="31"/> to have pleased his ear): and the third by <foreign lang="greek">a)rxai=os</foreign> as compared with <foreign lang="greek">palaio/s</foreign>, the former being suggestive of higher and nobler associations: <foreign lang="greek">oi( ga\r a)rxai=oi a)/ndres e)ntimo/teroi</foreign>. It seems from this that the distinction between the first and third of these sources of beauty in a word is that the first is the <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> suggestion, by <hi rend="italic">word-painting</hi>, of a beautiful object of sight, as a rosy cheek or skin: the third is the remoter suggestion of beauty, <hi rend="italic">by inference</hi> from association, as <foreign lang="greek">a)rxai=os</foreign> suggests worth and respect; this form of suggestion has an intellectual character, and is therefore represented by Theophrastus as <foreign lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign>. To the direct suggestions of sight in the first class, Aristotle afterwards adds all the other senses&mdash;as music to the ear, a well-remembered flavour to the palate, smell to the nose, soft and warm things to the touch.

						<p>&lsquo;And again thirdly (a third observation upon metaphors), which solves (furnishes an answer to, serves to refute) the sophistical argument (theory or position); for it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> true, as Bryson said, that no one ever uses (that there is no such thing as) foul or indecent language, if (if&mdash;as the case really is, i. e. since or because) the same thing is signified by saying this or that (by using the broad word or disguising it by a veil of <foreign lang="greek">u(pokorismo/s</foreign>), for this is false: for one term is more <hi rend="italic">properly</hi> applied to an object than another (represents it more <hi rend="italic">literally</hi> and directly), and is more assimilated to it, and more nearly <hi rend="italic">akin</hi> to it, by setting the <pb n="32"/> thing more directly before the eyes (and so making it more <hi rend="italic">vivid, striking</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">impressive</hi>)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Of Bryson, I have collected what is known in <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. v Vol. II pp. 143&mdash;6. In this dogma of the impossibility of indecent language he seems to have anticipated the Stoics&mdash;see Cicero's famous letter to Paetus on this Stoic <hi rend="italic">libertas loquendi</hi>, u. s. p. 144 note. <hi rend="italic">Suo quamque rem nomine appellare</hi> was their statement of this &lsquo;liberty&rsquo;, to call everything its right and proper name without shame or disguise, to call a spade a spade, to use the language of a Swift or Aristophanes. Aristotle answers Bryson by a simple denial of the fact. It is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> true that there is no difference in the use of words in respect of their moral effect upon us; the broad and literal expression presents the abomination much more vividly and impressively to the mind, naked as it were, than the same notion when half hidden from the view by a decent veil which conceals a great deal of its deformity. On this subject of plain speaking, besides Cicero's letter to Paetus (ad Div. IX 22), already referred to, see Cic. de Off. I 35. 128 where the Stoics are again introduced.

						<p>&lsquo;And besides, it is not under the same conditions and circumstances that it signifies this or that, so that on this ground again we must assume that one (mode of expression) is fairer or fouler than another: for though both of them <hi rend="italic">do</hi> express (or signify) beauty and deformity, yet not <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> beautiful and deformed (in so far as they are beautiful and the reverse, <hi rend="italic">and in no other respect</hi>)<hi rend="italic">:</hi> or, if the latter also, at all events in different degrees&rsquo;. These two different effects of <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxrologi/a</foreign> seem to be thus distinguishable. We are first told that the use of the broad word is offensive because it suggests directly and immediately, paints on the mind a vivid picture of the ugly, foul or impure object: nothing is said of any further, indirect, associations connected with it, and the bad effect arises solely from the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> or vividness of the impure or ugly impression. But in the second case the effect of the plain speaking and its associations is contrasted with those that may be produced by softening the term, or employing one which <hi rend="italic">signifies</hi> the <pb n="33"/> same thing, but suggests an entirely different and innocent set of associations. As in the instances given by Cic. in de Off. I 35. 128 <hi rend="italic">liberis dare operam.</hi> Here all the associations which would be at once suggested by the broad, obscene word, are diverted, and another set introduced, connected solely with children, as the result of the intercourse, and perfectly free from all impurity. In the one case it is the mere comparison of strength and intensity that makes the difference, in the other there is a difference of <hi rend="italic">kind.</hi> &lsquo;The fair term and the foul term it is true <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> the same thing, point to the same object, but not in respect of beauty and deformity alone simply and solely (<foreign lang="greek">h(=|</foreign>), but besides that, there are associations suggested by which the one may be invested with a moral and the other with an immoral character, either altogether, or at all events in different degrees&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">a)/mfw ga/r...ma=llon kai\ h(=tton</foreign>. An example of these words suggestive of unpleasant associations which are willingly avoided by the well-bred and refined under the name of <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxrologi/a</foreign>, is to be found in Plat. Gorg. 494 c, where Socrates is made to apologise to Callicles for shocking him by the use of terms such as <foreign lang="greek">ywra=n, knhsia=n</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;These are the sources from which metaphors may be taken; from things beautiful either by the voice (the sound of the word itself when uttered), or by the force or meaning&rsquo; (what it indirectly suggests: as <foreign lang="greek">du/nasqai</foreign>, to have the power, force, virtue, when applied to words, denotes their &lsquo;value&rsquo;, in the sense of <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> or signification, see note on I 9.36; so <foreign lang="greek">du/namis</foreign> the subst. may of course be similarly employed), &lsquo;or by (i.e. conveyed by) the sight or any other sense&rsquo;. These terms have been already explained. <foreign lang="greek">o)/yei h)\ a)/llh| tini\ ai)sqh/sei</foreign> is illustrated by Victorius from Cic. de Or. III 40.161, <hi rend="italic">Nam ut odor urbanitatis, et mollitudo humanitatis, et murmur maris, et dulcedo orationis, sunt ducta a ceteris sensibus; illa vero oculorum multo acriora, quae ponunt paene in conspectu animi quae cernere et videre non possumus.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But it is preferable (<foreign lang="greek">diafe/rei</foreign> here, to surpass, excel) to say <hi rend="italic">rose-fingered</hi> dawn, rather than <hi rend="italic">purple-fingered</hi>, or, still worse, <hi rend="italic">red-fingered.</hi>&rsquo; The latter suggests cooks' hands, or other vulgar associations. The rose on the contrary reminds one of what is agreeable to the <hi rend="italic">sight</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">smell.</hi> Add to this from Campbell, <hi rend="italic">Phil. of Rhet.</hi>, Bk. III ch. I &sect; 1, (Vol. II p. 142, 2nd ed.), that the last of the three epithets compared is the vaguest and most general, and therefore the worst: the second better, because more special; and the first best of all, because the most particular, the red (<hi rend="italic">purple</hi> Campbell says) of the rose. He also mentions the gratification of the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> senses. </p>

					<div3 id="b3c2s14" type="section" n="14">
						<p>&lsquo;In the epithets also, the application of them may be made (they <pb n="34"/> may be derived, for application) from what is mean and low (morally bad in this sense), or foul and ugly, or disgraceful (another kind of badness), for instance &ldquo;matricide&rdquo;, or from what is (nobler and) better, as &ldquo;a father's avenger&rdquo;&rsquo;. The one represents the fair side of Orestes' act, the other its bad aspect. &ldquo;Locus ex Eur.

Dion., de Comp. Verb. c. 25 (Vol. V 201, ed.

						<p>&lsquo;Further the same thing may be effected (as by epithets in the way of elevation or depreciation) by diminutives&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;diminutives are, or amount to, much the same thing as epithets&rsquo;. As epithets, so diminutives, may be applied to diminish the good or bad of a thing, according as a favourable or unfavourable view is to be taken of it. On <foreign lang="greek">u(pokori/zesqai, u(pokorismo/s</foreign>, see note on I 9.29. Add Gr&auml;fenhan, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Klass. Philologie</hi>, I p. 459. It will be seen by the examples quoted in the note referred to, that the term includes much more than mere diminu<pb n="35"/> tives, and is extended to the expression of all coaxing, flattering, soothing, endearing phrases; and does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> (properly) include expressions of contempt, which <hi rend="italic">is</hi> however conveyed by many diminutives. The two terms are therefore by no means co-extensive: Aristotle, who has merely illustrated this form of language by <hi rend="italic">examples</hi> of diminutives, has taken them alone as the most distinctive class of words which convey by the termination endearment and contempt. The form of <hi rend="italic">endearment</hi> used in <hi rend="italic">extenuation</hi> diminishes the bad, the <hi rend="italic">contemptuous</hi> employment of them diminishes the good. </p>
						<p>There are no less than thirteen varieties of Greek diminutive terminations, which may be found in Matth. <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 103. Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 361, 3. f. aa, p. 320, gives only ten. Both of them have omitted a form <foreign lang="greek">*)attiki/wn</foreign>, which occurs in Arist. Pax 214, where the Schol. has <foreign lang="greek">katafronh/sews e(/neka</foreign>. It is to be noted that some of these diminutives in <foreign lang="greek">-dion</foreign> have the <foreign lang="greek">i</foreign> long, though by the ordinary rule it is short. <foreign lang="greek">tw)|ki_dion</foreign>, Ar. Nub. 93. <foreign lang="greek">ou)di_dion</foreign>, Nicom. Inc. Fr. ap. Meineke, IV. 587. <foreign lang="greek">shpi_dion</foreign>, Arist. Fragm. et octies ap. Comic.

Fritzsche ad Arist. Ran. 1301. <foreign lang="greek">porni/dion</foreign> has the <foreign lang="greek">i</foreign> long and short, Arist. Ran. 1301, and Nub. 997. The long <foreign lang="greek">i</foreign> arises from a contraction, so that <foreign lang="greek">porni_dion</foreign> must be, derived from <foreign lang="greek">porni-idion</foreign>, and is a diminutive of a diminutive. [K&uuml;hner <hi rend="italic">Gr. Gr.</hi> &sect; 330.] </p>
						<p>On Latin diminutives, Madvig, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Gr.</hi> &sect; 182. &ldquo;By means of <hi rend="italic">lus, la</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lum</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">culus, cula</hi> or <hi rend="italic">culum</hi>, are formed diminutives (<hi rend="italic">nomina diminutiva</hi>) which denote littleness, and are often used by way of endearment, commiseration, or to ridicule something insignificant, e.g. <hi rend="italic">hortulus</hi>, a little garden, <hi rend="italic">matercula</hi>, a (poor) mother, <hi rend="italic">ingeniolum</hi>, a little bit of talent.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;By diminutive I mean that which diminishes the evil and the good (which belongs to the proper meaning of a word; by the addition of a <pb n="36"/> termination), of which Aristophanes' sarcasm in the Babylonians is a specimen, where he substitutes <foreign lang="greek">xrusida/rion</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">xrusi/on</foreign> (this again is diminutive of diminutive), <foreign lang="greek">i(matida/rion</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">i(ma/tion, loidorhma/tion</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">loidori/a</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">noshma/tion</foreign>&rsquo; (Fritzsche, ap. Meineke l. c., by a very probable conj., reads <foreign lang="greek">nohma/tion</foreign>, which is certainly much more germane to the matter). &lsquo;We must, however, be very careful (in the use of this figure), and be on our guard against exaggeration in both&rsquo; (in the employment of <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/qeta</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">u(pokorismo/s</foreign>). On these diminutives of Aristophanes, Meineke, Fragm. Babyl. XXX. <hi rend="italic">Fr. Comic.

						<p>&lsquo;The third vice of style lies in the misuse of &ldquo;epithets&rdquo;, that is, in introducing them either too long, or out of season (out of <hi rend="italic">place, we</hi> say), or too frequent (numerous); for in poetry it is suitable enough to say &ldquo;white milk&rdquo; (a Homeric epithet of course; as red wine, fair women, &amp;c. in ballad poetry), but in prose it is not only less appropriate, but also, if they be employed to satiety (excess), they convict (detect, expose, the <hi rend="italic">art</hi> of the composition) and make it plain that it is poetry: for, to be sure, it must be used; for it varies the customary style and gives a foreign air to the language&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/qeta</foreign> see Introd. p. 289. The over-long &lsquo;epithets&rsquo; are illustrated by those of Aeschylus in Tragedy, and Aristophanes in Comedy&mdash;who sometimes strings together an entire line of epithets, as <foreign lang="greek">a)rxaiomelisidwnifrunixh/rata</foreign>, of Phrynichus' <foreign lang="greek">me/lh</foreign> [Vesp. 220]. Such epithets are of course most inappropriate to prose. The excessive length may also be shewn in the &lsquo;descriptive additions&rsquo; to a substantive, which often takes the place of a regular <hi rend="italic">epithet.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dei= ge xrh=sqai au)th=|</lemma>] i. e. to a limited extent; taking care at the same time that the poetical character of the language be not <hi rend="italic">marked</hi> and <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> (reading <foreign lang="greek">au)th=|</foreign> the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> retained by Bekker). Spengel with A^{c} <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=|</foreign>: Victorius and Vater <foreign lang="greek">au)toi=s</foreign>; but the <hi rend="italic">variation of the customary language</hi> is far more applicable to <hi rend="italic">poetical usages</hi> than to <hi rend="italic">epithets:</hi> in fact I doubt whether <foreign lang="greek">e)calla/ttei</foreign> could be applied to <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/qeta</foreign> with any satisfactory meaning). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;But the mean should always be our aim, for (the reverse of moderation, excess) does more mischief than careless, random, speaking, (over-doing it, exaggeration, is worse than entire carelessness, taking no pains at all): for the one no doubt wants the good, but the other (<hi rend="italic">has</hi>) the bad (the defect in the one case is negative, the mere absence of special excellence, in the other it is positive). And this is why Alcidamas' (epithets) appear tasteless; because he employs them, not as the mere seasoning but as the actual meat (<hi rend="italic">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</hi>, the substance, not the mere adjunct or appendage); so frequent, and unduly long (<foreign lang="greek">mei/zosi tou= deo/ntos</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">too</hi> long) and conspicuous are they&rsquo;. Victorius is doubtless right in his opinion that these three words are a repetition in slightly altered terms of the three views of epithets at the commencement of the section; <hi rend="italic">unseasonableness</hi>, the importunity with which they engross the attention, is now represented by the conspicuousness or <pb n="41"/> undue prominence which produces the same effect. A fair specimen of this pompous inflated writing, in epithet and metaphor, is given in Auctor. ad Heren. IV 10. 15, <hi rend="italic">nam qui perduellionibus venditat patriam non satis supplicii dederit si praeceps in Neptunias depulsus erit lacunas.

						<p>On these extracts from Alcidamas Victorius remarks, &ldquo;Cum autem haec omnia a mediis quibusdam orationibus sumpserit, ut vitiosae tantum locutionis exemplum sint, non est quod miremur aut plenam sententiam in nonnullis non esse; aut desiderari, ut in hac, verbum unde casus nominum regantur.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And so this poetical diction by its unsuitableness introduces absurdity and tastelessness into their composition, and obscurity which is due to the verbiage: for whenever (a speaker or writer) accumulates words (throws a heap of them) upon one already informed (already acquainted with his meaning), he destroys (breaks up, dissolves, effaces) all perspicuity (distinctness) by the cloud (or darkness, obscurity) in which he involves his meaning&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> which he brings <hi rend="italic">over</hi> it; <foreign lang="greek">e)piskotei=n th=| kri/sei</foreign>, I 1. 7, see note: <hi rend="italic">to over-cloud</hi>, over-shadow, obscure). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And further, the fourth vice of style is shewn in metaphors; for metaphors also are inappropriate, some because they are laughable&mdash; for the <hi rend="italic">comic</hi> poets also employ metaphors&mdash;others from their exaggeration of the stately (solemn) and tragic (pompous) style: if far-fetched, they are obscure&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">po/rrwqen</foreign>, see on III 2. 12. &lsquo;As Gorgias, &ldquo;things (<foreign lang="greek">pra/gmata</foreign>, actions, occurrences, events, business) all fresh and raw&rdquo;&rsquo;. This certainly is a good exemplification of what it is designed to illustrate: it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> obscure. It seems, however, to mean nothing more than &lsquo;recent events&rsquo;, events <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>, and with the blood in them: the metaphor from a beast just killed. It therefore corresponds to <foreign lang="greek">pro/sfatos</foreign>, &lsquo;fresh&rsquo;, which also stands for &lsquo;recent&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">pro/sfatos</foreign> is specially applied to &lsquo;fresh meat&rsquo;. See Lobeck <hi rend="italic">On Phrynichus</hi>, p. 375, note: examples of <foreign lang="greek">pro/sfatos</foreign> are there given, p. 374. &lsquo;&ldquo;And these things <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> hast sown in disgrace, and reaped in misery&rdquo;. For it smells too much of poetry&rsquo;. [Both the extracts probably belong to the same context, and may perhaps be combined by rendering them thus: &lsquo;all was green and unripe (fresh and flushed with sap), and this was the crop that you sowed in shame to reap in ruin&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">xlwra\ kai\ e)/naima</foreign> possibly refer to the green and unripe stalks of corn, with the sap still fresh in them. This assumes that <foreign lang="greek">ai(=ma</foreign> can be used metaphorically of &lsquo;sap&rsquo;, both coming under the generic notion of &lsquo;vital juice&rsquo;. If so, the metaphor is a sufficiently bold one. Thompson (ed. of the Gorgias, p. 179) notes that <foreign lang="greek">a)/naima</foreign> (which is the reading of Q, Y^{b} and Z^{b}) is &lsquo;well supported, and cannot but be right,&rsquo; and remarks that while the metaphor of sowing and reaping is a mere commonplace, &ldquo;pallid and bloodless affairs&rdquo; would need apology even from a modern.] </p>
						<p>A metaphor, nearly resembling the first of these two, occurs in Demetrius <foreign lang="greek">peri\ e(rmhnei/as, &sect; 116, gi/netai de\ kai\ e)n metafora=| to\ yuxro/n, tre/monta kai\ w)xra\ ta\ pra/gmata</foreign>.

						<p>Hermogenes also, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ i)dew=n *tom. a/, peri\ semno/thtos</foreign> 226 (p. 292, Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci</hi>, vol.

The objection to some of these metaphors, as the &lsquo;sowing and reaping&rsquo;, the &lsquo;selling oneself&rsquo;, and above all, Alcidamas' &lsquo;mirror of human life&rsquo;, seems to shew a change of taste from ancient to modern criticism. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> certainly should object to none of these; and the &lsquo;mirror&rsquo; in particular has become one of the commonest metaphors in our language. The &lsquo;sowing and reaping&rsquo; appears in Plato, Phaedr. 260 C (see Thompson's note), and Aesch. Pers. 821. In Cic. de Orat. II 65. 261 (without comment), <hi rend="italic">ut sementem feceris ita metes.</hi> I Ep. ad Cor. xv. 42&mdash;4. Ep. ad Gal. vi. 7 (and Lightfoot ad loc.). &ldquo;They that sow in tears shall reap in joy: he that now goeth forth weeping, and beareth forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him,&rdquo; Psalm cxxvi. 6, 7. Possibly the antithesis, one of Gorgias' new inventions, may have helped to offend Aristotle's tastes, and it is the effect of the whole phrase, and not of the harmless metaphor alone, that has unconsciously provoked his disapprobation: yet the same occurs in the simple psalm. </p>
						<p>[<foreign lang="greek">kalo\n a)nqrwpi/nou bi/ou ka/toptron</foreign>. Alcidamas elsewhere uses this metaphor from a mirror, in the form of a <hi rend="italic">simile</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ sofi/stwn, &sect; 32, ei)s de\ ta\ gegramme/na katido/ntas w(/sper e)n kato/ptrw| qewrh=sai ta\s th=s yuxh=s e)pido/seis r(a/|dio/n e)stin</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;And as Alcidamas (follower of Gorgias), (called) philosophy a &ldquo;fortress to threaten&rdquo; (a standing menace to), the laws; and the Odyssey a &ldquo;fair mirror of human life&rdquo;; and &ldquo;introducing no such toys, or gawds, in his poetry&rdquo;&mdash;for all such things are subversive of credibility, for the reasons already stated&rsquo;. These are, that forced metaphors, and all such-like artificial graces and ornaments, make the art and the labour of composition apparent; make the speech appear studied and affected, and therefore <hi rend="italic">premeditated</hi> and unreal, and without <hi rend="italic">serious purpose:</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ou)k eu)= kle/ptetai</foreign>: the language of genuine emotion, of earnest and real conviction, which are required for persuasion, being always simple and natural. Probably the most perfect example of art thus disguised by art is to be found in Mark Antony's speeches over Caesar's body in <hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar;</hi> and the first thing he does is to impress upon his audience the entire artlessness and unstudied simplicity of <pb n="47"/> his address: <hi rend="italic">I am no orator as Brutus is, but, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man that love my friend</hi>, &amp;c [III 2. 221]. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pitei/xisma</lemma>] in the first extract from Alcidamas, is interpreted in this passage in the Lexicons of Rost and Palm, and Liddell and Scott&mdash;in Stephens' <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> it is quoted but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> explained&mdash;&lsquo;a bulwark or defence of the laws&rsquo;. But <foreign lang="greek">e)pitei/xisma</foreign> in its proper literal sense seems to be invariably used of an offensive, not defensive, fortification, to command and annoy an enemy's country, like Decelia, which, <foreign lang="greek">th=| xw/ra| e)pw|kei=to</foreign>, Thuc. VII 27. 3 (Bekker, in Thuc. VIII 95, reads <foreign lang="greek">tei/xisma</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e)pitei/xisma</foreign>, on this account) as indeed is required by the <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/</foreign> with which it is compounded; and <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi> may be used in the attack, as well as the defence, of established laws and institutions, whether it be understood as speculation or scientific research. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Gorgias' address to the swallow, when she discharged her excrement&rsquo; [rather, &lsquo;dropped her leavings&rsquo;] upon him as she flew over, is in the best style of tragic diction, (<foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ *g. a)/rista</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rhtai</foreign>,) &ldquo;For shame, Philomel&rdquo;, said he. For to a bird it was no disgrace to have done it, but to a young (unmarried) lady it was. And therefore he was right in his reproach to describe (speak of) her as she <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, and not as she is'. The simplicity of all this is delightful. I could fancy Aristotle winking to his imaginary reader as he wrote the explanation, <foreign lang="greek">o)/rniqi me\n ga/r k.t.l.</foreign>, a bird, you know, &amp;c. [The anecdote illustrates the habit of irony ascribed to Gorgias in 7 &sect; 11, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">met'  ei)rwnei/as o(/per *gorgi/as e)poi/ei</foreign>, as noticed in Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, p. 180.] </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri/ttwma</lemma>] in medicine and natural history is &lsquo;a secretion&rsquo;. It occurs constantly all through Ar.'s writings on Nat. Hist. Plut.

						<p>On the transformation of Procne and Philomela authorities differ. Thucydides, II 29, referring to the story, seems to adopt Gorgias' view, and make Procne the nightingale. Ovid seems to leave the point unsettled, Metaph. VI 667 seq. But tradition in general, and English poetry in particular, have always associated Philomela with the nightingale; e.g. 'Less Philomel will deign a song. Milton's <hi rend="italic">Penseroso</hi>, 56. </p>
						<p>Victorius notices on this passage that Aristotle includes under the designation of metaphor more than is now recognised as belonging to it. The case here, he says, is a mere <hi rend="italic">hypallage</hi> or change of name. Comp. Cic. Orator c.

					<p>From metaphors (c. 2), and the abuse of them (c. 3), we pass on in this chapter to the simile, <foreign lang="greek">ei)kw/n;</foreign> which differs from the metaphor only in this, that the latter concentrates, or fuses into one, the two things or notions brought into comparison. The former separates them by the particle of comparison <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign>. Thus the simile may be regarded as an expanded metaphor. See further on this in Introd. p. 290, and the references to other authorities. </p>
					<div3 id="b3c4s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;The simile too is a metaphor, the difference between them being slight: for when he (Homer<note anchored="yes">The words here assigned to Homer do not occur in our present text: but the substance of them is found at the beginning of the famous simile of the lion, Il.

The former of course includes this amongst the quotations which differ from Homer's text, but draws from this the inference that the <hi rend="italic">text</hi> used by Aristotle (who himself revised it) was here different to our own. I think that nothing more can fairly be inferred from <hi rend="italic">cases like this</hi> than that Aristotle has misquoted the <hi rend="italic">words</hi> of our present version: all the substance is there. As we have already so many times had occasion to notice, Ar. has here quoted from memory; and like all other men of very extensive reading and very retentive memory, Bacon for example, and Walter Scott, has trusted too much to his memory, not referred to his author, and consequently misquoted. And I think that is all that can reasonably be said about it.</note>) says of (his, or the great) Achilles &ldquo;and as a lion he rushed on&rdquo;, it is a simile, but when, &ldquo;he rushed on, a (very) lion&rdquo;, a metaphor: for (in the latter) because they are both brave, he transferred to Achilles the appellation of lion&rsquo;. </p>

					<div3 id="b3c4s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;The simile is useful also in prose, but seldom (to be employed), since it has a poetical character.

						<p>&lsquo;An example of the simile is&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> Similes are a thing like that simile which), &lsquo;that which Androtion (directed, discharged) against Idrieus, that he was like the curs when they are let loose (untied); for <hi rend="italic">they</hi> fly at you and bite, and so Idrieus was vicious (or savage) when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was freed from his chains&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Androtion was an Athenian orator, whose name occurs coupled with many opprobrious epithets not only in the speech delivered against him (Or. 22), but also in that against Timocrates in which he is very frequently mentioned. He was sent on an embassy with Melanopus and Glaucetes, Dem. c. Timocr. &sect;&sect; 12, 13, alibi, to Mausolus prince of Caria 377&mdash;351 B. C. Idrieus was his brother, and Androtion may have met him at his court, and there had the encounter with him which ended in the discharge of his simile. The Scholiast on Isocr. p. 4 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 27 (ap. Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad Or. Att.</hi>) tells us that he was a pupil of Isocrates, and the writer of the &lsquo;Atthis&rsquo;, &ldquo;a work on the history of Attica&rdquo;, <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary</hi>&mdash;which settles the question raised in that Dictionary about the identity of the orator and author&mdash;and the Scholiast adds that he was also the defendant in Demosthenes' speech <hi rend="italic">contra Androtionem.</hi> </p>
						<p>Idrieus was a prince of Caria who succeeded to the throne on the death of his brother Mausolus in 351 B.C. See Mr Bunbury's Art. in <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> He is mentioned by Isocrates, Philippus &sect; 103, as <foreign lang="greek">eu)porw/taton tw=n nu=n peri\ th\n h)/peiron</foreign>. This speech was published in 346 B.C. (Clinton), and therefore subsequent to his accession. It may be presumed that the imprisonment with which Androtion taunts him was due to his brother, and of course prior to his accession to the throne. He is referred to again without his name by Demosth. in the speech de Pace, &sect; 25,&mdash; this was also delivered in 346 B.C. (Clinton <hi rend="italic">F.H.</hi> II 360)&mdash;as &lsquo;the Carian&rsquo;, who had been permitted to take possession of the islands of Chios, Cos, and Rhodes. [A. Schaefer, <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi>, I 351, 440.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Theodamas' comparison of Archidamus to Euxenus&mdash;<hi rend="italic">minus</hi> his geometry, by proportion: for Euxenus also will be Archidamus <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> geometry&rsquo; (a geometrical Archidamus). Nothing is known of the three persons here mentioned. Theodamas compares Archidamus to Euxenus without his geometry; and so&mdash;by the rule of proportion, i. e. in the same proportion&mdash;will Euxenus be to Archidamus with geometry: i. e. <hi rend="italic">equal</hi>, both being alike rascals. The <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> is that of equality. With <foreign lang="greek">e)n tw=| a)na/logon</foreign> supply <foreign lang="greek">lo/gw|</foreign>, &lsquo;in the ratio, or relation, of <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi>&rsquo;. <pb n="50"/> In this we are referred to the &lsquo;proportional metaphor&rsquo;, the last and most approved of the four kinds described in Poet. XXI 7&mdash;16. Comp. Rhet. III 10. 7, where the proportional met. is illustrated at length. Victorius, who agrees in this explanation, supplies a parallel case from Diogenes Laertius, Polemo, IV 3.7, <foreign lang="greek">e)/legen ou)=n to\n me\n *(/omhron e)piko\n ei)=nai *sofokle/a, to\n de\ *sofokle/a *(/omhron tragiko/n</foreign>. Theodamas has taken this common mode of comparison and applied it to the <hi rend="italic">equal worthlessness</hi> of Archidamus and Euxenus. It was probably a standing joke at Athens. The case may have been something of this kind:&mdash;Two contemptible fellows, one of them priding himself upon a little knowledge of geometry, are comparing or disputing their respective merits: &ldquo;you needn't say any more about the matter,&rdquo; says Theodamas, a bystander, who was listening much amused to the discussion, &ldquo;you are both equal, <hi rend="italic">Arcades ambo</hi>, a pair of fools, only Euxenus is a geometrical Archidamus, Archidamus an ungeometrical Euxenus.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that in Plato's Republic (V 469 D), that &ldquo;the spoilers of the dead are like <hi rend="italic">curs</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">kunidi/ois</foreign>, contemptuous, diminutive: an improvement on <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, who merely says <foreign lang="greek">kunw=n</foreign>), which bite the stones (thrown at them) without attacking, setting upon, the thrower&rdquo;&rsquo;. Aristotle, like Bacon, quoting from memory, and assuming a knowledge of the original in his readers, has left out the explanatory part of the illustration which is supplied by Plato. Victorius cites Pacuvius, ap. Nonium, in Armorum Iudicio, <hi rend="italic">Nam canis, quando est percussa lapide, non tam illum appetit, Qui se icit, quam illum eum lapidem, qui ipsa icta est, petit.</hi> </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ h( ei)s to\n dh=mon</lemma>] This, which originally stood in MSS Q, Y^{b}, Z^{b}, and the early editions, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ w(s o( *dhmosqe/nhs ei)s to\n dh=mon</foreign>, was first corrected by Victorius from MS A^{c}. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that (simile, understand <foreign lang="greek">ei)kw/n</foreign>,) (directed) against democracy, that it is like a ship-owner (or ship's captain) strong but slightly deaf&rsquo;. This again is a mere allusion to or reminder of, &lsquo;what every one must surely remember&rsquo;, Plato's celebrated illustration (Rep. VI 488 A) of the evils of democracy by the comparison of it to the undisciplined, untrained, turbulent, anarchical, crew of a ship; each of them, though utterly without qualification for the charge, ready to dispute with the captain the direction and control of the vessel. The passage is referred to by Cicero, de Off. I 25. The words quoted by Ar., few as they are, are not correct: he makes the <foreign lang="greek">nau/klhros</foreign> the representative of the <foreign lang="greek">dh=mos</foreign>, the whole state; in Plato the <foreign lang="greek">nau/klhros</foreign>&mdash;the ship-owner, who in this case is captain, and steers his own vessel&mdash;is the governor, or governors, of the unruly mob of citizens. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And that (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">ei)kw/n</foreign>, as before) applied to the poet's measures, that they are like the bloom of youth without beauty (actual beauty of features): <pb n="51"/> for they, when their bloom has faded (worn off, when they have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> it), and the other (the poet's measures) when they are broken up, seem utterly unlike (their former selves)&rsquo;. This also comes from Rep. X 601 B, <foreign lang="greek">e)/oike</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">ta\ tw=n poihtw=n</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">toi=s tw=n w(rai/wn prosw/pois, kalw=n de\ mh\, oi(=a gi/gnetai i)dei=n o(/tan au)ta\ to\ a)/nqos proli/ph|</foreign>. All poetry is imitation of natural objects, which are invested with certain &lsquo;colours&rsquo; by the poetical art, in which the entire interest and beauty of poetry lie. These colours resemble the bloom on a youthful face, which is merely superficial, when there is nothing corresponding underneath, no beauty of feature or solid attraction. The imitation of the objects themselves may be bad and incorrect, as the face itself may be plain; so that when the bloom, the poetical colours, the graces and ornaments, and especially the <hi rend="italic">numbers</hi>, are removed, there remains only a substratum, which may be worthless, of the direct imitation. Horace, Sat. I 4.60, has pronounced, as is wellknown, a directly contrary opinion, at least in respect of the better kind of poetry. After applying to Lucilius' verses much the same criticism as Plato does to poetry in general, he adds, <hi rend="italic">Non, ut si</hi> solvas &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">postquam discordia tetra Belli ferratos postes portasque refregit</hi>,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Invenias etiam disiecti membra po&lt;*&gt;tae:</hi> from Ennius.

The comparison made here by Pericles of the Samians to babies, which take their food, but cry while they take it, refers to their conduct after the final reduction of the island by Pericles in 440 B. C., Thuc. I 115&mdash;117, after an eight months' contest, <foreign lang="greek">e)cepoliorkh/qhsan e)na/tw| mhni/</foreign>. The sop, i.e. the nourishment, benefits, favours, they had received&mdash;from the <hi rend="italic">Athenian</hi> point of view&mdash;consisted, thinks Schrader, in their freedom, and liberation from the yoke of the Persians and the oligarchs. They nevertheless, though they accepted them, most ungratefully and unreasonably grumbled. Buhle refers to Diodor. XII 27. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (of Pericles again) against the Boeotians; that they are like their <pb n="52"/> own holm-oaks: for as these are cut down (knocked about or down) by themselves&rsquo; (dashed one against another by the wind; so Victorius; or &lsquo;cut down&rsquo;, split by wedges and mallets made of their own wood, like the &ldquo;struck eagle&rdquo; of Aeschylus, Waller, and Byron), &lsquo;so are the Boeotians, by their civil (or domestic) contentions&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Demosthenes compared the people&rsquo; (of the Athenian, or some other, democracy: understand <foreign lang="greek">ei)/kasen</foreign>, which is expressed in the next example) &lsquo;to the sea-sick passengers in the vessels at sea&rsquo;. Their <hi rend="italic">squeamishness</hi>, fastidiousness, nausea with the existing state of things, constant desire of change, is produced by the perpetual <hi rend="italic">agitation, fluctuation</hi> of their political condition and circumstances, the tumultuous waves of the stormy sea of civil commotion: they are sick of the present, and long for change. The Demosthenes here mentioned is, by general consent, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the Orator; more probably the Athenian general of the Peloponnesian war in Thucydides [<hi rend="italic">sine causa</hi>, says Spengel]. </p>
						<p>The very remarkable fact that the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the great Orator is in all probability only once mentioned by Aristotle&mdash;II 24. 8, where Demades' condemnation of his policy is quoted&mdash;though the pair were living together for many years in the same city&mdash;is parallel to a similar silence of Bacon as to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> great contemporary Shakespeare; but still more remarkable in the former case, from the constant occasion offered to the writer on Rhetoric of illustrating his rules and topics from the practice of the first of speakers. It has been already noticed in the Introduction, pp. 45, 46, and notes, where the cases of supposed mention of or allusion to Demosthenes are collected and examined. And this omission will appear still more remarkable when it is contrasted with the nine closely printed columns of references and citations in Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Index Auctorum ad Rhetores Graecos</hi> III 312, seq. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Democrates' comparison of the &ldquo;orators&rdquo; to the nurses who themselves swallow the morsel (which they have previously chewed and softened for the baby), and smear (or slobber over) the babies with the spittle (that they have used in the process)&rsquo;. This is the case of the lawyer and the oyster in the caricature; the legal practitioner swallows the savoury contents, and presents the rival claimants with a shell apiece; so the public speakers swallow the substantial profit themselves, and besmear the audience with their unctuous flattery. Comp. Ar. Eq. 715, (<foreign lang="greek">*kle/wn</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/stamai ga\r au)to\n</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">to\n dh=mon</foreign>, represented as a toothless old man that must be fed like a baby) <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s ywmi/zetai:</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">*)allantopw/lhs</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ka)=|q'  w(/sper ai( titqai/ ge siti/zeis kakw=s: masw/menos ga\r tw=| me\n o)li/gon e)nti/qhs, au)to\s d)</foreign> <pb n="53"/> <foreign lang="greek">e)kei/nou tripla/sion kate/spakas</foreign>. Democrates, the author of this saying, seems, from a passage of Plutarch (in Vict.), Pol. Praec. 803 D, to have been notorious for biting and offensive sayings, <foreign lang="greek">to\ lupou=n a)kai/rws tou\s a)kou/ontas</foreign>: two of them are quoted. Two persons of this name are mentioned by the Orators. One, son of Sophilus, of the deme of Phlya, in a list of the ambassadors sent to Philip in 347 B.C., after the fall of Olynthus (in the spurious <foreign lang="greek">yh/fisma</foreign>, Demosth. de Cor. &sect; 29, see Dissen), and again in another questionable <foreign lang="greek">yh/fisma</foreign>, Dem. de Cor. &sect; 187, purporting to be Demosthenes' decree for the appointment of ambassadors to Thebes and the other Greek states, to negotiate an alliance, and arrest the progress of Philip, June, B. C. 338, Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici, sub anno.</hi> The other, of Aphidna, Isaeus, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tou= *filokth/monos klh/rou</foreign>, &sect; 22, and Aesch. de F. L. &sect; 17. Nothing more seems to be known of either of them. The two are confounded in the article of Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary</hi>, Democrates No. 1; and the saying here quoted is styled &ldquo;a fragment of one of his orations.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Antisthenes' comparison of Cephisodotus the thin (slight, lean) to frankincense, because he gives pleasure by wasting away&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">o( lepto/s</foreign> seems to have been a sobriquet of Cephisodotus; and may also indicate a second point of resemblance between him and frankincense, namely his slight, vaporous, unsubstantial nature. Buhle quotes in illustration the German proverb, <hi rend="italic">die Juden nehmen sich nirgend besser aus als am Galgen.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">*(/oti a)pollu/menos eu)frai/nei</foreign> means that that was the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> enjoyment that was to be got out of him: all the rest of him, his properties, qualities, character, was anything but enjoyable, bad and vicious. On <foreign lang="greek">lepto/s</foreign> contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">paxu/s</foreign>, and men distinguished by this personal peculiarity, Athenaeus has three chapters, XII 75&mdash;77, p. 551, seq. </p>
						<p>Antisthenes is most likely the Cynic philosopher, who outlived the battle of Leuctra, 371 B. C., Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici, sub anno</hi> 365, and was therefore contemporary with Cephisodotus. He, like his successor, Diogenes, had a habit of bitter sarcasm, of which the saying here quoted is a fair specimen. It is truly a bitter jest. See the account of him in Cotton's art. in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Dict.</hi> Vol. I, p. 208 <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> A long list of his sayings is given by Diog. Laert. in his life, VI I, some of which are caustic enough. Mr. Grote, in his account of Antisthenes, <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, III, p. 504, seq., has not specified this cynical feature in his character. [Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, II 304&mdash;316.] </p>
						<p>Cephisodotus, <foreign lang="greek">e)k *kerame/wn</foreign>. Distinguished by Sauppe (<hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad Or. Att.</hi> III, p. 77) from the general of that name, mentioned by Demosth. c. Aristocr. &sect;&sect; 153, 156, 163, 167, as sent (about 359 B. C.) to cooperate with Charidemus in the Hellespont and Chersonese, and elsewhere; by Aesch. c. Ctes. &sect; 51, seq.; by Suidas and Harpocration. Cephis. <foreign lang="greek">e)k *kerame/wn</foreign>, the orator, is referred to in Dem. c. Lept. &sect; 146, together with Leodamas, Aristophon, and Deinias, as one of the best speakers of the time; and again, &sect; 150, <foreign lang="greek">ou(=to/s e)stin ou)deno\s h(=tton tw=n lego/ntwn deino\s ei)pei=n</foreign>. The Cephisodotus who was sent (with Callias, see note on III 2. 10) to the congress at Sparta in B. C. 371, Xen. Hellen. VI 3. 2, VII 1. 12, seems more <pb n="54"/> likely to have been the orator than the general; and so Schneider pronounces, ad Xen. l. c. Three more <hi rend="italic">bons mots</hi> of the same are quoted, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> III 10. 7. In Mr Elder's art. Cephisodotus No. 2, <hi rend="italic">Biog. Dict.</hi>, the two are identified. [Arnold Schaefer distinguishes them, <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi> III 2. 155&mdash;6.] </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For all these may be expressed either as similes or as metaphors: and therefore, plainly, all those that are popular when expressed as metaphors, will be also (if required) similes, and similes metaphors without the descriptive details (the detailed explanation)&rsquo;. &ldquo;A simile is a metaphor <hi rend="italic">writ large</hi>, with the details filled in; this is <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign>.&rdquo; Introd. p. 290. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The <hi rend="italic">proportional metaphor</hi> should always be reciprocally transferable, and to either of the two congeners; for instance, if the goblet is Dionysius' shield, then also the shield may be appropriately called Ares' goblet. Such then are the elements of which the speech (or discourse in general, or prose) is composed&rsquo;. This section, and its concluding observation, are fully explained in detail in the Introd, pp. 290&mdash;292, to which the reader is referred. </p>
						<p>Anaxandrides (Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Comic. Gr.</hi> III. 201, Anax. Fr. Inc.

From Athenaeus, XI. 502 B, we learn that the goblets which Anaxandrides calls <foreign lang="greek">fia/las *)/areos</foreign> are <foreign lang="greek">ta\s karuwta/s</foreign>, &lsquo;walnut-shaped&rsquo;. This tends to confirm Twining's remark, on Poet. XXI. 12, note 185, that there was a resemblance in shape between this kind of cup and a shield, which helped to suggest and justify the metaphor. He refers, as also Buhle ad loc. Poet.&mdash;see also Gr&auml;fenhan, ad Poet. p. 157&mdash;to Hom. Il.

					<p>Here commences the second division of <foreign lang="greek">le/cis</foreign>, the treatment of style as it appears in the <hi rend="italic">combination</hi> of words in <hi rend="italic">sentences</hi>, and the connexion of the latter in harmonious periods. The <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign>, the beginning, basis or <pb n="55"/> foundation, of style in this sense, is <hi rend="italic">purity</hi> of language, <foreign lang="greek">to\ *(ellhni/zein</foreign>, pure and correct Greek, in idiom and choice of words, opposed to barbarism, solecism, and all impropriety in general.

					<p>The divisions of the chapter, the five heads to which Purity may be reduced&mdash;to which are added in the last section two supplementary topics which belong rather to <hi rend="italic">perspicuity</hi>, punctuation and <foreign lang="greek">metaculogi/a</foreign>, or <hi rend="italic">parenthesis</hi>&mdash;are explained and illustrated by references to the works of other rhetoricians, in the analysis, Introd. pp. 292&mdash;5. </p>
					<p>The classification is, as we shall see, extremely imperfect and deficient; and, moreover, the distinction of <hi rend="italic">purity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">perspicuity</hi> is not carefully observed.

					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c5s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;The first of these is (the proper use of) <hi rend="italic">connective particles</hi>, that is, when they are made to correspond, in such a natural position (relation) of priority or posteriority to one another in the sentence, as some of them <pb n="56"/> require; as <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ me/n</foreign> require <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o( de/</foreign> (as correlatives)&rsquo;. That is to say, the connective <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">o( &lsquo;me\n&rsquo; su/ndesmos</foreign>) requires an answering <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> in the apodosis, the one particle necessarily implying the other; and the same with <foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ me/n</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">o( de/; me/n</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">e)gw/</foreign> necessarily implies a <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">other</hi> person, <hi rend="italic">some one else</hi>, (see note on I 6. 22, and Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi>, &sect; 154, there cited,) correlative and subsequent or posterior: and therefore in the construction of the sentence <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> is placed <hi rend="italic">before</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> <hi rend="italic">after</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">u(/steron</foreign>). </p>
						<p>On <foreign lang="greek">su/ndesmos</foreign> as a &lsquo;part of speech&rsquo;, see Introd. Appendix A to Bk. III c. 2, p. 371 seq.; and on its various senses in general, ib. Appendix D, p. 392; and again p. 437, in the analysis c. 25 (26) of the Rhet. ad Alex. The rule here given for the treatment of connectives is derived originally from Isocrates' <foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign>. Ibid. pp. 437, 8. The Rhet. ad Alex. also has it, c. 25 (26), 1, <foreign lang="greek">meta\ de\ sunde/smous ou(\s a)\n proei/ph|s a)podi/dou tou\s a)kolouqou=ntas</foreign>; which is then exemplified by <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">kai\, kai/</foreign>. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)podido/nai</lemma>] to render, or &lsquo;assign, to its proper place&rsquo;, see note on I 1. 7. <foreign lang="greek">a)nt-apodido/nai</foreign> (in the following clause) is to do this so that there is a &lsquo;reciprocal correspondence&rsquo; between the two, <foreign lang="greek">a)nt-a)llh/lois</foreign>. &lsquo;But this reciprocal correspondence between them should be introduced (by the speaker, <foreign lang="greek">dei= to\n le/gonta</foreign>) before the audience has had time to forget (<foreign lang="greek">e(/ws me/mnhtai</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">o( a)kroath/s</foreign>, while he still retains in his recollection) the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of the two connectives, with its accompanying clause; and the two should neither be too widely separated, nor should (another) conjunction be introduced before that which is absolutely required; for (such a construction) is seldom appropriate. &ldquo;But I, as soon as he told me&mdash; for Cleon came entreating and requiring (<hi rend="italic">claiming</hi>, demanding)&mdash;set out with them in my company.&rdquo; For in examples like this, several clauses with conjunctions are prematurely inserted before that which is to correspond as the correlative&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The example of this faulty construction here given is one of the very few which Aristotle has manufactured, contrary to his usual rule of citing examples from the sayings or writings of others supplied by memory. This has been noticed as one of the characteristic differences which distinguish <hi rend="italic">Aristotle's</hi> Rhetoric from the Rhet. ad Alex.&mdash;see Introd. p. 414<note anchored="yes">Where &ldquo;the <hi rend="italic">single</hi> exception, of III 16&rdquo; requires modification: but the exceptions are extremely rare.</note>&mdash;the author of the latter, almost invariably, illustrating his precepts by examples of his own. The example itself, as appears from the <foreign lang="greek">polloi\ su/ndesmoi</foreign> of the ensuing clause, is to be regarded, not as an actual exemplification of the fault, but only as a suggestion of what might be. In itself it is clear enough: but if these parenthetical clauses be <hi rend="italic">multiplied</hi>&mdash;as in fact is very often done in Aristotle's own writings&mdash;. between protasis and apodosis, the hearer, or reader, is very apt to <pb n="57"/> forget the commencement of the sentence, and the argument becomes confused. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But if the clauses that intervene (before) <foreign lang="greek">e)poreuo/mhn</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">between</hi> the <foreign lang="greek">pro/tasis</foreign> and it) be numerous, it becomes obscure&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">metacu/</foreign> is not unfrequently used with only one of the two extremes, between which the intermediate lies, expressed: examples are, Arist. Ach. 432, <foreign lang="greek">*thle/fou r(akw/mata. kei=tai d'  a)/nwqen tw=n *questei/wn r(akw=n, metacu\ tw=n *)inou=s</foreign>. Aesch.

						<p>A violation of this rule is pointed out by Arnold, on Thuc. I 32. 1. Comp. Quint. VIII 2. 14, 15.

						<p>&lsquo;So one point (or head, of merit in style) appears, resides, in the due construction of connectives (conjunctions); a second is to call things by their own proper (special) names, and not by terms that are <hi rend="italic">general</hi> (comprehensive; i. e. names of <hi rend="italic">classes</hi>, abstract terms)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ perie/xonta</lemma> is explained by Victorius and Schrader, &lsquo;periphrases, circumlocutions&rsquo;, such as the general definition for the particular object under it, the <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign> for the <foreign lang="greek">o)/noma</foreign>; or a description in <hi rend="italic">several</hi> words substituted for the <hi rend="italic">single</hi> <foreign lang="greek">i)/dion o)/noma</foreign>, as <hi rend="italic">Ibericas herbas</hi> for <hi rend="italic">spartum, duratos muria pisces</hi> for <hi rend="italic">salsamenta</hi>, Quint.

						<p>&lsquo;As is done (ambiguous terms employed, by speakers and writers) whenever, having in fact nothing to say, they make a pretence (affect) of saying something; for such (those who pretend to a meaning when there is none) express this no-meaning in verse (comp. III 1. 9, <foreign lang="greek">oi( poihtai\ le/gontes eu)h/qh k.t.l.</foreign>), Empedocles, for instance: for this (roundabout, circuitous, phraseology) circumlocution cheats (deludes) by the multitude (accumulation) of words, and the listeners are affected (i.e. imposed upon) in the same way as the vulgar in the presence of diviners; that is, when (the latter) pronounce their ambiguous utterance, they express their approval by a nod of assent, &ldquo;Croesus, if he pass the Halys, shall destroy a mighty realm&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>

						<p>Perhaps the two following verses of Empedocles' collected fragments, <pb n="59"/> Karsten, p. 100, lines 106&mdash;7, may in some degree illustrate Aristotle's allusion to this writer, and his sound without sense; </p>

						<p>Karsten's remarks on Empedocles' style, <hi rend="italic">de Emp. vita et studiis</hi> p. 60, (prefixed to the Fragm. and Comment.) well illustrate this passage, to which he refers. He notices the obscurity of his diction, which appears especially in the symbolical terms, such as <foreign lang="greek">*nh=stis</foreign>, by which he sometimes designates the elements&mdash;see for instance the four lines, Fragm. 211&mdash;214&mdash;and in the ambiguities ascribed to him here by Aristotle, &ldquo;Nonnunquam vero ad <hi rend="italic">oraculorum</hi> gravitatem adsurgit, quales sunt versus illi, <foreign lang="greek">e)/stin *)ana/gkhs xrh=ma k.t.l.</foreign> Fragm. init. <foreign lang="greek">a)lla\ to\ me\n pa/ntwn no/mimon k.t.l.</foreign> v. 404.

It is curious to contrast this contemptuous judgment of his poetry and the general character and value of his writings, as it may be gathered from the two passages of the Rhet. and Poet., with the glowing eulogium of Lucretius, de rerum nat. I 716&mdash;733. After describing the wonders and good things of Sicily, his birthplace, he concludes, <hi rend="italic">Nil tamen hoc habuisse viro praeclarius in se, nec sanctum magis et mirum carumque videtur. Carmina quin etiam divini pectoris eius vociferantur et exponunt praeclara reperta, ut vix humana videatur stirpe creatus.</hi> And still more remarkable is Aristotle's contradiction of himself, if Diogenes Laertius' quotation, VIII 57, is to be depended upon, <foreign lang="greek">e)n de\ tw=| peri\ poihtw=n fhsin o(/ti kai\ *(omhriko\s o( *)empedoklh=s kai\ deino\s peri\ th\n fra/sin, k.t.l.</foreign>&mdash;comp. the passage of the Poetics:&mdash;the possible explanation, that what he said in the one refers to the style, and in the other to the contents, of Empedocles' poem, is excluded by the contemptuous remark upon his style in the Rhetoric. On the passage of Lucretius, see Munro's note, I 733. </p>
						<p>Of the vagabond impostors who hawked about spurious oracles and predictions under the names of <foreign lang="greek">ma/nteis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">xrhsmolo/goi</foreign>, prophets or diviners and soothsayers, Aristophanes has given us specimens, Hierocles in the &lsquo;Peace,&rsquo; 1252, foll., and the nameless <foreign lang="greek">xrhsmolo/gos</foreign> in the &lsquo;Birds,&rsquo; 959, foll. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And by reason of the less liability to mistake in general (by following this course) diviners are accustomed to deliver their predictions in (through the channel, or <hi rend="italic">medium</hi> of) general terms of the fact (which is prophesied), <hi rend="italic">fraus latet in generalibus;</hi> for a man is much more likely to make a hit in playing &ldquo;odd and even&rdquo; by saying &ldquo;even&rdquo; or &ldquo;odd&rdquo;, than <pb n="60"/> any particular number that he has in his hand; or &ldquo;that (the event predicted) <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be&rdquo; than &ldquo;when&rdquo; (it will be); and this is why the soothsayers never add (to their prediction) the <hi rend="italic">precise</hi> time (lit. the definition of the &lsquo;when&rsquo;). All these then (circumlocutions, ambiguities, and the like) are alike (in being <hi rend="italic">faults</hi>) and therefore, unless for some such (reason as was before suggested), to be avoided&rsquo;. </p>

Sat. II 3. 248 (Heindorf's note), Ovid, Nux Eleg. line 79, <hi rend="italic">est etiam, par sit numerus, qui dicat, an impar.</hi> The game might be played with any kind of counters, beans, acorns, coins&mdash;in Carion's house, after he had grown rich, Arist. Plut. 816, &ldquo;the servants played at odd and even with golden staters.&rdquo; It is usually described as played by two persons, one of whom held in his closed hand a number of counters, and the other had to guess whether it was odd or even. This was no doubt one way of playing it, but there was also another not quite so simple, as appears from this passage of the Rhetoric, and also from the Schol. on Plut. 1057, in which the guess was made at the <hi rend="italic">number</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">po/sa</foreign>. In the Plutus, l. c., the game is played with &lsquo;walnuts&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ka/rua</foreign>, and the Scholiast's comment is, &ldquo;one grasps a handful of walnuts, and with his hand stretched out asks, how many? and if the other guesses right, he receives all the contents of his hand; if wrong, he <hi rend="italic">pays</hi> the number found in the other's hand when opened.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;This is wanting (in compositions in which) conjunctions and other connecting particles are numerous, and such as are not easy to <hi rend="italic">punctuate</hi>, like those of Heraclitus&rsquo;. This does not contradict what was said before about the necessity of conjunctions, &amp;c., to ensure perspicuity, it only condemns the excessive use of them; a long string of connected clauses is apt to lead to obscurity: the due mean is to be observed, here as elsewhere.

This want of punctuation is not by any means the only, or indeed the principal, source of the obscurity of the mystic enigmatical sayings of the &lsquo;dark&rsquo; philosopher. The remains of these have been collected by Schleiermacher, Bernays [and Bywater] in their respective tracts, and several of the most remarkable quoted by Thompson in his note on Butler's <hi rend="italic">Lect. on Anc.

						<p>&lsquo;For to punctuate Heraclitus' writing is a hard matter (a difficult <hi rend="italic">job, a business</hi>), owing to the uncertainty as to which of the two (words), the preceding or following, (any particular word) is attached; as for instance, at the commencement of his (<foreign lang="greek">au)tou=</foreign>, masc.) composition, where he says, &ldquo;Of this reason constant (being) ever (reading <foreign lang="greek">tou=d'  e)o/ntos a)ei/</foreign>) men come into being devoid of understanding&rdquo;; for this leaves it uncertain to which of the two (<foreign lang="greek">e)o/ntos</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)cu/netoi gi/gnontai</foreign>) the word <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> should be attached by the punctuation&rsquo;. Bekker, who in his first edition reads <foreign lang="greek">tou= de/ontos</foreign>, has in the third altered it to <foreign lang="greek">tou=d'  e)/ontos</foreign>. Spengel retains the former&mdash;which is the reading of MS A^{c} (or A). <foreign lang="greek">tou=d'  e)o/ntos</foreign>, which had been already proposed by Victorius from a passage of Sext. Empir., is undoubtedly right. The words are quoted also by Clemens Alex. <hi rend="italic">Strom.</hi> V 14, p. 716, by Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">Praep. Evang.</hi> XIII, and by Sextus Empiricus <hi rend="italic">adv.

Clemens and Eusebius have <foreign lang="greek">tou= de/ontos</foreign> (Schleierm.). The <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign>, according to Sextus&mdash; and this is confirmed by Heraclitus' context, which he quotes&mdash;is the universal reason, <foreign lang="greek">o( qei=os lo/gos</foreign>, of which men are unconscious, depending rather upon sense, though it is the true <foreign lang="greek">krith/rion. toi=ton dh\ to\n koino\n lo/gon kai\ qei=on, kai\ ou(= kata\ metoxh\n gino/meqa logikoi/, krith/rion a)lhqei/as fhsi\n o( *(hra/kleitos</foreign>. This interpretation of course requires <foreign lang="greek">e)/ontos</foreign>. An additional argument in its favour is suggested by Schleiermacher, that if <foreign lang="greek">deo/ntos</foreign> had been the reading in Aristotle's copy of Heraclitus, he would have found no difficulty in the reference of <foreign lang="greek">a)ei/</foreign>. The title of his <foreign lang="greek">su/ggramma</foreign>&mdash;which is omitted by Diogenes in his life, IX I, though the <foreign lang="greek">su/ggramma</foreign> itself is twice mentioned, &sect;&sect; 6, 7, and some of its contents quoted in the 7th and follow<pb n="63"/> ing sections&mdash;seems to have been <foreign lang="greek">peri\ fu/sews</foreign>; the ordinary title of works upon similar subjects by the earlier cosmical speculators, as Empedocles, Anaxagoras, &amp;c. </p>

In the latter case the &lsquo;pomp&rsquo; of style becomes &lsquo;pomposity&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;swelling phrases&rsquo; turgid and inflated <hi rend="italic">ampullae.</hi> And in a moral sense the same notion of <hi rend="italic">fastus</hi> is attached to it, and it comes to denote vanity, ostentation, arrogance, as Plat. Meno 90 A, where it is personal, and opposed to <foreign lang="greek">ko/smios</foreign>. In Soph. Oed. Col. 1162, <foreign lang="greek">braxu\n mu=qon ou)k o)/gkou ple/wn</foreign> is a short conversation without &lsquo;bulk&rsquo;, not unnaturally and unreasonably <hi rend="italic">swelled out</hi> or lengthened. <foreign lang="greek">o)gkwqei\s xlidh=|</foreign> in the same author (Fragm. Inc. ap. Stobaeum, No. 679, Dind.) has the same sense in a moral application. And so <foreign lang="greek">o)/gkon ai)/rein</foreign>, Soph. Aj. 129. <foreign lang="greek">to\ o)gkhro/n</foreign>, Ar. Eth. N. IV. 13, <hi rend="italic">sub finem</hi>, is again &lsquo;inflated&rsquo;, of mere bulk without solidity, show without substance; i. e. morally, &lsquo;ostentation&rsquo;, a pretentious air and exterior, assumption.

						<p>&lsquo;To dignity, amplification of style, the following things contribute; first, the substitution of definition (or detailed description) for the (direct, proper) name (of the object); to say for example not <hi rend="italic">circle</hi>, but &ldquo;a plane figure which is in all points equidistant from the centre&rsquo;&rdquo;. One would have supposed that this was an exemplification rather of the unfavourable sense of <foreign lang="greek">o)/gkos</foreign>: it also seems to be opposed to what was said c. 5. 3, <foreign lang="greek">toi=s i)di/ois o)no/masi le/gein kai\ mh\ toi=s perie/xousin</foreign>: and in fact dignity ought not to interfere with perspicuity. The two precepts, however, do not in reality contradict one another. The use of abstract, general terms, instead of the plain and direct individual names, is a source of obscurity: there is no obscurity, but rather the contrary, in setting forth the definition of it at length. &lsquo;For (the purpose of) brevity the contrary (is the rule), the proper name, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the definition&rsquo;. Both of these precepts appear in the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 22 (23) &sect;&sect; 3 and 5.

It is to be observed that as connecting particles occur much more frequently in Greek than in our own language, the want of them, which constitutes <hi rend="italic">asyndeton</hi>, would be much more disagreeable to the Greeks than to us, and would give the composition the appearance of being both naked and disjointed. Consequently the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> rule (which is stated here) is to avoid it: but in special cases, where the aim is to give emphasis and vigour, rapidity and conciseness to a narrative, it may often be used with advantage, as the examples will shew.

						<p>&lsquo;And the (practice) of Antimachus is useful (for this purpose), to draw the materials of a description from the attributes, (qualities, virtues, excellences,) which (the thing described) has <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, as he does in the case of Teumessus, &ldquo;There is a windy low hill&rdquo;; for in that way the amplification may be carried to infinity&rsquo;. This is a quotation from Antimachus' Theb&auml;is, the expedition of Adrastus and his six Argive companions against Thebes, the <foreign lang="greek">e(pta\ e)pi\ *qh/bas</foreign>. In this he had occasion to mention Teumessus, &ldquo;a village of Boeotia in the plain of Thebes, standing upon a low rocky hill of the same name&rdquo;. Launching out, as his manner was, into an episodical encomium of this little hill, he expended many verses upon it <foreign lang="greek">dia\ pollw=n e)pw=n</foreign>, &ldquo;enumerating all the virtues that did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> belong to it&rdquo;. Strabo, IX. 2, Boeotia, p. 409. Strabo, like Aristotle, only quotes these five words, adding, as a reason for breaking off there, <foreign lang="greek">gnw/rima de\ ta\ e)/ph</foreign>. This same poem is referred to by Horace, A. P. 146, <hi rend="italic">Nec reditum Diomedis ab interitu Meleagri;</hi> a narrative of Diomedes' fortune and return seems to have been interwoven with the main subject of the poem.

Cyclus</hi>, p. 163; also quoted by Orelli ad loc. Antimachus was an elder contemporary of Plato. The occasion of their meeting is related by Plutarch, Lysand. 18, and differently by Cicero, Brutus 51 &sect; 191, <hi rend="italic">Antimachum, Clarium poetam</hi>, ...<hi rend="italic">qui quum convocatis auditoribus legeret eis magnum illud quod novistis volumen suum</hi> (the Thebais), <hi rend="italic">et eum legentem omnes praeter Platonem reliquissent, Legam, inquit, nihilominus: Plato enim mihi unus instar est omnium millium.</hi> (Welcker pronounces both forms of the story unworthy of credit.) In <hi rend="italic">magnum</hi> Cicero no doubt refers not to the merit or celebrity, but to the bulk of the poem. His style is spoken of by Dionysius de Comp. Verb. c. 22 (v. 150, ed. Reiske), together with that of Empedocles, Pindar, Aeschylus, Thucydides and Antiphon, as belonging to the <foreign lang="greek">au)sthra\ le/cis</foreign>, already described. To class him with these authors may seem to imply approbation. Quintilian, X 1. 53, in a comparison of the Epic poets, places him next to&mdash;though far below&mdash;Homer. <hi rend="italic">Contra in Antimacho vis et gravitas et minime vulgare eloquendi genus</hi> (this agrees with Dionysius) <hi rend="italic">habet laudem. Sed quamvis ei secundas fere grammaticorum</hi> (of Alexandria) <hi rend="italic">consensus deferat; et affectibus et iucunditate et dispositione et omnino arte deficitur, ut plane manifesto appareat quanto sit aliud proximum esse, aliud secundum:</hi> (so Horace of Jupiter, <hi rend="italic">nec viget quicquam simile aut</hi> secundum; proximos illi tamen <hi rend="italic">occupavit Pallas honores</hi>). He is called by some authors Clarian, by others Colophonian. Claros was a small town near Colophon, a colony and dependency of it. Most probably Claros was his birthplace, for which the more important and neighbouring mother-city was substituted. See further on Antimachus in Schrader and Buhle's notes; and on Teumessus, Valken. ad Phoen. 1107. </p>

						<p>I transcribe Twining's excellent note on this passage, which well illustrates our present subject. Note 189, p. 446. &ldquo;Metaphors from their nature are in danger of being obscure or forced, though it is essential to their beauty and effect that they should be clear and apposite. For this purpose a metaphor may be guarded in various ways. If the simple substitution of the improper for the proper term would be obscure or harsh, the metaphor may be converted into an <hi rend="italic">image</hi> or <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi> (referring to Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ e(rmhnei/as</foreign> &sect; 80); it may be used <hi rend="italic">analogically</hi>, and we may say <foreign lang="greek">fia/lh *)/arews</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">fia/lh a)/oinos</foreign>; or if that be not sufficient for perspicuity&mdash;that is, if the meaning be not sufficiently pointed out by the manner or circumstances in which the expression is introduced&mdash; we may join these (<foreign lang="greek">fia/lh *)/arews a)/oinos</foreign>), or even add to either of them the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> word itself. There is a fine instance of this <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> mode of explaining a metaphor in Isaiah li. 21, &lsquo;Thou drunken, <hi rend="italic">but not with wine.</hi>&rsquo; The same end is often answered by an epithet <hi rend="italic">affirming</hi> of the thing <hi rend="italic">expressed</hi> some quality of the thing <hi rend="italic">signified;</hi> thus ships are <hi rend="italic">floating bulwarks</hi> [Mason's Ode to the Naval Officers], and the lyre a <hi rend="italic">chorded shell</hi>, where Dryden [Song for St Cecilia's Day, line 17, <hi rend="italic">Jubal struck the chorded shell</hi>,] has made the same use of the affirmative epithet <hi rend="italic">chorded</hi> that Theognis did of the negative <foreign lang="greek">a)/xordos</foreign> in his metaphorical expression for a bow, <foreign lang="greek">fo/rmigc a)/xordos</foreign> (comp. Rhet. III 11. 11, and Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">peri\ e(rmhnei/as</foreign> &sect; 85, quoted in Introd. p. 297). Sometimes the explanatory epithet is itself a metaphor; as in the <foreign lang="greek">pterwtoi=s a(/rmasi</foreign> (Iph. Aul. 251) of Euripides, &lsquo;winged chariots&rsquo;. Here we have a double metaphor: <hi rend="italic">chariot</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ship</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">wing</hi> for <hi rend="italic">sail.</hi>&rdquo; <pb n="71"/> </p>
						<p>He then concludes with four examples of these privative explanatory epithets from the Greek Tragedians, which I have already quoted with some others in the Introduction p. 297, in the note on this passage of the Rhetoric. Add to these Cephisodotus' &lsquo;parti-coloured millstones&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">mu/lwnas poiki/lous</foreign>, III 10. 7, by which he meant to represent the &lsquo;crushing&rsquo; properties of the Athenian &lsquo;triremes&rsquo; in devastating the coasts and islands and exacting tribute. These differ from millstones in having their sides gaily painted in various colours. <foreign lang="greek">a)/pteros fa/tis</foreign>, Aesch. Agam. 267 (contrasted with <foreign lang="greek">e)/pea pteroe/nta</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">a)/pteros o)/rnis</foreign>, Eur. Iph. Taur. 1095. [Eur. Phoen. 791 (<foreign lang="greek">*)/arhs</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">kw=mon a)naulo/taton proxoreu/eis, 808 *sfiggo\s a)mousota/taisi su\n w)|dai=s</foreign>, Herc. Fur. 879, 891, 892. Similarly the Italian poet, Guarini, called birds &lsquo;winged lyres&rsquo;.] </p>
						<p>It remains to notice the <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of the metaphor, which, according to Victorius, is Trumpet: sound of trumpet (anonymous) :: lyre : <foreign lang="greek">me/los</foreign>, the music of the lyre (<hi rend="italic">properly</hi> so called). To qualify the harshness, throw light on the obscurity, of this improper application of the word <foreign lang="greek">melos</foreign>, the epithet <foreign lang="greek">a)/luron</foreign> &ldquo;not that of the lyre&rdquo; is added. </p>
						<p>One more remark on privative epithet, which has not been pointed out. They have two uses, the one to <hi rend="italic">qualify</hi>, the other to <hi rend="italic">contradict</hi>, the substantive they are joined with. In the latter case they are not metaphors at all. This is what is called the figure <hi rend="italic">oxymoron</hi>, which combines in one expression two contradictory notions of which the one denies the other: <foreign lang="greek">e)xqrw=n a)/dwra dw=ra</foreign> (Aj. 655), an enemy's gifts are no gifts at all; <foreign lang="greek">xa/ris a)/xaris</foreign> &ldquo;graceless grace&rdquo;, or &ldquo;thankless favour&rdquo;; <foreign lang="greek">mh/thr a)mh/twr</foreign>, Soph.

						<p>&lsquo;This <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> consists in a style of composition (<foreign lang="greek">le/ghtai</foreign> of speaking <hi rend="italic">and</hi> writing) such as is neither off-hand (i. e. careless and slovenly, <foreign lang="greek">au)toka/bdalos</foreign> is &lsquo;extemporaneous&rsquo;) on a dignified, nor stately on a slight and mean (lit. <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi>), subject, and has no ornamental epithets (<foreign lang="greek">e)ph=|</foreign> refers to <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/qeta</foreign>) attached to mean words; otherwise, it (the composition) has the appearance of mere comedy (i. e. laughable; its subject <pb n="72"/> is <foreign lang="greek">to\ geloi=on</foreign>: Poet.

In the Paris MS, indeed, there is a mark of omission which Buhle and Hermann have indicated in their editions. He understands <foreign lang="greek">ko/smos</foreign> to signify &ldquo;such an epithet as embellishes or <hi rend="italic">elevates</hi> the thing to which it is applied.&rdquo; Though he quotes this passage of the Rhetoric, he does not notice that <foreign lang="greek">e)ph=|</foreign> here applied to it proves that the kind of <hi rend="italic">ornament</hi> intended by <foreign lang="greek">ko/smos</foreign> is an ornamental <hi rend="italic">epithet.</hi> See also Gr&auml;fenhan, on Poet.

						<p>&lsquo;Emotion is expressed, if insult (wanton outrage) (be what you <pb n="74"/> are describing), by the language of one in anger; if impiety or anything foul or base, by that of indignation and reluctance (hesitat on) even to name (or mention) it; what is praiseworthy, by that of admiration; what is pitiable, in a low tone and language, and so on for the rest in like manner&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;This appropriate language (proper or peculiar to the emotion to be represented) also gives a plausible air to the facts (or statements under consideration): for the mind draws a false inference to the truth of the <hi rend="italic">speaker</hi> (the reality of his emotion, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> hence to the truth of his statements), because every one under similar circumstances feels the same&mdash;so that they (the audience) are led to think, even though the fact is really not so, that the things (the facts of the case, the things under consideration) are as the speaker represents them (<foreign lang="greek">au)ta\ e)/xein fhsi/</foreign>, Buhle), and (besides this) the listener always has a fellow-feeling with one who speaks with emotion, even though what he says is naught (worthless; proves nothing)&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">paralogi/zetai k.t.l.</lemma>] The fallacy is this. A speaker puts himself into a passion in describing some atrocity imputed to his opponent, assuming the tone of anger or virtuous indignation, which would <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> be provoked by the act as described. People always sympathize with the expression of emotion, and the audience, knowing what it is to be angry themselves, and perceiving by reference to their own experience the &lsquo;appropriateness&rsquo; of the language, tone, and gestures, to the true expression of the passion, draw from this the fallacious inference that the speaker must be in earnest, <hi rend="italic">as they were</hi> when they were similarly affected, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> that the facts that he states must be true: arguing from the truth of the delineation to the truth of the fact stated. </p>
						<p>The logic of the fallacy is explained in de Soph. El. c. 5, 167 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 1 seq. It proceeds from the false assumption, in antecedent and consequent, that they are reciprocally convertible: that if a consequent always follows an antecedent the converse is likewise true, and that the consequent in<pb n="75"/> variably implies the antecedent as well as the antecedent the consequent. Here, the language &amp;c. used <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the ordinary sign of the emotion represented, as they themselves know from their own experience; and <hi rend="italic">does</hi> usually arise in men as a consequence of such facts as those alleged: the antecedent is then falsely inferred &lsquo;reciprocally&rsquo; from the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>, but not necessary or universal, consequent. This may be otherwise represented as a confusion between the <foreign lang="greek">shmei=on</foreign>, the usual and ordinary, and the <foreign lang="greek">tekmh/rion</foreign>, the universal and necessary, accompaniment of something thereby signified.

						<p>&lsquo;And this is the reason why many (speakers) try to stun (overwhelm, confound) their hearers with the clamour that they raise&rsquo;.

The <foreign lang="greek">dio/</foreign> is, because the listener always sympathizes with the language and raised tone of passion; the more violent the expression of it, the more he is likely to be affected.

						<p>&lsquo;And this mode of proof arising out of (external) signs (exhibited in language, tone, and action) may be invested also with an ethical character, in that (in so far as) that which is appropriate (i. e. the appropriate language, &amp;c.) to each class and moral state (i. e. character, <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>; the sum of the moral states and habits which characterizes the individual) is attendant upon each of them&rsquo;. The datives <foreign lang="greek">ge/nei</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e(/cei</foreign> seem to belong equally to <foreign lang="greek">a)kolouqei=</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a(rmo/ttousa</foreign>. Compare, with what is said here of <foreign lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, III 16. 9. </p>
						<p>In the Introduction, p. 108 foll., on <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, I have endeavoured to shew (against Spengel) that there are three kinds of <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> distinguished by Aristotle in the Rhetoric; (1) the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=| le/gonti</foreign>, the personal character exhibited by the speaker himself, serving as a kind of proof of his sincerity, competency, and good will; (2) the characters of certain <pb n="76"/> ages and classes, with which the speaker must be previously acquainted, in order to accommodate his general tone, and the opinions he expresses, to the tastes and dispositions of his audience, their political sentiments and such like: as for instance an audience of rich and poor, young and old, aristocratic and democratical, must be addressed each in a different tone and with different language, suitable to their several opinions and prejudices; and (3) what I have called the <hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi> characters, which are treated only in the third book as belonging to style, and are still more important, and occupy a larger share of attention in poetry (especially dramatic poetry)&mdash;and therefore in the Poetics XV&mdash;than in the prose of Rhetoric. These consist in the accurate representation of <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> character, as described by Horace, A. P. 114 seq. See also the instances given in the parallel passage, III 16. 9, above referred to. This is what is now called &lsquo;keeping&rsquo;, and seems to me to be totally distinct from the second, which refers to <hi rend="italic">classes;</hi> although the two have some points in common. The principal differences between them are that the latter describes <hi rend="italic">personal peculiarities</hi>, and is an ingredient of <hi rend="italic">propriety of style:</hi> and the two are therefore treated in different parts of the work. The dramatic <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">morata oratio</hi>, does however in some inferior degree assist the <hi rend="italic">argument</hi>, as Aristotle has just told us, and is a <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of <foreign lang="greek">dei=cis</foreign>; it conveys a favourable impression of the accuracy of the speaker, and the truth of his description. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;By <hi rend="italic">class</hi> I mean (according to age, different ages) the various ages of life, youth, manhood, old age; and (sexes) woman or man, and (natives of different countries) Lacedaemonian or Thessalian; and by <hi rend="italic">states</hi> (moral states) those by which the character (or quality) of a man's life is determined: for it is not every kind of <hi rend="italic">state</hi> that determines the character of men's lives&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">*(/ecis</foreign>, an acquired, developed, permanent, habit, is a general term (opposed to <foreign lang="greek">dia/qesis</foreign> an incomplete and progressive state, Categ.) and applicable to various states in men and things, <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">intellectual</hi> and <hi rend="italic">moral.</hi> It is only the last two that determine the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>. </p>

Victorius supposes, in accordance with his preconceived opinion of a still continued hostility between Aristotle and Isocrates, that the latter is here alluded to; quoting four instances of it from Isocrates and two from Demosth. de Cor. This is hardly enough to sustain the charge. On this subject, see Introd. p. 41, foll. </p>

						<p>The greatest care and pains are always requisite to give the speech an <hi rend="italic">artless</hi>, natural, and unstudied character: the rule <hi rend="italic">ars est celare artem</hi> is of the utmost importance in effecting the end and object of a speech, persuasion or conviction. See, for instance, III 2. 4, 5; 8. 1. This applies equally to proportion, as an element of propriety. It has been laid down that a certain proportion (or resemblance) of style, tone, and manner to the subject is always to be observed: but this, if carried too far, will defeat its own object; the study will appear, and the suspicions of the hearers will be aroused. For instance, there is a proportion in the tone of voice and manner of delivery, in the expression of features and the action, to the subject of the words delivered: these however should not be all employed at once: if the words have a <hi rend="italic">harsh</hi> sound&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">sklhra\ o)no/mata</foreign> are exemplified by Hermogenes <foreign lang="greek">peri\ i)dew=n, a/, peri\ traxu/thtos</foreign>, p. 236, II 300 (<hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> Spengel), by <foreign lang="greek">a)tarpo/s, e)/marpten, e)/gnamye</foreign>, &amp;c., and again, Ib. <foreign lang="greek">b)</foreign>, (II 359), by a line from Homer in which <foreign lang="greek">a)gka\s e)/marpte</foreign>, both of them objectionable on this ground, occur together. &ldquo;The voice and the features and the rest should not be made to assume a harsh expression, else the study becomes apparent&mdash;it will give the composition a stiff and studied appearance, make it look affected and overdone: whereas, if one or two of them are made to correspond, and the rest not, the same <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> is produced, whilst the <hi rend="italic">artifice</hi> escapes detection&rdquo;. Introd. pp. 301, 2. Compare on this subject, Cic. de Or. III 57. 216. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Further, not to employ all these proportions (or correspondences) together; for by the observance of this precept (following this rule) the listener is deluded (i.e. the art is disguised). I mean, to take an instance if the words used are harsh (in <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>), not to (extend the harshness) to <pb n="79"/> the tone of voice and the features and the other appropriate (correspondences or proportions)&rsquo;: (we must supply here either <foreign lang="greek">xrh=sqai</foreign> from <foreign lang="greek">xrh/sasqai</foreign> preceding; or, <hi rend="italic">ad sensum</hi>, from <foreign lang="greek">sklhra\ h)=|, sklhro/thta prosfe/rein</foreign>, or something else similar). &lsquo;Otherwise the true character of each of them (their studied and artificial character, <foreign lang="greek">pe/plasqai</foreign> <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> 2. 4) becomes manifest&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Vahlen, in his observations on the Rhetoric, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Vienn. Acad.</hi> p. 144 (already referred to), says, that nothing else can be implied in <foreign lang="greek">toi=s a(rmo/ttousin</foreign> than the adaptation of voice and feature to subject, already specified; and therefore proposes to strike out <foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">toi=s a(rmo/ttousin</foreign> so that <foreign lang="greek">toi=s a(rmo/ttousin</foreign> may be connected with, not distinguished from, the two preceding. This seems to me quite unnecessary. Besides the two proportions specified by Aristotle, there is at all events <foreign lang="greek">u(po/krisis</foreign>, appropriate action or gesticulation, that may be brought into correspondence; and also the mode of delivery may be distinguished&mdash;at all events for the nonce&mdash;from the other three. And he adds a similar objection to another perfectly innocent <foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign>, in I 15. 28, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ w(s ou(=tos k.t.l.</foreign>, the sense (as I have explained it in the paraphrase of the Introduction) being at least equally good with, as without, the conjunction. </p>
						<p>In the succeeding clause&mdash;which guards against a possible misapprehension of the foregoing, as though it were meant that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> this kind of adaptation should be avoided, and intimates that the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> is to be observed here as everywhere else; that we do not rush into the opposite extreme, like those who <hi rend="italic">dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt</hi>&mdash;the connexion of thought might seem to require that <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n de/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n ou)=n</foreign> should change places. If the two clauses, <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n de/, e)a\n ou)=n</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to be connected in sense, we require some kind of opposition, expressed by a restrictive or adversative particle such as <foreign lang="greek">me/ntoi, de/</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">a)lla/</foreign>, to establish this, and not one that conveys an inference or consequence, which does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> follow from the foregoing. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But if (the speaker introduce) one and omit the other (make the adaptation in some cases, in others not), he does the same thing (really has recourse to study and art) and yet escapes detection. So then&rsquo;, (it results in a general way from all this,) or, &lsquo;well then&mdash;as I say&mdash;if things soft and mild (for instance, the expression of compassion) be represented by a harsh tone and language, or harsh things in soft tone and language (so Victorius), it (the expression or things expressed) loses all its plausibility (or power of persuasion)&rsquo;. If <foreign lang="greek">ou)=n</foreign> be retained, it must be understood (I think) as I have rendered it. There will be no connexion between the clause which it introduces and that which immediately precedes it, and <foreign lang="greek">ou)=n</foreign> will be a mere continuative, as in the narrative use of <foreign lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign>&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">inferential</hi>, as with our <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, having degenerated into a <hi rend="italic">temporal</hi> sense, denoting mere continuation or succession. The clause will then be a sort <pb n="80"/> of <hi rend="italic">general</hi> conclusion from all that has been said in this section on the adaptation of delivery to subject-matter. <foreign lang="greek">a)pi/qanon</foreign>, see III 3. 4. </p>

						<p>This is, as usual, a misquotation; Isocrates wrote, Paneg. &sect; 186, <foreign lang="greek">fh/mhn de\ kai\ mnh/mhn</foreign> (Aristotle ought not to have forgotten this, for it is a striking case of <foreign lang="greek">o(moiote/leuton</foreign>, or rhyming termination, one of the new figures introduced into Rhetoric by Gorgias and his school): <foreign lang="greek">fh/mhn de\ kai\ mnh/mhn kai\ do/can po/shn tina\ xrh\ nomi/zein h)\ zw=ntas e(/cein h)\ teleuth/santas katalei/yein tou\s e)n toiou/tois toi=s e)/rgois a)risteu/santas</foreign>; It is in fact a finely written sentence. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;This also accounts for the fitness of this kind of language for poetry, because poetry is inspired.

Whilst Gorgias was in Thessaly, where he seems to have spent a considerable time at Larissa, some Thessalian, who had no doubt heard his boast that he was able and ready to answer any question upon any subject, took him at his word, and asked him what constituted a citizen.&mdash;This is the constitutional question which gives occasion to Aristotle's quotation.&mdash;Partly in jest, and partly because he was really at a loss, he replied, that citizens were made by citizen-manufacturers: as the vessels made by mortarmanufacturers were mortars, so those made by the Larissaean-manufacturers were Larissaean citizens or Larissaeans: for there were such people as <foreign lang="greek">*larissaiopoioi/. *la/rissa</foreign>, besides the Thessalian city, denotes also some kind of kettle or other cooking-utensil. The reply is much the same as if some one being asked, What makes a citizen of the town of Sandwich? were to answer, &lsquo;a cook, for he is a sandwich-maker&rsquo;; and is no bad specimen of the way in which Gorgias most likely fulfilled his promise of solving any problem whatsoever that was proposed to him.

					<p>On rhythm in Prose. </p>
					<p>In the paraphrase of the Introduction I have already given an outline of the contents of this chapter and their connexion, with references and some details, pp. 303&mdash;306. And on rhythm in general, and its application to prose, there is an Appendix (C), pp. 379&mdash;392; in which is a full account of its original and derived significations in the first part, and of its distinction from <foreign lang="greek">me/tron</foreign> in the second. The commentary on this chapter will therefore deal principally with the details of the language, allusions, and such particulars as require explanation, which are omitted in the paraphrase. </p>
					<p>In the fragments of Isocrates' <foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign>, collected by Benseler in the Teubner series, Vol. II p. 276, we have the following, fragm. 4&mdash;cited from <pb n="83"/> Maximus Planudes ad Hermog. and Joannes Siceliotes&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">o(/lws de\ o( lo/gos mh\ lo/gos e)/stw: chro\n ga/r: mhde\ e)/mmetros: katafane\s ga/r: a)lla\ memi/xqw panti\ r(uqmw=|, ma/lista i)ambikw=| h)\ troxai+kw=|</foreign>. The first of these precepts is in entire agreement with Aristotle, &sect; 1; the disagreement of the second with the statements of &sect; 4 is equally striking. It seems from what is said of Thrasymachus and the paean in &sect; 4, that the subject of prosaic rhythm was not included in the <foreign lang="greek">te/xnai</foreign> of himself and the succeeding writers on Rhetoric. It does not appear even in the Rhet. ad Alex. Cicero, de Or. III 44. 173, attributes to Isocrates the first introduction of &lsquo;numbers&rsquo; into prose composition. </p>
					<p>Dionysius de Comp. Verb. c. 25 (p. 197 R.) refers to this chapter of Aristotle in support of his observations on rhythm in prose. His own opinions on the subject are given, pp. 195, 6. </p>
					<p>References are made by Cicero to this chapter (&sect; 4 et seq.), de Or. 1 47. 182, 183, in the course of his dissertation on rhythm, from &sect; 171 foll. The same subject is treated, Orat. c. LXIII 212 seq. The various rhythms heroic, iambic, trochaic, &amp;c. are discussed in c. LXIV, where Aristotle's opinions, as expressed in this chapter, are twice referred to, &sect;&sect; 215, 218. In &sect; 214 we have, temeritas <hi rend="italic">ex tribus brevibus et longa est, quem</hi> (sc. paeanem) <hi rend="italic">Aristoteles ut optimum probat, a quo dissentio.</hi> Cicero is referring to this chapter, from which the other references are taken: and as this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> found there, he must be either quoting inexactly, from memory, or perhaps confounding Aristotle's opinion on the point with that of one of the other rhetoricians whom he mentions, &sect; 218. There is likewise an incorrectness in the opinion which he there attributes to Aristotle, that the paean is, <hi rend="italic">aptissimus orationi vel orienti vel</hi> mediae: <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> says nothing of the &lsquo;middle&rsquo; of the sentence. </p>

						<p>This however is not the point of the reference here.

This character always belonged to the tetrameter; and hence we are told that the dithyrambs, from which Tragedy took its rise, were originally written in this measure, which was afterwards exchanged for the iambic, the metre nearest to the language of ordinary conversation, when the <hi rend="italic">dialogue</hi> had been introduced, and Tragedy assumed a regular form. <foreign lang="greek">*to/ te me/tron</foreign> (of Tragedy) <foreign lang="greek">e)k tetrame/trou i)ambei=on e)ge/neto: to\ me\n ga\r prw=ton tetrame/trw| e)xrw=nto dia\ to\ saturikh\n kai\ o)rxhstikwte/ran ei)=nai th\n poi/hsin, le/cews de\ genome/nhs au)th\ h( fu/sis to\ oi)kei=on me/tron eu(=ren: ma/lista ga\r lektiko\n tw=n me/trwn to\ i)ambei=o/n e)stin</foreign> (Poet.

						<p>These rhythms being set aside, (they are in fact reducible to two, the proportions 1 : 1, and 2 : 1, iambus and trochee, &breve;-and -&breve; respectively) the third &lsquo;the paean remains, the use of which began with Thrasymachus, though he and his followers couldn't tell what it was (did not know how to define it). The paean<note anchored="yes">Aristotle writes <foreign lang="greek">paia/n</foreign>: Cicero, <hi rend="italic">paean</hi> in the Orator, and <hi rend="italic">paeon</hi> in the de Oratore: Quintilian, <hi rend="italic">paeon.</hi></note> is the third (of the rhythms) and closely connected with the preceding: for it has the ratio of three to two (3/2 : 1, three short, and one long syllable equal to two short), whilst the others have that of one to one (dactyl, spondee, anapaest), and two to one (iambus and trochee), severally. And one and a half (3/2 : 1, the ratio of the paean) is connected with these (two) ratios [&lsquo;next to&rsquo; both ratios, i. e. the mean between the two extremes, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1], and that is the paean&rsquo;. On this see Introd. Appendix on <foreign lang="greek">r(uqmo/s</foreign>, pp. 387, 8. The paeonic ratio includes also the bacchius and cretic.

						<p>&lsquo;There are two kinds of paean opposed to one another, of which the one is suitable at the beginning (of the sentence or period), as in fact it is employed: and this is the one which begins with the long (syllable), and ends with three short. <foreign lang="greek">*dalogene\s ei)/te *luki/an</foreign>, &ldquo;O Delosborn, or if perchance Lycia&rdquo; (were thy birthplace). The poet, whose alternative is cut short by the inexorable brevity of the quotation, was doubtless going on, as the manner of the ancient poets is, to offer the deity whom he was addressing the choice of the various titles under which he was known and worshipped, expressive of place of birth, special character or office: which was done to avoid the possibility of giving offence by omitting any title of honour of which he might be specially proud. The following specimens of a very frequent custom will suffice to illustrate it. Hor. Carm. Sec. line 14, <hi rend="italic">Lenis Ilithya... sive tu Lucina probas vocari seu Genitalis.</hi> Sat. II 6. 20, <hi rend="italic">Matutine pater, seu Iane libentius audis.</hi> [We may also compare Horace's enumeration of the favourite haunts of Apollo, <hi rend="italic">qui rore puro Castaliae lavit crines solutos, qui Lyciae tenet dumeta natalemque silvam Delius et Patareus Apollo.</hi> Od.

The author of the paean was apparently about to add after <foreign lang="greek">*luki/an, ne/mwn</foreign> or some such word, offering the god the alternative birthplace of Lycia, if he happened to prefer it. The Homeric epithet <foreign lang="greek">*lukhge/nhs</foreign>, Il. <foreign lang="greek">*d</foreign> 101, 119, is usually supposed to denote his Lycian birthplace, Patara, though M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Dor.</hi> II 6. 8, would &ldquo;rather understand&rdquo; by it &lsquo;born of light&rsquo;. On the epithet <foreign lang="greek">*lu/keios</foreign>, frequently applied to Apollo by the Tragedians, as Aesch. Suppl. 668 (with Paley's note), Sept. c. Theb. 133, Agam. 1228, Soph. Oed.

The other, the opposite to this, in which three short syllables form the beginning, and the long one comes at the end. &ldquo;After earth and its waters, night obscured (blotted out) ocean&rdquo;&rsquo;.

					<p>Of the two principal varieties of style, the <foreign lang="greek">ei)ro/menh</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">katestramme/nh le/cis</foreign>, the latter more usually called <foreign lang="greek">periodikh/</foreign>, the style of Demosthenes, Isocrates, and the more finished rhetoricians, there is a detailed account in the Introduction, in the analysis of this chapter, p. 306 seq. So that we may at once pass on to the translation, and the particular points of interest and difficulty that the text offers. On Dionysius' distinction of three varieties of style, see p. 306, note 4. On the <foreign lang="greek">ei)rome/nh le/cis</foreign>, the earlier style of Hecataeus, Herodotus and the <foreign lang="greek">logogra/foi</foreign>, see p. 307, and 306, note 5; and on <foreign lang="greek">a)nabolai/</foreign>, to which this style of prose is compared, p. 307 note 1. The opposite style, <foreign lang="greek">h( katestramme/nh</foreign>, is described at length, pp. 308&mdash;310. See Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Techn.

						<p>&lsquo;The style must be either <hi rend="italic">loose and concatenated</hi>&rsquo; (the sentences loosely strung together, connected solely by connecting particles, as <foreign lang="greek">de/, kai/</foreign>, like onions on a string) &lsquo;and one only by the connecting particle, like the preludes in the dithyrambs, or <hi rend="italic">close and compact</hi> (i. e. periodic) and resembling the (regular) antistrophes of the old lyric poets&rsquo;, Pindar Arion, Stesichorus, and the like. The last of the three is said to have owed his new name of Stesichorus&mdash;his original name was Tisias&mdash;to his having been the first to bring the chorus to a stand, make it stationary, for a time at least; and give it order, regularity, symmetry, and dignity. This is also attributed to Arion. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Now the loose style is the ancient (original) one. &ldquo;This is the setting forth of the researches of Herodotus of Thurii.&rdquo; This style which was formerly universal is now confined to a few. By <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> I mean that which has no end in itself except the completion of the subject under discussion. And it is displeasing by reason of its endlessness (or <hi rend="italic">indefinite</hi> length or character, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 8. 2); for every one desires to have the end distinctly in view&rsquo;. Quintilian, VIII 5. 27, thus describes the <foreign lang="greek">ei)rome/nh le/cis</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">soluta fere oratio, et e singulis non membris sed frustis collata, structura caret.</hi> Cicero, Or.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*(hrodo/tou *qouri/ou</lemma>] This appears to be the reading of all MSS, except that A^{c} has <foreign lang="greek">quri/ou</foreign>. Herodotus did actually join the colony established at Thurium in 443 (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi> sub anno 443, col. 3), and was thence sometimes called a Thurian from this his second birthplace. So Strabo, XIV c. 2, (Caria,) p. 657, of Halicarnassus; <foreign lang="greek">a)/ndres de\ gego/nasin e)c au)th=s *(hro/doto/s te o( suggrafeu/s, o(\n u(/steron *qou/rion e)ka/lesan, dia\ to\ koinwnh=sai th=s ei)s *qouri/ous a)poiki/as</foreign>.

The second of these passages may be interpreted to mean, that the reading in Plutarch's time was often found altered <hi rend="italic">in the copies of Herodotus' history</hi>, from <foreign lang="greek">*(alikarnasse/ws</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">*qouri/ou</foreign>; and if so, no doubt Aristotle's copy <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have had that reading, which he transferred to his Rhetoric. But on the other hand, Demetrius, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ e(rmhnei/as</foreign>, &sect; 17 (<foreign lang="greek">peri\ perio/dou</foreign>), in quoting the same passage, follows the reading of all our MSS <foreign lang="greek">*(hrodo/tou *(alikarnassh=os i(stori/hs a)po/decis h(/de</foreign>. Which, together with two other inaccuracies of quotation (in the Rhet.), the transposition of <foreign lang="greek">h(/de</foreign>, and the writing <foreign lang="greek">a)po/deicis</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">a)po/decis</foreign>&mdash;Demetr. preserves the correct form&mdash;leads me rather to conclude that the variation from our text is due here, as we have already seen in so many other instances, to our author's carelessness in quoting from memory, without referring to the original. Aristotle was a book-collector, and no doubt <hi rend="italic">possessed</hi> a copy of Herodotus. Victorius thinks that the reading here is sufficiently justified by the fact that Herodotus did actually become a citizen of Thurii, and was so called. But the point here to be decided is not whether he was ever so called by others, or even by himself at odd times; but whether he did, or did not, write himself a Thurian at the commencement of his own history: which I deny, and attribute the implied assertion of that fact as a mere misquotation to our author himself. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And this is why it is only at the goal that (the runners) pant (or gasp) and become faint, because whilst they are looking forward to the limit of the race they don't flag before that (i. e. before they have reached the goal)&rsquo;. This, as I have said in Introd. p. 311, note, seems the explanation of the illustration which is required by the application of it and by the context. The sight of the goal before them, the term of their labour, keeps up the racers' spirits and stimulates their exertions, so that they neither faint nor fail till they reach it: <hi rend="italic">then</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e)kpne/ousi kai\ e)klu/ontai</foreign>, they breathe hard, and their exertions being over, their sinews are relaxed, they slacken and grow languid. This interpretation, which is opposed to that of Victorius (see note u.s.), makes the <foreign lang="greek">kampth/r</foreign>, which is properly the <hi rend="italic">turning-point</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">di/aulos</foreign>&mdash;whence its name&mdash;<hi rend="italic">here</hi> the <hi rend="italic">goal</hi> of the <foreign lang="greek">sta/dion</foreign> or single race, in a straight line: the <foreign lang="greek">kampth/r</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">di/aulos</foreign> being in fact the <foreign lang="greek">pe/ras</foreign> of the <foreign lang="greek">sta/dion</foreign>. If the <foreign lang="greek">kampth/r</foreign> were intended here for the turning-point, the statement made of it could not be true, for in that case the runners would not come in sight of the goal until they had <hi rend="italic">passed</hi> the <foreign lang="greek">kampth/r</foreign>. So in Eth. N.

						<p>&lsquo;And easy to be learnt because easily recollected: and this because the periodic style can be <hi rend="italic">numbered</hi>, and number is of all things the most easily recollected&rsquo;. The proportions, or relations of the several parts or members of the period to the whole, and to one another&mdash;its symmetrical structure&mdash;can be expressed in numbers, like the numerical relations of rhythm, c. 8. This gives the periodic structure a hold upon the memory, by its definite proportions, which is entirely wanting to the continuous and indefinite succession of the other. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The period must also be completed (or brought to a conclusion) <pb n="96"/> by the sense (<foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign>, as well as by the structure and rhythm) and not broken off abruptly (without completing the sense: <foreign lang="greek">diako/ptein</foreign> &lsquo;to cut in two&rsquo;), like Sophocles' iambics, &ldquo;Calydon is this land of the Pelopian soil&mdash;&rdquo;: for the contrary supposition (to this real fact) arises from (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> is caused <hi rend="italic">by; dativus instrumenti</hi>) this (wrong) division (in general), as <hi rend="italic">also</hi> in the instance given, that Calydon belongs to the Peloponnesus&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>We learn from the Anonymous Scholiast on this passage (see Brandis' tract [<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i] pp. 46, 7,) and more precisely from the Schol. on Ar. Ran. 1269, that this verse comes not from Sophocles, but from Eur. Meleager, of which it is the commencement. See Wagner, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Eur.</hi> Mel. I (<hi rend="italic">Fr. Tr.

This makes it clear that this misstatement was not due to Euripides. As to the substitution of Sophocles for Euripides as the author, I have no doubt, from the abundant evidence we have already had, that it is due solely to a lapse of memory on Ar.'s part, and that no alteration of the text, as suggested by Vater and Buhle, is required. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">stop</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">pause</hi>, which the speaker or reader makes, when introduced in the wrong place, may make a complete alteration in the meaning: as here, if the verse be read as an entire sentence with the pause at <foreign lang="greek">xqono/s</foreign>, it conveys the meaning that Calydon is situated in the Peloponnesus, which is contrary to the fact: but if it be read continuously without a pause with the ensuing line, the true sense becomes clear. <foreign lang="greek">diairei=sqai</foreign> here is equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">diasti/cai</foreign> III 5. 6, comp.

						<p>&lsquo;For that (sc. the <foreign lang="greek">kw=lon</foreign>) which is too short often makes the listener stumble (<hi rend="italic">balks</hi> him by bringing him up short and abruptly); because if, whilst he is still hurrying (eager) to get on (forward), and to the (end or completion of the) measure (rhythm), of which he has already a definition (i.e. a definite and preconceived notion) in himself, he be suddenly pulled up (checked, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> pulled against) by a pause (a premature cessation on the part of the speaker), there must necessarily follow (arise <foreign lang="greek">gi/gnesqai</foreign>) a sort of stumble by reason of the check&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">prosptai/ein</lemma>] must be regarded as a subst. in the accusative before <foreign lang="greek">gi/gnesqai</foreign>, equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">to\ prosptai/ein</foreign>. The metaphor is from driving: a sudden and unexpected check, or pulling against him, will often cause a horse to stumble, or bring him on his knees. The abrupt cessation of the onward motion, in the listener's mind, as in the horse's career, produces analogous effects&mdash;whence the metaphor&mdash;in the two cases. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Those again which are too long produce a feeling of being left behind, like those who (in a measured walk, as in the colonnade of a gymnasium) turn back only after passing (not till they have passed) the limit; for they too&mdash;like the speaker that uses too long periods&mdash;leave behind their companions in the walk&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>The notion is that of a party walking backwards and forwards in the portico of a gymnasium, the walk, like the period, being properly limited, though the limit is capable of being passed. If one of the party &mdash;suppose Aristotle himself in his daily <foreign lang="greek">peri/patoi</foreign> in the Lyceum&mdash; chanced to have thus outstripped his companions, the latter would be left in the lurch, and be no longer able to hear him. Similarly the speaker who makes his periods of undue length, leaves <hi rend="italic">his</hi> hearers in the lurch: they stop short, as it were, and lose the thread of his discourse. <foreign lang="greek">a)poka/mptein</foreign> is here not in its usual sense, but &lsquo;to turn <hi rend="italic">away</hi>&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;turning back&rsquo;, as <foreign lang="greek">a)podido/nai, a)pone/mein, a)paitei=n</foreign>. </p>

LIII 178, <hi rend="italic">itaque et longiora et breviora iudicat et perfecta ac moderata semper expectat; mutila sentit quaedam et quasi decurtata, quibus tanquam debito fraudetur offenditur, productiora alia et quasi immoderatius excurrentia, quae magis etiam aspernantur aures</hi>, et seq. <pb n="100"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And in like manner also the periods that are too long become so many speeches, and like a dithyrambic prelude; that is, rambling and incoherent, without unity or system. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And therefore what Democritus of Chios quoted to taunt Melanippides for writing (long, rambling) dithyrambic preludes instead of the (compact and regular) stanzas, is realized (in these overgrown periods). &ldquo;A man works mischief to himself in working mischief to another, and the long dithyrambic prelude is most mischievous to its composer&rdquo; (substituted for <foreign lang="greek">h( de\ kakh\ boulh\ tw=| bouleu/santi kaki/sth</foreign>, of the original, Hesiod. Op. et D. 263): for a taunt of the same kind may also be appropriately applied to the long-membered gentry, (the dealers in long-membered periods)&rsquo;. <hi rend="italic">The makers of the periods</hi> are themselves called here <foreign lang="greek">makro/kwloi</foreign>. To scan the second verse of the quotation <foreign lang="greek">makra_nabolh/</foreign> must be read as a crasis. &ldquo;Democritus Chius Musicus, Abderitae aequalis teste Diogene Laertio, IX 49 (<foreign lang="greek">gego/nasi de\ *dhmo/kritoi e(/c: prw=tos au)to\s ou(=tos, deu/teros *xi=os mousiko\s kata\ to\n au)to\n xro/non</foreign>).

						<p>In the note on <foreign lang="greek">a)nabolai/</foreign>, Introd. p. 307, already referred to, may be found some account of the two kinds of dithyramb here alluded to; the earlier antistrophic form of that of Arion, Stesichorus, Pindar, and the novel, relaxed, often incoherent, extravagances, of Melanippides and his followers. Nevertheless, Melanippides is selected by Aristodemus, in answer to Socrates' question, Xen. Mem. I 4. 3, as the most distinguished representative of dithyrambic poetry, as Homer of epic, Sophocles of tragedy, Polycletus of sculpture, and Zeuxis of painting. This represents the popular judgment, as opposed to that of the critics. On this subject, I have referred to Bode, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. der Hell. Dichtk.</hi> Vol. II Pt. II p. 111 seq. and 293 seq. and to M&uuml;ller, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> c. XXX. See also Arist. Probl. XIX 15.

						<p>&lsquo;Those which have their members too short make no period at all: and so it (i.e. the period made up of these short <foreign lang="greek">kw=la</foreign>) drags the hearer with it headlong&rsquo;. The audience is <hi rend="italic">carried away</hi> by them, as by a <pb n="101"/> horse, at a headlong, break-neck, pace. Specimens of this style are given in Introd. p. 314, note 1. </p>

					<div3 id="b3c9s7" type="section" n="7">
						<p>&lsquo;The periodic style has two divisions, of which the one has its clauses (simply) divided, the other opposed to one another; an instance of simple division is, &ldquo;I have often wondered that those who first assembled these universal gatherings and established the athletic contests...&rdquo;&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">dih|rhme/nh le/cis</foreign>, &ldquo;in qua membra periodi copula a se invicem distinguuntur.&rdquo; Ernesti, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Techn. Gr.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">diairei=n</foreign>. This is the opening of Isocrates' Panegyric Speech, supposed or intended to be delivered at the &lsquo;General Assembly&rsquo; of the great Olympic games&mdash;whence the name. It is remarkable, and shews that Ar. could not have looked at the passage he was quoting, that the very next words to those at which his quotation stops, long before the end of the sentence, contain a regular antithesis or opposition of members, and the &lsquo;simple division&rsquo; is absolutely confined to the words cited. I should suppose that he could not have been aware of this. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;(An instance) of the antithetic period, wherein in each of the two clauses contrary by contrary are brought together, or (the same word is imposed as a yoke, i.e. bracket, or <hi rend="italic">vinculum</hi>, on both contraries) the two contraries are coupled together by one and the same word, is &ldquo;Both they served, them that remained, and them that followed; for the one they acquired more land than they had at home in addition, and to the others they left behind sufficient in what they had at home.&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">u(pomonh/</foreign>, (staying behind) is contrary to <foreign lang="greek">a)kolou/qhsis</foreign> (following), <foreign lang="greek">i(kano/n</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">plei=on</foreign>&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>It is unnecessary to say that the passage is quoted wrong: it runs in the original, Paneg. &sect; 35, 6, <foreign lang="greek">a)mf. de\ kai\ tou\s a)kol. kai\ tou\s u(pom. e)/swsan: toi=s me\n ga\r i(kanh\n th\n oi)/koi xw/ran kate/lipon, toi=s de\ plei/w th=s u(parxou/shs e)po/risan</foreign>. The first clause is an exemplification of <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/zeucis</foreign>, on which see note <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> c. 5 &sect; 7; the second, of the antithesis of contraries in two clauses balanced and opposed to one another. </p>
						<p>In the quotation that follows, Paneg. &sect; 41, the original is, <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste kai\ toi=s</foreign> <pb n="102"/> <foreign lang="greek">xrhma/twn deome/nois kai\ toi=s a)polau=sai tw=n u(parxo/ntwn e)piqumou=sin a)mfote/rois a(rmo/ttein</foreign>. Ar. in his alteration has adorned Isocrates' text with an additional rhetorical figure, the <foreign lang="greek">o(moiote/leuton</foreign> or rhyming terminations of <foreign lang="greek">deome/nois</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">boulome/nois. &lsquo;a)po/lausis</foreign>, (sensual) enjoyment, is opposed to <foreign lang="greek">kth/sei</foreign>, acquisition&rsquo;, as the text has it. As these two can hardly be considered antithetical, and nothing corresponding to <foreign lang="greek">kth/sei</foreign> occurs in Isocr., are we to suppose that Ar., meaning to write <foreign lang="greek">e)ndei/a|</foreign>, carelessly substituted <foreign lang="greek">kth/sei</foreign>? or rather, that <foreign lang="greek">kth/sei</foreign> is a mistake of a copyist for <foreign lang="greek">deh/sei</foreign>, which occurs twice in the sense of &lsquo;want&rsquo; II 7. 3 and 4: and also, in the same sense, Pseudo-Plato, Eryxias, 405 E <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi> </p>
						<p>Then follows a string of quotations from the same speech of Isocrates, illustrative of antithesis; &sect; 48 (wrong), &sect; 72 (right), &sect; 89 (right again), &sect; 105 (wrong), &sect; 149 (right), &sect; 181 (wrong), &sect; 186 (wrong, <foreign lang="greek">a)/cein</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e(/cein</foreign>). </p>
						<p>The passage <foreign lang="greek">to\n me\n *(ellh/sponton k.t.l.</foreign> occurs likewise in the funeral oration attributed to Lysias, &sect; 29. This speech is marked as spurious by Baiter and Sauppe in their ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> If this be so, the figure is probably due to Isocrates, which is all the more likely as Lysias' style, <foreign lang="greek">lith\ kai\ a)felh/s</foreign>, is usually free from these rhetorical artifices. Victorius refers to an imitation of this, Cic. de Fin. II 34. 112, <hi rend="italic">Ut si Xerxes... Hellesponto iuncto, Athone perfosso, maria ambulavisset terramque navigasset.</hi> And Lucr. III 1042 (1029, Munro), <hi rend="italic">ille quoque ipse</hi> (Xerxes) <hi rend="italic">viam qui quondam per mare magnum stravit</hi>, et seq. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And what some one (some advocate, in accusation, whose name Ar. either had never heard, or didn't recollect) said against Peitholaus and Lycophron in the law-court (at <hi rend="italic">some</hi> trial: <hi rend="italic">quaere</hi>, theirs?), &ldquo;And these fellows (<foreign lang="greek">ou(=toi</foreign>, apparently &lsquo;the accused&rsquo; or &lsquo;opponents&rsquo; as usual) who used to sell you when they were at home, now that they have come to you here, have bought you&rdquo;&rsquo;. Peitholaus and Lycophron were brothers of Thebe, the wife of Alexander of Pherae. At her instigation they murdered their brother-in-law and succeeded him in the dynasty. They maintained themselves long against the attacks of Philip by the aid of Onomarchus the Phocian commander, but at last were defeated, 353&mdash;352 B. C., and Onomarchus slain; upon which they &ldquo;retired with their mercenaries, 2000 in number, into Phokis.&rdquo; Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> from Diodorus, Vol. XI ch. LXXXVII pp. 366, 408, 9, 11, where Lycophron alone is mentioned as &lsquo;the despot of Pherae&rsquo;: in p. 412, <pb n="103"/> Peitholaus and Lycophron are named together for the first time as joint commanders. </p>
						<p>As the time, place, and circumstances, as well as the speaker, of what is here related, are alike utterly unknown, any attempt at interpreting it must be a mere guess. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> conjecture is, (1) that the scene is a court of justice&mdash;<hi rend="italic">where</hi>, no one can say; I will assume at Athens&mdash; (2) that <foreign lang="greek">ou(=toi</foreign> are Peitholaus and Lycophron, as accused or defendants&mdash; this is suggested by <foreign lang="greek">ei)s *p. tis ei)=pe</foreign> and the use of <foreign lang="greek">ou(=toi</foreign>&mdash;and if so, this must have been <hi rend="italic">after</hi> their downfall: and (3) that, to give the remark a point, <foreign lang="greek">e)w/nhntai</foreign> must have a double sense. &lsquo;These fellows, says <hi rend="italic">some one</hi> to the judges, used when they were at home, at Pherae, to <hi rend="italic">sell you</hi> (as slaves)&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">u(ma=s</foreign> maliciously identifies the Athenian judges with their fellow-countrymen, captives in Thessaly&mdash;<hi rend="italic">now</hi> that they are come to you, the tables are turned, and they have to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> you&rsquo; (i. e. to bribe the judges). Victorius, but utterly without point, <hi rend="italic">Videtur contumeliosa vox in eos iacta, qui pecunia, quam comparassent in suis civibus hostibus emancipandis, eadem postea uterentur in illis ab iisdem emendis, atque in servitudinem sibi adiudicandis.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For all these (passages) do what has been mentioned&rsquo;, i. e. give an antithetical structure to the several sentences. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c9s8" type="section" n="8">
						<p>&lsquo;This kind of style is agreeable because contraries are best known (in themselves and by reason of their opposition), and still better when placed side by side (in juxtaposition, for the purpose of contrast and comparison); and also because it resembles a syllogism; for the <foreign lang="greek">e)/legxos</foreign> (the refutative syllogism) is a bringing together (for the same purpose) of the two opposites (the two contradictory conclusion)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This opposition of contraries in the antithesis, also reminds us of the <foreign lang="greek">e)/legxos</foreign>, the conclusion of opposites, refutation by an opposite conclusion; this resemblance makes the former look like a proof, which is a source of pleasure. </p>
						<p>Aristotle is constantly telling us&mdash;see Bonitz ad Metaph. B 2, 996 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 18 &mdash;that contraries, which are the two extremes of things under the same genus, are also subject to the same science, <foreign lang="greek">tw=n e)nanti/a mi/a</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">h( au)th/, e)pisth/mh</foreign>. And accordingly, inferences may be drawn from one contrary to another, Eth. N. V 1, 1129 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 14 seq. This appears to be the foundation of what is here said, that contraries are best known to us; they can be studied together, and one throws light upon the other. Comp. III 11. 9, <pb n="104"/> <foreign lang="greek">o(/sw| a)\n...a)ntikeime/nws lexqh=| tosou/tw| eu)dokimei= ma=llon. to\ d'  ai)/tion o(/ti h( ma/qhsis dia\ me\n to\ a)ntikei=sqai ma=llon...gi/netai</foreign>.

XIX 5, <foreign lang="greek">h(du\ to\ manqa/nein</foreign> is assigned, as an acknowledged truth, in explanation of a musical fact. &lsquo;Best known&rsquo; seems to mean that contraries, being under the same genus, are better known than any other things that have no such relation, or no relation at all, to one another. </p>
						<p>On the pleasure derived from learning, which is here assumed to be the explanation of the agreeableness of this periodic style, see the notes on I 11. 21, 23; particularly the latter, in which it is fully illustrated from Aristotle's writings. I will repeat here that the Metaphysics opens with a statement that all men have a natural longing for (strive after) knowledge, <foreign lang="greek">pa/ntes a)/nqrwpoi tou= ei)de/nai o)re/gontai fu/sei</foreign>: and this of course implies pleasure in learning, which is the satisfaction of this natural appetite. The natural love of imitation or copying, which gives rise to all the imitative arts, is based in the same way upon the desire and pleasure of learning. And contrariwise therefore (this is additional), as we saw in c. 8. 2, <foreign lang="greek">a)hde\s kai\ a)/gnwston to\ a)/peiron</foreign>, the infinite, or indefinite, is displeasing to us because it is unknowable. Comp. <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 10. 2, <foreign lang="greek">to\ ga\r manqa/nein r(a|di/ws h(du\ fu/sei pa=si/n e)sti</foreign>: the <hi rend="italic">words</hi> that convey the most instruction to us are the most pleasing; hence the pleasure derived from <hi rend="italic">metaphors</hi>, which is explained: <foreign lang="greek">glw=ttai</foreign> on the contrary, which teach us nothing, are therefore disagreeable. </p>

There are also false antitheses, as Epicharmus, besides others, (<foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign>) wrote, <foreign lang="greek">to/ka me\n k.t.l.</foreign>&rsquo; This line of Epicharmus is also given by Demetr. u. s. &sect; 24.

Gorgias and his school, the inventors of antithesis and the rest of these rhetorical novelties. </p>
						<p>For further details on the subject of these rhetorical figures introduced by Gorgias and his school, who carried them to a vicious excess, a style to which the term <foreign lang="greek">*gorgia/zein</foreign> was afterwards applied; which was thought to have attained its highest perfection in the measured and laboured, empty and monotonous, periods of Isocrates;&mdash;see the paper on Gorgias, <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi>, No. VII, Vol. III. p. 69 seq. where they are classified and arranged under three heads, representing parallelism in <hi rend="italic">sense, structure</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>, which is in fact Aristotle's division. Illustrative extracts from Gorgias' speeches are given at p. 67: and a collection of his fragments in Sauppe, Fragm. Or. Att. (appended to the <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> Vol. III) p. 129 seq. [Compare Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, I pp. 60&mdash;62, and Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, Appendix, <hi rend="italic">On the Fragments of Gorgias.</hi>] </p>
						<p>Perhaps the most complete specimen of Isocrates' style in his Panegyric, from which I will select one or two illustrations, is &sect; 76, <foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r w)ligw/roun tw=n koinw=n, ou)d'  a)pe/lauon me\n w(s i)di/wn, h)me/loun de\ w(s a)llotri/wn, a)ll) e)kh/donto me\n w(s oi)kei/wn, a)pei/xonto d) w(/sper xrh\ tw=n mhde\n proshko/ntwn:</foreign> and so on, in the same measured strain.

XXVII 23, <hi rend="italic">Arce et urbe orba sum.</hi>) No better illustration could be found of the importance of <pb n="107"/> the precept so much insisted upon by Aristotle, that the art employed in composition should be carefully concealed, than the striking difference in point of interest between the studied, monotonous, wearisome periods of Isocrates, and the animated, vigorous, natural, yet rhythmical periods of Demosthenes, on which though at least as much pains and labour had been bestowed by the one as by the other&mdash;the critics said &lsquo;they smelt of the lamp&rsquo;&mdash;in the one the study entirely escapes notice, in the other it is most painfully apparent. </p>
						<p>On antithesis and the rest, there are also remarks in Introd. pp. 314, 5, and the note: and on the divisions of the period, <foreign lang="greek">ko/mma</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">kw=lon</foreign>, of which the last two are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> distinguished by Ar., p. 312, note 1. </p>
						<p>The meaning and authorship of the Theodectea has been already discussed at length, p. 55, seq. The conclusion arrived at is, that the work here referred to was an earlier treatise on Rhetoric by Aristotle, the result of his rhetorical <hi rend="italic">teaching</hi>, which confined itself to the subjects dealt with in the extant third book. <foreign lang="greek">ai( a)rxai\ tw=n perio/dwn</foreign>, which is confined by the <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> to the <foreign lang="greek">o(moioka/tarkton</foreign>, may perhaps, as Victorius supposed, be intended to include by inference all the other figures described in this chapter. </p>

					<p>This chapter offers a remarkable exception, at all events in the first six sections, to Aristotle's ordinary manner of writing; in that the thoughts are in some degree written out and the meaning fairly represented by the language: instead of being left, as usual, to the sagacity of the reader to fill up and interpret as best he can. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Having discussed and settled the preceding subject we have next to describe the sources of lively, pointed, sprightly, witty, facetious, clever, and popular (<foreign lang="greek">eu)dokimou=nta</foreign>) sayings.

The Rhet. ad Alex. c. 22 (23) treats of <foreign lang="greek">a)stei=on</foreign> in style, apparently with much the same meaning as that of Aristotle. See the analysis of the chap. in Introd. p. 434. Brevity is at all events an element of <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)stei=on</foreign>. Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)stei=on</foreign> seems to correspond to Campbell's &lsquo;vivacity&rsquo; of style, which is treated in the first three chapters of his third book. <pb n="108"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Let us then describe it by a complete (thorough or detailed) enumeration, and let this be our starting-point. Learning namely with ease (without trouble or labour) is naturally agreeable to every one, and names (nouns) are significant; and therefore all nouns or words from which we learn anything are most agreeable&rsquo;. On this see note on c. 9 &sect; 8, add c. 11. 9, and I 11. 21, 23. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now words strange, foreign, archaic, are not known at all (and can therefore convey no information), and the proper, ordinary, names of things, we know already. It is the metaphor (the only remaining kind of single word) that does this in the highest degree: for when (the poet, Homer Od. <foreign lang="greek">c</foreign> [XIV] 214) calls old age a (dry, withered) stalk or stubble, he conveys learning and knowledge through the medium of the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, because both are withered&rsquo;, &lsquo;are fallen into the <hi rend="italic">sere and yellow leaf</hi>&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">dia\ tou= ge/nous</foreign>, because the metaphor brings remote members (<hi rend="italic">species</hi>) of the same <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> into a novel comparison, which teaches us something new of one or the other. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Now the poets' similes produce the same effect (give point, vivacity, or liveliness, to the narrative of an epic poem, in which they usually appear): and therefore if the simile be well (selected or executed, or both), it gives an air of liveliness, point, vividness to the composition. For the simile, as has been said before&rsquo; (not literally what is said here, but the substance of it, III 4. 1), &lsquo;is a metaphor, differing from it merely by the manner of setting forth (mode of statement): and therefore it is less agreeable because longer (<foreign lang="greek">makrote/rws, legome/nh</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">pepoihme/nh</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> written in a longer form, at greater length), and (because) it does not say directly that (of the two things compared) one <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the other; and accordingly (as the speaker's <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> does not say this, so) neither does the (hearer's) mind look out for it&rsquo;&mdash;and so loses the opportunity of <hi rend="italic">learning.</hi> </p>

						<p>The meaning of <foreign lang="greek">proqe/sei</foreign>, by which the simile is said here to differ from <pb n="109"/> the metaphor, may be inferred from the previous passage referred to, III 4. 1, but is not there directly expressed. It means the &lsquo;mode of setting forth&rsquo;, of describing or stating the comparison which both of them make; just as in c. 13. 2, 3 (in Ar.'s division of the speech), and Rhet. ad Alex. 29 (30) &sect;&sect; 2, 21; 35 (36) &sect; 1, <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">proekti/qenai</foreign> are put for &lsquo;the statement of the case&rsquo; or exposition of the facts. There are two distinguishable points in which the simile differs from the metaphor; the length, and (consequent) dilution of the force of its impression. The metaphor is concise, generally expressed in a single word, which <hi rend="italic">suggests</hi> the comparison, and <hi rend="italic">identifies</hi> the two things compared, <foreign lang="greek">le/gei w(s tou=to e)kei=no</foreign>; so that the comparison is forced directly upon the hearer's mind, who thereby learns something: whereas the simile goes into detail, often to a considerable length, so that it loses the pointed brevity of the metaphor; and instead of identifying the two objects compared, like the other, by the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">particle of comparison</hi> <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign>, so weakens its force that the hearer is apt to lose the lesson and the pleasure that should be derived from it. </p>

For in the one case knowledge as it were is acquired; in the other, neither the one nor the other&rsquo;, i. e. in either of these two ways there is a sort of learning, either immediate or nearly so: in the other case, that of superficial and unintelligible enthymemes or style in general, neither immediate nor quasi-immediate knowledge is attainable.

I may add that <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign> is used in two distinct senses, representing two different forms of development, which may be distinguished as the metaphysical and moral applications of it; as will appear from a comparison of the form it assumes in the Nicom. Ethics, and the biology of the de Anima. It is sometimes identifiable with <foreign lang="greek">e)ntele/xeia</foreign>, expressing the actuality or actual realization of <hi rend="italic">existence</hi> out of a mere undeveloped capacity of life: in the moral view, it is the realization of <hi rend="italic">action</hi>, a realized activity, from the dormant capacity&mdash;implying existence&mdash;to the active exercise or energy of the bodily and mental functions.

LXXVIII] p. 320 seq. Thirlw. <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> ch. XXXIX (Vol. v. p. 106, 1st ed.).

						<p>&lsquo;And the saying of Cephisodotus, in his indignation at Chares' eager<pb n="113"/> ness for the scrutiny of the accounts (of his charge) in the conduct of the Olynthian war, &ldquo;that he drove the people into a fit of choking by his (pertinacity in the) attempt to offer his accounts for scrutiny in this way.&rdquo;&rsquo; He wanted to force his accounts down their throats, and nearly choked them in the attempt. I have followed Dionysius' version of this extract, which is plainly preferable to the text of Aristotle. <foreign lang="greek">a)/gein ei)s pni=gma</foreign> is Greek and sense; <foreign lang="greek">e)/xein ei)s pni=gma</foreign> neither one nor the other; and <foreign lang="greek">dido/nai ou(/tws</foreign>, at the end, has far more meaning than the simple <foreign lang="greek">dou=nai</foreign> of our text. With the vulgar reading, <foreign lang="greek">e)/xonta</foreign> must be taken with <foreign lang="greek">ta\s eu)qu/nas</foreign>, &ldquo;with his accounts in his hands&rdquo;&mdash;which is so far graphic, as it indicates the eagerness with which he was trying to force them upon the people&mdash;but then <foreign lang="greek">dou=nai to\n dh=mon ei)s pni=gma</foreign>, for &lsquo;to drive them into a choking-fit&rsquo;, is surely indefensible. </p>
						<p>Cephisodotus, <foreign lang="greek">o( e)k *kerame/wn</foreign>, has been already quoted; see III 4.3 note (near the end of the section [p. 53]), where some account is given. Two more of his pungent sayings are quoted further on. Chares, with his mercenaries, was sent to take the command in the Olynthian war in 349 B. C. (Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi>). Olynthus was taken by Philip, 347. This notice is cited by Max Schmidt in his tract <hi rend="italic">On the date of Ar.'s Rhetoric</hi>, p. 15, as a piece of evidence on that question; but the limit of the period of publication can be brought much lower down. See Introd. <hi rend="italic">On the date of the Rhetoric</hi>, p. 36 seq. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pni=gma</lemma> or <foreign lang="greek">pnigmo/s</foreign>, and its congeners, is a medical term, used by Hippocrates, expressive of choking, stifling, suffocation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the same (Cephisodotus) once in an exhortation to the Athenians said that they must march out (at once) to Euboea (to the aid of the Euboeans), and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> provide themselves with provisions&rsquo; (read by all means <foreign lang="greek">e)pisitisome/nous</foreign>, the future, with Spengel; Bekker retains the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e)pisitisame/nous</foreign>, which spoils the point), &lsquo;like Miltiades' decree&rsquo; (with all the unhesitating haste prescribed by Miltiades' decree at the time of the first Median invasion). They were <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> not to lose any time in making provision <hi rend="italic">at home</hi>, but to get to Euboea with all speed and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> provide themselves: the future is necessary: Victorius, though he reads the aorist, translates it as the future. This hurried expedition to Euboea occurred in 358 B. C., Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H.</hi>, sub anno, Dem. c. Androt. &sect; 14, <foreign lang="greek">i)/sq'  o(/ti prw/|hn *eu)boeu=sin h(merw=n triw=n e)bohqh/sate k.t.l.</foreign> and Aesch. c. Ctes. &sect; 85. It was made to assist the Euboeans against the Theban invaders; and in the archonship of Cephisodotus himself. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ *miltia/dou yh/fisma</lemma>] is explained by the Scholiast, quoted by Vater, <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ bouleu/sasqai: *miltia/dhs mh\ bouleusa/menos e)ch=lqen kata\ tou= *ce/rcou</foreign>: and more at length by Ulpian in Shilleto's note to Dem. de F.

As to the grammatical construction of the accusative, it seems to be a substitution <pb n="114"/> of <foreign lang="greek">to\ *miltia/dou yh/fisma</foreign> for the proper cognate accusative <foreign lang="greek">e)/codon</foreign>, to make an expedition, such as, on the principle of, Miltiades' decree, with all haste, and without deliberation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Iphicrates, indignant at the truce that the Athenians had made with Epidaurus and the neighbouring coasts, said of them that &ldquo;they had stript themselves of their provisions (not &lsquo;for the <hi rend="italic">way</hi>&rsquo;, but) for the war&rdquo;&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">e)fo/dia</foreign> are <hi rend="italic">viatica</hi>, provisions for a journey; which in the absence of inns the traveller had to carry with him: here, provisions for the support and maintenance of war and its expeditions. Hdt. writes <foreign lang="greek">e)po/dia</foreign>, Xen. <foreign lang="greek">e)fo/dion</foreign> (sing.). Arist., Pol. II 5, 1263 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 37, uses it of provisions for hunting expeditions in Lacedaemon. </p>
						<p>The small independent state of Epidaurus, bounded by the territories of Corinth, Argolis, Troezen, and the Saronic gulf, was at this time in alliance with Sparta, to which it supplied troops, in the great contest with the confederate Greeks, allied for the reduction of the Lacedaemonian power, terminating in the battle of Corinth, 394 B. C., see Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> Vol. IX [ch. LXXIV] p. 422, 425; and Xenophon's description of the battle, Helen. IV 2.9&mdash;23. It appears from this passage that the Athenians had made a truce with Epidaurus. Cephisodotus' indignation was aroused at the folly of making a truce with people who had a sea-board, which the Athenians with their naval superiority could have plundered with impunity, and so have supported the war. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Peitholaus (called) the Paralian (trireme) &ldquo;the people's cudgel&rdquo;, and Sestos &ldquo;the corn-stall of the Piraeus&rdquo;&rsquo;. Whether this Peitholaus is the same as the one already mentioned III 9. 7, as associated with Lycophron in the government of Pherae, we have no means of precisely determining. The probability is that he is. For even Aristotle's carelessness could hardly have carried him so far as to neglect to mention the distinction between two persons named so nearly together, if there were any. This being so, it appears again, as from the former passage, that he lived at Athens after his downfall. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">th\n pa/ralon</lemma>] This vessel and its companion the <foreign lang="greek">*salamini/a</foreign> were two picked vessels, fast sailers, and with carefully chosen and highly paid crews, kept in reserve at the Piraeus for state purposes; such as sacred embassies, <foreign lang="greek">qewri/ai</foreign>, to carry the admiral of the fleet in a naval expedition, for ordinary embassies, &lsquo;for the transport of money and persons&rsquo; (B&ouml;ckh, <hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ.</hi>, Bk. II. c. 16, Lewis' Transl. p. 240), and for the pursuit and conveyance to Athens of state offenders who had made their escape; as Alcibiades after the mutilation of the Hermae, Thuc. VI 53, 61 <hi rend="italic">bis</hi>, of the Salaminia. As illustrating the use of the Paralus as a <foreign lang="greek">r(o/palon</foreign>, Demosth. <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tw=n e)n *xer)r(onh/sw|</foreign>, &sect; 29 is still more in point; <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  e)pi\ me\n tou\s e)xqrou/s, ou(\s ou)k e)/sti labei=n u(po\ toi=s no/mois, kai\ stratiw/tas tre/fein kai\ trih/reis e)kpe/mpein kai\ xrh/mata ei)sfe/rein dei= kai\ a)nagkai=o/n e)stin, e)pi\ d) h(ma=s au)tou\s yh/fisma, ei)saggeli/a, *pa/ralos, tau=t) e)sti/n</foreign>, i. e. the special decree, <pb n="115"/> impeachment, and the Paralus, were the three principal <hi rend="italic">instruments of punishment</hi> of offenders amongst the Athenian citizens. The <foreign lang="greek">*pa/ralos</foreign> therefore is here compared to a <foreign lang="greek">r(o/palon</foreign> or cudgel, because it is the instrument with which the state deals her heaviest blows, not only upon those that have escaped her justice, but upon all those who offend her. <foreign lang="greek">*pa/ralos: mi/a tw=n par'  *)aqhnai/wn pro\s ta\s dhmosi/as xrei/as diapempome/nwn trih/rwn</foreign>, Harpocr. s. v. He adds that the crews of the two vessels received four obols a day, and stayed at home the greater part of the year. Photius has four articles on the word, one of them borrowed from Harpocr., almost in the same words. The first of the four identifies the Salaminian and Paralian. There is an article upon this in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict. of Ant.</hi> (s. v. <hi rend="italic">Salaminia</hi>). </p>
						<p>Sestos, on the Hellespont, seems from this passage to have been one of the emporia for the corn which was imported from the coasts of the Black Sea and the adjacent regions. It is mentioned with others by Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/d</foreign>. &sect; 107, as an important and well-situated town. Strabo, in writing of Troas, makes no mention of the corn-stores of Sestos. [B&uuml;chsensch&uuml;tz, <hi rend="italic">Besitz und Erwerb</hi>, pp. 421&mdash;430 (on the corn-trade between Greece and the Euxine). The present passage, which he does not quote, suggests a modification of his statement on p. 426 that Sestos and Abydos were less important emporia than Lampsacus.] </p>
						<p>This corn-store or warehouse is compared to the &lsquo;shopboard&rsquo; or &lsquo;stall&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">thli/a</foreign>, the tray on which corn was exposed for sale in the shops. The word was used for a &lsquo;stand&rsquo; or &lsquo;stage&rsquo; of various kinds. A passage which illustrates the use of it referred to here (which does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> appear in the Lexicons) is Arist. Hist. An. VI 24. 3, where there is an account of a wonderful mule, that lived to the age of 80; after it had been released from labour by reason of its age, it used to walk by the side of the teams which were dragging the stone for the building of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> temple (doubtless the Parthenon), and not only urged them on to their work, but helped them itself to drag the load up the hill (how this was done by the animal is not explained); <foreign lang="greek">w(/st'  e)yhfi/santo mh\ a)pelau/nein au)to\n tou\s sitopw/lous a)po\ tw=n thliw=n</foreign>. This clearly explains the particular sense of <foreign lang="greek">thli/a</foreign> in this passage. The <foreign lang="greek">thli/a</foreign> is the tray or stand at the corn-dealer's door, in which the corn is exposed for sale. In Aristoph. Plut. 1038, it means &lsquo;a sieve&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">koski/nou ku/klos</foreign> <hi rend="italic">sive</hi> <foreign lang="greek">perife/reia</foreign>, Schol. ad loc., Etym., Suidas and Hesychius. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Pericles bade (his countrymen) get Aegina out of the way (get rid of it, as a plague or obstacle to their enjoyment or happiness) &ldquo;the eyesore of the Piraeus&rdquo;&rsquo;. This saying is quoted by Plutarch, Pol.

						<p>&lsquo;And Moerocles said that he was in no respect a greater knave than &mdash;one of the respectable (upper) classes that he named: for the other played the knave at the rate of 33 per cent., he (himself) only at ten&rsquo;. The degree of knavery is compared to the rate of interest of profit which is made upon each: &ldquo;a very respectable person indeed!&rdquo; says Moerocles &ldquo;and a very respectable interest he makes upon his respectability (or, rightly <hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>, roguery): why! I only get a third of that for mine.&rdquo; Of Moerocles an account is given in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr.

It takes the genit. here, as if it were <foreign lang="greek">u(pe\r th\n h(me/ran tw=n ga/mwn</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">a)/xalkos a)spi/dwn, a)/peplos fare/wn, a)yo/fhtos kwkuma/twn</foreign>, &amp;c. Anaxandrides was a poet of the Middle Comedy, Meineke, <hi rend="italic">Fragm. Com. Att.</hi> Vol. I. p. 367 seq. The line here quoted is Fragm. Inc. XVII, Meineke III 200. Anaxandrides is quoted again, c. 11. 8, an equally uncertain fragment, No. XVIII, and probably again, 11. 10, also 12. 3, and Eth. N. VII 11. <pb n="117"/> </p>

M&uuml;ller, u. s. &sect; 3, II 294 Lewis' Transl.), remarks, note 2, &ldquo;It is very probable that this <foreign lang="greek">feidi/tia</foreign>, <pb n="119"/> (<hi rend="italic">spare</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scanty meals</hi>) was a ludicrous distortion of an ancient Spartan name <foreign lang="greek">fili/tia</foreign>, i. e. <hi rend="italic">love-feasts.</hi>&rdquo; This is made still more probable by the fact that Ar. in his Politics always writes the word <foreign lang="greek">fidi/tia&mdash;ta\ sussi/tia ta\ kalou/mena fidi/tia</foreign>, II 9, 1271 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 27, Ib. 10, 1272 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 2, c. 11, 1272 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 34&mdash;and the constant interchange of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">da/kru</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">lacrima;</hi> <foreign lang="greek">*)odusseu/s</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Ulysses</hi>). They were originally called <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrei=a</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">men's meals</hi>, both by Cretans and Spartans, the institution being common to both peoples, the Spartan being in this, as in other particulars, borrowed from the Cretan.

						<p>&lsquo;And Aesion, that (the Athenians) had emptied (or drained) their entire city into Sicily&rsquo;. Meaning, that the Athenian forces sent over for the invasion of Sicily in 415&mdash;413 B. C. were so enormous in proportion to the population of Athens, that they might be said to have completely drained it. &lsquo;For this is a metaphor, and sets the thing before our eyes&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>Aesion's name occurs, but only as the father of Euctemon, in Demosth. Mid. &sect; 165. Also in a citation from Hermippus, in Plut. Vit. Demosth. (Vit. Parall.) c. 11, in which he compares Demosthenes' speeches, especially for <hi rend="italic">reading</hi>, advantageously with those of his predecessors. The only other notice of him that I have been able to find is Suidas s. v. <foreign lang="greek">*dhmosqe/nhs</foreign>: which is merely that he (Dem.) <foreign lang="greek">sunefilolo/ghse *ai)si/wni tw=| *)aqhnai/w|</foreign>; which implies community of studies. He was therefore an Athenian orator, contemporary with Demosthenes. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And&rsquo;&mdash;Aesion again&mdash;&ldquo;so that Greece cried aloud&rdquo;: this again is in some sense a metaphor, and a vivid expression&rsquo;. A metaphor no doubt (though Victorius says it is a mere <hi rend="italic">hypallage</hi>), since it <hi rend="italic">transfers</hi> the voice from an individual to a collective people, or country. It is <foreign lang="greek">pro\ o)mma/twn</foreign> in that it animates an inanimate object, or abstraction; c. 11. 2, 3. Demosthenes has used this twice, de F. L. &sect; 92, <foreign lang="greek">h( ga\r a)lh/qeia kai\ ta\ pepragme/na au)ta\ boa=|</foreign>, and &sect; 129, <foreign lang="greek">tau=t'  ou)xi\ boa=| kai\ le/gei o(/ti xrh/mat) ei)/lhfen *ai)sxi/nhs</foreign>: and a very near approach to it, Olynth. <foreign lang="greek">a/</foreign> &sect; 2, <foreign lang="greek">o( me\n ou)=n parw\n kairo/s...mo/non ou)xi\ le/gei fwnh\n a)fiei\s o(/ti k.t.l.</foreign> Aesch. Agam. 1106 (Dind.), <foreign lang="greek">pa=sa ga\r po/lis boa=|</foreign>. Eur. Hippol. 877, <foreign lang="greek">boa=| boa=| de/ltos a)/lasta</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And as Cephisodotus bade (the Athenians) take care not to convert many of their mobs into assemblies&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> their mobs, in any numbers). Cephisodotus we have had three times already as the author of pointed sayings, III 4. 3, and 10. 6, <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi> The point of this saying seems to lie in the word <foreign lang="greek">sundroma/s</foreign>, which is substituted for <foreign lang="greek">sugklh/tous e)kklhsi/as</foreign>. It implies that most of their ordinary assemblies are mere mobs, tumultuary gatherings, riotous and unruly, instead of <foreign lang="greek">su/gklhtoi</foreign>, regularly convoked for special occasions in due form and order. It would certainly be <pb n="120"/> better without <foreign lang="greek">e)kklhsi/as</foreign>, as Wolf proposes. It would then mean &ldquo;not to hold their&mdash;mobs too frequently.&rdquo; Both Bekker and Spengel retain the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio:</hi> the latter with a comma between <foreign lang="greek">sundroma\s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)kklhsi/as</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And Isocrates, &ldquo;to those that flock together promiscuously (scramble, as it were) in the general festivals&rdquo;&rsquo;. This is an expression of precisely the same import as the preceding. It occurs in Isocr. Phil. &sect; 12, and runs thus, <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti to\ me\n tai=s panhgu/resin e)noxlei=n kai\ pro\s a(/pantas le/gein tou\s suntre/xontas e)n au)tai=s pro\s ou)de/na le/gein e)sti/n, k.t.l.</foreign> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the example in the Funeral Oration, that &ldquo;Greece might well have her hair cut off (go into mourning) over the tomb of those that died at Salamis, for her freedom and their valour were buried in the same grave&rdquo;: for had he only said &ldquo;that she might well weep for the virtue that lay buried with them&rdquo;, it would have been a metaphor and a graphic touch, but the (addition of) &ldquo;freedom with the virtue&rdquo; carries with it a kind of antithesis&rsquo;. This really affecting passage, which Aristotle has partially spoiled by omission and alteration, runs thus in the original&mdash; the funeral oration attributed to Lysias<note anchored="yes">This speech is condemned as spurious by [Dobree and] Baiter and Sauppe [and also by Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, I p. 431, and Jebb, <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi>, I p. 208. It contains some close parallels to the Panegyric of Isocrates and would appear to have been written by one of the pupils of that rhetorician, from whom Ar. (it will be observed) takes the quotation just preceding the present passage]. Let us hear on the other side Mr Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> vol. VI [chap. XLVIII] p. 191, note, &ldquo;Of (the funeral orations) as&lt;*&gt;ribed to Plato and Lysias also, the genuineness has been suspected, though upon far less grounds (than that attributed to Demosth.)..... but this harangue of Lysias,  <hi rend="italic">a very fine composition</hi>, may well be his, and may perhaps have been really delivered&mdash;though probably not delivered by him, as he was not a qualified citizen.&rdquo; In this judgment I entirely agree; and it seems to derive some authority from the citation of this extract here, as a specimen of pointed style, which shews that it was at all events well known to Aristotle and the Athenian public, and well remembered, though the author's name is not given; perhaps for this very reason, that the authorship of it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so well known.</note>, Or. 2, in Baiter and Sauppe's <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> I 68, &sect; 60: &ldquo;and therefore Greece might well that day cut off her hair over yonder tomb (the orator is on the spot, and points to it) and mourn for those that lie buried here, seeing that her own (the text has <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">their</hi> own, the collective <foreign lang="greek">*(ella/s</foreign> being resolved into its component members) freedom and their valour are laid together in one grave&rdquo;. Aristotle has very much marred the simple beauty of the sentence (which if it be not Lysias', is at all events quite worthy of him) by his alterations; <pb n="121"/> especially the substitution of the frigid, explanatory, <foreign lang="greek">tw=| tw=n e)n *salami=ni</foreign>, for the graphic <foreign lang="greek">tw=|de</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">to/te</foreign> of the original (I here follow Victorius). [The context of the original passage shews that the substitution is really a blunder, as the reference is not to the Athenians who fought at Salamis but to those who died at Aegospotami and elsewhere towards the close of the Peloponnesian war.] </p>
						<p>The metaphor lies of course in the word <foreign lang="greek">kei/rasqai</foreign>, by which Greece is personified and compared to a woman who, according to the national custom, cuts off her hair as a sign of mourning&mdash;on this custom see Becker's <hi rend="italic">Charicles</hi>, p. 398; comp. Eur. Troad. 141, Orest. 458, Alc. 515, Suppl. 97, 974, Hel. 1060, <foreign lang="greek">pe/nqimos, penqh/rhs, koura/, kourai/</foreign>. Aesch. Choeph. 6 (Paley's note ad loc.), Hom. Il. XXIII. 142, &amp;c. The last two passages shew that this custom was not absolutely confined to women, though it was especially characteristic of them. In Lysias the personification, which is most tastelessly interrupted by the plural <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign>, is resumed in the next clause, <foreign lang="greek">w(s dustuxh\s me\n h( *(ella\s toiou/twn a)ndrw=n o)rfanh\ genome/nh k.t.l.</foreign> Here Greece becomes a bereaved mother. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And as Iphicrates said, &ldquo;the course of my argument cuts right through the middle of Chares' acts&rdquo;: a proportional metaphor; and the &ldquo;right through the middle&rdquo; sets the thing vividly before our eyes&rsquo;. This was said by Iphicrates in the same case as that which is noticed in II 23. 7 (see note), the prosecution, namely, of him and his colleagues Menestheus and Timotheus, together with Chares, who were all brought to trial by Aristophon the Azenian in 355 B. C. on the scrutiny of their accounts, for misconduct in their command during the Social war. Sauppe u. s. p. 191, commenting on this passage, says &ldquo;Iphicrates se et collegas accusatos defendens exponit quam male Chares rem gesserit. Hoc facturus dixit, iter orationes suae ferre per medias Charetis res gestas, <hi rend="italic">quasi de itinere per hostium fines faciundo</hi> diceret.&rdquo; The <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of the metaphor is this: As a road is carried, or an army or expedition marched, right into the heart of an enemy's country, so Iphicrates in his defence carried hostility and destruction (exposure and censure) into Chares' conduct during their joint command. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the saying, &ldquo;to invite dangers to the help (rescue, remedy) of dangers&rdquo; is a vivid metaphor&rsquo;. The author, and occasion, of this sentence are alike unknown. I have followed Schrader in the translation. To rid yourself of one danger another must often be invoked or invited, as a man saves himself from a shipwrecked vessel by throwing himself overboard and clinging to a plank. He also quotes Florus, I. 17, <hi rend="italic">Fabius Maximus periculosissimum bellum bello explicavit.</hi> The metaphor lies in <foreign lang="greek">parakalei=n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">bohqh/sontas</foreign>, which are transferred from men to dangers, which are thereby &lsquo;animated&rsquo;; <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)/yuxon</foreign> becomes <foreign lang="greek">e)/myuxon</foreign>. <pb n="122"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And (what) Lycoleon (said) in his defence of Chabrias, &ldquo;not even awed by that symbol of his supplication, the bronze image (yonder)&rdquo;&rsquo;. Of Lycoleon nothing seems to be known, beyond what may be gathered from this passage, that he was an Athenian orator, and defended Chabrias in his trial B. C. 366. </p>
						<p>The circumstances referred to are briefly these. In 366 B. C. Chabrias was brought to trial with Callistratus, the orator, on a charge of misconduct leading to the loss of Oropus. See <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>, note ad I 7. 13. Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> X [chap. LXXIX] pp. 392, 3, and note 3<note anchored="yes">Diog. Laert., III 3. 24, says that Plato also was engaged in the defence of Chabrias, no one else daring to undertake it. See Grote's <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, I 128, note i.</note>. Chabrias had greatly distinguished himself on a former occasion, described in Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> X [chap. LXXVII] pp. 172, 3, in an action near Thebes fought against Agesilaus and the Lacedaemonians, 378 B. C. Agesilaus &ldquo;was daunted by the firm attitude and excellent array of the troops of Chabrias. They had received orders to await his approach on a high and advantageous ground, without moving until signal should be given; with their shields resting on the knee, and their spears protruded&rdquo; (Diodorus, XV. 33, Cornelius Nepos, Chabr. c. 1, <hi rend="italic">obnixo genu scuto</hi>). &ldquo;The Athenian public having afterwards voted a statue in his honour, he made choice of this attitude for the design.&rdquo; Ib. 173, note 1. This is also referred to, the details being passed over, in Dem. c. Lept., in a long enumeration of all Chabrias' services to his country, &sect;&sect; 75&mdash;78; <foreign lang="greek">pro\s a(/pantas *peloponnhsi/ous pareta/cato e)n *qh/bais</foreign>, &sect; 76. See also Wolf, ad loc. p. 479. 25 (Sch&auml;fer, <hi rend="italic">Appar. ad Dem.</hi> III 168). Lycoleon in his speech points to this statue which stood in the <foreign lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign> in sight of the court, and taking advantage of the posture of it, which he interprets as that of a suppliant, appeals from it to the feelings of the judges, at the same time reminding them of the merits of the original. The effect no doubt must have been very striking. The <hi rend="italic">metaphor</hi> resides in <foreign lang="greek">i(kethri/an</foreign>, which is transferred from the suppliant's olive-branch (<foreign lang="greek">e)lai/an</foreign>) to a suppliant attitude in general, implied in the posture of the kneeling figure. On the accusative of the object of awe with <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nesqai</foreign>, see note on II 2. 22. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For it was a metaphor at the moment (whilst Lycoleon was speaking and Chabrias was in actual danger), but not for ever (i. e. so long, and no longer; not permanently), but yet perpetually (repeat <foreign lang="greek">a)ei/</foreign>, Schrader) before the eyes (vivid and graphic): for it is only while he (Chabrias) is in danger that the image seems to supplicate, but the inanimate is ever animated&mdash;&ldquo;the monument of his deeds for the city&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This very obscure sentence seems intended as an explanatory com<pb n="123"/> mentary on the preceding extract. It is truly <hi rend="italic">obscurum per obscurius</hi>, a masterpiece of Aristotelian brevity, and a complete illustration of the Horatian <hi rend="italic">brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio.</hi> I follow Schrader and Victorius in the interpretation. First he says that there is a metaphor: this of course is in the word <foreign lang="greek">i(kethri/an</foreign>, as above explained. But the metaphorical application of it only continues during the danger of the person represented; when that is over, and the suppliant out of danger, the statue loses indeed the suppliant character with which it was invested for the time by the application of Lycoleon, but retains the posture and its associations as &ldquo;the memorial of his services to the state.&rdquo; (I agree with Victorius in supposing that this is a continuation of the extract, and <foreign lang="greek">to\ u(po/mnhma</foreign> therefore in apposition with <foreign lang="greek">th\n ei)ko/na th\n xalkh=n</foreign>. He ingeniously suggests an alternative, that it may be a second extract from the same speech, <hi rend="italic">alibi in eadem causa</hi>, and another example of a pointed and graphic saying.) <foreign lang="greek">kinduneu/ontos ga/r...h( ei)kw/n</foreign> is the explanation of <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  ou)k a)ei/</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">to\ a)/yuxon e)/myuxon</foreign> of <foreign lang="greek">pro\ o)mma/twn</foreign>. Comp. c. 11. 2, 3, a vivid representation gives <hi rend="italic">animation</hi> to <hi rend="italic">inanimate</hi> objects. If this explanation be correct we must read <foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">dh/</foreign>: by which the explanation of <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  ou)k a)ei/</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">contrasted</hi> with that of <foreign lang="greek">pro\ o)mma/twn. dh/</foreign> is retained by all the Edd., but I cannot discover any sense in which it is here applicable. It seems also that <foreign lang="greek">u(pe/r</foreign> has dropt out in the phrase <foreign lang="greek">to\ u(po/mn. tw=n</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">u(pe\r</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">th=s po/lews e)/rgwn. u(po/mnhma</foreign> occurs in the same sense, Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 156, and de Pace &sect; 124. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And, &ldquo;in every way practising (or studying) meanness of spirit&rdquo;, for <hi rend="italic">studying</hi> is a kind of <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">promoting.</hi>&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">meleta=n</foreign> being a &lsquo;kind&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign>, of <foreign lang="greek">au)/cein</foreign>, the metaphor is one <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ tou= ei)/dous e)pi\ ge/nos</foreign>, Poet. XXI 7, one of the four kinds of metaphor. &lsquo;To study&rsquo; therefore, which is one kind of the genus &lsquo;promoting&rsquo;, is here put metaphorically for the general term &lsquo;to promote&rsquo;. And the <hi rend="italic">point</hi> of the metaphor lies in the unusual application of &lsquo;study&rsquo;: a man usually studies or takes pains to promote some worthy object, to cultivate some virtue: here the object is an unworthy one, a vice or defect. This is taken from Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 151, in a note on which passage Coraes ingeniously proposed to read <foreign lang="greek">a)skei=n</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">au)/cein</foreign> in Aristotle's comment on <foreign lang="greek">meleta=n</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And &ldquo;that God kindled (lit up) reason as a light in the soul&rdquo;: for both of them shew something (make things clear and visible)&rsquo;. This is a proportional metaphor. As light to material, so reason to intellectual objects. <hi rend="italic">Cuius haec verba sunt nondum repperi</hi>, says Victorius, and no subsequent commentator has supplied the deficiency. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;(The peaces that we make are nugatory) for we do not put an end to <pb n="124"/> wars (do away with them altogether), but merely postpone them&rsquo;. This also comes from Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 172. &lsquo;For both of them look to the future (to future results), both actual postponement (in its proper sense and application) and a peace of that kind&rsquo;. This therefore is a metaphor from <foreign lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign>, from one kind of postponement, to another, analogous, kind. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And to say &ldquo;that the treaty is a far fairer trophy than those which are obtained in wars: for the one is for the sake of (to commemorate) a trifling success and a single chance, but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> for (on behalf of, marking the issue of,) the entire war&rdquo;: for both of them are signs of victory&rsquo;. Isocr. Paneg. &sect; 180, quoted by Aristotle, as Mr Sandys says in his note, <hi rend="italic">memoriter.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">mia=s tu/xhs</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">explained</hi> by Isocr. Antid. &sect; 128. It is &lsquo;a single stroke of fortune&rsquo;, a mere lucky accident, as opposed to a <hi rend="italic">series of successes</hi>, which prove design, skill, and knowledge. (<foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign>, the mark of quotation). &lsquo;Again, &ldquo;Cities pay a heavy reckoning (render a terrible account, for their misdeeds) to (or by?) the censure of mankind.&rdquo; For the &ldquo;account&rdquo; or &ldquo;reckoning&rdquo; is a legal damage or punishment&rsquo;. The explanation shews, first, (as Bernays also remarks, <hi rend="italic">Dialog. des Arist.</hi> p. 16,) that <foreign lang="greek">eu)/quna</foreign> here expresses not merely the account itself that is rendered, but the penalty consequent upon it, if unsatisfactory: and secondly, that the metaphor is a transfer from the legal and particular scrutiny or account rendered by the officer on laying down his command, and extended from this to an account or scrutiny <hi rend="italic">in general</hi>, the penalty paid by whole cities to the judgment and censure of mankind and posterity: consequently it is a metaphor from <foreign lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign> to <foreign lang="greek">ge/nos</foreign>, from species to genus. The passage referred to in Bernays' treatise will furnish a commentary on the use and signification of <foreign lang="greek">eu)qu/nas</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">lo/gon</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">lo/gous dido/nai</foreign>, pp. 15, 16. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)/quna</lemma>] This, according to some authorities, as B&ouml;ckh and L. Dindorf, is the only true Attic form of the word, <foreign lang="greek">eu)qu/nh</foreign> belonging to the later Greek. G. Dindorf writes <foreign lang="greek">eu)qu=nai</foreign>, Dem.

It is however approved by Timaeus (p. 26 Ruhnken). Ruhnken in his note indignantly denies the use of the word in Plato, and refers it to the later Greek. <pb n="125"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And so we have despatched the subject of the pointed sayings that are derived from the proportional metaphor and by the vivid graphic language that sets things described before your eyes (presents them vividly to your mind's eye, as it were to the actual sense)&rsquo;. </p>

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tetra/gwnos</lemma> comes from Simonides&mdash;or rather from the Pythagoreans, who by a square number or figure symbolized (or, as Aristotle tells us, Met.

						<p>The second extract quoted from Isocr. Phil. &sect; 127 requires the context to justify its selection as an example of animated style; with that, it becomes very striking. The orator is contrasting the entire freedom of view which Philip's commanding position allows him, as compared with the narrow patriotism enforced upon those who are &lsquo;fast bound&rsquo; in the constitution and laws of their native cities; which he expresses by <foreign lang="greek">se\ d'  w(/sper a)/feton gegenhme/non a(/pasan th\n *(ella/da patri/da nomi/zein k.t.l.</foreign>&mdash;a flight quite beyond Isocrates' ordinary range of imagination. The metaphor is of course derived from the sacred cattle which were devoted to the worship of some god, and left free from the ordinary labours of the plough and cart, to roam and graze at large in the sacred precincts, the <foreign lang="greek">te/menos</foreign> of his temple. See Plat. Protag. 320 A, Rep. VI 498 C, and the notes of the Comm.: Aesch. Prom. Vinct. 666, 684 (Paley) and the note there (also Blomfield's Glossary, 687), Eur. Ion 822, <foreign lang="greek">o( d'  e)n qeou= do/moisin a)/fetos, w(s la/qoi, paideu/etai</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The difference between the mere metaphor <foreign lang="greek">tetra/gwnos</foreign>, and the metaphor which also vivifies and animates, is this: in a square there is neither life nor action; in &lsquo;blooming&rsquo; we have the life of a plant, in <foreign lang="greek">a)/feton</foreign> of an animal, in <foreign lang="greek">a)/|cantes</foreign> the vigour and impetuosity of living human beings. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;And Homer's frequent employment of the figure which invests inanimate objects with life and motion by the medium of the metaphor. But in all of them it is by representing (objects) as animated&mdash;setting them as it were in <hi rend="italic">action</hi>&mdash;that he distinguishes himself (acquires his popularity, secures our approbation): in the following for instance: &ldquo;again (this belongs to the preceding sentence: <foreign lang="greek">au)=qis: e)/peita pe/donde kuli/ndeto la=as a)naidh\s</foreign> is the reading of Homer, Od. XI 598): then to the plain rolled the ruthless (remorseless) stone&rdquo;&rsquo; [&ldquo;Downward anon to the valley the boulder remorselessly bounded&rdquo;]. The animating metaphor is of course in <foreign lang="greek">a)naidh/s</foreign>, which attributes not only life, but also shamelessness, recklessness, remorselessness, want of mercy and proper feeling, to the stone. Whately, u.s., ingeniously, but not correctly: &lsquo;provoking&rsquo;, mocking Sisyphus' efforts, <foreign lang="greek">a)naidh=</foreign>, in the same sense, ruthless, pitiless, Soph. <pb n="127"/> Oed.

						<p>&lsquo;And &ldquo;the spear-point panting, quivering in its eagerness, rushed through his breast&rdquo;&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>On these extracts, Whately, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> u. s., note, well observes, &ldquo;that there is a peculiar aptitude in some of these expressions: an arrow or dart from it flying with a spinning motion quivers violently when it is fixed; thus suggesting the idea of one quivering with eagerness&rdquo;. This is particularly applicable to the two last extracts. In the third, <foreign lang="greek">i(/stanto</foreign> may help to convey this. The darts which fell short of their aim, struck, were fixed, in the ground, and there stood quivering. &ldquo;And winged the shaft that quivered in his heart&rdquo;. Byron (of Kirke White), in <hi rend="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.</hi> Gaisford, in <hi rend="italic">Variorum not.</hi> p. 426, adds Od. <foreign lang="greek">e/ 175, nh=es, a)gallo/menai</foreign> (exulting) <foreign lang="greek">*dio\s ou)/rw|</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;For in all these by reason of the living character (with which they are invested) they appear to be in action: for &ldquo;shameless conduct&rdquo;, and &ldquo;quivering with eagerness&rdquo; and the rest, all express forms of activity (implying life). But these he has applied to them through the medium of the proportional metaphor, for as the stone is to Sisyphus, so is the shameless actor to him who is shamelessly treated&rsquo;. <pb n="128"/> </p>
						<p>I am sorry to be obliged to differ from our author in the view he here takes of the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">a)naidh/s</foreign>. The notion of &ldquo;reckless impudence&rdquo;, conveyed by his equivalent <foreign lang="greek">a)nai/sxuntos</foreign>, seems to me altogether alien from the Homeric conception of it. I can't think that &ldquo;reckless impudence&rdquo;, <foreign lang="greek">a)naisxunti/a</foreign>, is what <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> meant to attribute to the stone when he called it <foreign lang="greek">a)naidh/s</foreign>, but &lsquo;unmerciful treatment&rsquo;. At all events it is better than Pope's &ldquo;huge round stone.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Or if one were to say that an anchor and a hook were the same: for they are both the same kind of thing, but differ in position&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;the above and below&rsquo;). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">krema/qra</lemma> is defined by the Schol. on Ar. Nub. 218, and by Suidas, as a basket for remnants, <foreign lang="greek">ei)s o(\ ta\ peritteu/onta o)/ya</foreign> (the leavings of the dinner-table) <foreign lang="greek">ei)w/qamen a)poti/qesqai</foreign>.

Hence the use of it for Socrates in the Clouds, u. s. But it is plain that that cannot be the meaning of it here, for it does not answer to the subsequent description of it, in respect either of the resemblance or the difference stated. Rost and Palm in their Lexicon translate it &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">ankertau</hi>&rsquo;, the cable that holds the anchor; but this is open to precisely the same objection. It must be something in the nature of a hook, from which things may be <hi rend="italic">suspended;</hi> and is literally &lsquo;a suspending instrument&rsquo;. The resemblance to the anchor lies in its hooked form, and also in the intention or design of them both, which is to keep things where they are, preservation or security. The difference is that the anchor is applied to keep the vessel safe and steady <hi rend="italic">at the bottom</hi>, the hook is <hi rend="italic">above</hi>, and from it the thing suspended <hi rend="italic">hangs.</hi> Liddell and Scott have <foreign lang="greek">krema/stra</foreign> (the reading of three inferior MSS) with this reference, and identify it with <foreign lang="greek">krema/qra</foreign> in the Nubes. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the re-equalisation of cities (in the respect of property, and powers, i. e. state offices, privileges, &amp;c.) when the same principle is applied to (is the same for) things standing wide apart (very dissimilar, viz. to surface (area) and powers (functions, offices, prerogatives &amp;c.)&rsquo;. The widely dissimilar things which are here brought together for comparison, are the areas of properties, and the state offices and privileges, &amp;c., which are to be alike <hi rend="italic">equalised.</hi> The Scholiast quoted by Vater, explains the word and its application in the same way of the equalisation of the properties, fortunes or conditions, duties and rights of the citizens of a state. Victorius quotes Isocr. Phil. &sect; 40, <foreign lang="greek">oi)=da ga\r a(pa/sas w(malisme/nas u(po\ tw=n</foreign> <pb n="130"/> <foreign lang="greek">sumforw=n</foreign>, all the Greek cities have been alike levelled to one condition by their misfortunes. </p>
						<p>Vahlen has again applied his perverted ingenuity to the emendation of this passage. The passage wants none: it is clear in sense and construction, and the reading of the text is retained by Bekker and Spengel. In the first place, <foreign lang="greek">an</foreign> in the compound verb is not <emph><foreign lang="greek">a</foreign></emph> privative with <emph><foreign lang="greek">n</foreign></emph> inserted, as <foreign lang="greek">a)nw/numos, a)nw/dunos</foreign>, &amp;c., but <foreign lang="greek">a)na/</foreign> is <hi rend="italic">re</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">breaking up</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">a)nalu/ein</foreign>, &amp;c.) for redistribution, restoring to an original equality: so <foreign lang="greek">a)nadido/nai</foreign> &lsquo;to distribute&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">yh/fous</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">a)nada/sasqai</foreign> &lsquo;to redistribute&rsquo; Thuc. V 4, <foreign lang="greek">a)na/dastos, a)nadasmo/s</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">de agro ex integro aequis partibus dividendo</hi> (Herod., Plat., see Ruhnken's Timaeus p. 33), <foreign lang="greek">a)nane/mein</foreign>, et sim. <foreign lang="greek">a)nwmali/sqai</foreign> therefore does not denote <hi rend="italic">in</hi>equality, but <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-equalisation. What the signification of the word is, appears from two passages of the Polit. II 7, 1266 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 3 and c. 12, 1274 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9. In the first of these the word is <foreign lang="greek">o(malisqh=nai</foreign>, in the second, <foreign lang="greek">a)noma/lwsis</foreign>, from verbs in <foreign lang="greek">-i/zein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">-ou=n</foreign> respectively. They both refer to the same thing, viz. Phaleas of Chalcedon's scheme for the equalisation or re-equalisation of properties, and plainly, except perhaps so far as the <foreign lang="greek">a)na/</foreign> is concerned, have precisely the same signification: and this is perfectly applicable here. Vahlen proposes <foreign lang="greek">kai\ &ldquo;o(malisqh=nai ta\s po/leis&rdquo; e)n polu\ die/xousi tau)to/</foreign>. His objection to <foreign lang="greek">a)nwmali/sqai</foreign> seems to me to be entirely unfounded, and I can see no reason whatever for altering the text. There is another slight alteration proposed, which is not worth mentioning. </p>

						<p>This introduces a new topic of <foreign lang="greek">a)stei=a</foreign>, things pointed and lively, in the sense of witticisms, things amusing and laughable, such as jokes <foreign lang="greek">par'  u(po/noian</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">para\ prosdoki/an</foreign>, repartees, puns, plays upon words, and the like. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Though it is true in general that most of these &lsquo;vivacities&rsquo; are conveyed by (<foreign lang="greek">dia/</foreign>) metaphor, yet they are also derived from (a temporary, momentary) delusion (leading to a pleasing <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi> at the unexpected supplement): for it becomes clearer (to the listener) that he has learnt something from (the conclusion of the sentence) being contrary&rsquo; to his expectation&mdash;or, as Victorius, from <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> contrary, i.e. changed, state of mind, which has arisen between the beginning and end of the sentence&mdash;&lsquo;and the soul seems to say to herself, &ldquo;Really, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> it is; and I missed it (never found it out till now)&rdquo;&rsquo;. (This explanation of the pleasure derived from the <hi rend="italic">unexpected</hi> surprise,&mdash;that the previous deception heightens the pleasure of the acquired knowledge&mdash;is due, I think, rather to the theory which had become habitual with Ar., that all intellectual pleasure is due to the natural desire of learning, than to <pb n="131"/> his sober judgment exercised upon this particular application of it.) Schrader has supplied two capital instances of this form of pleasantry: the first is from Cic. de Or. II 281, <hi rend="italic">Quid huic abest&mdash;nisi res et virtus?</hi> Here the listener is <hi rend="italic">misled</hi> by the opening of the sentence to expect a very good character of somebody, when unexpectedly, after a pause, two words are added as exceptions, which convert the expected eulogium into beggary and worthlessness: but is it the <hi rend="italic">learning</hi>, the becoming acquainted with that fact, however unexpectedly, that constitutes the pleasure or amusement that the listener derives from his surprise? A still better from Quint. of a dandy advocate, <hi rend="italic">illud Afri</hi> &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">homo in agendis causis optime&mdash; vestitus</hi>,&rdquo; for the expected <hi rend="italic">versatus</hi><note anchored="yes">What is learnt here is only that the man whom you expected (at the beginning of the sentence) to be an accomplished lawyer, turns out to be an empty coxcomb. It may be doubted again whether the knowledge of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> fact would give much pleasure.</note>, Quint. VI 3. 24 and 84. This topic he calls, <hi rend="italic">decipiendi opinionem.</hi> He returns to it again in VIII 5. 15 under the name of <hi rend="italic">ex inopinato:</hi> and gives two examples. Cic. de Or. II 63. 255; 70. 284, <hi rend="italic">iocus praeter expectationem.</hi> I have quoted two or three English ones in the note to Introd. p. 319, note 3. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And the apophthegms that have point and vivacity derive this character from the <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi> statement of the meaning (from the speaker's not directly expressing the intended meaning), as that of Stesichorus &ldquo;that their cicalas will have to sing to themselves from the ground&rdquo;&rsquo; all the trees being cut down and the land devastated; which is the real, direct, meaning: and <foreign lang="greek">e(autoi=s</foreign>, that there will be no one else to listen to them. On <foreign lang="greek">a)pofqe/gmata</foreign>, see II 21. 8, where this is also quoted, Stesichorus' apophthegm also appears in Demetr. <foreign lang="greek">p. e(rm.</foreign> &sect; 99 where it is attributed to Dionysius (the tyrant; as a threat); and &sect; 243, as an example of <foreign lang="greek">braxulogi/a</foreign> in the chapter on <foreign lang="greek">deino/ths</foreign>. This is a <hi rend="italic">riddle</hi> in the shape of an apophthegm: the next topic brings us to aenigmas proper. The pleasure derived from these is traced, as usual, to that of learning: and against that explanation in the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> instance I have no objection to make. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And for the same reason, riddles well wrapped up give pleasure: for not only is this (viz. the solution of them) a kind of <hi rend="italic">learning</hi>, but they are also expressed in metaphor. And what Theodorus calls &ldquo;novel phrases, expressions.&rdquo; This is effected (this <hi rend="italic">novelty</hi>, this <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi>) when (the sequel) is unexpected, and not, to use his own words, &ldquo;according to previous opinion or expectation&rdquo;; but, as is the custom of humorous, <pb n="132"/> jocular writers, who alter the letters of words to make jokes&rsquo;. I have given a free transl. of the last clause; with <foreign lang="greek">oi( e)n toi=s geloi/ois</foreign> understand <foreign lang="greek">o)/ntes</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">diatri/bontes</foreign>; and with <foreign lang="greek">ta\ parapepoihme/na, poiou=sin</foreign>, or the like. </p>

						<p>On Theodorus of Byzantium, see note on II 23. 28, ult. and the references there given. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Which is the effect also of <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> jokes (founded upon the letters and the changes of them); for these also cheat (the expectation, and so far mislead). (This kind of joke is not confined to prose: it appears) also in verses. For (the conclusion) is not as the hearer (the <hi rend="italic">listener</hi> to the recitation of a rhapsodist) supposed: &ldquo;and he trod with his&mdash;chilblains under his feet&rdquo; (statelily stept he along, and under his feet were his&mdash; chilblains)&mdash;whereas the other thought he was going to say &ldquo;sandals&rdquo;&rsquo;. This <foreign lang="greek">para\ gramma\ skw=mma</foreign>, which must be taken from some burlesque hexameter poem&mdash;author unknown&mdash;has its counterpart in Arist. Vesp. 1167, <foreign lang="greek">kakodai/mwn e)gw/: o(/stis g'  e)pi\ gh/ra| xi/metlon ou)de\n lh/yomai</foreign>. The Schol. ad h. l. (in Gaisford's <hi rend="italic">Not.

						<p>&lsquo;Pleasantries arising from changes of letters (plays on words) are produced, not by a mere enunciation of a word in its direct meaning, but by something (a change) which gives a different <hi rend="italic">turn</hi> to it, (converts or twists it into a different sense); as that of Theodorus (of Byzantium, the rhetorician: <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, II 23. 28), against Nicon the harper, <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei</foreign>: he pretends namely to say &ldquo;it confounds you&rdquo; (you are confounded), and cheats; for he means something else: and therefore it is amusing only after one has become acquainted with the meaning (or circumstances); <pb n="133"/> for if (the hearer) doesn't know that he is a Thracian, he will see no point in it at all&rsquo;. Victorius and Schrader have both missed the meaning of this pun. But in order to arrive at it, we must first remove from the text the first <foreign lang="greek">se</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei</foreign> which has been introduced from the second (where it is required) and spoils the pun. Nicon, it appears from the explanation, is, or is supposed to be, of foreign extraction; and not only that, but a Thracian, the most barbarous of all nations. The Thracian women were habitually slaves, in Athenian families: Arist. Thesm. 279, 280, 284, 293, Pac. 1138, Vesp. 828. This person is addressed by Theodorus with the word <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei</foreign>, which means <hi rend="italic">apparently</hi>, &lsquo;You are confounded&rdquo;; this appears from the interpretation that follows, (<foreign lang="greek">ti</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei se</foreign>, which is of course convertible in meaning with the passive <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei</foreign> (and it follows also that the first <foreign lang="greek">se</foreign> must be an error of the transcriber, for <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei se</foreign> would be no interpretation of <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei se</foreign>; nor in that form would there be any pun).

						<p>The amusement derived from a pun is thus explained by Cicero, de Or.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">bou/lei au)to\n pe/rsai</lemma>] No satisfactory explanation has hitherto been given of this pun. The point of the joke has been always supposed to lie in <foreign lang="greek">pe/rsai</foreign>. Franc&eacute;sco dei Medici, a friend of Vettori, suggested to him a solution which he quotes at length, that the Persae a poem of Timotheus is referred to, and that we should read <foreign lang="greek">*pe/rsais</foreign>. But as Buhle justly remarks, &ldquo;non video quidnam in hoc sit <hi rend="italic">faceti.</hi>&rdquo; Majoragius' explanation, who supposes that there was a verb <foreign lang="greek">*pe/rsein</foreign>, of the same meaning as <foreign lang="greek">*mhdi/zein</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">Persis favere</hi>, is equally out of the question. I have looked (for once) into Spengel's commentary, and find that he has suggested an analogy with Horace's <hi rend="italic">vin tu curtis Iudaeis oppedere</hi>, Sat. I 9.70. The same thought once occurred to me, but I abandoned it, in consideration of the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the word, <foreign lang="greek">pe/rsai</foreign>; which, though a possible aorist, is entirely without authority. <foreign lang="greek">pe/rdomai</foreign> is a dep. and has <foreign lang="greek">pardh/somai</foreign> for its future, <foreign lang="greek">e)/pardon</foreign> for the aorist. The solution I have finally arrived at is that the alteration of letters which makes the pun, resides in <foreign lang="greek">bou/lei</foreign>. This would probably be pronounced nearly, if not quite, like <foreign lang="greek">boulh/</foreign>, and the word could be rendered &lsquo;will you?&rsquo; or &lsquo;the Council&rsquo;: in the <pb n="134"/> latter sense the words would mean &lsquo;may the council destroy him.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Sed de his nugis iam satis est.</hi> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;But both of them&rsquo; (either the two last examples of <foreign lang="greek">para\ gra/mma</foreign>; or that topic itself and the preceding, <foreign lang="greek">para\ prosdoki/an</foreign>: they all require the same precaution) &lsquo;must be properly pronounced&rsquo; (or delivered&mdash;attention must be called to the <foreign lang="greek">para\ prosdoki/an</foreign>, by a slight pause, and to the double-entendre by heightening the tone or some similar expedient). The following words, <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw de\ kai\ ta\ a)stei=a</foreign>, sadly want the end of the sentence to enable us to determine their meaning. Victorius understands it, &ldquo;tanquam in <foreign lang="greek">skw/mmasin</foreign> et iocis amarioribus, ita in urbanis hisce sermonibus&rdquo;: but Ar. makes no such distinction: all the jokes <foreign lang="greek">para\ gra/mma</foreign> are alike <foreign lang="greek">a)stei=a</foreign>.

In default of any thing better I propose the following:&mdash; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And so likewise witticisms, pointed sayings <hi rend="italic">in general</hi> (as distinguished from the two special varieties, or two particular instances preceding), (require the same attention to <hi rend="italic">pronunciation</hi>), as to say that &ldquo;to the Athenians the <hi rend="italic">command</hi> of the sea was not the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> (both expressed by the same word, <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/n</foreign>) of their misfortunes&rdquo;; for they derived benefit from it&rsquo; (it was the <hi rend="italic">source</hi> not of evil, but of good). Or, as Isocrates puts it, that &ldquo;the command was to the city the beginning (or source) of her calamities.&rdquo; This, or something like it, occurs three times in Isocrates. The two similar places, one a mere repetition of the other, Phil. &sect; 61, and de Pace &sect; 101, are probably what Ar. had (very imperfectly) in his recollection: the third is, Paneg. &sect; 119, which differs more widely from the quotation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;For in both (these cases, or examples) that is said which one would not suppose likely to be said by any one, (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> which one would not suppose that any one, <foreign lang="greek">tina/</foreign>, would say) and (yet, at the same time) is recognised as true (sound, in accordance with facts, Victorius, see III 7.9, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> &sect; 10): for though it is true that there is nothing particularly clever in calling the <hi rend="italic">command</hi> a <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi>, (in calling <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh\ a)rxh/</foreign>, though in different senses), still he uses the term not in the same, but in different senses, (in the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> example, Vahlen), and does not contradict (or deny) the use of <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign> (in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> example), only in a different sense&rsquo;. The second example, from Isocrates, may seem at first sight to <pb n="135"/> contradict the first, what is affirmed in the one being denied in the other. But if allowance be made for the double sense of <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign>, the apparent discrepancy between the two statements will disappear. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;But in all these cases, the merit (<foreign lang="greek">to\ eu)=</foreign>) consists in the proper application of the term (i. e. the <hi rend="italic">appropriateness</hi> of it to the thing described), whether by (expressed in) ambiguity (the play on words) or metaphor&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">e)ne/gkh|</foreign>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">o( le/gwn</foreign>: and comp.

Significant Greek names are to be found in II 23. 29, III 15. 8; Latin in Quint. VI 3. 55.

						<p>&lsquo;And, &ldquo;never make thyself as a stranger, more of a stranger than is required of thee&rdquo;, &ldquo;not more than thou art bound to do&rdquo;; the same thing (in different words)&rsquo;.

Victorius thinks that one of the two may mean &lsquo;host&rsquo; or &lsquo;guest&rsquo;; but as <foreign lang="greek">ce/nos</foreign> is not repeated in the alternative, Vahlen's explanation seems more probable. &lsquo;And, (in a third way) &ldquo;a stranger must not be always a stranger&rdquo; (or, strange): for that too is again of <pb n="136"/> a different kind, or form&rsquo;, (foreign, alien, to the two others: <foreign lang="greek">a)llo/trion</foreign> belonging to something or somebody else; opposed to <foreign lang="greek">oi)kei=on</foreign>). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Of the same kind is also that so highly praised verse of Anaxandrides, &ldquo;A noble thing it is to die ere doing aught worthy of death&rdquo;: for this is the same as saying, &ldquo;It is worthy to die when one is not worthy to die&rdquo;, or &ldquo;it is a worthy thing to die when one does not deserve death&rdquo;, or &ldquo;doing nothing worthy of death&rdquo;&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Similes too, as has been already said in the preceding (chapter, c. 4), are always in a certain sense popular metaphors. For they are always composed of (or, expressed in) two terms, just like the proportional metaphor; as for instance, the shield, we say, is Ares' goblet&rsquo;, (the shape of the <foreign lang="greek">fia/lh</foreign> is in reality more like an elongated saucer, or shield&mdash; whence the comparison), &lsquo;and a bow a stringless harp. When thus expressed, the phrase is not single (or simple; it has <hi rend="italic">both</hi> terms expressed, the two terms viz. that are brought into comparison; and is therefore a simile); whereas to call the bow a harp or the shield a goblet is single&rsquo; (and therefore only a metaphor).

						<p>The meaning seems to be this.

						<p>On the <foreign lang="greek">fia/lh *)/areos</foreign>, see note on III 4.4, and Introd. pp. 220&mdash;292, there referred to. This was due to Timotheus the dithyrambic poet.

On these privative epithets with metaphors, comp. III 6.7. The author of this last bit of <foreign lang="greek">a)steio/ths</foreign> is a tragic poet named Theognis, mentioned with contempt and ridicule three times by Aristophanes, Acharn. 11, and 138, and Thesm. 168.

For the black eye<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">to\ u(pw/pion</foreign>, which stands here for &lsquo;a black eye&rsquo;, is originally nothing but the seat of that, the part that is under the eye.

Victorius). According to Theophrastus, de Caus. Plant. VI 6. 4, there are two kinds of mulberries, red and white, <foreign lang="greek">e)ruqro\n kai\ leuko/n</foreign>. This is an instance of Quintilian's <hi rend="italic">first</hi> variety of hyperbole; <hi rend="italic">quum plus facto dicimus, direct</hi> exaggeration; of which two examples are given. Victorius refers to the saying of an Athenian wag about Sulla, <foreign lang="greek">suka/mino/n e)sq'  o( *su/llas a)lfi/tw| pepasme/non</foreign>, &ldquo;Sulla (i. e. his face) is like a mulberry powdered with flour&rdquo;, in Plutarch [<hi rend="italic">Sulla</hi>, c. 2, p. 451 F]. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And another (kind of phrase) like so and so&rsquo; (comp. <foreign lang="greek">ta\ kai\ ta/</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 17. 11; this seems to mean the two preceding examples, which are here repeated, <hi rend="italic">and others like them</hi>) &lsquo;is a hyperbole, differing from it merely by the form of the expression (it becomes a hyperbole by dropping the particle of comparison, <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign>). Thus &ldquo;like Philammon at close quarters with the sack&rdquo;, (may be thrown into the form of a hyperbole, thus), &ldquo;you would have taken him for Philammon fighting the sack&rdquo;. Again, &ldquo;to wear his legs curly like parsley&rdquo;, becomes &ldquo;you'ld have thought his legs not legs, but parsley, so crooked are they&rdquo;&rsquo;.

					<p>We now return for the last time to the subject of propriety of style, on which in this chapter we have some concluding observations. Rhetorical propriety must shew itself in the due adaptation of style to matter; and consequently the three branches of Rhetoric must be treated each in its appropriate style. We therefore distinguish two kinds of speeches, and two styles appropriate to them; (1) &lsquo;debate&rsquo;, speaking in the actual strife or contest of the assembly and the law-court, <foreign lang="greek">a)gw-</foreign> <pb n="144"/> <foreign lang="greek">nistikh\ le/cis</foreign>, and (2) <foreign lang="greek">grafikh/</foreign>, written compositions, which are confined to the third or epideictic branch: and the first is again subdivided into (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) public speaking, popular harangues addressed to the assembly, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) forensic. This is only true in theory: in practice speeches were often written by the orators, as Demosthenes and Isocrates, for the use of those who were incompetent or unwilling to write and plead for themselves. </p>
					<p>Under the head of <foreign lang="greek">grafikh\ le/cis</foreign> are included all compositions which are intended to be read, and consequently the whole range of literature, with the exception of speeches which are intended to be <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi> or <hi rend="italic">acted</hi>, deliberative and forensic, <hi rend="italic">public</hi> and <hi rend="italic">private</hi> orations&mdash;such as those of Demosthenes. Thus the third branch of Rhetoric, the <foreign lang="greek">e)pideiktikh/</foreign>, is made to embrace all poetry, philosophy, history, and indeed any <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> on any subject whatsoever. The distinction coincides with that of Hermogenes, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ i)dew=n tom. b/. peri\ tou= politikou= lo/gou</foreign> (see <hi rend="italic">Rhet. Gr.</hi> II. p. 401 seq. Spengel), who divides composition into <foreign lang="greek">lo/goi sumbouleutikoi/, dikanikoi/</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">panhgurikoi/</foreign>, the last including the works of Homer and Plato, the most distinguished of poets and prose writers. </p>
					<p>The declamations delivered at the Olympian Games and other great public festivals or assemblies <foreign lang="greek">panugu/reis</foreign>, whence the name <foreign lang="greek">panhgurikoi\ lo/goi</foreign>&mdash;such as Isocrates' Panegyric<note anchored="yes">See on this, Mr Sandys' Introduction to <hi rend="italic">Isocratis Panegyricus</hi>, p. XL seq.</note> and Panathenaic orations, and Lysias' celebrated <foreign lang="greek">*)olumpiako/s</foreign>, of which a short fragment is preserved, (Or. 33, Baiter et Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> I 146)&mdash;were intermediate between the public or agonistic and the epideictic or graphic speeches, partaking of the character of both; being declaimed in public and sometimes with a political object (as Lysias' speech, and some of Isocrates'), but that object was subordinate, the main consideration being always the display. Isocrates is always anxious to impress his readers with the conviction that his speeches are not mere empty declamations, <foreign lang="greek">e)pidei/ceis</foreign>, but genuine <foreign lang="greek">politikoi\ lo/goi</foreign>&mdash;are indeed a branch of Philosophy, which with him is pretty nearly convertible with Rhetoric, see <foreign lang="greek">kata\ tw=n sofistw=n</foreign> &sect;&sect; 1, 11, 21, and Mr Sandys' note on Paneg. &sect; 10. [&lsquo;Isocrates means by &ldquo;Philosophy&rdquo; a combination of the accomplishments of the <foreign lang="greek">r(h/twr</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">politiko/s</foreign>&rsquo;. Thompson's <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi>, p. 172.] </p>
					<p>Isocrates, writing from his point of view, <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/d</foreign>. &sect;&sect; 46&mdash;50, contrasts himself and his own declamations, which he calls <foreign lang="greek">*(ellhnikou\s kai\ politikou\s kai\ panhgurikou/s</foreign>, with <foreign lang="greek">dikanikoi\ lo/goi</foreign>, forensic pleading and pleaders, whom, probably in consequence of his own failure in that branch of Rhetoric, he attacks and vituperates upon intellectual, social, and moral grounds. Writing before the establishment of Aristotle's threefold division of the art, he evidently recognises only two branches, public or political speaking, in which national interests are concerned&mdash; and at the head of these he places his own <foreign lang="greek">panhgurikoi\ lo/goi</foreign>, the true philosophy (&sect; 50)&mdash;and judicial or forensic, in which private interests <pb n="145"/> between man and man are debated and decided. In respect of style, he of course gives the preference to his own kind of composition, &sect;&sect; 46, 7. </p>
					<p>On this adaptation of style to the different kinds of oratory, see Quint. VIII 3. 11&mdash;14. The opening observation, at all events, looks like a reference to this chapter, though Spalding in his note is silent on the subject. </p>
					<p>Whately also, in his <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. IV &lsquo;on Elocution&rsquo;, (<hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> p. 299 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, 300 <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, 301 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>,) has some good observations, partly derived from Aristotle, upon the contrast of the <hi rend="italic">agonistic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi> styles. On the contrast of the two, see by all means Isocr. Phil. &sect;&sect; 25, 26: all the main points of interest in public and forensic, or agonistic, speeches are there enumerated, and the comparatively lifeless speeches <hi rend="italic">to be read</hi>, forcibly contrasted with them. [Comp. also Alcidamas, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ tw=n tou\s graptou\s lo/gous grafo/ntwn</foreign>, (against Isocrates).] </p>
					<div3 id="b3c12s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;It must not be forgotten (lost sight of) that a different kind of language is appropriate to each different kind (of Rhetoric). For the same style is not suitable to <hi rend="italic">written</hi> composition (that which is intended <hi rend="italic">to be read</hi>) and that which is used in <hi rend="italic">debate</hi> (in the <hi rend="italic">contests</hi>, the actual struggle, of real life; nor again in (the two divisions of the latter) public and forensic speaking. The orator must be acquainted with both: for the one (debate) implies the knowledge and power of clear expression in pure Greek, and the other freedom from the necessity (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> the not being obliged to) of suppressing in silence (<foreign lang="greek">kata/</foreign>, keeping <hi rend="italic">down</hi>) anything that one may want to communicate to the rest of the world; which is the case with those who have no knowledge (or skill) of writing (i.e. composition)&rsquo;. Comp. III 1. 7. Cicero, de Or. II 82. 337, gives a brief description of the &lsquo;grand&rsquo; and dignified style appropriate to the exalted subjects of public speaking. </p>
						<p>The meaning of this seems to be&mdash;the orator must be acquainted with the written as well as the debating style; the latter implies and requires only the correct use of one's native language, so that one may be able to make oneself clearly intelligible: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> (debate alone) does not require the minute accuracy of studied composition, which can be examined at leisure and criticized; but since one who can only speak, and not write, is incapable of communicating his opinions to the rest of the world (<foreign lang="greek">toi=s a)/llois</foreign>, all others besides the members of the assembly or law-court that he is actually addressing), it is necessary for a statesman to acquire the power of writing well, and therefore to study in some degree the art of exact composition. Victorius, who renders <foreign lang="greek">to\ mh\ a)nagka/zesqai&mdash;toi=s a)/llois</foreign> of actual writing, that is of <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> to absent friends, seems to narrow the meaning of &lsquo;writing&rsquo; in such a way as to produce a somewhat ridiculous result. Surely <hi rend="italic">any</hi> educated man, whether he be an orator and statesman or not, requires and possesses the knowledge of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> in that sense. On <foreign lang="greek">to\ me\n ga/r e)stin e(llhni/zein e)pi/stasqai</foreign>, Thuc. II 60, 5&mdash;6 may serve as a commentary; Pericles, in his defence, describing his qualifications for a statesman, says <foreign lang="greek">ou)deno\s oi)/omai h(/sswn ei)=nai gnw=nai/ te ta\ de/onta</foreign> <pb n="146"/> <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e(rmhneu=sai tau=ta...o)/ te ga\r gnou\s kai\ mh\ safw=s dida/cas e)n i)/sw| kai\ ei) mh\ e)nequmh/qh</foreign>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The written style is the most exact&rsquo; (or finished: on <foreign lang="greek">a)kri/beia</foreign> and its various senses, see Grant ad Eth. Nic. I 7. 18, and the references in Introd. ad h. l. p. 334, note 4), &lsquo;that of debate lends itself most to acting&rsquo; (or delivery: is the &lsquo;most capable of being acted&rsquo;). Comp. III 1. 4. The reason of this as far as <hi rend="italic">declamation</hi> is concerned, viz. why the <hi rend="italic">graphic</hi> style admits of more ornament and artificial arrangement than the other, is thus stated by Cicero, Orat. LXI 208. After the invention of the period, &amp;c., he says, <hi rend="italic">nemo qui aliquo esset in numero scripsit orationem generis eius, quod esset ad delectationem comparatum remotumque a iudiciis forensique certamine, quin redigeret omnes fere in quadrum numerumque sententias.

						<p>&lsquo;Of this (<foreign lang="greek">a)gwnistikh/</foreign>) there are two kinds; one that (includes, conveys,) represents <hi rend="italic">character</hi>, the other <hi rend="italic">emotion</hi> (in the speech)&rsquo;. That is, not that <foreign lang="greek">a)gwnistikh/</foreign> is a <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, containing two <hi rend="italic">species</hi> under it, moral and emotional: for this is not the fact, and also <hi rend="italic">any</hi> speech may have <hi rend="italic">both:</hi> but that these two elements belong specially, not exclusively, to the two debating branches of Rhetoric, of which they are very prominent ingredients: the reality of the interests at stake giving more room for the play of passion and the assumption of character than the cold unimpassioned, deliberate <hi rend="italic">written</hi> compositions. The ethical part is of two kinds, the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=| le/gonti</foreign>, I 2. 4, II 1. 4, and the <hi rend="italic">characters</hi> <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> of the several ages and conditions, II 12. 17. The emotional is of course that which is partially described I 2. 5, and treated at length in II 2. 16. Of these &lsquo;appeals to the feelings&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">dei/nwsis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)/leos</foreign>, the earlier rhetorical treatises were full, I 1. 3, of which Thrasymachus' <foreign lang="greek">e)/leoi</foreign> (III 1. 7) described by Plato, Phaedr. 267 C, was a well-known specimen. Quint. III 8. 12, (In concionibus deliberatio) <hi rend="italic">affectus, ut quae maxima, postulat</hi>, seq. <hi rend="italic">Valet autem in consiliis auctoritas</hi> (this is principally due to <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>) <hi rend="italic">plurimum</hi>, seq. See III 7. 1, 3, 6, where the two are described. The <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> is there confined to those of age, nation, station, &amp;c.

						<p>&lsquo;And this is why actors also (as well as debaters) hunt after (<foreign lang="greek">diw/kousi</foreign>) plays of this kind (that is, plays of which the subjects give scope for the exhibitions of passion and character), and the poets after persons (whether <hi rend="italic">actors</hi> to represent the <foreign lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, or characters in the dramas <hi rend="italic">to be represented with</hi> them) of the same kind. At the same time, the poets <pb n="147"/> that can be read (that write to be read as well as acted or rhapsodised) become pocket-companions, or favourites&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">basta/zesqai</lemma> is said of anything that is carried about in the hand or arms, fondled, cherished, fondly and familiarly treated, like a baby or pet lapdog; and hence when applied to a book naturally means one that people are fond of, and carry about with them in their pockets. There are several instances in Sophocles&mdash;see Ellendt's Lex.&mdash;that illustrate this sense of <foreign lang="greek">basta/zesqai</foreign>, as Philoct. 655 of the <hi rend="italic">favourite</hi> bow and 657, (Neopt.) <foreign lang="greek">e)/stin w(/ste...kai\ basta/sai me</foreign> (be allowed to <hi rend="italic">nurse</hi> it), <foreign lang="greek">prosku/sai q'  w(/sper qeo/n</foreign>; Aesch.

(From an unknown rhetorician; most probably not the author's own.) &lsquo;And again, as another instance, what Philemon the actor (not to be confounded with the Comic <hi rend="italic">poet</hi>) used to do in Anaxandrides' <hi rend="italic">Old men's madness</hi>, where (lit. <hi rend="italic">when</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">o(/te</foreign>) he says (uses the words in playing his part) &ldquo;Rhadamanthys and Palamedes,&rdquo; and also, in the prologue of the <hi rend="italic">Devotees</hi>, the word <foreign lang="greek">e)gw/</foreign>: for if such things (phrases, sentences, or words) as these be not (varied) in the delivery, they become like &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> man that carries the beam,&rdquo; in the proverb (<foreign lang="greek">th/n</foreign>)&rsquo;, i.e. stiff and awkward, like one that has &lsquo;swallowed a poker&rsquo;, as <hi rend="italic">our</hi> proverb has it. </p>
						<p>Anaxandrides, quoted before, III 10.7. The first citation from his comedy, the <foreign lang="greek">gerontomani/a</foreign>, has the rest of the verse supplied in Athen.

						<p>It seems as if in the following section Aristotle had, probably unconsciously misled by the ambiguous term, used <foreign lang="greek">a)kribh/s</foreign> and its <foreign lang="greek">ptw/-</foreign> <pb n="152"/> <foreign lang="greek">seis</foreign> in two distinct senses: exactness and high finish in <hi rend="italic">style</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reasoning.</hi> The general subject and connexion of the chapter will oblige us to refer the first clause, with its comparison of public speaking to a rough sketch in black and white, without details, and producing no effect on close inspection, to the <hi rend="italic">style</hi> of the speech&mdash;which indeed is the subject of the whole book as well as this chapter&mdash;though it may possibly include also minute details of reasoning. The same thing may be said of <foreign lang="greek">h( di/kh a)kribe/steron</foreign>: in this the style <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the argument may be minuter, exacter and more detailed in proportion to the diminished size of the audience, and the increased probability of their paying attention to such things (see note ad loc.). But when we come to the third degree, the single judge, it seems to be false and absurd to say that exactness and high finish of <hi rend="italic">style</hi> is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> suited to speeches addressed to him: no man would endeavour to attract or impose upon an <hi rend="italic">arbitrator</hi> by such artifices. The exactness in this case seems therefore to be confined to exactness of reasoning and minute detail, as of evidence and the like. A single judge&mdash;as in our own courts&mdash;would always be more patient, more inclined to listen to, and more influenced by, exact reasoning and circumstantial evidence than either of the two preceding: the mob of the assembly would not hear them, nor follow them, nor listen to them at all: the large body of dicasts would be more ready to do so: but most of all the single judge. The last clause of the section brings us back to the point from which it started, viz. differences of style, and <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> to apply this exclusively to what has been said of <foreign lang="greek">a)kri/beia</foreign> in forensic pleading. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now the style of public-speaking is exactly like scene-painting; for the greater the crowd, the more distant the point of view, and consequently&rsquo; (in these crowded assemblies; held too in the open air&mdash;which should be added in respect of the style required, though this does not <hi rend="italic">distinguish</hi> it from forensic rhetoric,) &lsquo;all exactness, minute and delicate touches, and high finish in general appear to be superfluous and for the worse (deviating from the true standard of <hi rend="italic">public</hi> speaking) in both&rsquo;. Compare with this Whately's remarks, partly borrowed from Ar., <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. IV (<hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> p. 299), on the &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">bolder</hi>, as well as less accurate, kind of language allowable and advisable in speaking to a considerable number&rdquo;: he quotes Ar.'s comparison of scene-painting, and then proceeds &ldquo;to account for these phenomena&rdquo;&mdash;which Ar. has omitted to do. His explanation is derived from the various sympathies which are especially awakened in a great crowd. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">skiagrafi/a</lemma> is a painting in outline and <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro</hi>, or light and shade, without colour, and intended to produce its effect only <hi rend="italic">at a distance</hi>&mdash;herein lies the analogy to public speaking&mdash;consequently rough and unfinished, because <hi rend="italic">from the distance</hi> all niceties and refinements in style and finish would be entirely thrown away (<foreign lang="greek">peri/erga</foreign>).

As the point of comparison here is solely the difference between the near and distant effects, I have translated it &lsquo;scene-painting&rsquo; (as also Whately) which represents this better to <hi rend="italic">us:</hi> the proper and literal meaning of the word is &ldquo;the outline of a shadow&rdquo;, the supposed origin of painting.

And this is why the <pb n="154"/> same orators don't succeed (become popular, distinguish themselves) in all these (at once): but where action or delivery is most required, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is least of exact finish to be found&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;For plainly the <hi rend="italic">sweetness</hi> will be produced by all that has been enumerated (purity, propriety, rhythm, vivacity, and the rest) if we have rightly defined what the excellence of the language consists in: for why (else, <hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">a)/llou</foreign>) must it be (as we have described it) clear, and not low (mean and common-place), but appropriate (ch. 2 &sect; 2, <foreign lang="greek">mh\ tapeinh\n a)lla\ kekosmhme/nhn, semnote/ran, &sect; 3 ce/nhn</foreign>)?

						<p>&lsquo;But (on the contrary) it is quite plain (of itself, and without rule or precept) that <hi rend="italic">the mean</hi> is the appropriate style&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;We have now finished our remarks upon style or language, of all (the three branches of Rhetoric) in common (cc. 2&mdash;11), and of each kind individually (c. 12): it now remains to speak of the order (division and arrangement) of the parts of the speech&rsquo;. <pb n="156"/> </p>

					<p>Of the two divisions of this third book, proposed at the conclusion of Bk. II, and the opening of Bk. III, <foreign lang="greek">peri\ le/cews kai\ ta/cews, pw=s xrh\ ta/cai ta\ me/rh tou= lo/gou</foreign>, the first having been dispatched in the preceding chapters 2&mdash;12, we now proceed to the second, on the arrangement of the parts of the speech: this will include a criticism of the anterior, and the current, divisions, with a new classification in c. 13: and an explanation and discussion of the proper contents of each. A full account of the various divisions which prevailed before and after Aristotle has been already given in the Introd. p. 331, 332, and the notes, and need not be here repeated. It will be sufficient to say that Aristotle in this chapter takes the fourfold division, adopted by Isocrates, and accepted by his followers, as the author of the Rhet. ad Alex., viz. <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion, dihgh/seis, pi/steis, e)pi/logos</foreign>, criticizes it, and reduces it to two, <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>, as the only two parts <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> to the speech; adding notices of some superfluous distinctions introduced by Theodorus (of Byzantium) and Licymnius. [See R&ouml;ssler's pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Rhetorum antiquorum de dispositione doctrina</hi>, pp. 30, Budissin, 1866; and Volkmann, <hi rend="italic">die Rhetorik der Griechen und R&ouml;mer</hi>, &sect; 38.] </p>
					<p>On the importance attached to the arrangement of the topics of these divisions, and especially to the order of the <hi rend="italic">proofs</hi>, Whately has some good remarks, <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> c. 1 (<hi rend="italic">Encycl. Metrop.</hi> p. 256). This is illustrated by the contest between Demosthenes and Aeschines. &ldquo;Aeschines strongly urged the judges (in the celebrated contest for the Crown) to confine his adversary to the same order in his reply to the charges brought which he himself had observed in bringing them forward. Demosthenes however was far too skilful to be thus entrapped; and so much importance does he attach to the point, that he opens his speech with a most solemn appeal to the judges for an impartial hearing; which implies, he says, not only a rejection of prejudice, but no less also a permission for each speaker to adopt whatever <hi rend="italic">arrangement</hi> he should think fit. And accordingly he proceeds to adopt one very different from that which his antagonist had laid down; for he was no less sensible than his rival that the same arrangement which is the most favourable to one side, is likely to be least favourable to the other.&rdquo; </p>
					<div3 id="b3c13s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>&lsquo;Of the speech there are (only) two parts: for it is only necessary first to state the subject, and then to prove (your side of) it. It follows from this necessary relation between them (<foreign lang="greek">dio/</foreign>), that it is impossible (if the speech is to be complete) either to state your case without going on to prove it, or to prove it without having first stated it&rsquo;, (the <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi> lies in the absurdity of the supposition: it is a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> <pb n="157"/> impossibility): &lsquo;for proving implies <hi rend="italic">something</hi> to prove, and a preliminary statement is made in order to be proved&rsquo;. All this implies that the speaker has some object in view, some case to make out. It would not apply to all declamations; though it is true that, as a general rule, even they try to prove <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, however absurd it may be. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The present&rsquo; (current, Isocrates') &lsquo;division is absurd; for surely <hi rend="italic">narrative</hi> (<foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> <hi rend="italic">narratio</hi>, the detailed description of the circumstances of the case) belongs only to the forensic speech, but in a demonstrative or public speech how can there be a <hi rend="italic">narrative</hi> such as they describe, or a <hi rend="italic">reply to the opponent;</hi> or an epilogue (peroration) in argumentative or demonstrative speeches?&rsquo; On this Quint. says, III 9. 5, <hi rend="italic">Tamen nec iis assentior qui detrahunt</hi> refutationem (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ta\ pros to\n a)nti/dikon</foreign>) <hi rend="italic">tanquam probationi subiectam, ut Aristoteles; haec enim est quae constituat, illa quae destruat.

(This is one of Quintilian's ordinary misrepresentations of writers whom he quotes. Ar. says nothing here of the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, theoretically disallowing it: though in compliance with the received custom he afterwards gives an account of it and its contents). <hi rend="italic">Verum id facit quia</hi> propositio <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>, narratio <hi rend="italic">species videtur: et hac non semper, illa semper et ubique credit opus esse.</hi> The last clause very well explains Ar.'s substitution of <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign> for (<foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> <hi rend="italic">and</hi>) <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In Introd. p. 333, I have given at length from Cic. de Inv. I 19. 27, the distinction of <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> in its ordinary sense and <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign>. It is here said that the <hi rend="italic">narrative</hi> or statement of the case, strictly speaking, belongs (he means <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> belongs) only to the forensic branch of Rhetoric: <hi rend="italic">there</hi> there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> always a case to state: in the declamatory, panegyrical branch, not a <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> systematic narrative or detailed statement as of a case; in this the <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> is dispersed over the whole speech, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> 16. 1: and, in <foreign lang="greek">dhmhgori/a</foreign> equally, there is not universally or necessarily, as in the law-speech, a <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>, because <pb n="158"/> its <hi rend="italic">time</hi> is the future, and a narrative of things future is impossible: when it is used, it is to recall the memory of <hi rend="italic">past facts</hi> for the purpose of comparison&mdash;which is a very different thing from the forensic <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>. Comp. c. 16. 11. The author of the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 30 (31) includes <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> in the deliberative branch, <foreign lang="greek">dhmhgoriko\n ge/nos</foreign>; no doubt following Isocrates. On <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> see Dionysius Hal., Ars Rhet. c. x &sect; 14. </p>
						<p>The same argument applies to the <hi rend="italic">refutatio</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ pro\s to\n a)nti/dikon</foreign>, and with more force than to the preceding, for in the epideictic branch there is no adversary, and therefore can be no refutation of his arguments, at least such as those who lay down this division intend: though it is true that a panegyrist <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have to meet adverse statements or imputations on the object of his panegyric, real or supposed. In fact, it is only in the forensic branch that there is <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> an opponent. On this division, see III 17. 14, 15. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)\ e)pi/logon tw=n a)podeiktikw=n</lemma>] This is understood by Victorius, Majoragius, and Schrader of the <hi rend="italic">demonstrativum genus</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">a)pod</foreign>. being supposed to be put here for <foreign lang="greek">e)pideiktikw=n</foreign>. This <hi rend="italic">in Aristotle</hi> I hold to be impossible. Nor have I found any example of it elsewhere, though Victorius says that Isocrates uses <foreign lang="greek">a)podeiknu/nai</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e)pideiknu/nai</foreign> more than once in the Panath. speech. I have supposed (in note on p. 335 Introd.) that his text of Isocrates <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have exhibited this interchange from the uncorrected carelessness of transcribers. What is true is, that Isocrates, twice in the Paneg. &sect;&sect; 18 and 65, does use <foreign lang="greek">e)pideiknu/nai</foreign> in a sense nearly approaching, if not absolutely identical with, that of <foreign lang="greek">a)podeiknu/nai</foreign>. The words can only mean, as I have translated them, that there may be some speeches which consist entirely of proof or arguments, and that a summary of these would not correspond to the <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/logos</foreign> in its ordinary sense&mdash;described c. 19. 1&mdash;of which only a small part is a recapitulation. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> (preface, opening or introduction), and comparison (setting over against one another side by side) of opposing (views, statements, arguments), and review, are found in public speeches <hi rend="italic">then</hi> only when there is a dispute (between <hi rend="italic">two opponents</hi>)&rsquo;: as in Demosthenes' Speech for the Crown, of which the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> has been before referred to. <foreign lang="greek">e)pa/nodos</foreign>, &lsquo;a going over again&rsquo;=<foreign lang="greek">a)nakefalai/wsis</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">summary</hi> recapitulation of the foregoing topics of the speech, appears also in Plato Phaedr. 267 D, <foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ dh\ te/los tw=n lo/gwn koinh=| pa=sin e)/oike sundedogme/non ei)=nai, w(=| tine\s me\n e)pa/nodon, a)/lloi de\ a)/llo ti/qentai o)/noma</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">a)/llo o)/noma</foreign> may be <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/logos</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)nakefalai/wsis</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">palillogi/a</foreign> (Rhet. ad Alex. c. 20 (21). 1). It is properly a subdivision of the <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/logos</foreign>, and as such is here condemned as superfluous. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/tan a)ntilogi/a h)=|</lemma>] &ldquo;The object of the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> is to conciliate the audience, and invite their attention, and briefly intimate the subject of the ensuing speech. In recommending this or that measure to the assembly, unless there is an adversary who has poisoned the hearers' <pb n="159"/> minds against it and its author, or some other special reason, there is no occasion for this: and also, the audience is usually well acquainted with the subject. See further on this, c. 14. 11. Comparison of argument, and review, can only be required when there is an opposition.&rdquo; Introd. pp. 335, 6. The Rhet. ad Alex. expressly tells us, c. 28 (29) ult., that the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> is &ldquo;common to all the seven species, and will be appropriate to every kind of (rhetorical) business.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>The following argument <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ga\r&mdash;polla/kis</foreign> is a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> of the preceding. You say that <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion, a)ntiparabolh/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)pa/nodos</foreign> are essential parts of the public speech&mdash;&lsquo;Why at that rate (is the reply) so are accusation and defence, for they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> frequently there&rsquo;&mdash;this involves the absurdity of introducing the <hi rend="italic">whole contents</hi> of the forensic genus into the <foreign lang="greek">dhmhgoriko\n ge/nos</foreign> as a mere <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the latter&mdash;&lsquo;but not <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> deliberation&rsquo;: not in the sense or character of deliberation, which is <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> to the deliberative branch, but as mere accidents. </p>
						<p>There can be no question that we should read <foreign lang="greek">h(=|</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">h( sumboulh/</foreign>. So Victorius, Schrader, Buhle, Spengel. Bekker alone retains <foreign lang="greek">h(</foreign>. The following clause requires an alteration of punctuation to make it intelligible; suggested long ago by Victorius, Majoragius, Vater, and adopted by Spengel; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so by Bekker. Spengel also rejects <foreign lang="greek">e)/ti</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">delendum aut in</hi> <foreign lang="greek">e)sti\n</foreign> <hi rend="italic">mutandum</hi>]. With the altered reading, <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  o( e)pi/logos e)/ti ou)de\ dikanikou= k.t.l.</foreign> it is certainly out of place. I am by no means persuaded of the certainty of this alteration&mdash;perhaps Bekker had the same reason for withholding his consent to the two alterations&mdash;I think it quite as likely that a word or two has dropt out after <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/logos</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;But further&rsquo; (if <foreign lang="greek">e)/ti</foreign> be <hi rend="italic">retained</hi>) &lsquo;neither does the peroration belong to every forensic speech; as for instance if it be short, or the matter of it easy to recollect; for what happens (in an ordinary epilogue) is a subtraction from the length&rsquo;&mdash;not the brevity, of a speech: i.e. an epilogue is appropriate to a long speech, not a short one. This is Victorius' explanation, and no doubt right (that which I gave in the Introd. is wrong, and also <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Victorius', as stated in the note). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Consequently the (only) necessary parts are the statement of the case, and the proof&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c13s4" type="section" n="4">
						<p>&lsquo;Now these two are peculiar to, and characteristic of, speeches in general&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>It is possible that <foreign lang="greek">i)/dion</foreign> here may be the <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi> of logic, one of the predicables: that which characterizes a thing, without being absolutely <pb n="160"/> <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> to it, as the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">differentia</hi> are. The <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> accident or property, though it is not of the essence itself: &ldquo;but flowing from, or a consequence of, the essence, is inseparably attached to the species&rdquo; (J. S. Mill, <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>, I p. 148). All this would apply very well to these two <hi rend="italic">parts.</hi> They are not of the essence of the speech, and do not enter into the definition: the speech could exist without them. At the same time they are immediate consequences of that essence, and inseparably attached to all species of speeches, according to the view put forward here. </p>
						<p>We might therefore be satisfied with these. &lsquo;If we add more&rsquo; (following the authorities on the subject), &lsquo;they must be at the most, preface, statement of case, confirmatory arguments, conclusion: for the refutation of the adversary belongs to the proofs&rsquo; (Quint. u.s. III 9. 5, <hi rend="italic">Tamen nec iis assentior qui detrahunt</hi> refutationem, <hi rend="italic">tanquam probationi subiectam, ut Aristoteles; haec enim est quae constituat, illa quae destruat</hi>), &lsquo;and counter-comparison, (a comparative statement of your own views and arguments placed in juxtaposition with them to bring them into contrast,) which, being as it is a magnifying (making the most) of one's own case, must be a part of the confirmatory arguments, or general proof: for one who does this proves something: but not so the prologue; nor the epilogue, which merely recalls to mind&rsquo;. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c13s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;Such divisions, if any one choose to make them, will be pretty much the same as the inventions of Theodorus and his school, that is, to distinguish narration from after-narration and fore-narration, and refutation and per-re-refutation&rsquo;. In this compound word <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/</foreign> &lsquo;in addition&rsquo; is represented by <hi rend="italic">re</hi>, and <foreign lang="greek">e)c</foreign>, &lsquo;out and out&rsquo;, &lsquo;outright&rsquo;, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">thoroughly</hi>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">completely</hi>&rsquo; by <hi rend="italic">per.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">dia/</foreign> and <hi rend="italic">per</hi> in composition are the more usual and direct exponents of &lsquo;thoroughness&rsquo; or &lsquo;complete carrying through&rsquo;, of a thing. On <foreign lang="greek">e)pidih/ghsis</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">repetita narratio</hi>, see Quint. IV 2. 128, <hi rend="italic">res declamatoria magis quam forensis.</hi> He accepts it as a division, but thinks it should be rarely used. Plato, Phaedr. 266 D seq., in speaking of these same superfluous divisions of Theodorus, leaves out <foreign lang="greek">e)pi-</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pro-dih/ghsis</foreign>, and introduces <foreign lang="greek">pi/stwsin kai\ e)pipi/stwsin</foreign> in their place. These plainly correspond to the other pair <foreign lang="greek">e)/legxos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)pece/legxos</foreign>, the one being confirmatory, the other refutatory arguments. See <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX. Vol. III p. 285, and Thompson's notes on the Phaedrus. </p>
						<p>The general drift of the last clause is this; if you introduce such divisions at all, you may go on dividing and subdividing for ever, as Theodorus does in his <foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign>. This is followed by the statement of the true <pb n="161"/> principle of division: the foundation of <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> twofold division, hints Ar. &lsquo;But a name (like one of these, the class-name, or, as here, the name of a division) should be given to mark a kind and a specific difference&rsquo;. It is the genus <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the specific (<foreign lang="greek">ei)dopoio/s</foreign>, species-making) difference that constitutes the distinct species or <hi rend="italic">kind.</hi> Now these <hi rend="italic">names</hi>, though supposed to mark distinct kinds, <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no specific differences which thus distinguish them.

						<p>&lsquo;Otherwise they become empty and frivolous, such as Licymnius' inventions in his art, the names which he coins, <foreign lang="greek">e)pou/rwsis, a)popla/nhsis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o)/zoi</foreign>&rsquo;. On Licymnius and his productions, see Heindorf ad Phaedr. u. s. p. 242, and <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl.and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. IX. Vol. III pp. 255&mdash;7; where an attempt is made to explain these three obscure names. Licymnius was a dithyrambic poet, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi> III 12. 2, as well as a rhetorician, and his prose style seems to have participated in the dithyrambic character. <foreign lang="greek">e)pou/rwsis</foreign> I take to be a word coined by Licymnius for his own purposes: it is a <foreign lang="greek">a(/pac lego/menon</foreign>. It seems to be formed from <foreign lang="greek">e)pourou=n</foreign>, a synonym of <foreign lang="greek">e)pouri/zein</foreign>, &lsquo;to speed onward by a fair gale&rsquo;, also <foreign lang="greek">sunepouri/zein</foreign>, Hist. Anim. VIII 13. 9, de Caelo, III 2. 17: Polybius has <foreign lang="greek">e)pourou=n</foreign> II 10. 6, and <foreign lang="greek">katourou=n</foreign>, I 44. 3, 61. 7, both as neut. The Schol. quoted by Spengel, <hi rend="italic">Artium Scriptores</hi> p. 89, defines <foreign lang="greek">e)po/rousis</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">e)pou/rwsis</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ta\ suneupori/zonta kai\ bohqou=nta toi=s e)nqumh/masi, kai\ a(plw=s o(/sa le/gontai bohqou=nta th=| a)podei/cei</foreign>. All which seems to favour the notion that the figurative rhetorician represented &lsquo;subsidiary&rsquo; or &lsquo;confirmatory arguments&rsquo;, Theodorus' <foreign lang="greek">pi/stwsis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)pipi/stwsis</foreign>, under the image of &lsquo;a fair wind astern&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">a)popla/nhsis</foreign> is no doubt, as in Plato Polit. 263 C, &lsquo;a digression&rsquo;, <hi rend="italic">wandering off</hi> from the main subject, Schol. <foreign lang="greek">ta\ e)/cw tou= pra/gmatos</foreign>; and <foreign lang="greek">o)/zoi</foreign>, &lsquo;branches&rsquo;, most likely means places in which the discourse &lsquo;branches off&rsquo; in different directions, &lsquo;ramifications&rsquo;: unless the same Scholiast's explanation be preferred, <foreign lang="greek">ta\ a)/kra, h)/toi ta\ prooi/mia kai\ tou\s e)pilo/gous</foreign>. This would mean the &lsquo;branches&rsquo; opposed to the stock or trunk, as something extraneous, or at all events non-essential. (I think this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> preferable.) </p>

					<p>Having considered the divisions of the speech in general we now come to the details, to the enumeration and examination of the ordinary contents of each of the four. These in each case are discussed under the heads of the three branches of Rhetoric. The treatment of the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> occupies the 14th chapter, to which is appended a second, c. xv, which analyses the topics of <foreign lang="greek">diabolh/</foreign>, the art of &lsquo;setting a man against his neighbour&rsquo;, infusing suspicion and hostile feeling against him in the minds of others, raising a prejudice against him&mdash;especially of course in the minds of judges against your opponent.

These rules seem to be chiefly derived from the actual practice of the Orators. Some of the arts to which public speakers had recourse in the topics of their <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> are mentioned by Isocrates, Paneg. &sect; 13. Compare Cic. de Orat. II 19. 80; de Invent. I 15. 20; where it is defined: it has two parts, <hi rend="italic">principium</hi> (the object of this is to make the hearer <hi rend="italic">benevolum aut docilem aut attentum</hi>,) and <hi rend="italic">insinuatio, oratio quadam dissimulatione et circuitione obscura subiens auditoris animum.</hi> Quint.

						<p>&lsquo;Now the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> is the beginning of a speech and stands in the place of the prologue in poetry (i. e. tragedy, and specially of Euripides' tragedy), and of the prelude in flute music&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">proau/lion</lemma>] an introduction, ornamental, and preparatory to, not an essential part of, the theme or subject of the composition; for all these are <hi rend="italic">beginnings</hi>, and as it were a paving of the way (preparation, pioneering of the road) for what follows (<foreign lang="greek">o(dopoi/hsis</foreign>, note on I 1. 2). </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Now the flute-prelude is like the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> of the epideictic branch: that is to say, as the flute-players first open their performance with whatever they can play best (in order to gain attention and favour of the audience) which they then join on to the <foreign lang="greek">e)ndo/simon</foreign> (the actual opening, preliminary notes, of the subject which gives the tone, or cue, to the rest), so in the epideictic speeches the writing (of the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>) ought to be of this kind: for (in these the speaker) may say first (<foreign lang="greek">ei)po/nta</foreign>) anything he pleases, and then should at once sound the note of preparation, and join on (the rest)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>This represents the epideictic <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, like the flute-prelude, as hardly at all connected with what follows; it is a preliminary flourish, anything that he knows to be likely to be most successful, as already observed, to conciliate the audience and put them in good humour. &ldquo;For here, as there is no real interest at stake, the author is allowed a much greater liberty in his choice of topics for amusing (and gaining <pb n="163"/> over) an audience; a license which would be intolerable in a case of life and death, or in the suggestion of a course of action which may involve the safety or ruin of the state. Here the audience are too eager to come to the point to admit of any trifling with their anxiety.&rdquo; Introd. pp. 337, 8. Cic. de Or.

It thus has the effect of the &lsquo;key-note&rsquo;, and takes the secondary sense of a &lsquo;guide&rsquo;, &lsquo;preparation for&rsquo;, &lsquo;introduction to&rsquo;, anything. So Plut. de disc. adul. ab amico, c. 55, 73 B, <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper e)ndo/simon e(/cei pro\s ta\ mei/zona tw=n a(marthma/twn</foreign>, ubi Wyttenbach, <hi rend="italic">occasio, incitamentum;</hi> similarly Ib. c. 30, 70 B, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ yo/gos...h)\ e)/painos w(/sper e)ndo/simon ei)s par)r(hsi/an e)stin</foreign>, &lsquo;gives the tone, the cue, i.e. the occasion or incitement, to freedom (taking liberties).&rsquo; See other passages from Plutarch and others in Wyttenbach's note on 73 B.

						<p>&lsquo;And this is done by all. An example is the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi> of Isocrates' Helen: for there is nothing in common between the disputatious dia<pb n="164"/> lecticians, and Helen&rsquo;. The <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, which occupies the first thirteen sections of the speech, includes many other subjects besides the <foreign lang="greek">e)ristikoi/</foreign>, and is certainly an excellent illustration of the want of connexion between proem and the rest in an epideictic speech. Quint. III 8. 8, <hi rend="italic">In demonstrativis vero prooemia esse maxime libera existimat</hi> (Ar.). <hi rend="italic">Nam et longe a materia duci hoc, ut in Helenae laude Isocrates fecerit; et ex aliqua rei vicinia, ut idem in Panegyrico, cum queritur plus honoris corporum quam animorum virtutibus dari.</hi> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And at the same time also (it has this further recommendation) that if (the speaker thus) migrate into a foreign region, there is this propriety in it, that the entire speech is not of the same kind&rsquo; (it removes the wearisome monotony which is characteristic of this branch of Rhetoric). </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ktopi/zein</lemma> is to &lsquo;change one's residence&rsquo;, and applied especially to migratory birds and animals. It is always neuter in Aristotle.

					<div3 id="b3c14s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;The introductions in the epideictic branch are derived from praise and blame (naturally: see 1 3 &sect;&sect; 3, 4); as, for instance, Gorgias' opening of his Olympic oration (a <foreign lang="greek">panhguriko\s lo/gos</foreign>, delivered at the Olympic games), &ldquo;By many&rsquo; (or <foreign lang="greek">u(pe/r</foreign>, &lsquo;for many things&rsquo;; which seems more in accordance with what followed) &lsquo;are ye worthy to be admired, O men of Hellas&rdquo;: that is to say (<foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> <hi rend="italic">videlicet</hi>) he praises those who first brought together the general assemblies&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;But Isocrates blames them for that bodily excellences they rewarded with gifts, whilst to intellectual excellence they awarded no prize&rsquo;.

Mr Sandys, in his note <hi rend="italic">ad locum</hi>, gives a summary of the whole exordium &sect;&sect; 1&mdash;14.

[Compare Virgil's <hi rend="italic">omnia iam vulgata</hi> in the Exordium of the third Georgic.] </p>
						<p>Of the four Choeriluses distinguished by N&auml;ke, this is the Epic poet of Samos, born, according to N&auml;ke, in B.C. 470. His principal work, from which this fragment is taken, was a poetical narrative of the Persian wars with Greece under Darius and Xerxes&mdash;&ldquo;all that was left him&rdquo; by his predecessors&mdash;very much applauded, as Suidas tell us, and &ldquo;decreed to be read with Homer.&rdquo; Aristotle (Top. <foreign lang="greek">*q</foreign> I, ult. <foreign lang="greek">paradei/gmata...oi(=a *(/omhros, mh\ oi(=a *xoi/rilos</foreign>) thinks less favourably of it; and it was afterwards excluded from the Alexandrian Canon in favour of the poem of Antimachus. An earlier Choerilus was the Athenian tragic poet, contemporary with Phrynichus, Pratinas, and Aeschylus in early life; the third a slave of the Comic poet Ecphantides, whom he is said to have assisted in the composition of his plays; and the fourth, Horace's Choerilus, Ep. II 1. 232, Ars Poet. 357, a later and contemptible epic poet who attended Alexander on his expedition, and according to Horace, <hi rend="italic">incultis qui versibus et male natis rettulit acceptos, regale nomisma, Philippos.</hi> Suidas tells this story of the Samian Choerilus, an evident mistake. The fragments of the Choerilus of our text are all collected and commented on by N&auml;ke in his volume on Choerilus. This fragm. is given on p. 104. See also D&uuml;ntzer <hi rend="italic">Epic. Gr. Fragm.</hi> p. 96 seq. where five lines of the poem, from which our extract is made are given: and the four articles in <hi rend="italic">Biogr.

VIII.</note>, p. 160: printed also in N&auml;ke and D&uuml;ntzer&mdash;and runs thus: <emph><foreign lang="greek">a)= ma/kar, o(/stis e)/hn kei=non xro/non i)/dris a)oidh=s, *mousa/wn qera/pwn o(/t'  a)kh/ratos h)=n e)/ti leimw/n: nu=n d) o(/te pa/nta de/dastai, e)/xousi de\ pei/rata te/xnai, u(/statoi w(/ste dro/mou kataleipo/meq), ou)de/ ph| e)sti\ pa/nth paptai/nonta neozuge\s a(/rma pela/ssai. kai\ ta\ e(ch=s</foreign></emph><note anchored="yes" n="2">N&auml;ke, <hi rend="italic">Choerilus</hi> p. 105, thinks that this, and not the second fragm. in &sect; 6&mdash; as Buhle, Wolf, Vater, agree in supposing&mdash;was the opening of the poem. This is rendered probable by the <foreign lang="greek">lo/gon a)/ l l o n</foreign> in v. I, of the other.</note>. Which are certainly pretty lines enough: perhaps the rest was not equal to them. Compare with <foreign lang="greek">leimw\n *mousa/wn</foreign>, and the whole passage, Lucr. I 925 seq. <hi rend="italic">avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante trita solo</hi>, et seq., which might <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi> have been suggested by this of Choerilus. An apology of the same kind is introduced by Isocrates in the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> of his Panegyr. &sect; 74; and another in his <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/dosis</foreign>, &sect; 55. In the latter the word <foreign lang="greek">diateqrulhme/nous</foreign> occurs. <pb n="167"/> </p>
						<p>&lsquo;So the introductions of the epideictic speeches are derived from the following topics; from praise, blame, exhortation, dissuasion, appeals to the hearer: and these &ldquo;introductions&rdquo;&rsquo; (see the note on &sect; I: <foreign lang="greek">e)ndo/sima</foreign> is used here for <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mia</foreign> in general, instead of the more limited sense of the preceding passage) &lsquo;must be either foreign or closely connected with the speeches (to which they are prefixed)&rsquo;. </p>
						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ce/nos</lemma>, a stranger or foreigner, is properly opposed to <foreign lang="greek">oi)kei=os</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">domesticus</hi>, one of one's own household. This last clause, <foreign lang="greek">dei= de/ k.t.l.</foreign> is, as Vater remarks, introduced as a transition to the next topic, the forensic <hi rend="italic">prooemia.</hi> </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c14s5" type="section" n="5">
						<p>&lsquo;The introduction of the forensic speech must be understood as having the same force (or value, or signification) as the prologue of a drama (<foreign lang="greek">tou=</foreign>, the drama to which it belongs), or the introduction to an epic poem: for to the epideictic <hi rend="italic">exordia</hi> the preludes (introductions, <foreign lang="greek">a)nabolai/</foreign>) of the dithyrambs bear resemblance, &ldquo;for thee and thy gifts, or spoils&rdquo;&rsquo;. On the <foreign lang="greek">a)nabolai/</foreign>, the openings or introductions of dithyrambs, and their loose, incoherent, flighty character, see note on III 9. 1. Introd. p. 307, note 1. It is this which makes them comparable to the epideictic exordia, as above described. </p>
						<p>The dramatic, i. e. tragic, prologue, and the introduction of the epic, are compared to the exordium of the dicastic speech, in that all three contain &lsquo;statements of the case&rsquo;; the last, literally; the tragic and epic, virtually. The prologue of Euripides (who of the three extant tragedians can be the only one whose prologues are referred to) actually states all the preceding circumstances of the story of the drama, which it is necessary that the spectator should be acquainted with in order to enter into the plot. The introduction of the Epic poem is neither so long nor so regular. That of the Iliad occupies only seven lines, and states the subject very simply and in few words. That of the Odyssey is concluded in ten, and little or nothing of the story told. The Aeneid, and Pharsalia have seven apiece. </p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="b3c14s6" type="section" n="6">
						<p>Having hinted at the points of resemblance between the dithyrambic <foreign lang="greek">a)nabolai/</foreign> and the epideictic <hi rend="italic">prooemia</hi>, he now proceeds to explain further the resemblance of the dicastic proem to the prologue of tragedy and prelude of the Epic poem. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;In the prose speeches as well as the poetry&rsquo; (Victorius understands <pb n="168"/> <foreign lang="greek">t. lo/gois</foreign><note anchored="yes">Spengel puts <foreign lang="greek">lo/gois kai\</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">h)=n</foreign> in brackets, as spurious or doubtful: Bekker retains <foreign lang="greek">h)=n</foreign>. MS A^{c} has <foreign lang="greek">h)i=</foreign>. By rejecting the words Spengel seems to shew that he thinks that <foreign lang="greek">lo/goi</foreign> alone cannot mean &lsquo;stories&rsquo; in the sense of <hi rend="italic">dramas.</hi> I think it is doubtful. Otherwise, this interpretation is certainly more suitable to the general connexion and what follows. On the other hand, our author here seems to be rather digressive, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to observe any very regular order of succession in his remarks. So that perhaps upon the whole, we may let the other consideration have its due weight in deciding the point.</note>, <hi rend="italic">fabulae poetarum</hi>, meaning the <hi rend="italic">dramas</hi> as contrasted with the Epics: the other contrast of <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> and <hi rend="italic">verse</hi> is more natural as well as more suitable here) &lsquo;these <hi rend="italic">prooemia</hi> are (present, offer) a specimen or sample of the subject (of the speech or poem) in order that they may have some previous acquaintance with the intention of it&rsquo; (if <foreign lang="greek">h)=n</foreign>, &lsquo;about what it was to be&rsquo;, as in <foreign lang="greek">to\ ti/ h)=n ei)=nai</foreign>; the object, purpose, or design), &lsquo;and the mind not be kept in suspense; for all that is vague and indefinite keeps the mind wandering (in doubt and uncertainty): accordingly, (the speaker or writer) that puts the beginning into his hand supplies him with a clue, as it were, by which he may hold, so as to enable him to follow the story (or argument). This is why (Homer in the Iliad and Odyssey, <hi rend="italic">began</hi> the two poems with the lines quoted; and Choerilus&mdash;if N&auml;ke u. s. is right about the order of the two fragments in our text&mdash;did not <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> his poem with <foreign lang="greek">h(/geo/ moi k.t.l.</foreign>, but introduced it in his <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi>)&rsquo;&mdash;here the quotations from the three poems are introduced, and the sentence remains unfinished. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Similarly the tragic poets explain the subject of their play, if not immediately at the opening, as Euripides, at any rate somewhere or other the poet explains it in his prologue or introduction), as <hi rend="italic">even</hi> Sophocles (who does not <hi rend="italic">usually</hi> employ it; in the Oedip. Tyr. 774 seq.) &ldquo;Polybus of Corinth was my father, &amp;c.&rdquo;, and the following.&rsquo; </p>
						<p>&ldquo;The Commentators object to <foreign lang="greek">prolo/gw|</foreign> here because the passage that it indicates occurs not at the beginning, but in the middle of the play. But, it seems that Aristotle has here used <foreign lang="greek">pro/logos</foreign> in a more compre<pb n="169"/> hensive sense than that which it usually bears, for an &lsquo;explanatory introduction&rsquo; in general, wherever it may occur: and that it has much the same relation here to its <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> signification, as <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign> has to <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> in c. 13. Also the analogous <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> is applied twice in &sect; 10 <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> to introductory speeches <hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi> in a play.&rdquo; Introd. p. 339 note. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And comedy in like manner&rsquo;: that is, wherever an introductory explanation is required, there it is introduced. Victorius notes that this appears in Terence, the Latin representative of the New Comedy, and Plautus. Simo in the <hi rend="italic">Andria</hi>, Menedemus in the <hi rend="italic">Heautontimorumenos</hi>, Micio in the <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi>, perform this office. And similarly, Strepsiades in Aristoph. Nubes, Demosthenes in the Equites 40 seq., Dionysius in the Ranae&mdash;Victorius says &ldquo;tum maxime cum <hi rend="italic">Servo</hi> narrat, &amp;c.,&rdquo; but the conversation referred to is with Hercules, not Xanthias, lines 64 seq. There is another explanatory introduction, preparatory to the dramatic contest between Aeacus and Xanthias, 759 seq. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;So then (to resume) the most necessary function of the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> peculiar to it, is to make it clear what is the end and object of the speech or story&rsquo; (the former is the <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign> in <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, the latter in the Epic and the drama). Compare Rhet. ad Alex. 29 (30).

Quintilian, IV 1. 6, seems to charge Aristotle&mdash; if he includes him in the <hi rend="italic">plerique</hi> who have been guilty of the omission&mdash; with having neglected to include the &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">auctor causae</hi>&rsquo; amongst the sources of topics for <hi rend="italic">prooemia.</hi> Victorius defends him against this, by pointing out, as Cicero, that <foreign lang="greek">o( le/gwn</foreign> includes <hi rend="italic">both parties</hi> in a suit or prosecution, <hi rend="italic">actor</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">reus</hi> (in its ordinary sense).

						<p>&lsquo;The topics derivable from the speaker himself and the opponent, are all such as relate to allaying (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> &lsquo;refuting&rsquo;) and exciting prejudice and illfeeling (after <foreign lang="greek">poih=sai</foreign> understand <foreign lang="greek">au)th/n</foreign>): but with this difference: that in defending oneself all that relates to <foreign lang="greek">diabolh/</foreign> (i. e. the removal of prejudice and ill-will from ourselves, and exciting them against the opponent) must be put first (<hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">lekte/on</foreign>, viz. in the <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi>), but in the accusation of another reserved for the peroration. The reason of this is not difficult to see; that is, that the defendant, when he is about to introduce his own case, must necessarily begin by doing away with all hindrances (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi> to the establishment of it; all prepossessions against him on the part of the judge); and therefore must make the removal or refutation of all calumnies or prejudices against him his first point; whereas the accuser (the speaker whose office it is to &lsquo;set&rsquo; the defendant &lsquo;against&rsquo; the judges, conciliate their ill-will to him) must reserve all that tends to prejudice his antagonist for the epilogue (peroration, conclusion), that they may better remember it&rsquo; (that his accusations may &lsquo;leave their sting behind them&rsquo; in the judges' minds). Both Spengel and Bekker write <foreign lang="greek">au(to/n</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">e|i)ka/zein</foreign> for the <hi rend="italic">vulgata lectio</hi> <foreign lang="greek">au)to/n</foreign>; which as far as appears to the contrary is the reading of all MSS.

That is, the judge's inattention often arises not from negligence, but from a mistaken supposition that the adversary is right and we are wrong: in order to set him right we must rouse his attention. The supposition implied here in explanation of <foreign lang="greek">ou)k a)ei\ sumf. k.t.l.</foreign>, which Quint. refers to and criticizes, is that inattention on the judge's part is sometimes expedient when our cause is bad. Quint.'s reply is, it is not his <hi rend="italic">inattention</hi> that would be of use to us in such a case, but his <hi rend="italic">attention</hi> to the arguments which we are about to use in order to convince him to the contrary. Another disadvantage that may arise from over-attention on the judge's part, occurs when we want to slur over an unfavourable point in our case. In illustration of the following <foreign lang="greek">dio\ polloi\ k.t.l.</foreign> Gaisford very appositely quotes Arist.

						<p>The Scholiast on this place (see in Spengel's Ed. p. 158), tells, <hi rend="italic">apropos</hi> of this, the story from Demosth. de Cor. &sect;&sect; 51, 52, with additions. The Scholiast, Ulpian on the passage of Dem., and a scholiast on Ar. Anal. Pr. 1 24 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 20 (in Brandis' collection, Arist. Op. Bekker's 4to. vol. IV. p. 147 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 43 of Bekker's quarto ed. of Aristotle), all agree that Demosthenes' <hi rend="italic">joke</hi> consisted in an intentional mispronunciation of the word <foreign lang="greek">misqwto/s</foreign>, which he applied to Aeschines, pronouncing it <foreign lang="greek">mi/sqwtos</foreign>, in order to divert the attention of the audience: he appealed to them to say whether the word was not well applied: they burst into a roar of laughter, accepted the application, and shouted <foreign lang="greek">*ai)sxi/nhs misqwto/s, *ai)sxi/nhs misqwto/s</foreign>, with the pronunciation corrected. I entirely agree with Dissen that this is a foolish and improbable story, absurd in itself, and receiving no countenance from the <hi rend="italic">text of Demosthenes.</hi> All that he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> say is found in the existing text, viz. that he interpreted Aeschines' <foreign lang="greek">ceni/an *)aleca/ndrou</foreign>&mdash;which Aesch. claimed&mdash;as meaning that he was not a <foreign lang="greek">ce/nos</foreign>, a guest and friend, but a <foreign lang="greek">misqwto\s</foreign> (a hireling) <foreign lang="greek">*)aleca/ndron</foreign> and nothing more, and that the people accepted this version.

						<p>(<foreign lang="greek">eu)ma/qeia</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">docilitas</hi>, need not be made a <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> topic, because) &lsquo;any speaker may refer to this (carry back, i. e. apply) any thing he pleases (any of the topics of the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>), even the appearance of worth and respectability; for to these (<foreign lang="greek">toi=s e)pieike/si</foreign>) the audience is always more inclined to attend&rsquo;. (This is in fact the <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign> which the speaker must always assume <hi rend="italic">by his speech</hi>, in order that his hearers may have confidence in him, that he may have weight and <hi rend="italic">authority</hi> with them; one of the three ingredients in the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=| le/gonti</foreign>, II 1. 5. Introd. on <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, p. 108 seq.) In short, <foreign lang="greek">eu)ma/qeia</foreign> need not be made a <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> topic, provided only the speaker treats the other topics of the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> with the view of making the audience <hi rend="italic">docilcs</hi>, that is, ready to receive the information which he is prepared to communicate to them. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;The things to which the audience is most <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi> to listen are things great (momentous, important), things of special interest (to the hearers themselves), things wonderful (surprising), and things pleasant (to hear; either in themselves, or in their associations); and therefore the speaker should always try to produce the impression (<foreign lang="greek">e)n</foreign> in his hearers' minds) that things of such kinds are his subject. If he wish to make them inattentive (he must try to convey the impression, <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n mh/</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">subaudi</hi> <foreign lang="greek">poiei=n e)qe/lh| tis&mdash;prosektikou/s</foreign>) that his subject is trifling, has no reference to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> and their interests (that is, is unimportant in general, or to them in particular: the opposite of the <foreign lang="greek">ta\ i)/dia</foreign> in this preceding topic) or that it is unpleasant&rsquo;. <pb n="173"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Besides, this making the hearers disposed to listen (keep up <pb n="174"/> their attention), is common to all the parts of the speech alike, wherever it is required: for they are more inclined to relax it anywhere rather than at the opening.

						<p>&lsquo;The <hi rend="italic">exordia</hi> of the public oration are borrowed from those of the forensic speech, but are naturally very rare in it: for in fact the subject of it is one with which they are already well acquainted, and therefore the facts of the case require no preface (no preparatory explanation) except&mdash;if at all&mdash;on his own account or that of the adversary (<foreign lang="greek">di) au)to/n</foreign> to put himself right with the audience, the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=| le/gonti; h)\ tou\s a)ntile/gontas</foreign> to meet the adversary's charges, combat the prejudices the other has raised against him: both of these therefore are <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>), or in case the subject (this is <hi rend="italic">essential</hi>) is not considered by them of the precise degree of importance which you wish, but rated either too high or too low.&rsquo; As to <foreign lang="greek">tou\s a)ntile/gontas</foreign>, we had been told before, c. 13. 3, <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion de\...e)n tai=s dhmhgori/ais to/te gi/netai o(/tan a)ntilogi/a h)=</foreign>: as in Demosth. de Corona, and de Falsa Legatione.

						<p>&lsquo;And hence the necessity of either raising or doing away with prejudice (<foreign lang="greek">dio/</foreign>, because when there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an adversary, as there always is in dicastic practice, the same treatment in deliberative speaking is <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> required) and (the topics) of amplification and diminution (to meet the other requirement, <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n mh\ h(liko\n bou/lei, u(poloipo/n, k.t.l.</foreign>)&rsquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;These are the circumstances in which a preface is required (<foreign lang="greek">dei=tai, o( lo/gos</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">o( le/gwn</foreign>); either these, or for mere ornament's sake, because, without it, the speech has an off-hand, slovenly (impromptu, extemporaneous) air (note on III 7. 1).

					<p>The following chapter is a continuation of the preceding on the ordinary contents of the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>, two of which, as we have seen c. 14 &sect; 12, are <foreign lang="greek">diaba/llein</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)polu/esqai</foreign>: and on these two the orator is supplied with topics. </p>
					<p>The same subject is treated in the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 29 (30), at even greater length than by Aristotle: and a summary of its contents, with some remarks on its moral character, and its connexion with Isocrates, may be found in Introd. pp. 441&mdash;443. A comparison of this with Aristotle's treatment of the subject is altogether in favour of the latter. He had already told us that he disapproves of the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>, as distinct from the <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign>, altogether: but he is obliged, by the practice of his predecessors, and the evident importance of the subject, which in spite of its unscientific character cannot be altogether passed over in a complete treatise on Rhetoric, to give it a place in his system; but it will be observed that in dealing with it he occupies at least threefourths of the chapter with the topics of the <hi rend="italic">defensive</hi> use of it, confining his observations on the aggressive side to two topics in a single section. See also especially &sect; 10, <foreign lang="greek">toiou=toi de\ oi( texnikw/tatoi k.t.l.</foreign> The reckless and unscrupulous precepts of the other treatise present <foreign lang="greek">diabolh/</foreign> in its very worst character: it is truly here the &lsquo;devil's art&rsquo;, <foreign lang="greek">h( tou= diabo/lou te/xnh</foreign>, the art of insinuating by whatever means prejudice and ill-will against your opponent&mdash;merely because he happens to be such, and for no other reason&mdash;and so <hi rend="italic">prejudicing his case.</hi> There is something further on this in c. 36 (37). 46, 47. There is an invective against <foreign lang="greek">diabolh/</foreign> in Isocr. <foreign lang="greek">a)nti/d</foreign>. &sect; 18. &ldquo;<foreign lang="greek">diaba/llein</foreign> is &lsquo;to set at variance&rsquo;, &lsquo;to make hostile&rsquo;; and so to inspire ill-will, insinuate suspicions, or prejudice a person against another. It applies as a technical term to all insinuations and accusations by which one of the parties in a case endeavours to raise a prejudice against the other, which are to be reflected upon, but do not directly help to prove, the main charge or point at issue; and are therefore <hi rend="italic">extra artem</hi>, <foreign lang="greek">e)/cw tou= pra/gmatos</foreign>. See III 15. 9; and comp. the example, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> &sect; 3. <foreign lang="greek">a)polu/esqai</foreign> is to clear oneself of such insinuated charges, to remove evil suspicions. Aristotle begins with this, because, as he told us before (c. 14. 7), it is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> appropriate to the exordium, as the opposite (in accusation) is to the peroration.&rdquo; Introd. p. 344. <pb n="179"/> </p>

						<p>&lsquo;With respect to <foreign lang="greek">diabolh/</foreign>, (intentional and malicious) calumny or (accidental, undesigned) prejudice, one (the first) topic is <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> from which arguments may be derived for removing offensive (unpleasant, injurious) <hi rend="italic">suspicion:</hi> for it makes no difference whether (the charge or insinuation) has been actually spoken (expressed, in the shape of a direct <hi rend="italic">personal calumny</hi>) or not&rsquo; (i.e. has merely been conceived, not openly stated; <foreign lang="greek">u(po/lhyis</foreign> as a mere conception or supposition&mdash;against us by inference, from our words, actions, or manners, or altogether accidentally, when people have a <hi rend="italic">bad opinion</hi> of us: in either case the prejudice requires to be removed); &lsquo;and therefore this is a general rule&rsquo;; includes everything, every kind of argument which tends to remove any bad opinion or prejudice which for whatever reason may be entertained against us: and this, whether the charge we have to meet be a direct statement, or merely an uncertified suspicion. This is illustrated by Rhet. ad Alex. 29 (30). 8, 9. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;Or (in justifying oneself), admitting a wrong done, to balance (or compensate) it (by something else which may be taken as a set-off, or drawback, in diminution of the wrong); for instance you say, what I did was injurious no doubt, but honourable; or painful, but serviceable; or anything else of the same sort&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Another method is (to extenuate the <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma</foreign> by the milder <pb n="181"/> terms), (to say) that it is a mistake, or an accident, or compulsory&rsquo;, done under compulsion: <foreign lang="greek">bi/a|</foreign>, see I 10. 14, and Appendix C to Bk.

Four <hi rend="italic">degrees of criminality</hi> are thus distinguished in Eth. Nic. V 10, 1135 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 11, (1) <foreign lang="greek">a)tu/xhma</foreign>, a mere accident, an injury done unintentionally without knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">special circumstances</hi> of the case: (2) <foreign lang="greek">a(ma/rthma</foreign>, an error or mistake, where the act is intentional but the injury unintentional (the case of killing a friend with a gun supposed not to be loaded); this does not include the case of moral ignorance, ignorance of right and wrong, for which a man <hi rend="italic">is</hi> responsible: (3) <foreign lang="greek">a)di/khma</foreign>, a wrong, intentional in a sense, but without <hi rend="italic">deliberation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">malice prepense</hi>, as a deadly blow dealt in a fit of passion, when the judgment is for the moment overpowered; (this is, I believe, the only place in which this degree is distinguished from the following: at all events the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> division is threefold.) All these are short of actual guilt or crime. The last stage, of actual crime, is (4) <foreign lang="greek">a)diki/a</foreign>, a wrong act committed with full knowledge of the circumstances, and deliberate purpose, <foreign lang="greek">o(/tan e)k proaire/sews a)/dikos kai\ moxqhro/s</foreign>.

						<p>&lsquo;As for instance Sophocles said that his trembling was not, as his accuser (or traducer) said, assumed to convey the appearance of old age, (and thereby obtain the sympathy and compassion of the judges) but compulsory (and therefore he was not responsible for it); for his eighty years were quite unintentional&rsquo;. On Sophocles&mdash;not the poet&mdash;see note on I 14. 3. The same Sophocles is mentioned again III 18. 6. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, by a balance (compensatory interchange or substitution) of motives; (for instance) that you had no intention of injuring him; what you really intended to do was so and so, and not that which was falsely laid to your charge; the <hi rend="italic">injury</hi> was an accident (not <hi rend="italic">of the essence</hi> of what you did: a mere <foreign lang="greek">sumbebhko/s</foreign>). &ldquo;I should deserve to be hated if that were my intention in doing it&rdquo;&rsquo;.

His reply was that the other had no right to bring cases (decisions) out of the Dionysiac contest into the courts of law: for he had already given an account (stood his trial) of them (his words, <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign>, included in the verse), or was prepared to do so, if the other chose to accuse him&rsquo;. This celebrated verse, Hippol. 608, probably owes a good deal of its notoriety to Aristophanes' parody of it near the end of the Frogs. Seldom has so &ldquo;much ado about nothing&rdquo; been made as about this unlucky line. The charge of recommending perjury is at any rate a gross exaggeration. Nor does it <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> imply even mental reservation. Cicero, de Off. III 29. 107 (quoted by Monk ad loc.), puts the case very clearly. <hi rend="italic">Quod ita iuratum est ut</hi> mens conciperet fieri oportere, <hi rend="italic">id servandum est: quod aliter, id si non feceris nullum est periurium. Non enim falsum iurare periurare est; sed quod ex animi tui sententia iuraris, sicut verbis concipitur more nostro, id non facere periurium est. Scite enim Euripides</hi>, Iuravi lingua, mentem iniuratam gero. See the whole of Monk's note. Paley in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> note follows Cicero. Of course the deceit, if there be any, lies in the intention and not in the word; and this is all that Hippolytus seems to say. He never intended that his oath should be kept in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sense: and his ignorance of the circumstances absolves him from the responsibility, or obligation of the oath. See above in note on &sect; 3<note anchored="yes">I find this note in one of my copies of the Hippolytus. &ldquo;I don't think the principle implied in this (the verse of Eurip.) can be defended. Hippolytus says that he swore to keep the secret in ignorance of the nature of it: now that he knows <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, he is freed from the obligation of keeping it. Has a man a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to lay himself under an obligation, of the nature of which he is ignorant?&rdquo; However the question still remains, if the oath <hi rend="italic">has been</hi> taken in ignorance, is he still bound to keep it? The last sentence was added when this Commentary was written.</note>. </p>

						<p>&lsquo;In defence&rsquo;&mdash;when you have to narrate circumstances in order to correct an opponent's statement of the facts&mdash;&lsquo;the recital may be shorter (because most of the story has been already told by the other), and as the issues (<foreign lang="greek">a)mfisbhth/seis</foreign> is Arist.'s term for what were afterwards called <foreign lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">status</hi>) are (on the defensive side) the denial either of the fact, or the injury, or the wrong, or the degree (the estimated <hi rend="italic">amount</hi> of the crime and penalty), we must therefore waste no time upon proving what is already admitted, unless it (the proofs of any of the facts) chance <pb n="191"/> to contribute to the establishment of the issue (on which we <hi rend="italic">do</hi> rest our case); for instance, when we admit the fact, but deny the wrong&rsquo;.

						<p>&lsquo;Events should generally be recited as past and gone&mdash;except those which by being acted&rsquo; (represented as actually done, passing before the eyes, <foreign lang="greek">pro\ o)mma/twn</foreign>, note on III 11. 2,) &lsquo;may afford an opportunity for exciting either commiseration or indignation&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">dei/nwsis</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">e)/leos, oi)=ktos, sxetliasmo/s</foreign>, are two ordinary &lsquo;common topics&rsquo;, (subordinate varieties of <foreign lang="greek">au)/chsis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">mei/wsis</foreign>,) of <hi rend="italic">appeals to the feelings</hi> in use amongst rhetoricians. See notes on II 21. 10, and 24. 4. Of Thrasymachus, and his use of these in his Rhetoric, Pl. Phaedr. 267 C, D, and of the early rhetoricians in general, Ib. 272 A, where <foreign lang="greek">braxulogi/a</foreign> is joined with the other two. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;An example of this is &ldquo;the story of Alcinous,&rdquo; (it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an example) <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it is told (<foreign lang="greek">pepoi/htai</foreign>, composed, written) to Penelope in sixty verses&rsquo;, i. e. the long story of Ulysses' wanderings, which occupies in the narration of it to the Phaeacians four whole books of the Odyssey, IX&mdash; XII, is condensed by Ulysses, when he repeats it to Penelope, Od. <foreign lang="greek">y/</foreign> [XXIII] 264&mdash;284, 310&mdash;343, into a summary of 55 verses&mdash;which here (with the characteristic inaccuracy of the ancient writers in calculations and descriptions of all kinds) are called in round numbers sixty&mdash;and thus furnishes a good example of the <hi rend="italic">summary</hi> treatment required in an ordinary narrative. Vater, who explains all this in his note, understates the actual number by two. &ldquo;Hi versus quinquaginta et tres numero rotundo <hi rend="italic">recte</hi> (correctly <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> for the occasion, I suppose) <foreign lang="greek">e(ch/konta e)/ph</foreign> nominantur.&rdquo; </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And as Phayllus reduced (condensed: <foreign lang="greek">e)poi/hse</foreign>, I suppose, must be understood from <foreign lang="greek">pepoi/htai</foreign>, &lsquo;composed&rsquo;) the Epic cycle: and Euripides' prologue to the Oeneus&rsquo;. These three cases are appealed to as wellknown instances of concise summaries. The <foreign lang="greek">*)alki/nou a)po/logos</foreign>, in its original form, when given at length with all its details, became proverbial for &ldquo;a long story.&rdquo; Erasmus <hi rend="italic">Chil.</hi> <foreign lang="greek">*)apo/logos *)alki/nou e)pi\ tw=n fluarou/ntwn kai\ makro\n a)poteino/ntwn lo/gon</foreign>, Suidas s.v.

See Ast and Stallbaum <hi rend="italic">ad locum.</hi> The <foreign lang="greek">*)alki/nou a)po/logos</foreign> appears in Aelian's list of <foreign lang="greek">r(ayw|di/ai</foreign> into which the Homeric poems were divided for recitation (Var. Hist. XIII 13, <foreign lang="greek">p. *(omh/ron e)pw=n kai\ poih/sews</foreign>, quoted by Paley, Pref. to Hom. Il. p. xlvii). It is quoted again to supply an instance of <foreign lang="greek">a)nagnw/risis</foreign>, Poet. XVI. </p>
						<p>Of Phayllus nothing whatever is known. It seems that this is the <pb n="192"/> only place in which his name occurs; neither is it to be found in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Biogr.

						<p>&lsquo;The narrative should have an ethical cast: this will be effected when (if) we know what imparts this ethical character. One thing in particular that does so, is any indication of a moral purpose (II 21. 16, III 17. 9, Poet. VI 24): it is by (the quality of) this that a moral quality is given to character: and the quality (good or bad) of the moral purpose is determined by the end&rsquo;. On <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign>, see Eth. Nic. III cc. 4, 5, VI 2. &lsquo;Consequently Mathematics (mathematical calculations or reasonings, <foreign lang="greek">lo/goi</foreign>) can have no moral character, because they have no moral purpose: for they have no (moral or practical) end in view&rsquo;. (<hi rend="italic">Their</hi> end is the intellectual one, <hi rend="italic">truth.</hi>) &lsquo;But the &ldquo;Socratic dialogues&rdquo; have (a moral purpose, and an ethical and practical end), for they treat of such (ethical) subjects&rsquo;.

By &lsquo;Socratic dialogues&rsquo; are meant dialogues on moral philosophy, after the manner of Socrates, and therefore bearing his name, whether (as in Plato and Xenophon) he was an interlocutor, or not; the compositions of Socrates' friends and followers, the Socratic &lsquo;family&rsquo;, Xenophon, Plato, Aeschines, Antisthenes, Phaedo, (<hi rend="italic">Socraticam domum</hi>, Hor.

						<p>&lsquo;Another, different, kind of ethical drawing or representation (<foreign lang="greek">a)/lla</foreign>; no longer confined to <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> qualities, but the representation of <hi rend="italic">character</hi> in general) are the characteristic peculiarities that accompany each individual character: for instance, &ldquo;so and so walked on as he was talking&rdquo;&mdash;an indication of audacity and rudeness of character&rsquo;. The rudeness and insolence are shewn in <hi rend="italic">not stopping</hi> to speak to the other; it is a sign of slight esteem and contempt, <foreign lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign>. The characters here spoken of differ in one point from the dramatic characters of III 7. 6,&mdash; though they belong to the same family, the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> kind of <foreign lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>, Introd. p. 112&mdash;in that these are the characteristic peculiarities of <hi rend="italic">individuals</hi>, the others those of <hi rend="italic">classes.</hi> A good specimen of this <hi rend="italic">ethical</hi> description occurs in Demosth. de F. L. &sect; 361, a portrait of Aeschines; and two similar traits in c. Steph. <foreign lang="greek">a/ &sect; 63, ou(=tos ga\r, h(ni/ka me\n sune/bainen eu)tuxei=n *)aristolo/xw| tw=| trapezi/th|, i)/sa bai/nwn e)ba/dizen u(popeptwkw\s au)tw=|...e)peidh\ d'  a)pw/let) e)kei=nos k.t.l.</foreign> and &sect; 77, <foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ d'  ...th=s me\n o)/yews th=| fu/sei kai\ tw=| taxe/ws badi/zein kai\ lalei=n me/ga</foreign> (signs apparently of ill-breeding) <foreign lang="greek">ou) tw=n eu)tuxw=s pefuko/twn e)mauto\n kri/nw</foreign>. The <foreign lang="greek">i)/sa bai/nein</foreign> in the former passage, is &lsquo;to keep pace with&rsquo;, &lsquo;to walk on a level&rsquo;, &lsquo;place oneself on equal terms with&rsquo; another. See Shilleto ad loc. de F. L. (His reference to the passage of c. Steph. should be &sect; 63, not 77.) </p>
						<p>&lsquo;And again, in speaking, let your words seem to proceed, not from the intellect (as the effect of calculation, deliberation), but as it were from a moral purpose or intention (the will; or, as we should say, the heart)&rsquo;. &ldquo;Let your style bear the impress, not so much of intellectual subtlety and vigour, as of good feeling and sound moral purpose: the one may be the mark of a wise man, the other is that of a good&mdash;and, what is more to the purpose in Rhetoric, a popular&mdash;character.&rdquo; Introd. (slightly altered). &lsquo;&ldquo;And I wished this to take place; in fact such was my purpose and intention: it is true that I gained nothing by it; but even so it is better.&rdquo; The one is characteristic of a wise or prudent man, the other of a good one: for prudence (worldly, practical, wisdom) shews itself in the pursuit of one's interest, goodness in that of the fair, high, noble, right&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;If any (trait of character that you introduce) seem incredible, then add the statement (or explanation) of the cause or reason, as (in) the example that Sophocles gives, the passage of (from) his Antigone &ldquo;that <pb n="194"/> she cared more for her brother than for husband or children, for the one could be replaced (recovered) if they were lost&mdash;but when father and mother are buried in the grave, no brother can spring up evermore&rdquo;&rsquo;. This is Antigone's reason for preferring the burial of her brother's body to marriage with Haemon, a husband and children: she has shewn her character in the preference, and the obstinacy in which she adheres to it. It is the conclusion of a beautiful passage, beginning, <foreign lang="greek">w)= tu/mbos, w)= numfei=on</foreign>, Antig. 891&mdash;912. Arist. has altered <foreign lang="greek">kekeuqo/twn</foreign> of the original to <foreign lang="greek">bebhko/twn</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The same answer is put into the mouth of the wife of Intaphernes, when Darius, having condemned her husband and the whole of his family to death, allows her to choose one of the number whose life is to be spared. She chooses her brother, and when Darius expresses his surprise and demands the reason, replies thus: <foreign lang="greek">*)=w basileu=, a)nh\r me/n moi a)\n a)/llos ge/noito, ei) dai/mwn e)qe/loi, kai\ te/kna a)/lla, ei) tau=ta a)poba/loimi: patro\s de\ kai\ mhtro\s ou)k e)/ti meu zwo/ntwn, a)delfeo\s a)\n a)/llos ou)deni\ tro/pw| ge/noito. tau/th| th=| gnw/mh| xrewme/nh e)/leca tau=ta</foreign>. The comparison of these two passages of the poet and historian, and another equally close correspondence of Herod. II 35 with Soph. Oed. Col. 337, have led to the inference that there was some connexion or acquaintance between the two. When or where they met, if they ever did meet, cannot now be ascertained: Samos (which has been suggested) is out of the question; for Herodotus was at Thurium before Sophocles was appointed to his command in the expedition under Pericles against that island. The Antigone was produced in 440 B.C. It is probable that some parts of Herodotus' history had been published<note anchored="yes">There is a doubtful story of a recitation at Olympia.</note> before the final completion of the work at Thurium, and Sophocles may have thus obtained access to them. That he was the borrower, there can be no reasonable doubt. At all events that Sophocles was an admirer of Herodotus we know from Plutarch, who gives us the first line and a half of an epigram by Sophocles in his honour; <foreign lang="greek">w)|dh\n *(hrodo/tw| teu=cen *sofoklh=s e)te/wn w)\n pe/nt'  e)pi\ penth/konta</foreign>; adding that it was <foreign lang="greek">o(mologoume/nws *sofokle/ous</foreign>. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;If you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no reason to give, <hi rend="italic">at any rate</hi> you may say that &ldquo;you know that what you say will convince nobody, but such is your nature (you can't help being virtuous and disinterested, do what you will)&mdash;for <pb n="195"/> people never believe in disinterested motives<note anchored="yes">Comp.

						<p>&lsquo;Further, besides the <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, topics may be also derived from the expression of emotion of various kinds, by introducing in your narration both the usual accompaniments of these emotions (the outward expressions, attitudes, and other external indications), which everybody is acquainted with, and also any <hi rend="italic">special</hi> peculiarities by which you yourself or the adversary may be distinguished (which may be attached to, belong to, <foreign lang="greek">proso/nta</foreign>)&rsquo;. These special touches and traits in the expression of individual emotion will lend a lifelike character to the descriptions of your narrative, and impart fidelity to your own impersonations of feelings, and your representation of them as they manifest themselves in others. How true and lifelike all that is, the audience will say: that can be no counterfeit: the man is evidently in earnest. Again, the same popular fallacy as before; the illicit inference from the faithfulness of the imitation to the sincerity of the feeling and truth of the fact. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;Such indications are &ldquo;and he went away with a scowl at me from under his eyebrows&rdquo; (so <foreign lang="greek">taurhdo\n u(poble/yas</foreign> of &lsquo;an angry glance&rsquo;, Pl.

A great number of these (indications of <pb n="196"/> feeling) may be obtained from Homer: &ldquo;Thus then he spake; and the aged dame (Euryclea, Ulysses' old nurse) held fast (clasped) her face with her hands&rdquo; (Hom. Od. <foreign lang="greek">t/</foreign> [XIX] 361)&mdash;for people, when they are beginning to cry, are apt to lay hold of their eyes. Introduce yourself at once (to the audience) in a particular character (in that, namely, which you wish to bear in their eyes) that they may regard you as such: and the adversary in the same way (<hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi>): only take care that the design isn't detected. That there is no difficulty in this&mdash;in conveying these impressions to the audience, how readily they seize, and draw inferences from, these indications of emotion, expression of features, action and the like&mdash;must needs be seen&rsquo; (retaining <foreign lang="greek">dei=</foreign> with Bekker, Spengel omits it) &lsquo;from the case of messengers: of things that we know nothing whatever about, we nevertheless (instantly) conceive a notion or suspicion&rsquo; (from the face, expression, gestures, general appearance of the messenger; as if he is hot and tired, and so on). </p>

						<p>&lsquo;The narrative should be (not confined to one place and continuous, but) distributed over the speech (<foreign lang="greek">pollaxou=</foreign> &lsquo;in many places&rsquo;), and sometimes not at the beginning&rsquo;. In saying <foreign lang="greek">ou)k e)n a)rxh=|</foreign>, Ar. is referring to his own division of the speech, which excludes the <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> and commences at once with the <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign>, c. 13.

						<p>&lsquo;In public speaking there is least occasion for narrative, because no one ever gives a narrative of things future&rsquo; (the only province of deliberative Rhetoric, from which <hi rend="italic">all</hi> its materials are derived; <foreign lang="greek">w(s e)/pos ei)pei=n</foreign>): &lsquo;but if there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a narrative, it must be of things past, in order that with these in their recollection they may be better able to deliberate about things to come&rsquo;. Gaisford refers to Dionys. Ars Rhet. X 14, <foreign lang="greek">o(/lh me\n i)de/a sumbouleutikh\ dihgh/sews ou) dei=tai: i)/sasi ga\r oi( bouleuo/menoi peri\ w(=n skopou=ntai, kai\ de/ontai maqei=n o(\ prakte/on e)sti/n, ou)x o(/per bouleute/on</foreign>. </p>

						<p>The following sentence to the end of the chapter I have done what I can to elucidate in the Introd. p. 354. No commentator, except Victorius, whose explanation I have there criticized, has bestowed a single word upon it; not even Spengel in his recent edition: I suppose he has given it up as hopeless. What it seems to me to mean is something of this kind&mdash;but I think there is most likely some latent corruption. &lsquo;If there be anything incredible in your narrative, you may promise your audience (omit <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign>) to add<note anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kai\ ai)ti/an</foreign> a reason in addition, besides the mere statement.</note> a reason (i.e. explanation, to <hi rend="italic">account for</hi> it), and a full, detailed, explanation of it as long as they please&rsquo;. <foreign lang="greek">diata/ttein</foreign> is one of the chief difficulties of the passage. The only appropriate meaning that occurs to me is to &lsquo;set out in order, i.e. set forth in full and clear detail&rsquo;: <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s bou/lontai</foreign> &lsquo;with what, with as many details as, they please&rsquo;. &lsquo;As Carcinus&rsquo; Jocasta, in his Oedipus, is perpetually promising, in answer to the inquiries of the man who is looking for her son&mdash;(something or other, which is left to be supplied by the hearer's knowledge of the context: probably, to satisfy him). And Sophocles' Haemon&rsquo;. This last example must be given up as hopeless: there is nothing in the extant play which could be interpreted as is required here. And what Carcinus' Jocasta has to do with the topic to be illustrated, is not easy to see. Carcinus' Medea has been already quoted II 23. 28, where an account is given of him in the note. His Thyestes is referred to, Poet. XVI 2, and a fault pointed out, XVII 2. And as if to aggravate the difficulties which surround the interpretation of this passage, Wagner, in his collection of the Tragic Fragments, has chosen to omit this reference to Carcinus. </p>

					<p>Of the various kinds of proof, the various ways in which facts and statements may be made to appear probable, <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>, some are direct and logical, and appeal exclusively to the reasoning faculty; others indirect, which by appealing to the moral sense <foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, or to the emotions <foreign lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, support the logical arguments by the favourable impressions they produce upon the hearts and feelings of the listeners, who are ever ready to <pb n="198"/> draw inferences from what <hi rend="italic">they feel</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">truth of what is said;</hi> and further the adventitious and external aids, which are not invented by the speaker but found ready for use and applied by him in evidence of the facts of his case: of these three the first only have any pretension to the character of <foreign lang="greek">a)podeiktikai/</foreign>. But not even these are entitled to the name in its strict and proper sense, <foreign lang="greek">a)po/deicis</foreign> &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo; implying conclusions universal and necessary and a rigorous exact syllogistic method. This belongs, strictly speaking, exclusively to the domain of Science and to the sphere of certainty, to which no conclusion of Rhetoric can ever attain. When it is said therefore in &sect; 1, that &ldquo;the proofs of preceding statements, and refutation of those of the adversary&rdquo;&mdash;which from the third division of the speech&mdash;&ldquo;must be demonstrative&rdquo;,&mdash;no more is meant than that they must be demonstrated, so far as the nature and limits of rhetorical proof permit, that is, that they must be such, so far consistent with sound reasoning and the rules of logic, as will induce those who hear them to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> what they seek to establish. We have very frequently had to remark the language of strict Logic applied to the laxer methods of Rhetoric, here it is done a little more formally than usual. </p>
					<p>&lsquo;The point to which this <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> must be directed (addressed) of the four questions on which the issue may turn, is the particular point on which the issue is actually joined between the two contending parties: for example, if the issue is the question of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, was the thing done or not? in the trial <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the point that he must most aim at establishing; if of <hi rend="italic">harm or loss</hi>, injury, at <hi rend="italic">that;</hi> or if&mdash;these two being admitted&mdash;the question is one of <hi rend="italic">the degree</hi> or amount of the injury; or of the justice of the action&mdash;admitting the fact and the injury and even the amount charged&mdash;of that; just as much (in the three last cases) as if the issue had been one of that same thing as a <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>&rsquo;.

					<div3 id="b3c17s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>&lsquo;But let it not be forgotten that this issue (of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>) is the only one in which it may happen that one of the two parties must necessarily be a rogue: for in such cases, ignorance (which exempts from responsibility, see note on c. 15. 3) cannot be pleaded (cannot be assigned as the cause or reason), as it may when the issue is the justice (or injustice) of the act&rsquo;&mdash;and the same of the <hi rend="italic">injury</hi>, and alleged degree or amount of the offence&mdash;&lsquo;and therefore in this issue alone the topic may be dwelt <pb n="199"/> upon, but not in the (three) others&rsquo;. It is important to observe here a qualification of the apparent meaning, which has not been&mdash;at all events distinctly&mdash;pointed out by the Commentators. It would not be true to say <hi rend="italic">universally</hi> that when the issue is that of fact, whether the act alleged has or has not been committed, that one of the two parties concerned must necessarily be a rogue: as when A accuses B of murder, the question is one of fact, is B guilty or not guilty? B may be perfectly innocent, though the circumstantial evidence is so strong as to justify A in bringing the charge. All that is meant is, that there is a certain class of cases which fall under this <hi rend="italic">status</hi> or issue, in which this topic may be safely used. Comp. Eth. Nic.

						<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ toi=s ma/ntesin</lemma>] as has been noticed elsewhere, &ldquo;was doubtless meant by Epimenides as a sarcasm upon his prophetic brethren, who pretended to see into futurity. &lsquo;Even diviners&rsquo;, said he, &lsquo;impostors as they are, can prophesy what is past&rsquo;&rdquo;.

Plato, who calls him a <foreign lang="greek">qei=os a)nh/r</foreign>, speaks of his foretelling the future (Legg. 642 D), and the very gift which in the text he appears to disclaim is similarly ascribed to him by Cicero, who after saying <hi rend="italic">est enim ars in iis qui nouas res coniectura persequuntur, veteres observatione didicerunt</hi>, classes Epimenides among those who are destitute of this art; <hi rend="italic">qui non ratione aut coniectura, observatis ac notatis signis, sed concitatione quadam animi, aut soluto liberoque motu, futura praesentiunt</hi> (de divin. I 18. 34). But the office of the prophet, or intermediary interpreter between God and man, was not necessarily confined to the prediction of the future, but also included the expounding of the will of heaven respecting the present and the past.

						<p>From this passage of Gorgias the existence of a panegyric oration &lsquo;in praise of Achilles&rsquo;, is inferred by Dr Thompson (on p. 178 of his ed. of the Gorgias), who also suggests that &ldquo;a fragment preserved by the Scholiast on Iliad IV 450 may have belonged to this speech: <foreign lang="greek">a)nemi/sgonto de\ li/tais a)peilai\ kai\ eu)xai=s oi)mwgai/</foreign>.&rdquo; </p>

						<p>&lsquo;When you are speaking in reply, you should first mention the arguments against the statement on the other side, by refuting that statement and drawing up counter-syllogisms, and especially if the arguments on the opposite side are well received; for just as the mind refuses to open itself favourably to one who has been made the victim of prejudice, the same applies to oratory also, if your opponent is held to have made a good speech&rsquo;. </p>
						<p>&lsquo;You must therefore as it were make room in the hearer's mind for the speech that is about to be made, and this will be effected by getting out of the way your opponent's speech&rsquo; (with which the minds of your audience are pre-occupied). </p>

						<p>The reference to the Philippus of Isocrates points (according to Victorius) to p. 96 D &sect;&sect; 72&mdash;78, where the writer gets rid of the indelicacy of himself reminding Philip of the current imputation that his growing power <foreign lang="greek">ou)x u(pe\r th=s *(ella/dos a)ll'  e)pi\ tau/thn au)ca/netai</foreign>, by attributing it to others in the words, <foreign lang="greek">ai)sqa/nomai ga/r se diaballo/menon u(po\ tw=n soi\ fqonou/ntwn</foreign> in &sect; 73, and by describing it in &sect; 78 as <foreign lang="greek">toiau/thn fh/mhn sautw=| perifuome/nhn, h(\n oi( me\n e)xqroi\ periqei=nai/ soi zhtou=si</foreign>.

Spengel accordingly prefers taking it as a reference to &sect;&sect; 4&mdash;7, where, instead of expressing his own satisfaction with one of his compositions, he states that his friends who have heard it recited had been struck by its truthful statement of facts, &sect; 4, and had expected that, if published, it would have led to the establishment of peace; it so happened, however, that Philip had concluded peace, before the fastidious rhetorician had elaborated his pamphlet to a sufficient degree to think it deserving of publication. Perhaps a still more apposite passage, which is omitted by Victorius and Spengel, is that in p. 87 B, &sect; 23, where the writer, after describing himself as deterred by his friends from addressing Philip, adds that finally <foreign lang="greek">e)/speudon ma=llon h)gw\ pemfqh=nai/ soi to\n lo/gon tou=ton, e)/legon d'  w(s e)/lpi/zousin ou) mo/non se\ kai\ th\n po/lin e(/cein moi xa/rin u(pe\r tw=n ei)rhme/nwn a)lla\ kai\ tou\s *(/ellhnas a(/pantas</foreign>. <pb n="209"/> </p>

					<p>This chapter treats of &lsquo;Interrogation&rsquo; of one's opponent (&sect;&sect; 1&mdash;4), and of &lsquo;Reply&rsquo; to his interrogations (&sect;&sect; 5, 6); it concludes with a few remarks on the use of &lsquo;ridicule&rsquo;, as an accessory to argument. These may be regarded as subdivisions of the general subject of proofs, <foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>, dealt with in the previous chapter, to which the present is an appendix. </p>
					<p>&ldquo;A favourite instrument of debate with speakers in the public assembly and law-courts is the interrogation of the adversary. The object of this is to enforce an argument; or to take the adversary by surprise and extract from him an unguarded admission; or to place him in an awkward dilemma, by shaping your question in such a way that he must either by avowing it admit something which his antagonist wishes to establish, or by refusing seem to give consent by his silence to that which the questioner wishes to insinuate; or to gain some similar advantage.&rdquo; Introd. p. 362. </p>
					<p>A Greek paraphrase of the first six sections of this chapter, with the headings <foreign lang="greek">peri\ e)rwth/sews</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">peri\ a)pokri/sews</foreign>, which owes its interest <pb n="211"/> mainly to the rareness of such commentaries on the Rhetoric, was edited in 1838 by Seguer from a MS in the library in Paris, and is reprinted in Spengel's <hi rend="italic">Rhetores Graeci</hi> I pp. 163&mdash;8, and also in his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, Vol. I pp. 147&mdash;152. It is a puerile piece of composition, but one or two extracts from it will be given where the writer's language really illustrates the text of Aristotle. </p>
					<p>On the subject of Interrogatories it may be noticed, that by Athenian Law either party to a suit might put questions to the other, and demand a reply, not only at the preliminary hearing (<foreign lang="greek">a)na/krisis</foreign>) but also at the trial itself (Plato, Apol. 25 D, <foreign lang="greek">a)po/krinai w)= )gaqe/: kai\ ga\r o( no/mos keleu/ei a)pokri/nasqai</foreign>). In the former instance, the answers were taken down in writing, and produced in court if wanted; in the latter, the questions could only be asked by the party addressing the court, who could not himself be interrupted by any interrogation on the part of his opponent, but only by the enquiries of the jury, which were sometimes even invited by the speaker. (Comp. C. R. Kennedy's <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes</hi> IV Appendix VII <hi rend="italic">On Interrogatories</hi>). </p>
					<p>Such interrogations, judging from the few specimens that have come down to us, were of the simplest kind; and owing to the large number and the natural impatience of the audience present, (whether as members of the general assembly or of the jury, in cases of the deliberative or the forensic class respectively), anything approaching an elaborate and protracted cross-examination was quite out of the question. </p>

						<p>The illustration is taken from the Apologia of Socrates. &lsquo;Socrates, when accused by Meletus of denying the existence of the gods, asked (<hi rend="italic">vulg. lect.</hi> said), if there was anything which he called divine, and on his admitting this, he enquired whether the divine beings (<foreign lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign>) were not either children of the gods or of godlike nature, and on his answering &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is there any one&rdquo; he said &ldquo;who believes in the existence of the children of the gods and yet denies that of the gods themselves?&rdquo; This corresponds only partially to the well-known passage in Plat.

The latter is the view supported by Victorius: &ldquo;Qui utitur dissimulatione, sibique semper in sermone detrahit, atque aliis plusquam vere concedi possit, tribuit, ut ipse oblectetur, voluptatemque ex aliorum stultitia capiat, hoc facit. quare sibi servit: contra scurra ridiculus est, et iocos undique captat, ut alii voluptatem gignat, quod illiberale ac sordidum est, omnia facere, ut alii turpiter inservias.&rdquo; </p>

					<p>The book appropriately closes with a chapter on the Peroration: the contents of that portion of the speech are distributed under four heads: (1) to inspire the audience with a favourable opinion of yourself and an unfavourable one of your opponents, (2) amplification and extenuation, (3) the excitement of the emotions of your audience, (4) refreshing their memory by recapitulation. </p>
					<p>Cornificius, II 30. 47, gives three divisions, (1) <hi rend="italic">enumeratio</hi>, (2) <hi rend="italic">amplificatio</hi>, (3) <hi rend="italic">commiseratio.</hi> Cic. de Inv.

					<p>In spite of what is here said about <foreign lang="greek">au)/chsis</foreign>, the student of ancient eloquence cannot fail to be struck by the quiet character of most of the perorations of the Attic orators. Perhaps the tamest of all (to our modern taste) is the closing sentence of Lysias Or. 22 (<foreign lang="greek">kata\ tw=n sitopw/lwn</foreign>) &sect; 22, <foreign lang="greek">ou)k oi)=d'  o(/ ti dei= plei/w le/gein: peri\ me\n ga\r tw=n a)/llwn tw=n a)dikou/ntwn, o(/te dika/zontai, dei= para\ tw=n kathgo/rwn puqe/sqai, th\n de\ tou/twn ponhri/an a(/pantes e)pi/stasqe. a)\n ou)=n tou/twn katayhfi/shsqe, ta/ te di/kaia poih/sete kai\ a)ciw/teron to\n si=ton w)nh/sesqe: ei) de\ mh\, timiw/teron</foreign>. It is well remarked by Brougham that &ldquo;the perorations, if by this we mean the concluding sentences of all, in the Greek orations, are calm and tame, compared with the rest of their texture, and especially with their penultimate <pb n="218"/> portions, which rise to the highest pitch of animation&rsquo; (vol. VII, <hi rend="italic">Rhetorical Dissertations</hi>, pp. 25, 184; see also especially Jebb's <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi> I p. ciii). </p>
					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pe/fuke&mdash;e)pixalkeu/ein</lemma>] &lsquo;For the natural order is first to prove your own case to be true and your opponent's to be false; and after that, to use praise and blame, and to elaborate these topics&rsquo;. These words give the reason for giving the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> place in the four heads to inspiring in the audience a favourable opinion towards yourself. </p>
					<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pixalkeu/ein</lemma>] is a difficult word to translate satisfactorily in the present context. Victorius dubiously explains it: &ldquo;explire et quod factum iam est cursim festinanterque eo consilio ut concinnes, iterare ac repetere.&rsquo; It is metaphorically used in Arist. Nub. 422, where Strepsiades offers himself (not his son, as Ernesti says <hi rend="italic">Lex. Techn.</hi> s.v.,) to Socrates, as sturdy and tough material for him to hammer upon and forge to his purpose, <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  e(/neke/n ge yuxh=s sterra=s...a)me/lei qarrw=n, ou(/neka tou/twn e)pixalkeu/ein pare/xoim) a)/n</foreign> (for a Latin metaphor from the anvil, comp. Horace, <hi rend="italic">A.P.</hi> 441, <hi rend="italic">male tornatos incudi reddere versus</hi>). At first sight the word might be supposed to refer to <foreign lang="greek">a)na/mnhsis</foreign>, which is subsequently explained in the words <foreign lang="greek">polla/kis ei)pei=n</foreign>, in which case it would mean &lsquo;to hammer your subject down&rsquo;, &lsquo;drive it home&rsquo;; but <foreign lang="greek">meta\ tou=to</foreign> in &sect; 2 shews that in the present section Ar. is only dwelling on the first of the four heads of the epilogue, and does not at present touch on <foreign lang="greek">a)na/mnhsis</foreign>, which is reserved for &sect; 4. Consequently we must understand it to mean &lsquo;to elaborate&rsquo;, &lsquo;to finish off&rsquo;, the topics belonging to the first head. It may also mean to mould the audience to one's purpose. Brandis in Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV I, p. 45, points out that his <hi rend="italic">Anonymus</hi> read the clause as follows: <foreign lang="greek">kai\ meta\</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">to\ e)painei=n kai\ ye/gein to\</foreign> (not <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">e)pixalkeu/ein</foreign>, in which case the last word corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> head, <foreign lang="greek">ei)s ta\ pa/qh katasth=sai to\n a)kroath/n</foreign>. </p>
					<p>&lsquo;Now (in this) you must aim at one of two objects; to represent yourself as either relatively or absolutely good, and your opponent as either relatively or absolutely bad&rsquo;. As is remarked in the Introd. p. 368, &lsquo;the virtue assumed may be either virtue <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, and independent of all other considerations, as times, places, and persons&mdash;or in default of this, at any rate good to the judges or audience; as it may be, useful, or well-disposed&rsquo;.

Considering the carelessness of style which characterizes many portions of the <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, it is all the more striking to find its close marked by a sentence so happily chosen,&mdash;a sentence which at once illustrates the point under <pb n="221"/> consideration and also serves as an appropriate farewell to the subject of the treatise; as though Aristotle had added at the conclusion of his course: &lsquo;I have said all that I had to say; my lectures are now finished; I leave the subject in your hands, and trust it to your judgment&rsquo;. The closing words of the Sophistici Elenchi are at least equally effective, <foreign lang="greek">loipo\n a)\n ei)/h pa/ntwn u(mw=n h)\ tw=n h)kroame/nwn e)/rgon toi=s me\n paraleleimme/nois th=s meqo/dou suggnw/mhn toi=s d'  eu(rhme/nois pollh\n e)/xein xa/rin</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The illustration is doubtless a reminiscence of the closing words of one of the best-known speeches of Lysias, Or. 12 (<foreign lang="greek">kat'  *)eratosqe/nous</foreign>), <foreign lang="greek">pau/somai kathgorw=n: a)khko/ate, e(wra/kate, pepo/nqate: e)/xete, dika/zete</foreign>, a passage which may perhaps find its modern equivalent in some such words as these: </p>
