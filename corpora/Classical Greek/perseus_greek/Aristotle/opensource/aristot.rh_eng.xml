				<pb ed="Bekker" n="1354a"/>
				<lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rhetoric is a
					counterpart<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Not an exact copy, but making
						a kind of pair with it, and corresponding to it as the antistrophe to the
						strophe in a choral ode.</note> of Dialectic; for both have to do with
					matters that are in a manner within the cognizance of all men and not
					confined<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or &ldquo;and they
						&lpar;Rhetoric and Dialectic&rpar; are not
						confined.&rdquo;</note> to any special science. Hence all men in a manner
					have a share of both; for all, up to a certain point, endeavor to criticize or
					uphold an argument, to defend themselves or to accuse. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now, the majority of people do this either at random or with a
					familiarity arising from habit. But since both these ways are possible, it is
					clear that matters can be reduced to a system, for it is possible to examine the
					reason why some attain their end by familiarity and others by chance; and such
					an examination all would at once admit to be the function of an art.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The special characteristic of an art is the
						discovery of a system or method, as distinguished from mere knack &lpar;
						<foreign lang="greek">e)mpeiri/a</foreign>&rpar;.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now, previous compilers of
					&ldquo;Arts&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Manuals or
						handbooks treating of the rules of any art or science.</note> of Rhetoric
					have provided us with only a small portion of this art, for proofs are the only
					things in it that come within the province of art; everything else is merely an
					accessory. And yet they say nothing about enthymemes which are the body of
					proof, but chiefly devote their attention to matters outside the subject;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for the arousing of prejudice, compassion,
					anger, and similar emotions has no connection with the matter in hand, but is
					directed only to the dicast.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">His functions
						were a combination of those of the modern judge and juryman.</note> The
					result would be that, if all trials were now carried on as they are in some
					States,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>especially those that are well administered,
					there would be nothing left for the rhetorician to say. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For all men either think that all the laws ought so to
					prescribe,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That is, forbid speaking of
						matters that have nothing to do with the case.</note> or in fact carry out
					the principle and forbid speaking outside the subject, as in the court of
					Areopagus, and in this they are right. For it is wrong to warp the dicast's
					feelings, to arouse him to anger, jealousy or compassion, which would be like
					making the rule crooked which one intended to use. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Further, it is evident that the only business of the litigant is to
					prove that the fact in question is or is not so, that it has happened or not;
					whether it is important or unimportant, just or unjust, in all cases in which
					the legislator has not laid down a ruling, is a matter for the dicast himself to
					decide; it is not the business of the litigants to instruct him.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>First of all, therefore, it is proper that laws,
					properly enacted, should themselves define the issue of all cases as far as
					possible, and leave as little as possible to the discretion of the judges; in
					the first place, because it is easier to find one or a few men of good sense,
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1354b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>capable of framing laws
					and pronouncing judgements, than a large number; secondly, legislation is the
					result of long consideration, whereas judgements are delivered on the spur of
					the moment, so that it is difficult for the judges properly to decide questions
					of justice or expediency. But what is most important of all is that the
					judgement of the legislator does not apply to a particular case, but is
					universal and applies to the future, whereas the member of the public assembly
					and the dicast have to decide present and definite issues, and in their case
					love, hate, or personal interest is often involved, so that they are no longer
					capable of discerning the truth adequately, their judgement being obscured by
					their own pleasure or pain.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>All other cases, as we have just said, should be
					left to the authority of the judge as seldom as possible, except where it is a
					question of a thing having happened or not, of its going to happen or not, of
					being or not being so; this must be left to the discretion of the judges, for it
					is impossible for the legislator to foresee such questions. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>If this is so, it is obvious that all those who
					definitely lay down, for instance, what should be the contents of the exordium
					or the narrative, or of the other parts of the discourse, are bringing under the
					rules of art what is outside the subject; for the only thing to which their
					attention is devoted<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>is how to put the judge into a
					certain frame of mind. They give no account of the artificial proofs,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Systematic logical proofs &lpar;enthymeme,
						for example&rpar;, including testimony as to character and appeals to
						the emotions &lpar;2.3&rpar;, which the rhetorician has to invent
						&lpar; <foreign lang="greek">eu(rei=n</foreign>, <foreign lang="la">inventio</foreign>&rpar; for use in particular cases. They are
						contrasted with &ldquo;inartificial&rdquo; proofs, which have
						nothing to do with the rules of the art, but are already in existence, and
						only need to be made use of. The former are dealt with in chs. 4-14, the
						latter in ch. 15 of this book.</note> which make a man a master of
					rhetorical argument.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Hence, although the method of deliberative and
					forensic Rhetoric is the same, and although the pursuit of the former is nobler
					and more worthy of a statesman than that of the latter, which is limited to
					transactions between private citizens, they say nothing about the former, but
					without exception endeavor to bring forensic speaking under the rules of art.
					The reason of this is that in public speaking it is less worth while to talk of
					what is outside the subject, and that deliberative oratory lends itself to
					trickery less than forensic, because it is of more general interest.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">koino/teron</foreign>:
						or, &ldquo;more intelligible to the ordinary man.&rdquo;</note> For
					in the assembly the judges decide upon their own affairs, so that the only thing
					necessary is to prove the truth of the statement of one who recommends a
					measure, but in the law courts this is not sufficient; there it is useful to win
					over the hearers, for the decision concerns other interests than those of the
					judges, who, having only themselves to consider and listening merely for their
					own pleasure, surrender to the pleaders but do not give a real decision.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The case as a rule being a matter of personal
						indifference, the judges are likely to be led away by the arguments which
						seem most plausible.</note>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1355a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>That is why, as I have said
					before, in many places the law prohibits speaking outside the subject in the law
					courts, whereas in the assembly the judges themselves take adequate precautions
					against this.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>It is obvious, therefore, that a system
					arranged according to the rules of art is only concerned with proofs; that proof
					is a sort of demonstration,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Exact scientific
						proof &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">a)po/deicis</foreign>&rpar;,
						which probable proof &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">pi/stis</foreign>&rpar; only to a certain extent resembles.</note>
					since we are most strongly convinced when we suppose anything to have been
					demonstrated; that rhetorical demonstration is an enthymeme, which, generally
					speaking, is the strongest of rhetorical proofs and lastly, that the enthymeme
					is a kind of syllogism. Now, as it is the function of Dialectic as a whole, or
					of one of its parts,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Dialectic here apparently
						includes logic generally, the &ldquo;part&rdquo; being either the
						<title>Analytica Priori</title>, which deals with the syllogism, or the
						<title>Sophistici Elenchi</title>, on Fallacies.</note> to consider
					every kind of syllogism in a similar manner, it is clear that he who is most
					capable of examining the matter and forms of a syllogism will be in the highest
					degree a master of rhetorical argument, if to this he adds a knowledge of the
					subjects with which enthymemes deal and the differences between them and logical
					syllogisms. For, in fact, the true and that which resembles it come under the
					purview of the same faculty, and at the same time men have a sufficient natural
					capacity for the truth and indeed in most cases attain to it; wherefore one who
					divines well in regard to the truth will also be able to divine well in regard
					to probabilities.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)/ndoca</foreign>, &ldquo;resting on opinion&rdquo;; defined
						in the <title>Topics</title> &lpar;1.1&rpar; as &ldquo;things
						generally admitted by all, or by most men, or by the wise, and by all or
						most of these, or by the most notable and esteemed.&rdquo;</note></p>
				<p>It is clear, then, that all other rhetoricians bring under the rules of art what
					is outside the subject,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">dio/ti</foreign> either = <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign>, &ldquo;that&rdquo;; or,
						&lpar;it is clear&rpar; &ldquo;why.&rdquo;</note> have
					rather inclined to the forensic branch of oratory. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Nevertheless, Rhetoric is useful, because the true and the just are
					naturally superior to their opposites, so that, if decisions are improperly
					made, they must owe their defeat to their own advocates; which is reprehensible.
					Further, in dealing with certain persons, even if we possessed the most accurate
					scientific knowledge, we should not find it easy to persuade them by the
					employment of such knowledge. For scientific discourse is concerned with
					instruction,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Almost equivalent to
						demonstration or strictly logical proof.</note> but in the case of such
					persons instruction is impossible; our proofs and arguments must rest on
					generally accepted principles, as we said in the <title>Topics</title>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">1.2. The <title>Topics</title> is a treatise in
						eight books on Dialectic and drawing conclusions from probabilities.</note>
					when speaking of converse with the multitude. Further, the orator should be able
					to prove opposites, as in logical arguments; not that we should do both
					&lpar;for one ought not to persuade people to do what is wrong&rpar;,
					but that the real state of the case may not escape us, and that we ourselves may
					be able to counteract false arguments, if another makes an unfair use of them.
					Rhetoric and Dialectic alone of all the arts prove opposites; for both are
					equally concerned with them. However, it is not the same with the subject
					matter, but, generally speaking, that which is true and better is naturally
					always easier to prove and more likely to persuade. Besides, it would be absurd
					if it were considered disgraceful not to be able to defend oneself with the help
					of the body, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1355b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but not
					disgraceful as far as speech is concerned, whose use is more characteristic of
					man than that of the body. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>If it is argued
					that one who makes an unfair use of such faculty of speech may do a great deal
					of harm, this objection applies equally to all good things except virtue, and
					above all to those things which are most useful, such as strength, health,
					wealth, generalship; for as these, rightly used, may be of the greatest benefit,
					so, wrongly used, they may do an equal amount of harm.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>It is thus evident that Rhetoric does not deal
					with any one definite class of subjects, but, like Dialectic, &lsqb;is of
					general application&rsqb;; also, that it is useful; and further, that its
					function is not so much to persuade, as to find out in each case the existing
					means of persuasion.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The early sophistical
						definition was &ldquo;the art of persuasion.&rdquo;</note> The same
					holds good in respect to all the other arts. For instance, it is not the
					function of medicine to restore a patient to health, but only to promote this
					end as far as possible; for even those whose recovery is impossible may be
					properly treated. It is further evident that it belongs to Rhetoric to discover
					the real and apparent means of persuasion, just as it belongs to Dialectic to
					discover the real and apparent syllogism. For what makes the sophist is not the
					faculty but the moral purpose. But there is a difference: in Rhetoric, one who
					acts in accordance with sound argument, and one who acts in accordance with
					moral purpose,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>are both called rhetoricians; but in
					Dialectic it is the moral purpose that makes the sophist, the dialectician being
					one whose arguments rest, not on moral purpose but on the faculty.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The essence of sophistry consists in the moral
						purpose, the deliberate use of fallacious arguments. In Dialectic, the
						dialectician has the power or faculty of making use of them when he pleases;
						when he does so deliberately, he is called a sophist. In Rhetoric, this
						distinction does not exist; he who uses sound arguments as well as he who
						uses false ones are both known as rhetoricians.</note></p>
				<p>Let us now endeavor to treat of the method itself, to see how and by what means
					we shall be able to attain our objects. And so let us as it were start again,
					and having defined Rhetoric anew, pass on to the remainder of the subject.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Rhetoric then
					may be defined as the faculty of discovering the possible means of persuasion in
					reference to any subject whatever. This is the function of no other of the arts,
					each of which is able to instruct and persuade in its own special subject; thus,
					medicine deals with health and sickness, geometry with the properties of
					magnitudes, arithmetic with number, and similarly with all the other arts and
					sciences. But Rhetoric, so to say, appears to be able to discover the means of
					persuasion in reference to any given subject. That is why we say that as an art
					its rules are not applied to any particular definite class of things.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As for proofs, some are artificial, others
					inartificial. By the latter I understand all those which have not been furnished
					by ourselves but were already in existence, such as witnesses, tortures,
					contracts, and the like; by the former, all that can be constructed by system
					and by our own efforts. Thus we have only to make use of the latter, whereas we
					must invent the former. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1356a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now the proofs furnished by the speech are of
					three kinds. The first depends upon the moral character of the speaker, the
					second upon putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind, the third upon the
					speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The orator persuades by moral character when his
					speech is delivered in such a manner as to render him worthy of confidence; for
					we feel confidence in a greater degree and more readily in persons of worth in
					regard to everything in general, but where there is no certainty and there is
					room for doubt, our confidence is absolute. But this confidence must be due to
					the speech itself, not to any preconceived idea of the speaker's character; for
					it is not the case, as some writers of rhetorical treatises lay down in their
					&ldquo;Art,&rdquo; that the worth of the orator in no way contributes to
					his powers of persuasion; on the contrary, moral character, so to say,
					constitutes the most effective means of proof. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The orator persuades by means of his hearers, when they are roused to emotion
					by his speech; for the judgements we deliver are not the same when we are
					influenced by joy or sorrow, love or hate; and it is to this alone that, as we
					have said, the present-day writers of treatises endeavor to devote their
					attention. &lpar;We will discuss these matters in detail when we come to
					speak of the emotions.&rpar; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Lastly,
					persuasion is produced by the speech itself, when we establish the true<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or apparently true from the means of persuasion
					applicable to each individual subject.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now, since proofs are effected by these means,
					it is evident that, to be able to grasp them, a man must be capable of logical
					reasoning, of studying characters and the virtues, and thirdly the
					emotions&mdash;the nature and character of each, its origin, and the manner
					in which it is produced. Thus it appears that Rhetoric is as it were an offshoot
					of Dialectic and of the science of Ethics, which may be reasonably called
					Politics.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Rhetoric, as dealing with human
						actions, characters, virtues, and emotions, is closely connected with
						Politics, which includes Ethics. The two latter treat of the same subject
						from a different point of view. Both deal with happiness and virtue, but the
						object of Politics is, by comparison of the different forms of States to
						find the one in which man will be most virtuous. Lastly, Rhetoric, as an
						important factor in the training and education of the individual citizen and
						of the members of the State as a whole, may be described as an offshoot of
						Politics, with which the sophistical rhetoricians <emph>identified</emph>
						it.</note> That is why Rhetoric assumes<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;slips into the garb of&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;.
							Probably a stage metaphor.</note> the character of Politics, and those who
					claim to possess it, partly from ignorance, partly from boastfulness, and partly
					from other human weaknesses, do the same. For, as we said at the outset,
					Rhetoric is a sort of division or likeness of Dialectic, since neither of them
					is a science that deals with the nature of any definite subject, but they are
					merely faculties of furnishing arguments. We have now said nearly enough about
					the faculties of these arts and their mutual relations.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But for purposes of demonstration, real or
					apparent, just as Dialectic possesses two modes of argument, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1356b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>induction and the syllogism, real or
					apparent, the same is the case in Rhetoric; for the example is induction, and
					the enthymeme a syllogism, and the apparent enthymeme an apparent syllogism.
					Accordingly I call an enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, and an example
					rhetorical induction. Now all orators produce belief by employing as proofs
					either examples or enthymemes and nothing else; so that if, generally speaking,
					it is necessary to prove any fact whatever either by syllogism or by
					induction&mdash;and that this is so is clear from the
					<title>Analytics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. APr. 2.23">Aristot. Pr. Anal. 2.23</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristot. APo. 1.1">Aristot. Post. Anal.
							1.1</bibl>.</note>&mdash;each of the two former must be identical with each
					of the two latter.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That is, enthymeme and
						example must be the same as syllogism and induction.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The difference between example and enthymeme is
					evident from the <title>Topics</title>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">From
						the definitions of syllogism &lpar;1.1&rpar; and induction
						&lpar;1.12&rpar;. No particular passage, however, explains the
						difference here mentioned.</note> where, in discussing syllogism and
					induction, it has previously been said that the proof from a number of
					particular cases that such is the rule, is called in Dialectic induction, in
					Rhetoric example; but when, certain things being posited, something different
					results by reason of them, alongside of them, from their being true, either
					universally or in most cases, such a conclusion in Dialectic is called a
					syllogism, in Rhetoric an enthymeme.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>It is evident that Rhetoric enjoys both these
					advantages<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The employment of syllogism and
						induction, <foreign lang="greek">to\ ei)=dos th=s r(htorikh=s</foreign>
						being taken as simply = <foreign lang="greek">h( r(htorikh/</foreign>.
						Another rendering is: &ldquo;that each kind of Rhetoric &lpar;that
						which depends upon example or upon enthymeme&rpar; enjoys some special
						advantage.&rdquo;</note>&mdash;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for what has
					been said in the <title>Methodica</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A
						lost treatise, mentioned by Diogenes Laertius in his <title>Life of
							Aristotle</title>, 24, and by Dionysius of <placeName key="tgn,7016142">Halicarnassus</placeName> in the first letter to Ammaeus, 6. It is
						supposed to have dealt with some branch of Logic.</note> holds good also in
					this case&mdash;for rhetorical speeches are sometimes characterized by
					examples and sometimes by enthymemes, and orators themselves may be similarly
					distinguished by their fondness for one or the other. Now arguments that depend
					on examples are not less calculated to persuade, but those which depend upon
					enthymemes meet with greater approval. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Their
					origin and the way in which each should be used will be discussed later<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">2.20-24.</note>; for the moment let us define
					more clearly these proofs themselves.</p>
				<p>Now, that which is persuasive is persuasive in reference to some one, and is
					persuasive and convincing either at once and in and by itself, or because it
					appears to be proved by propositions that are convincing<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;by persons which are so&rdquo;
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note>; further, no art has the particular in
					view, medicine for instance what is good for <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> or Callias, but what is good for this or that class of
					persons &lpar;for this is a matter that comes within the province of an art,
					whereas the particular is infinite and cannot be the subject of a true
					science&rpar;; similarly, therefore, Rhetoric will not consider what seems
					probable in each individual case, for instance to <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> or Hippias, but that which seems probable to this or
					that class of persons. It is the same with Dialectic, which does not draw
					conclusions from any random premises&mdash;for even madmen have some
					fancies&mdash;but it takes its material from subjects which demand reasoned
					discussion, as Rhetoric does from those which are common subjects of
					deliberation. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1357a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The function of Rhetoric, then, is to deal with
					things about which we deliberate, but for which we have no systematic rules; and
					in the presence of such hearers as are unable to take a general view of many
					stages, or to follow a lengthy chain of argument. But we only deliberate about
					things which seem to admit of issuing in two ways; as for those things which
					cannot in the past, present, or future be otherwise, no one deliberates about
					them, if he supposes that they are such; for nothing would be gained by it.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Now, it is possible to draw conclusions
					and inferences partly from what has been previously demonstrated
					syllogistically, partly from what has not, which however needs demonstration,
					because it is not probable.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Certain
						propositions, which seem paradoxical and improbable to a popular audience,
						must be proved before it is able to understand them.</note> The first of
					these methods is necessarily difficult to follow owing to its length, for the
					judge is supposed to be a simple person; the second will obtain little credence,
					because it does not depend upon what is either admitted or probable. The
					necessary result then is that the enthymeme and the example are concerned with
					things which may, generally speaking, be other than they are, the example being
					a kind of induction and the enthymeme a kind of syllogism, and deduced from few
					premises, often from fewer than the regular<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">prw=tos</foreign>: the primary, typical syllogism
						of the first figure.</note> syllogism; for if any one of these is well
					known, there is no need to mention it, for the hearer can add it himself. For
					instance, to prove that Dorieus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Son of
						Diagoras of <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, and like his
						father celebrated for his victories in the Greek athletic contests. He
						played a considerable part in political and naval affairs in support of the
						Spartans &lpar;<dateRange from="-412" to="-407">412</dateRange>-407
						B.C.&rpar; whom he afterwards offended, and by whom he is said to have
						been put to death.</note> was the victor in a contest at which the prize was
					a crown,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>it is enough to say that he won a victory at the
					Olympic games; there is no need to add that the prize at the Olympic games is a
					crown, for everybody knows it.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But since few of the propositions of the
					rhetorical syllogism are necessary, for most of the things which we judge and
					examine can be other than they are, human actions, which are the subject of our
					deliberation and examination, being all of such a character and, generally
					speaking, none of them necessary; since, further, facts which only generally
					happen or are merely possible can only be demonstrated by other facts of the
					same kind, and necessary facts by necessary propositions &lpar;and that this
					is so is clear from the <title>Analytics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. APr. 1.8">Aristot. APr. 1.8.13</bibl>.</note>&rpar;, it is evident that the materials
					from which enthymemes are derived will be sometimes necessary, but for the most
					part only generally true; and these materials being probabilities and signs, it
					follows that these two elements must correspond to these two kinds of
					propositions, each to each.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That is,
						probabilities and signs correspond to general and necessary propositions.
						This is not strictly correct; only the <foreign lang="greek">tekmh/ria</foreign> correspond to the necessary propositions, the other
						signs and the other probabilities to the general or contingent propositions.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>For that which is probable is that which
					generally happens, not however unreservedly, as some define it, but that which
					is concerned with things that may be other than they are, being so related to
					that in regard to which it is probable <pb ed="Bekker" n="1357b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>as the universal to the particular. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>As to signs, some are related as the particular to
					the universal, others as the universal to the particular. Necessary signs are
					called <term lang="xgreek">tekmeria</term>; those which are not necessary have
					no distinguishing name. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>I call those necessary
					signs from which a logical syllogism can be constructed, wherefore such a sign
					is called <term lang="xgreek">tekm&emacr;rion</term>; for when people think
					that their arguments are irrefutable, they think that they are bringing forward
					a <term lang="xgreek">tekm&emacr;rion</term>, something as it were proved
					and concluded; for in the old language <term lang="xgreek">tekmar</term> and
					<term lang="xgreek">peras</term> have the same meaning &lpar;limit,
					conclusion&rpar;.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Among signs, some are related as the particular
					to the universal; for instance, if one were to say that all wise men are just,
					because <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> was both wise and just. Now this is a sign, but even though the
					particular statement is true, it can be refuted, because it cannot be reduced to
					syllogistic form. But if one were to say that it is a sign that a man is ill,
					because he has a fever, or that a woman has had a child because she has milk,
					this is a necessary sign. This alone among signs is a
					<emph>tekm&emacr;rion</emph>; for only in this case, if the fact is true, is
					the argument irrefutable. Other signs are related as the universal to the
					particular, for instance, if one were to say that it is a sign that this man has
					a fever, because he breathes hard; but even if the fact be true,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>this argument also can be refuted, for it is possible for a man to
					breathe hard without having a fever. We have now explained the meaning of
					probable, sign, and necessary sign, and the difference between them; in the
					<title>Analytics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. APr. 2.27">Aristot. Pr. Anal. 2.27</bibl>.</note> we
					have defined them more clearly and stated why some of them can be converted into
					logical syllogisms, while others cannot.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>We have said that example is a kind of
					induction and with what kind of material it deals by way of induction. It is
					neither the relation of part to whole, nor of whole to part, nor of one whole to
					another whole, but of part to part, of like to like, when both come under the
					same genus, but one of them is better known than the other. For example, to
					prove that Dionysius is aiming at a tyranny, because he asks for a bodyguard,
					one might say that Pisistratus before him and Theagenes of <placeName key="tgn,7017133">Megara</placeName> did the same, and when they obtained
					what they asked for made themselves tyrants. All the other tyrants known may
					serve as an example of Dionysius, whose reason, however, for asking for a
					bodyguard we do not yet know. All these examples are contained under the same
					universal proposition, that one who is aiming at a tyranny asks for a bodyguard.
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1358a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p>We have now stated the materials of proofs which are thought to be demonstrative.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>But a very great difference between
					enthymemes has escaped the notice of nearly every one, although it also exists
					in the dialectical method of syllogisms. For some of them belong to Rhetoric,
					some syllogisms only to Dialectic, and others to other arts and faculties, some
					already existing and others not yet established. Hence it is that this escapes
					the notice of the speakers, and the more they specialize in a subject, the more
					they transgress the limits of Rhetoric and Dialectic. But this will be clearer
					if stated at greater length.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>I mean by dialectical and rhetorical syllogisms
					those which are concerned with what we call &ldquo;topics,&rdquo; which
					may be applied alike to Law, Physics, Politics, and many other sciences that
					differ in kind, such as the topic of the more or less, which will furnish
					syllogisms and enthymemes equally well for Law, Physics, or any other science
					whatever, although these subjects differ in kind. Specific topics on the other
					hand are derived from propositions which are peculiar to each species or genus
					of things; there are, for example, propositions about Physics which can furnish
					neither enthymemes nor syllogisms about Ethics,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and there
					are propositions concerned with Ethics which will be useless for furnishing
					conclusions about Physics; and the same holds good in all cases. The first kind
					of topics will not make a man practically wise about any particular class of
					things, because they do not deal with any particular subject matter; but as to
					the specific topics, the happier a man is in his choice of propositions, the
					more he will unconsciously produce a science quite different from Dialectic and
					Rhetoric. For if once he hits upon first principles, it will no longer be
					Dialectic or Rhetoric, but that science whose principles he has arrived at.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The common topics do not deal with particular
						subject matter, as the specific topics do. In making use of the latter, the
						&ldquo;better&rdquo; &lpar;that is, in regard to a special
						science&rpar; the propositions chosen by a man, the more he will without
						knowing it quit the domain of Rhetoric and Dialectic, and become a professor
						of that special science whose first principles he has hit upon.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Most enthymemes are constructed from these
					specific topics, which are called particular and special, fewer from those that
					are common or universal. As then we have done in the <title>Topics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. SE 9">Aristot. Sophist. Elenchi &lpar;Fallacies&rpar; 9</bibl>. This
						treatise is really the ninth and concluding part of the
						<title>Topics</title>.</note>, so here we must distinguish the specific and
					universal topics, from which enthymemes may be constructed. By specific topics I
					mean the propositions peculiar to each class of things, by universal those
					common to all alike. Let us then first speak of the specific topics, but before
					doing so let us ascertain the different kinds of Rhetoric, so that, having
					determined their number, we may separately ascertain their elements and
					propositions.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Propositions &lpar;or
						premises&rpar;, the name given to the two first statements in a
						syllogism from which the conclusion is drawn: All men are mortal
						&lpar;major premise&rpar;; <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> is a man &lpar;minor
						premise&rpar;; therefore <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> is mortal.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The kinds of
					Rhetoric are three in number, corresponding to the three kinds of hearers. For
					every speech is composed of three parts: the speaker, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1358b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>the subject of which he treats, and the person to
					whom it is addressed, I mean the hearer, to whom the end or object of the speech
					refers. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the hearer must necessarily be
					either a mere spectator or a judge, and a judge either of things past or of
					things to come.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">All three kinds of hearers are
						regarded as judges &lpar;the mere spectator as a
						&ldquo;critic&rdquo;&rpar;, although strictly <foreign lang="greek">krith/s</foreign> should be limited to the law
						courts.</note> For instance, a member of the general assembly is a judge of
					things to come; the dicast, of things past; the mere spectator, of the ability
					of the speaker. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Therefore there are necessarily
					three kinds of rhetorical speeches, deliberative, forensic, and epideictic.</p>
				<p>The deliberative kind is either hortatory or dissuasive; for both those who give
					advice in private and those who speak in the assembly invariably either exhort
					or dissuade. The forensic kind is either accusatory or defensive; for litigants
					must necessarily either accuse or defend. The epideictic kind has for its
					subject praise or blame.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Further, to each of these a special time is
					appropriate: to the deliberative the future,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In 1.6.I and 8.7 the present is also mentioned as a time appropriate to
						deliberative Rhetoric.</note> for the speaker, whether he exhorts or
					dissuades, always advises about things to come; to the forensic the past, for it
					is always in reference to things done that one party accuses and the other
					defends; to the epideictic most appropriately the present, for it is the
					existing condition of things that all those who praise or blame have in view. It
					is not uncommon, however, for epideictic speakers to avail themselves of other
					times, of the past<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>by way of recalling it, or of the
					future by way of anticipating it.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Each of the three kinds has a different special
					end, and as there are three kinds of Rhetoric, so there are three special ends.
					The end of the deliberative speaker Is the expedient or harmful; for he who
					exhorts recommends a course of action as better, and he who dissuades advises
					against it as worse; all other considerations, such as justice and injustice,
					honor and disgrace, are included as accessory in reference to this. The end of
					the forensic speaker is the just or the unjust; in this case also all other
					considerations are included as accessory. The end of those who praise or blame
					is the honorable and disgraceful; and they also refer all other considerations
					to these. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>A sign that what I have stated is the
					end which each has in view is the fact that sometimes the speakers will not
					dispute about the other points. For example, a man on trial does not always deny
					that an act has been committed or damage inflicted by him, but he will never
					admit that the act is unjust; for otherwise a trial would be unnecessary.
					Similarly, the deliberative orator, although he often sacrifices everything
					else, will never admit that he is recommending what is inexpedient or is
					dissuading from what is useful; but often he is quite indifferent about showing
					that the enslavement of neighboring peoples, even if they have done no harm, is
					not an act of injustice.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The omission of
						<foreign lang="greek">ou)k</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">a)/dikon</foreign> has been suggested. The sense would then be:
						&ldquo;As to the injustice of enslaving . . . he is quite
						indifferent.&rdquo; There is no doubt a reference to the cruel treatment
						by <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> of the inhabitants of
						the island of <placeName key="tgn,7010922">Melos</placeName> &lpar;<date value="-416">416</date> B.C.&rpar; for its loyalty to the Spartans
						during the Peloponnesian war &lpar;<bibl n="Thuc. 5.84-116">Thuc.
							5.84-116</bibl>&rpar;. The Athenian envoys declined to discuss the
						question of right or wrong, which they said was only possible between equal
						powers, and asserted that <emph>expediency</emph> was the only thing that
						had to be considered. The question of justice or injustice &lpar;in the
						Melian case entirely disregarded&rpar;, even when taken into account,
						was merely accessory and intended to serve as a specious justification for
						the policy of might.</note> Similarly, those who praise or blame do not
					consider <pb ed="Bekker" n="1359a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>whether a man has
					done what is expedient or harmful, but frequently make it a matter for praise
					that, disregarding his own interest, he performed some deed of honor. For
					example, they praise Achilles because he went to the aid of his comrade
					Patroclus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">To protect his body and avenge
						his death &lpar;<bibl n="Hom. Il. 18">Hom. Il.
							18</bibl>.&rpar;.</note> knowing that he was fated to die, although he might
					have lived. To him such a death was more honorable, although life was more
					expedient.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>From what has been said it is evident that the
					orator must first have in readiness the propositions on these three
					subjects.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The expedient, the just, the
						honorable, and their contraries.</note> Now, necessary signs, probabilities,
					and signs are the propositions of the rhetorician; for the syllogism
					universally<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">o(/lws</foreign>: or, reading <foreign lang="greek">o(/los</foreign>,
						&ldquo;the syllogism as a whole.&rdquo;</note> consists of
					propositions, and the enthymeme is a syllogism composed of the propositions
					above mentioned. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Again, since what is
					impossible can neither have been done nor will be done, but only what is
					possible, and since what has not taken place nor will take place can neither
					have been done nor will be done, it is necessary for each of the three kinds of
					orators to have in readiness propositions dealing with the possible and the
					impossible, and as to whether anything has taken place or will take place, or
					not. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Further, since all, whether they praise or
					blame, exhort or dissuade, accuse or defend, not only endeavor to prove what we
					have stated, but also that the same things,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>whether good
					or bad, honorable or disgraceful, just or unjust, are great or small, either in
					themselves or when compared with each other, it is clear that it will be
					necessary for the orator to be ready with propositions dealing with greatness
					and smallness and the greater and the less, both universally and in particular;
					for instance, which is the greater or less good, or act of injustice or justice;
					and similarly with regard to all other subjects. We have now stated the topics
					concerning which the orator must provide himself with propositions; after this,
					we must distinguish between each of them individually, that is, what the three
					kinds of Rhetoric, deliberative, epideictic, and forensic, are concerned with.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>We must first
					ascertain about what kind of good or bad things the deliberative orator advises,
					since he cannot do so about everything, but only about things which may possibly
					happen or not. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Everything which of necessity
					either is or will be, or which cannot possibly be or come to pass, is outside
					the scope of deliberation. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Indeed, even in the
					case of things that are possible advice is not universally appropriate; for they
					include certain advantages, natural and accidental, about which it is not worth
					while to offer advice. But it is clear that advice is limited to those subjects
					about which we take counsel; and such are all those which can naturally be
					referred to ourselves and the first cause of whose origination is in our own
					power; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1359b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for our examination is
					limited to finding out whether such things are possible or impossible for us to
					perform.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>However, there is no need at present to endeavor
					to enumerate with scrupulous exactness or to classify those subjects which men
					are wont to discuss, or to define them as far as possible with strict accuracy,
					since this is not the function of the rhetorical art but of one that is more
					intelligent and exact, and further, more than its legitimate subjects of inquiry
					have already been assigned to it. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For what we
					have said before is true<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The analytical
						science is Dialectic, incorrectly regarded as a branch of Analytics, which
						properly implies scientific demonstration.</note>: that Rhetoric is composed
					of analytical science and of that branch of political science which is concerned
					with Ethics, and that it resembles partly Dialectic and partly sophistical
					arguments. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But in proportion as anyone
					endeavors to make of Dialectic or Rhetoric, not what they are, faculties, but
					sciences, to that extent he will, without knowing it, destroy their real nature,
					in thus altering their character, by crossing over into the domain of
					sciences<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Taking <foreign lang="greek">ei)s
						e)pisth/mas</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">metabai/nein</foreign>.
						If taken with <foreign lang="greek">e)piskeua/zwn</foreign>, the sense will
						be: &ldquo;by changing his ground &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">metabai/nein</foreign> being used absolutely&rpar; while altering
						their characters from faculties to sciences.&rdquo;</note>, whose
					subjects are certain definite things, not merely words. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Nevertheless, even at present we may mention such
					matters as it is worth while to analyze, while still leaving much for political
					science to investigate.</p>
				<p>Now, we may say that the most important subjects about which all men
					deliberate<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and deliberative orators harangue, are
					five in number, to wit: ways and means, war and peace, the defence of the
					country, imports and exports, legislation.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Accordingly, the orator who is going to give
					advice on ways and means should be acquainted with the nature and extent of the
					State resources, so that if any is omitted it may be added, and if any is
					insufficient, it may be increased. Further, he should know all the expenses of
					the State, that if any is superfluous, it may be removed, or, if too great, may
					be curtailed. For men become wealthier, not only by adding to what they already
					possess, but also by cutting down expenses. Of these things it is not only
					possible to acquire a general view from individual experience, but in view of
					advising concerning them it is further necessary to be well informed about what
					has been discovered among others.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In regard to war and peace, the orator should be
					acquainted with the power of the State, how great it is already and how great it
					may possibly become; of what kind it is already and what additions may possibly
					be made to it; further, what wars it has waged and its conduct of them. These
					things he should be acquainted with, not only as far as his own State is
					concerned, but also in reference to neighboring States, and particularly those
					with whom there is a likelihood of war, so that towards the stronger a pacific
					attitude may be maintained, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1360a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and in regard to the weaker, the decision as to making war on them may be left
					to his own State. Again, he should know whether their forces are like or unlike
					his own, for herein also advantage or disadvantage may lie. With reference to
					these matters he must also have examined the results, not only of the wars
					carried on by his own State, but also of those carried on by others; for similar
					results naturally arise from similar causes.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Again, in regard to the defense of the country,
					he should not be ignorant how it is carried on; he should know both the strength
					of the guard, its character, and the positions of the guard-houses
					&lpar;which is impossible for one who is unacquainted with the
					country&rpar;, so that if any guard is insufficient it may be increased, or
					if any is superfluous it may be disbanded, and greater attention devoted to
					suitable positions.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Again, in regard to food, he should know what
					amount of expenditure is sufficient to support the State; what kind of food is
					produced at home or can be imported; and what exports and imports are necessary,
					in order that contracts and agreements may be made with those<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tou/tous</foreign>: those who will
						receive exports and send imports.</note> who can furnish them; for it is
					necessary to keep the citizens free from reproach in their relations with two
					classes of people&mdash;those who are stronger and those who are useful for
					commercial purposes.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>With a view to the safety of the State, it is
					necessary that the orator should be able to judge of all these questions, but an
					understanding of legislation is of special importance, for it is on the laws<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that the safety of the State is based. Wherefore he must
					know how many forms of government there are; what is expedient for each; and the
					natural causes of its downfall, whether they are peculiar to the particular form
					of government or opposed to it. By being ruined by causes peculiar to itself, I
					mean that, with the exception of the perfect form of government, all the rest
					are ruined by being relaxed or strained to excess. Thus democracy, not only when
					relaxed, but also when strained to excess, becomes weaker and will end in an
					oligarchy; similarly, not only does an aquiline or snub nose reach the mean,
					when one of these defects is relaxed, but when it becomes aquiline or snub to
					excess, it is altered to such an extent that even the likeness of a nose is
					lost. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Moreover, with reference to acts of
					legislation, it is useful not only to understand what form of government is
					expedient by judging in the light of the past, but also to become acquainted
					with those in existence in other nations, and to learn what kinds of government
					are suitable to what kinds of people. It is clear, therefore, that for
					legislation books of travel are useful, since they help us to understand the
					laws of other nations, and for political debates historical works.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This rendering, although convenient, hardly
						represents the Greek, which, literally translated, is &ldquo;the
						<emph>investigations</emph> of those who write about human
						actions&rdquo; &lpar;cf. <foreign lang="greek">i(storiko/s</foreign>, 4.8&rpar;.</note> All these things, however,
					belong to Politics and not to Rhetoric.</p>
				<p>Such, then, are the most important questions upon which the would-be deliberative
					orator <pb ed="Bekker" n="1360b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>must be well informed.
					Now let us again state the sources whence we must derive our arguments for
					exhortation or discussion on these and other questions.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Men,
					individually and in common, nearly all have some aim, in the attainment of which
					they choose or avoid certain things. This aim, briefly stated, is happiness and
					its component parts. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Therefore, for the sake of
					illustration, let us ascertain what happiness, generally speaking, is, and what
					its parts consist in; for all who exhort or dissuade discuss happiness and the
					things which conduce or are detrimental to it. For one should do the things
					which procure happiness or one of its parts, or increase instead of diminishing
					it, and avoid doing those things which destroy or hinder it or bring about what
					is contrary to it.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Let us then define happiness as well-being
					combined with virtue, or independence of life, or the life that is most
					agreeable combined with security, or abundance of possessions and slaves,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This is the usual rendering, although it is
						hardly satisfactory. Jebb translates &ldquo;a flourishing state . . . of
						body.&rdquo;</note> combined with power to protect and make use of
					them<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;bring
						about,&rdquo; &ldquo;effect them.&rdquo;</note>; for nearly all
					men admit that one or more of these things constitutes happiness. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>If, then, such is the nature of happiness, its
					component parts must necessarily be:<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>noble birth,
					numerous friends, good friends, wealth, good children, numerous children, a good
					old age; further, bodily excellences, such as health, beauty, strength, stature,
					fitness for athletic contests, a good reputation, honor, good luck, virtue. For
					a man would be entirely independent, provided he possessed all internal and
					external goods; for there are no others. Internal goods are those of mind and
					body; external goods are noble birth, friends, wealth, honor. To these we think
					should be added certain capacities<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><emph>i.e.</emph> of mind and body; or <foreign lang="greek">duna/meis</foreign> may mean &ldquo;positions of authority and
						influence.&rdquo;</note> and good luck; for on these conditions life
					will be perfectly secure. Let us now in the same way define each of these in
					detail.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Noble birth, in the case of a nation or State,
					means that its members or inhabitants are sprung from the soil<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This was a favorite boast of the
						Athenians.</note>, or of long standing; that its first members were famous as
					leaders, and that many of their descendants have been famous for qualities that
					are highly esteemed. In the case of private individuals, noble birth is derived
					from either the father's or the mother's side, and on both sides there must be
					legitimacy; and, as in the case of a State, it means that its founders were
					distinguished for virtue, or wealth, or any other of the things that men honor,
					and that a number of famous persons, both men and women, young and old, belong
					to the family.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The blessing of good children and numerous
					children needs little explanation. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1361a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>For the commonwealth it consists in a large number of good young men,
					good in bodily excellences, such as stature, beauty, strength, fitness for
					athletic contests; the moral excellences of a young man are self-control and
					courage. For the individual it consists in a number of good children of his own,
					both male and female, and such as we have described. Female bodily excellences
					are beauty and stature, their moral excellences self-control and industrious
					habits, free from servility.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)neleuqeri/a</foreign>: literally, qualities unbecoming to
						a free man or woman, ungentlemanly, unladylike; hence, mean, servile,
						sordid.</note> The object of both the individual and of the community should
					be to secure the existence of each of these qualities in both men and women; for
					all those States in which the character of women is unsatisfactory, as in
					<placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A similar charge against the Spartan woman is made in <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1274a">Aristot. Pol. 2.9.5</bibl>: &ldquo;Further

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Wealth consists in abundance of money, ownership
					of land and properties, and further of movables, cattle, and slaves, remarkable
					for number, size, and beauty, if they are all secure, liberal, and useful.
					Property that is productive is more useful, but that which has enjoyment for its
					object is more liberal. By productive I mean that which is a source of income,
					by enjoyable that which offers no advantage beyond the use of it&mdash;at
					least, none worth mentioning. Security may be defined<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>as
					possession of property in such places and on such conditions that the use of it
					is in our own hands; and ownership as the right of alienation or not<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">h)\ mh/</foreign>: in the

					selling it. In a word, being wealthy consists rather in use than in possession;
					for the actualization<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>: realization in action or fact.</note> and use of
					such things is wealth.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>A good reputation consists in being considered a
					man of worth by all, or in possessing something of such a nature that all or
					most men, or the good, or the men of practical wisdom desire it.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Honor is a token of a reputation for doing good;
					and those who have already done good are justly and above all honored, not but
					that he who is capable of doing good is also honored. Doing good relates either
					to personal security and all the causes of existence; or to wealth; or to any
					other good things which are not easy to acquire, either in any conditions, or at
					such a place, or at such a time; for many obtain honor for things that appear
					trifling, but this depends upon place and time. The components of honor are
					sacrifices, memorials in verse and prose, privileges, grants of land, front
					seats, public burial, State maintenance, and among the barbarians, prostration
					and giving place, and all gifts which are highly prized in each country. For a
					gift is at once a giving of a possession and a token of honor; wherefore gifts
					are desired by the ambitious and by those who are fond of money, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1361b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>since they are an acquisition for the
					latter and an honor for the former; so that they furnish both with what they
					want.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Bodily excellence is health, and of such a kind
					that when exercising the body we are free from sickness; for many are healthy in

					have been, whom no one would consider happy in the matter of health, because
					they are obliged to abstain from all or nearly all human enjoyments.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Beauty varies with each age. In a young man, it
					consists in possessing a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the
					racecourse or of bodily strength, while he himself is pleasant to look upon and
					a sheer delight. This is why the athletes in the pentathlon<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Five contests: jumping, running, discus-throwing,
						javelin-throwing, wrestling.</note> are most beautiful, because they are
					naturally adapted for bodily exertion and for swiftness of foot. In a man who
					has reached his prime, beauty consists in being naturally adapted for the toils
					of war, in being pleasant to look upon and at the same time awe-inspiring. In an
					old man, beauty consists in being naturally adapted to contend with unavoidable
					labors and in not causing annoyance<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or simply,
						&ldquo;freedom from pain&rdquo; &lpar;5.15&rpar;.</note> to
					others, thanks to the absence of the disagreeable accompaniments of old age.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Strength consists in the power of moving
					another as one wills, for which purpose it is necessary to pull or push, to
					lift, to squeeze or crush, so that the strong man is strong by virtue of being
					able to do all or some of these things.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Excellence of stature consists in being
					superior to most men in height, depth, and breadth,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>but
					in such proportion as not to render the movements of the body slower as the
					result of excess.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Bodily excellence in athletics consists in
					size, strength, and swiftness of foot; for to be swift is to be strong. For one
					who is able to throw his legs about in a certain way, to move them rapidly and
					with long strides, makes a good runner; one who can hug and grapple, a good
					wrestler; one who can thrust away by a blow of the fist, a good boxer; one who
					excels in boxing and wrestling is fit for the pancratium,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A combination of wrestling and boxing.</note> he who excels
					in all for the pentathlon.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>A happy old age is one that comes slowly with
					freedom from pain; for neither one who rapidly grows old nor one who grows old
					insensibly but with pain enjoys a happy old age. This also depends upon bodily
					excellences and good fortune; for unless a man is free from illness and is
					strong, he will never be free from suffering, nor will he live long and
					painlessly without good fortune. Apart from health and strength, however, there
					is a power of vitality in certain cases; for many live long who are not endowed
					with bodily excellences. But a minute examination of such questions is needless
					for the present purpose.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>The meaning of numerous and worthy friends is
					easy to understand from the definition of a friend. A friend is one who exerts
					himself to do for the sake of another what he thinks is advantageous to him. A
					man to whom many persons are so disposed, has many friends; if they are
					virtuous, he has worthy friends.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Good fortune consists in the acquisition or
					possession <pb ed="Bekker" n="1362a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>of either all, or
					the most, or the most important of those goods of which fortune is the cause.
					Now fortune is the cause of some things with which the arts also are concerned,
					and also of many which have nothing to do with art, for instance, such as are
					due to nature &lpar;though it is possible that the results of fortune may be
					contrary to nature&rpar;; for art is a cause of health, but nature of beauty
					and stature.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The results of art and the
						results due to nature are often assisted &lpar;or hindered&rpar; by
						the interference of the irregular operations of fortune or chance. Health
						may be the result of fortune, as well as art &lpar;a sick man may be
						cured by a drug taken by chance, one not prescribed by the
						physician&rpar;; beauty and strength, of fortune as well as nature. It
						is parenthetically remarked that fortune may also produce unnatural
						monstrosities. The removal of the brackets and the substitution of a comma
						for the colon after <foreign lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> have been
						suggested. The meaning would then be: &ldquo;for instance, such as are
						due to nature, but possibly may be also contrary to
						nature.&rdquo;</note> Speaking generally, the goods which come from fortune
					are such as excite envy. Fortune is also a cause of those goods which are beyond
					calculation; for instance, a man's brothers are all ugly, while he is handsome;
					they did not see the treasure, while he found it; the arrow hit one who stood by
					and not the man aimed at; or, one who frequented a certain place was the only
					one who did not go there on a certain occasion, while those who went there then
					for the first time met their death. All such instances appear to be examples of
					good fortune.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>The definition of virtue, with which the topic
					of praise is most closely connected, must be left until we come to treat of the
					latter.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It is evident,
					then, what things, likely to happen or already existing, the orator should aim
					at, when exhorting, and what when dissuading; for they are opposites. But since
					the aim before the deliberative orator is that which is expedient, and men
					deliberate, not about the end, but about the means to the end, which are the
					things which are expedient in regard to<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>our actions; and
					since, further, the expedient is good, we must first grasp the elementary
					notions of good and expedient in general.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let us assume good to be whatever is desirable
					for its own sake, or for the sake of which we choose something else; that which
					is the aim of all things, or of all things that possess sensation or reason; or
					would be, if they could acquire the latter. Whatever reason might assign to each
					and whatever reason does assign to each in individual cases, that is good for
					each; and that whose presence makes a man fit and also independent; and
					independence in general; and that which produces or preserves such things, or on
					which such things follow, or all that is likely to prevent or destroy their
					opposites.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now things follow in two
					ways&mdash;simultaneously or subsequently; for instance, knowledge is
					subsequent to learning, but life is simultaneous with health. Things which
					produce act in three ways; thus, healthiness produces health; and so does food;
					and exercise as a rule. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This being laid down,
					it necessarily follows that the acquisition of good things and the loss of evil
					things are both good; for it follows simultaneously on the latter that we are
					rid of that which is bad, and subsequently on the former that we obtain
					possession of that which is good. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The same
					applies to the acquisition of a greater in place of a less good, and a less in
					place of a greater evil; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1362b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for
					in proportion as the greater exceeds the less, there is an acquisition of the
					one and a loss of the other. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The virtues also
					must be a good thing; for those who possess them are in a sound condition, and
					they are also productive of good things and practical. However, we must speak
					separately concerning each&mdash;what it is, and of what kind. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Pleasure also must be a good; for all living creatures
					naturally desire it. Hence it follows that both agreeable and beautiful things
					must be good; for the former produce pleasure, while among beautiful things some
					are pleasant and others are desirable in themselves.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>To enumerate them one by one, the following
					things must necessarily be good. Happiness, since it is desirable in itself and
					self-sufficient, and to obtain it we choose a number of things. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Justice, courage, self-control, magnanimity,
					magnificence, and all other similar states of mind, for they are virtues of the
					soul. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Health, beauty, and the like, for they
					are virtues of the body and produce many advantages; for instance, health is
					productive of pleasure and of life, wherefore it is thought to be best of all,
					because it is the cause of two things which the majority of men prize most
					highly. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Wealth, since it is the excellence of
					acquisition<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The excellence of anything is
						proportionate to its success in the performance of its proper function. The
						function of acquisition is to get something valuable, such as money, and its
						&ldquo;excellence&rdquo; may be judges by the amount of wealth
						obtained.</note> and productive of many things.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>A friend and friendship, since a friend
					is desirable in himself and produces many advantages. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Honor and good repute, since they are agreeable and produce many
					advantages, and are generally accompanied by the possession of those things for
					which men are honored. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Eloquence and capacity
					for action; for all such faculties are productive of many advantages. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Further, natural cleverness, good memory, readiness
					to learn, quick-wittedness, and all similar qualities; for these faculties are
					productive of advantages. The same applies to all the sciences, arts, and even
					life, for even though no other good should result from it, <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>it is desirable in itself. Lastly, justice, since it
					is expedient in general for the common weal.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>These are nearly all the things generally
					recognized as good; <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>in the case of doubtful
					goods, the arguments in their favor are drawn from the following. That is good
					the opposite of which is evil, <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>or the opposite
					of which is advantageous to our enemies; for instance, if it is specially
					advantageous to our enemies that we should be cowards, it is clear that courage
					is specially advantageous to the citizens. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And, speaking generally, the opposite of what our enemies desire or of that in
					which they rejoice, appears to be advantageous; wherefore it was well said: <quote>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And, generally speaking, all that is
					deliberately chosen is good.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>Now, men deliberately choose
					to do the things just mentioned, and those which are harmful to their enemies,
					and advantageous to their friends, and things which are possible. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>The last are of two kinds: things which might
					happen,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">geno/mena
						a)/n</foreign>: Spengel omits <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>: i.e.
						&ldquo;things which <emph>have</emph> happened.&rdquo;</note> and
					things which easily happen; by the latter are meant things that happen without
					labor or in a short time, for difficulty is defined by labor or length of time.
					And anything that happens as men wish is good; and what they wish is either what
					is not evil at all or is less an evil than a good, which will be the case for
					instance, whenever the penalty attached to it is unnoticed or light. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>And things that are peculiar to them, or which no one
					else possesses,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"> &ldquo;Or which no one
						else has done&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> or which are out
					of the common; for thus the honor is greater. And things which are appropriate
					to them; such are all things befitting them in respect of birth and power. And
					things which they think they lack, however unimportant; for none the less they
					deliberately choose to acquire them. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>And
					things which are easy of accomplishment, for being easy they are possible; such
					things are those in which all, or most men, or those who are equals or inferiors
					have been successful. And things whereby they will gratify friends or incur the
					hatred of enemies. And all things that those whom they admire deliberately
					choose to do. And those things in regard to which they are clever naturally or
					by experience; for they hope to be more easily successful in them. And things
					which no worthless man would approve, for that makes them the more commendable.
					And things which they happen to desire, for such things seem not only agreeable,
					but also better. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>Lastly, and above all, each
					man thinks those things good which are the object of his special desire, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1363b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>as victory of the man who
					desires victory, honor of the ambitious man, money of the avaricious, and so in
					other instances. These then are the materials from which we must draw our
					arguments in reference to good and the expedient.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But since men
					often agree that both of two things are useful, but dispute which is the more
					so, we must next speak of the greater good and the more expedient. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let one thing, then, be said to exceed another, when
					it is as great and something more&mdash;and to be exceeded when it is
					contained in the other. &ldquo;Greater&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;more&rdquo; always imply a relation with less;
					&ldquo;great&rdquo; and &ldquo;small,&rdquo;
					&ldquo;much&rdquo; and &ldquo;little&rdquo; with the general
					size of things; the &ldquo;great&rdquo; is that which exceeds, and that
					which falls short of it is &ldquo;small&rdquo;; and similarly
					&ldquo;much&rdquo; and &ldquo;little.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Since, besides, we call good that which is desirable
					for its own sake and not for anything else, and that which all things aim at and
					which they would choose if they possessed reason and practical wisdom; and that
					which is productive or protective of good, or on which such things follow; and
					since that for the sake of which anything is done is the end, and the end is
					that for the sake of which everything else is done, and that is good for each
					man which relatively to him presents all these conditions, it necessarily
					follows that a larger number of good things is a greater good than one or a
					smaller number, if the one or the smaller number is reckoned as one of
					them;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The one, the smaller number, and the
						greater number must be of the same species. Thus, 5 pounds is a greater good
						than 2 pounds; but 5 farthings is not a greater good than 2 pounds, since
						the smaller number is not reckoned in with the greater <persName><surname>Buckley</surname></persName>.</note><lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for it exceeds them and that which is contained is exceeded.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And if that which is greatest in one class
					surpass that which is greatest in another class, the first class will surpass
					the second; and whenever one class surpasses another, the greatest of that class
					will surpass the greatest of the other. For instance, if the biggest man is
					greater than the biggest woman, men in general will be bigger than women; and if
					men in general are bigger than women, the biggest man will be bigger than the
					biggest woman; for the superiority of classes and of the greatest things
					contained in them are proportionate. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And when
					this follows on that, but not that on this &lsqb;then
					&ldquo;that&rdquo; is the greater good&rsqb;;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">If B &lpar;life&rpar; follows on, is the consequent
						of A &lpar;health&rpar;, but A is not the consequent of B, then A is
						a greater good than B.</note> for the enjoyment of that which follows is
					contained in that of the other. Now, things follow simultaneously, or
					successively, or potentially; thus, life follows simultaneously on health, but
					not health on life; knowledge follows subsequently on learning &lsqb;but not
					learning on knowledge&rsqb;; and simple theft potentially on sacrilege, for
					one who commits sacrilege will also steal. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And
					things which exceed the same thing by a greater amount &lsqb;than something
					else&rsqb; are greater, for they must also exceed the greater.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Eight is greater than 2 by 6, which itself is
						greater than 2.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And things which produce a greater good are
					greater; for this we agreed was the meaning of productive of greater. And
					similarly, that which is produced by a greater cause; for if that which produces
					health is more desirable than that which produces pleasure and a greater good,
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1364a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>then health is a greater
					good than pleasure. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And that which is more
					desirable in itself is superior to that which is not; for example, strength is a
					greater good than the wholesome, which is not desirable for its own sake, while
					strength is; and, this we agreed was the meaning of a good. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And the end is a greater good than the means; for the
					latter is desirable for the sake of something else, the former for its own sake;
					for instance, exercise is only a means for the acquirement of a good
					constitution. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And that which has less need of
					one or several other things in addition is a greater good, for it is more
					independent &lpar;and &ldquo;having less need&rdquo; means needing
					fewer or easier additions&rpar;. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And when
					one thing does not exist or cannot be brought into existence without the aid of
					another, but that other can, then that which needs no aid is more independent,
					and accordingly is seen to be a greater good.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>And if one thing is a first principle, and
					another not; if one thing is a cause and another not, for the same reason; for
					without cause or first principle nothing can exist or come into existence. And
					if there are two first principles or two causes, that which results from the
					greater is greater; and conversely, when there are two first principles or two
					causes, that which is the first cause or principle of the greater is greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>It is clear then, from what has been said,
					that a thing may be greater in two ways; for if it is a first principle but
					another is not, it will appear to be greater, and if it is not a first principle
					&lsqb;but an end&rsqb;, while another is; for the end is greater and not
					a first principle.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A thing may be of greater

						principle; for the end is superior to the means. In the illustration that

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And that which is scarcer is a greater good
					than that which is abundant, as gold than iron, although it is less useful, but
					the possession of it is more valuable, since it is more difficult of

					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And, speaking generally, that which is more
					difficult is preferable to that which is easier of attainment, for it is
					scarcer; but from another point of view that which is easier is preferable to
					that which is more difficult; for its nature is as we wish. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And that, the contrary or the deprivation of which is
					greater, is the greater good.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">e.g. it is worse
						to be blind than deaf; therefore sight is better than hearing
						&lpar;Schrader&rpar;.</note> And virtue is greater than non-virtue,
					and vice than non-vice; for virtues and vices are ends, the others not.
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>And those things whose works are nobler or
					more disgraceful are themselves greater; and the works of those things, the
					vices and virtues of which are greater, will also be greater, since between
					causes and first principles compared with results there is the same relation as
					between results compared with causes and first principles. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Things, superiority in which is more desirable or
					nobler, are to be preferred; for instance, sharpness of sight is preferable to
					keenness of smell for sight is better than smell. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1364b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>And loving one's friends more than money is nobler,
					whence it follows that love of friends is nobler than love of money. And, on the
					other hand, the better and nobler things are, the better and nobler will be
					their superiority; and similarly, those things, the desire for which is nobler
					and better, are themselves nobler and better, <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>for greater longings are directed towards greater objects. For the same
					reason, the better and nobler the object, the better and nobler are the desires.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And when the sciences are nobler and more
					dignified, the nobler and more dignified are their subjects; for as is the
					science, so is the truth which is its object, and each science prescribes that
					which properly belongs to it; and, by analogy, the nobler and more dignified the
					objects of a science, the nobler and more dignified is the science itself, for
					the same reasons. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>And that which men of
					practical wisdom, either all, or more, or the best of them, would judge, or have
					judged, to be a greater good, must necessarily be such, either absolutely or in
					so far as they have judged as men of practical wisdom. The same may be said in
					regard to everything else; for the nature, quantity, and quality of things are
					such as would be defined by science and practical wisdom. But our statement only
					applies to goods; for we defined that as good which everything, if possessed of
					practical wisdom, would choose; hence it is evident that that is a greater good
					to which practical wisdom assigns the superiority. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>So also are those things which better men<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>possess, either absolutely, or in so far as they are better; for instance
					courage is better than strength. And what the better man would choose, either
					absolutely or in so far as he is better; thus, it is better to suffer wrong than
					to commit it, for that is what the juster man would choose. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>And that which is more agreeable rather than that
					which is less so; for all things pursue pleasure and desire it for its own sake;
					and it is by these conditions that the good and the end have been defined. And
					that is more agreeable which is less subject to pain and is agreeable for a
					longer time. <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And that which is nobler than
					that which is less noble; for the noble is that which is either agreeable or
					desirable in itself. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And all things which we
					have a greater desire to be instrumental in procuring for ourselves or for our
					friends are greater goods, and those as to which our desire is least are greater
					evils. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And things that last longer are
					preferable to those that are of shorter duration, and those that are safer to
					those that are less so; for time increases the use of the first and the wish
					that of the second; for whenever we wish, we can make greater use of things that
					are safe.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/> And things in all cases follow the relations
					between coordinates and similar inflections; for instance, if
					&ldquo;courageously&rdquo; is nobler than and preferable to
					&ldquo;temperately,&rdquo; then &ldquo;courage&rdquo; is
					preferable to &ldquo;temperance,&rdquo; and it is better to be
					&ldquo;courageous&rdquo; than &ldquo;temperate.&rdquo;
					<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>And that which is chosen by all is better
					than that which is not; and that which the majority choose than that which the
					minority choose; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1365a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for, as we
					have said, the good is that which all desire, and consequently a good is
					greater, the more it is desired. The same applies to goods which are recognized
					as greater by opponents or enemies, by judges, or by those whom they select; for
					in the one case it would be, so to say, the verdict of all mankind, in the other
					that of those who are acknowledged authorities and experts. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>And sometimes a good is greater in which all
					participate, for it is a disgrace not to participate in it; sometimes when none
					or only a few participate in it, for it is scarcer. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>And things which are more praiseworthy, since they are nobler. And
					in the same way things which are more highly honored,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Things of which the prices are greater, price

					choose the former even if it should pass unnoticed, whereas one would not choose
					to confer a benefit, if it were likely to remain unknown. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>Those things also are to be preferred, which men
					would rather possess in reality than in appearance, because they are nearer the

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These are
					nearly all the topics from which arguments<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>may be drawn
					in persuading and dissuading; but the most important and effective of all the
					means of persuasion and good counsel is to know all the forms of government and
					to distinguish the manners and customs, institutions, and interests of each;
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>for all men are guided by considerations of
					expediency, and that which preserves the State is expedient. Further, the
					declaration of the authority is authoritative,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The pronouncements of the supreme authority are themselves authoritative as
						laying down laws and regulations for the citizens.</note> and the different
					kinds of authority are distinguished according to forms of government; in fact,
					there are as many authorities as there are forms of government.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now, there are four kinds of government,
					democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy, so that the supreme and deciding
					authority is always a part or the whole of these. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Democracy is a form of government in which the offices are
					distributed by the people among themselves by lot; in an oligarchy, by those who
					possess a certain property-qualification; in an aristocracy, by those who
					possess an educational qualification, meaning an education that is laid down by
					the law. In fact, in an aristocracy, power and office are in the hands of those
					who have remained faithful to what the law prescribes, and who must of necessity
					appear best, whence this form of government has taken its name. In a monarchy,
					as its name indicates, one man alone is supreme over all; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1366a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>if it is subject to certain regulations,
					it is called a kingdom; if it is unlimited, a tyranny.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Nor should the end of each form of government be
					neglected, for men choose the things which have reference to the end. Now, the
					end of democracy is liberty, of oligarchy wealth, of aristocracy things relating
					to education and what the law prescribes, . . . ,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The &ldquo;end&rdquo; of monarchy is wanting
						here.</note> of tyranny self-protection. It is clear then that we must
					distinguish the manners and customs, institutions, and interests of each form of
					government, since it is in reference to this that men make their choice.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But as proofs are established not only by
					demonstrative, but also by ethical argument&mdash;since we have confidence
					in an orator who exhibits certain qualities, such as goodness, goodwill, or
					both&mdash;it follows that we ought to be acquainted with the characters of
					each form of government; for, in reference to each, the character most likely to
					persuade must be that which is characteristic of it. These characters will be
					understood by the same means; for characters reveal themselves in accordance
					with moral purpose, and moral purpose has reference to the end.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>We have now stated what things, whether future
					or present, should be the aim of those who recommend a certain course; from what
					topics they should derive their proofs of expediency; further, the ways and
					means of being well equipped for dealing with the characters and institutions<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>of each form of government, so far as was within the
					scope of the present occasion; for the subject has been discussed in detail in

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>We will next
					speak of virtue and vice, of the noble and the disgraceful, since they
					constitute the aim of one who praises and of one who blames; for, when speaking
					of these, we shall incidentally bring to light the means of making us appear of
					such and such a character, which, as we have said, is a second method of proof;
					for it is by the same means that we shall be able to inspire confidence in
					ourselves or others in regard to virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But
					since it happens that men, seriously or not, often praise not only a man or a
					god but even inanimate things or any ordinary animal, we ought in the same way
					to make ourselves familiar with the propositions relating to these subjects. Let
					us, then, discuss these matters also, so far as may serve for illustration.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The noble, then, is that which, being desirable
					in itself is at the same time worthy of praise, or which, being good, is
					pleasant because it is good. If this is the noble, then virtue must of necessity
					be noble, for, being good, it is worthy of praise. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Virtue, it would seem, is a faculty of providing and preserving good
					things, a faculty productive of many and great benefits, in fact, of all things
					in all cases.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;a faculty of
						doing many and great benefits to all men in all cases&rdquo;
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1366b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The components of virtue are justice, courage, self-control,
					magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, practical and speculative
					wisdom. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The greatest virtues are necessarily
					those which are most useful to others, if virtue is the faculty of conferring
					benefits. For this reason justice and courage are the most esteemed, the latter
					being useful to others in war, the former in peace as well. Next is liberality,
					for the liberal spend freely and do not dispute the possession of wealth, which
					is the chief object of other men's desire. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Justice is a virtue which assigns to each man his due in conformity with the
					law; injustice claims what belongs to others, in opposition to the law.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Courage makes men perform noble acts in the
					midst of dangers according to the dictates of the law and in submission to it;
					the contrary is cowardice. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Self-control is a
					virtue which disposes men in regard to the pleasures of the body as the law
					prescribes; the contrary is licentiousness. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Liberality does good in many matters; the contrary is avarice. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Magnanimity is a virtue productive of great benefits;
					the contrary is little-mindedness. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Magnificence is a virtue which produces greatness in matters of expenditure;
					the contraries are little-mindedness<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and meanness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Practical wisdom is a virtue of reason,
					which enables men to come to a wise decision in regard to good and evil things,
					which have been mentioned as connected with happiness.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">ei)s eu)daimoni/an</foreign>
						with <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/esqai</foreign>, &ldquo;come to a wise
						decision conducive to their happiness.&rdquo;</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Concerning virtue and vice in general and their
					separate parts, enough has been said for the moment. To discern the rest<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e. the causes and results of virtue
						&lpar;Cope&rpar;; or, the noble and the disgraceful
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> presents no difficulty; for it is evident
					that whatever produces virtue, as it tends to it, must be noble, and so also
					must be what comes from virtue; for such are its signs and works. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>But since the signs of virtue and such things as are
					the works and sufferings of a good man are noble, it necessarily follows that
					all the works and signs of courage and all courageous acts are also noble. The
					same may be said of just things and of just actions; &lpar;but not of what
					one suffers justly; for in this alone amongst the virtues that which is justly
					done is not always noble, and a just punishment is more disgraceful than an
					unjust punishment&rpar;. The same applies equally to the other virtues.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Those things of which the reward is honor
					are noble; also those which are done for honor rather than money. Also, those
					desirable things which a man does not do for his own sake; <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>things which are absolutely good, which a man has
					done for the sake of his country, while neglecting his own interests; things
					which are naturally good; and not such as are good for the individual, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1367a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>since such things are inspired
					by selfish motives.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>And those things are noble which it is possible
					for a man to possess after death rather than during his lifetime, for the latter
					involve more selfishness; <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>all acts done for
					the sake of others, for they are more disinterested; the successes gained, not
					for oneself but for others; and for one's benefactors, for that is justice; in a
					word, all acts of kinds, for they are disinterested. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And the contrary of those things of which we are ashamed; for we are
					ashamed of what is disgraceful, in words, acts, or intention; as, for instance,
					when Alcaeus said: <quote>
						<lg type="lyric">
							<l>I would fain say something, but shame holds me back,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Frag. 55
								&lpar;<title>P.L.G.</title> 3.&rpar;.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> Sappho rejoined: <quote>

									&lpar;<title>P.L.G.</title> 3.&rpar;.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Those things also are noble for which men
					anxiously strive, but without fear; for men are thus affected about goods which
					lead to good repute. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Virtues and actions are
					nobler, when they proceed from those who are naturally worthier, for instance,
					from a man rather than from a woman. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>It is the
					same with those which are the cause of enjoyment to others rather than to
					ourselves; this is why justice and that which is just are noble.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/><milestone unit="section" n="24"/>To take vengeance on one's enemies
					is nobler than to come to terms with them; for to retaliate is just, and that
					which is just is noble; and further, a courageous man ought not to allow himself
					to be beaten. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Victory and honor also are
					noble; for both are desirable even when they are fruitless, and are
					manifestations of superior virtue. And things worthy of remembrance, which are
					the more honorable the longer their memory lasts; those which follow us after
					death; those which are accompanied by honor; and those which are out of the
					common. Those which are only possessed by a single individual, because they are
					more worthy of remembrance. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And possessions
					which bring no profit; for they are more gentlemanly. Customs that are peculiar
					to individual peoples and all the tokens of what is esteemed among them are
					noble; for instance, in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> it
					is noble to wear one's hair long, for it is the mark of a gentleman, the
					performance of any servile task being difficult for one whose hair is long.
					<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>And not carrying on any vulgar profession
					is noble, for a gentleman does not live in dependence on others.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/>We must also assume, for the purpose of praise
					or blame, that qualities which closely resemble the real qualities are identical
					with them; for instance, that the cautious man is cold and designing, the
					simpleton good-natured, and the emotionless gentle. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>And in each case we must adopt a term from qualities closely
					connected, always in the more favorable sense; for instance, the choleric and
					passionate man may be spoken of as frank and open, the arrogant as magnificent
					and dignified; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1367b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>those in excess
					as possessing the corresponding virtue,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Those
						whose qualities are extreme may be described as possessing the virtues of
						which these are the excess.</note> the fool-hardy as courageous, the
					recklessly extravagant as liberal. For most people will think so, and at the
					same time a fallacious argument may be drawn from the motive; for if a man risks
					his life when there is no necessity, much more will he be thought likely to do
					so when it is honorable; and if he is lavish to all comers, the more so will he
					be to his friends; for the height of virtue is to do good to all. <milestone unit="section" n="30"/>We ought also to consider in whose presence we
					praise, for, as <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> said, it is not difficult to praise Athenians among
					Athenians.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Menex. 235d">Plat. Menex. 235d</bibl>.</note> We ought also to speak of what is
					esteemed among the particular audience, Scythians, Lacedaemonians, or
					philosophers,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Thus, the Scythians may be
						assumed to be brave and great hunters; the Spartans hardy, courageous, and
						brief in speech; the Athenians fond of literature&mdash;and they should
						be praised accordingly.</note> as actually existing there. And, generally
					speaking, that which is esteemed should be classed as noble, since there seems
					to be a close resemblance between the two.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That is, <foreign lang="greek">to\ ti/mion</foreign> looks as if it were
						really <foreign lang="greek">kalo/n</foreign>, and should be spoken as if it
						were so.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>Again, all such actions as are in accord with
					what is fitting are noble; if, for instance, they are worthy of a man's
					ancestors or of his own previous achievements; for to obtain additional honor is
					noble and conduces to happiness. Also, if the tendency of what is done is better
					and nobler, and goes beyond what is to be expected; for instance, if a man is
					moderate in good fortune and stout-hearted in adversity, or if, when he becomes
					greater, he is better and more forgiving. Such was the phrase of Iphicrates,
					&ldquo;Look what I started from !&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cp. 7.32 above.</note> and of the Olympian victor: <quote>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/>Since praise is founded on actions, and acting
					according to moral purpose is characteristic of the worthy man, we must endeavor
					to show that a man is acting in that manner, and it is useful that it should
					appear that he has done so on several occasions. For this reason also one must
					assume that accidents and strokes of good fortune are due to moral purpose; for
					if a number of similar examples can be adduced, they will be thought to be signs
					of virtue and moral purpose.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="33"/>Now praise is language that sets forth
					greatness of virtue; hence it is necessary to show that a man's actions are
					virtuous. But encomium deals with achievements&mdash;all attendant
					circumstances, such as noble birth and education, merely conduce to persuasion;
					for it is probable that virtuous parents will have virtuous offspring and that a
					man will turn out as he has been brought up. Hence we pronounce an encomium upon
					those who have achieved something. Achievements, in fact, are signs of moral
					habit; for we should praise even a man who had not achieved anything, if we felt
					confident that he was likely to do so. <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>Blessing and felicitation are identical with each other, but are not the same
					as praise and encomium, which, as virtue is contained in happiness, are
					contained in felicitation.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="35"/>Praise and counsels have a common aspect; for
					what you might suggest in counseling becomes encomium by a change in the phrase.
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1368a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="36"/>Accordingly, when we know what we ought to do and the qualities we
					ought to possess, we ought to make a change in the phrase and turn it, employing
					this knowledge as a suggestion. For instance, the statement that &ldquo;one
					ought not to pride oneself on goods which are due to fortune, but on those which
					are due to oneself alone,&rdquo; when expressed in this way, has the force
					of a suggestion; but expressed thus, &ldquo;he was proud, not of goods which
					were due to fortune, but of those which were due to himself alone,&rdquo; it
					becomes praise. Accordingly, if you desire to praise, look what you would
					suggest; if you desire to suggest, look what you would praise. <milestone unit="section" n="37"/>The form of the expression will necessarily be
					opposite, when the prohibitive has been changed into the non-prohibitive.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In the first sentence, the statement is
						imperative, there is a prohibition; in the second, it is a simple
						affirmative, implying praise. In the one case there is forbidding, in the
						other not-forbidding, which are opposites.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="38"/>We must also employ many of the means of
					amplification; for instance, if a man has done anything alone, or first, or with
					a few, or has been chiefly responsible for it; all these circumstances render an
					action noble. Similarly, topics derived from times and seasons, that is to say,
					if our expectation is surpassed. Also, if a man has often been successful in the
					same thing; for this is of importance and would appear to be due to the man
					himself, and not to be the result of chance. And if it is for his sake that
					distinctions which are an encouragement or honor have been invented and
					established; and if he was the first on whom an encomium was pronounced, as
					Hippolochus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Nothing more is known of
						him.</note> or to whom a statue was set up in the market-place, as to Harmodius
					and Aristogiton.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Who slew Hipparchus, tyrant
						of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> And similarly
					in opposite cases. If he does not furnish you with enough material in
					himself,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>you must compare him with others, as
					Isocrates used to do, because of his inexperience<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">a)sunh/qeian</foreign>. He had
						no legal practice, which would have shown the irrelevancy of comparisons in
						a law court, whereas in epideictic speeches they are useful. <foreign lang="greek">sunh/qeian</foreign> gives exactly the opposite sense, and
						must refer to his having written speeches for others to deliver in the
						courts.</note> of forensic speaking. And you must compare him with
					illustrious personages, for it affords ground for amplification and is noble, if
					he can be proved better than men of worth. <milestone unit="section" n="39"/>Amplification is with good reason ranked as one of the forms of praise, since
					it consists in superiority, and superiority is one of the things that are noble.
					That is why, if you cannot compare him with illustrious personages, you must
					compare him with ordinary persons, since superiority is thought to indicate
					virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="40"/>Speaking generally, of the topics
					common to all rhetorical arguments, amplification is most suitable for
					epideictic speakers, whose subject is actions which are not disputed, so that
					all that remains to be done is to attribute beauty and importance to them.
					Examples are most suitable for deliberative speakers, for it is by examination
					of the past that we divine and judge the future. Enthymemes are most suitable
					for forensic speakers, because the past, by reason of its obscurity, above all
					lends itself to the investigation of causes and to demonstrative proof.
					<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>Such are nearly all the materials of
					praise or blame, the things which those who praise or blame should keep in view,
					and the sources of encomia and invective; for when these are known their
					contraries are obvious, since blame is derived from the contrary things. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1368b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>We have next
					to speak of the number and quality of the propositions of which those syllogisms
					are constructed which have for their object accusation and defence. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Three things have to be considered; first, the nature
					and the number of the motives which lead men to act unjustly; secondly, what is
					the state of mind of those who so act; thirdly, the character and dispositions
					of those who are exposed to injustice. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>We will
					discuss these questions in order, after we have first defined acting unjustly.</p>
				<p>Let injustice, then, be defined as voluntarily causing injury contrary to the
					law. Now, the law is particular or general. By particular, I mean the written
					law in accordance with which a state is administered; by general, the unwritten
					regulations which appear to be universally recognized. Men act voluntarily when
					they know what they do, and do not act under compulsion. What is done
					voluntarily is not always done with premeditation; but what is done with
					premeditation is always known to the agent, for no one is ignorant of what he
					does with a purpose.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> &lpar;premeditation, deliberate or moral
						choice&rpar; is always voluntary, but all voluntary action is not
						premeditated; we sometimes act on the spur of the moment. Choice is a
						voluntary act, the result of deliberate counsel, including the use of reason
						and knowledge. In <bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1113a">Aristot. Nic. Eth.
							11</bibl> Aristotle defines <foreign lang="greek">proai/resis</foreign> as &ldquo;a deliberate appetition of
						&lpar;longing for, <foreign lang="greek">o)/recis</foreign>&rpar;
						things in our power,&rdquo; as to which we should necessarily be
						well-informed.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The motives which lead men to do injury and
					commit wrong actions are depravity and incontinence. For if men have one or more
					vices, it is in that which makes him vicious that he shows himself unjust; for
					example, the illiberal in regard to money, the licentious in regard to bodily
					pleasures, the effeminate in regard to what makes for ease,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;in the matter of ease,&rdquo; taking
						<foreign lang="greek">ta\ r(a/quma</foreign> as = <foreign lang="greek">r(aqumi/a</foreign>.</note> the coward in regard to dangers, for fright
					makes him desert his comrades in peril;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>the ambitious in
					his desire for honor, the irascible owing to anger, one who is eager to conquer
					in his desire for victory, the rancorous in his desire for vengeance; the
					foolish man from having mistaken ideas of right and wrong, the shameless from
					his contempt for the opinion of others. Similarly, each of the rest of mankind
					is unjust in regard to his special weakness.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This will be perfectly clear, partly from what
					has already been said about the virtues, and partly from what will be said about
					the emotions. It remains to state the motives and character of those who do
					wrong and of those who suffer from it. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>First,
					then, let us decide what those who set about doing wrong long for or avoid; for
					it is evident that the accuser must examine the number and nature of the motives
					which are to be found in his opponent; the defendant, which of them are not to
					be found in him. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now, all human actions are
					either the result of man's efforts or not. Of the latter some are due to chance,
					others to necessity. Of those due to necessity, some are to be attributed to
					compulsion, others to nature, so that the things which men do not do of
					themselves are all the result of chance, nature, or compulsion. As for those
					which they do of themselves and of which they are the cause, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1369a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>some are the result of habit, others of
					longing, and of the latter some are due to rational, others to irrational
					longing. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now wish is a
					&lsqb;rational&rsqb; longing for good, for no one wishes for anything
					unless he thinks it is good; irrational longings are anger and desire. Thus all
					the actions of men must necessarily be referred to seven causes: chance, nature,
					compulsion, habit, reason, anger, and desire.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But it is superfluous to establish further
					distinctions of men's acts based upon age, moral habits, or anything else. For
					if the young happen to be<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In the cases of the
						young, the poor, and the rich, their youth etc. are only
						&ldquo;accidents,&rdquo; accidental not real causes. Aristotle
						defines <foreign lang="greek">to\ sumbebhko/s</foreign> &lpar;<bibl n="Aristot. Met. 4.30">Aristot. Met. 4.30</bibl>&rpar; as
						&ldquo;that which is inherent in something, and may be predicated of it
						as true, but neither necessarily, nor in most cases; for instance, if a man,
						when digging a hole for a plant, finds a treasure.&rdquo; The color of a
						man's eyes is an &ldquo;inseparable&rdquo; accident, the fact that a
						man is a lawyer is a &ldquo;separabIe&rdquo; accident.</note>
					irascible, or passionately desire anything, it is not because of their youth
					that they act accordingly, but because of anger and desire. Nor is it because of
					wealth or poverty; but the poor happen to desire wealth because of their lack of
					it, and the rich desire unnecessary pleasures because they are able to procure
					them. Yet in their case too it will not be wealth or poverty, but desire, that
					will be the mainspring of their action. Similarly, the just and the unjust, and
					all the others who are said to act in accordance with their moral habits, will
					act from the same causes, either from reason or emotion, but some from good
					characters and emotions, and others from the opposite. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Not but that it does happen<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that such and
					such moral habits are followed by such and such consequences; for it may be that
					from the outset the fact of being temperate produces in the temperate man good
					opinions and desires in the matter of pleasant things, in the intemperate man
					the contrary. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Therefore we must leave these
					distinctions on one side, but we must examine what are the usual consequences of
					certain conditions. For, if a man is fair or dark, tall or short, there is no
					rule that any such consequences should follow, but if he is young or old, just
					or unjust, it does make a difference. In a word, it will be necessary to take
					account of all the circumstances that make men's characters different; for
					instance, if a man fancies himself rich or poor, fortunate or unfortunate, it
					will make a difference. We will, however, discuss this later<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 2.12-18.</note>; let us now speak of what remains to be
					said here.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Things which are the result of chance are all
					those of which the cause is indefinite, those which happen without any end in
					view, and that neither always, nor generally, nor regularly. The definition of
					chance will make this clear. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Things which are
					the result of nature are all those of which the cause is in themselves and
					regular; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1369b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for they turn out
					always, or generally, in the same way. As for those which happen contrary to
					nature there is no need to investigate minutely whether their occurrence is due
					to a certain force of nature or some other cause <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>&lpar;it would seem, however, that such cases also are due to
					chance&rpar;. Those things are the result of compulsion which are done by
					the agents themselves in opposition to their desire or calculation. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Things are the result of habit, when they are done
					because they have often been done. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Things are
					the result of calculation which are done because, of the goods already
					mentioned, they appear to be expedient either as an end or means to an end,
					provided they are done by reason of their being expedient; for even the
					intemperate do certain things that are expedient, for the sake, not of
					expediency, but of pleasure. Passion and anger are the causes of acts of
					revenge. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>But there is a difference between
					revenge and punishment; the latter is inflicted in the interest of the sufferer,
					the former in the interest of him who inflicts it, that he may obtain
					satisfaction. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>We will define anger when we
					come to speak of the emotions.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book
						2.2.</note> Desire is the cause of things being done that are apparently
					pleasant. The things which are familiar and to which we have become accustomed
					are among pleasant things; for men do with pleasure many things which are not
					naturally pleasant, when they have become accustomed to them.</p>
				<p>In short, all things that men do of themselves either are, or seem,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>good or pleasant; and since men do voluntarily what they
					do of themselves, and involuntarily what they do not, it follows that all that
					men do voluntarily will be either that which is or seems good, or that which is
					or seems pleasant. For I reckon among good things the removal of that which is
					evil or seems evil, or the exchange of a greater evil for a less, because these
					two things are in a way desirable; in like manner, I reckon among pleasant
					things the removal of that which is or appears painful, and the exchange of a
					greater pain for a less. We must therefore make ourselves acquainted with the
					number and quality of expedient and pleasant things. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>We have already spoken of the expedient when discussing deliberative
					rhetoric<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cf. Book 1.6 above.</note>; let
					us now speak of the pleasant. And we must regard our definitions as sufficient
					in each case, provided they are neither obscure nor too precise.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let it be
					assumed by us that pleasure is a certain movement of the soul, a sudden and
					perceptible settling down into its natural state, and pain the opposite.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>If such is the nature of pleasure, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1370a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>it is evident that that which
					produces the disposition we have just mentioned is pleasant, and that that which
					destroys it or produces the contrary settling down is painful. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Necessarily, therefore, it must be generally pleasant
					to enter into a normal state &lpar;especially when what is done in
					accordance with that state has come into its own again&rpar;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The true nature of the &ldquo;normal
						state&rdquo; was lost during the period of disturbance and
						unsettlement.</note>; and the same with habits. For that which has become
					habitual becomes as it were natural; in fact, habit is something like nature,
					for the distance between &ldquo;often&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;always&rdquo; is not great, and nature belongs to the idea of
					&ldquo;always,&rdquo; habit to that of &ldquo;often.&rdquo;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>That which is not compulsory is also
					pleasant, for compulsion is contrary to nature. That is why what is necessary is
					painful, and it was rightly said, <quote>
						<lg type="eleg">
							<l>For every act of necessity is disagreeable.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">From Evenus of <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName> &lpar;Frag. 8, <title>P.L.G.</title>

						</lg>
					</quote> Application, study, and intense effort are also painful, for these
					involve necessity and compulsion, if they have not become habitual; for then

						&lpar;bodily&rpar;.</note> and sleep are among pleasant things,
					because none of these is in any way compulsory. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Everything of which we have in us the desire is pleasant, for desire is a
					longing for the pleasant.</p>
				<p>Now, of desires some are irrational, others rational. I call irrational all those
					that are not the result of any<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>assumption.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">There is no consideration or
						&ldquo;definite theory&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb, Welldon&rpar; of
						the results that may follow. The desires arise without anything of the kind;
						they simply come.</note> Such are all those which are called natural; for

					desire of food, thirst, hunger, the desire of such and such food in particular;
					the desires connected with taste, sexual pleasures, in a word, with touch,
					smell, hearing, and sight. I call those desires rational which are due to our
					being convinced; for there are many things which we desire to see or acquire
					when we have heard them spoken of and are convinced that they are pleasant.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And if pleasure consists in the sensation of a
					certain emotion, and imagination is a weakened sensation, then both the man who
					remembers and the man who hopes will be attended by an imagination of what he
					remembers or hopes.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The passage <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\ d' e)sti\ . . . ai)/sqhsis</foreign> has been

						conclusion then drawn is that memory and hope are accompanied by imagination
						of what is remembered or hoped. To this it is objected that what Aristotle
						really wants to prove is that memory and hope are a cause of pleasure.
						&lpar;2&rpar; With a comma at <foreign lang="greek">e)lpi/zei</foreign> &lpar;Cope, Victorius&rpar;. The steps in the
						argument will then be: if pleasure is the sensation of a certain emotion; if
						imagination is a weakened &lpar;faded&rpar; sensation; if one who
						remembers or hopes is attended by an imagination of what he remembers or
						hopes; then, this being so, pleasure will attend one who remembers or hopes,
						since there is sensation, and pleasure is sensation and a kind of movement
						&lpar;sect. 1&rpar;. <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>, the
						faculty of forming mental images &lpar;variously translated
						&ldquo;imagination,&rdquo; &ldquo;mental impression,&rdquo;
						&ldquo;fantasy&rdquo;&rpar; is defined by Aristotle
						&lpar;<bibl n="Aristot. de An. 3.3.11">Aristot. De Anima
							3.3.11</bibl>&rpar; as a <emph>kind of movement</emph>, which cannot
						arise apart from sensation, and the movement produced must resemble the
						sensation which produced it. But <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>
						is more than this; it is not merely a faculty of sense, but occupies a place
						midway between sense and intellect; while imagination has need of the
						senses, the intellect has need of imagination. If <foreign lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign> is referred to an earlier perception of which the
						sense image is a copy, this is memory. Imagination carries the sense images
						&lpar; <foreign lang="greek">fanta/smata</foreign>&rpar; to the seat
						of memory. They are then transformed into memory &lpar;of something
						past&rpar; or hope &lpar;of something future&rpar; and are
						handed on to the intellect. &lpar;See Cope here, and R. D. Hicks in his
						edition of the <title>De Anima</title>.&rpar;</note> This being so, it
					is evident that there is pleasure both for those who remember and for those who
					hope, since there is sensation. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Therefore all
					pleasant things must either be present in sensation, or past in recollection, or
					future in hope; for one senses the present, recollects the past, and hopes for
					the future. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1370b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Therefore our recollections are pleasant, not only
					when they recall things which when present were agreeable, but also some things

						<lg type="iamb">

						</lg>
					</quote> This is why what we only see at intervals, whether men or things, is
					pleasant; for there is a change from the present, and at the same time it is
					rare. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>And learning and admiring are as a rule
					pleasant; for admiring implies the desire to learn, so that what causes
					admiration is to be desired, and learning implies a return to the normal.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">True knowledge or philosophy, which is the
						result of learning, is the highest condition of the intellect, its normal or
						settled state. Consequently, a return to this is pleasure, which is defined
						&lpar;11.1&rpar; as a settling down of the soul into its natural
						state after a period of disturbance.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>It is pleasant to bestow and to receive
					benefits; the latter is the attainment of what we desire, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1371b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>the former the possession of more than
					sufficient means,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;larger means
						than the person benefited.&rdquo;</note> both of them things that men
					desire. Since it is pleasant to do good, it must also be pleasant for men to set
					their neighbors on their feet, and to supply their deficiencies. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>And since learning and admiring are pleasant, all
					things connected with them must also be pleasant; for instance, a work of
					imitation, such as painting, sculpture, poetry, and all that is well imitated,
					even if the object of imitation is not pleasant; for it is not this that causes
					pleasure or the reverse, but the inference that the imitation and the object
					imitated are identical, so that the result is that we learn something.
					<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>The same may be said of sudden changes and
					narrow escapes from danger; for all these things excite wonder. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And since that which is in accordance with nature is
					pleasant, and things which are akin are akin in accordance with nature, all
					things akin and like are for the most part pleasant to each other, as man to
					man; horse to horse, youth to youth. This is the origin of the proverbs:
					<quote>The old have charms for the old, the young for the
						young,</quote><quote>Like to like,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.218">Hom. Od. 17.218</bibl>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And since things which are akin and like are
					always pleasant to one another, and every man in the highest degree feels this
					in regard to himself, it must needs be<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that all men are
					more or less selfish; for it is in himself above all that such conditions<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of likeness and kinship.</note> are to be
					found. Since, then, all men are selfish, it follows that all find pleasure in
					what is their own, such as their works and words. That is why men as a rule are
					fond of those who flatter and love them, of honor, and of children; for the last
					are their own work. It is also pleasant to supply what is wanting,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">11.22.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>for then it becomes our work. And since it is
					most pleasant to command, it is also pleasant to be regarded as wise<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Both practically and speculatively or
						philosophically.</note> for practical wisdom is commanding, and philosophy
					consists In the knowledge of many things that excite wonder. Further, since men
					are generally ambitious, it follows that it is also agreeable to find fault with
					our neighbors. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>And if a man thinks he excels
					in anything, he likes to devote his time to it; as Euripides says: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">

					<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>Similarly, since amusement, every kind of
					relaxation, and laughter are pleasant, ridiculous things&mdash;men, words,
					or deeds&mdash;must also be pleasant. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1372a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>The ridiculous has been discussed separately in the
					<title>Poetics</title>.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Only the

					pleasant; those that are painful will be obvious from the contraries of these.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such are the
					motives of injustice; let us now state the frame of mind of those who commit it,
					and who are the sufferers from it. Men do wrong when they think that it can be
					done and that it can be done by them; when they think that their action will
					either be undiscovered, or if discovered will remain unpunished; or if it is
					punished, that the punishment will be less than the profit to themselves or to
					those for whom they care. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As for the kind of
					things which seem possible or impossible, we will discuss them later,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 2.19.</note> for these topics are common
					to all kinds of rhetoric. Now men who commit wrong think they are most likely to
					be able to do so with impunity, if they are eloquent, business-like, experienced
					in judicial trials, if they have many friends, and if they are wealthy.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They think there is the greatest chance of
					their being able to do so, if they themselves belong to the above classes; if
					not, if they have friends, servants, or accomplices who do; for thanks to these
					qualities they are able to commit wrong and to escape discovery and punishment.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Similarly, if they are friends of those who
					are being wronged, or of the judges; for friends are not on their guard against
					being wronged and, besides, they prefer reconciliation<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>to
					taking proceedings; and judges favor those whom they are fond of, and either let
					them off altogether or inflict a small penalty.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Those are likely to remain undetected whose
					qualities are out of keeping with the charges, for instance, if a man wanting in
					physical strength were accused of assault and battery, or a poor and an ugly
					man<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Two different persons. If the second
						<foreign lang="greek">o(</foreign> be omitted, the reference is to
						one.</note> of adultery. Also, if the acts are done quite openly and in sight of
					all; for they are not guarded against, because no one would think them possible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Also, if they are so great and of such a
					nature that no one would even be likely to attempt them, for these also are not
					guarded against; for all guard against ordinary ailments and wrongs, but no one
					takes precautions against those ailments from which no one has ever yet
					suffered. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And those who have either no enemy at
					all or many; the former hope to escape notice because they are not watched, the
					latter do escape because they would not be thought likely to attack those who
					are on their guard and because they can defend themselves by the plea that they
					would never have attempted it. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And, those who
					have ways or places of concealment for stolen property, or abundant
					opportunities of disposing of it.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, a
						&ldquo;resourceful mind.&rdquo; </note> And those who, even if they
					do not remain undetected, can get the trial set aside or put off, or corrupt the
					judges. And those who, if a fine be imposed, can get payment in full set aside
					or put off for a long time, or those who, owing to poverty, have nothing to
					lose. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And in cases where the profit is certain,
					large, or immediate, while the punishment is small, uncertain, or remote. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1372b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>And where there can be no
					punishment equal to the advantages, as seems to be the case in a tyranny.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And when the unjust acts are real gains
					and the only punishment is disgrace; and when, on the contrary, the unjust acts
					tend to our credit, for instance, if one avenges father or mother, as was the
					case with Zeno,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Who Zeno was, and what the
						story, is unknown.</note> while the punishment only involves loss of money,
					exile, or something of the kind. For men do wrong from both these motives and in
					both these conditions of mind; but the persons are not the same, and their
					characters are exactly opposite.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Some do wrong
						for the sake of gain, others for the sake of praise; but the former
						sacrifice honor for self-interest, the latter self-interest for honor.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And those who have often been undetected or
					have escaped punishment; and those who have often been unsuccessful; for in such
					cases, as in actual warfare, there are always men ready to return to the fight.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>And all who hope for pleasure and profit
					at once, while the pain and the loss come later; such are the intemperate,
					intemperance being concerned with all things that men long for. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And when, on the contrary, the pain or the loss is
					immediate, while the pleasure and the profit are later and more lasting<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;More distant&rdquo;
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note>; for temperate and wiser men pursue such
					aims. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And those who may possibly be thought to
					have acted by chance or from necessity, from some natural impulse or from habit,
					in a word, to have committed an error rather than a crime. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And those who hope to obtain indulgence; and all
					those who are in need, which is of two kinds;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for men
					either need what is necessary, as the poor, or what is superfluous, as the
					wealthy. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And those who are highly esteemed or
					held in great contempt; the former will not be suspected, the latter no more
					than they are already.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>In such a frame of mind men attempt to do
					wrong, and the objects of their wrongdoing are men and circumstances of the
					following kind.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">With a comma or colon after
						<foreign lang="greek">ta\ toiau=ta</foreign>; without these render:
						&ldquo;those who possess such things as they . . .&rdquo;</note>
					Those who possess what they themselves lack, things either necessary, or
					superfluous, or enjoyable; <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>both those who are
					far off and those who are near, for in the one case the gain is speedy, in the
					other reprisals are slow, as if, for instance, Greeks were to plunder
					Carthaginians.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Who were too far off to
						retaliate.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>And those who never take precautions and are
					never on their guard, but are confiding; for all these are easily taken
					unawares. And those who are indolent; for it requires a man who takes pains to
					prosecute. And those who are bashful; for they are not likely to fight about
					money. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And those who have often been wronged
					but have not prosecuted, being, as the proverb says, &ldquo;Mysian
					booty.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A proverb meaning
						&ldquo;an easy prey.&rdquo; The Mysians were regarded as cowardly
						and unwarlike.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>And those who have never, or those who have
					often, suffered wrong; for both are off their guard, the one because they have
					never yet been attacked, the others because they do not expect to be attacked
					again. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>And those who have been slandered, or
					are easy to slander; for such men neither care to go to law, for fear of the
					judges, nor, if they do, can they convince them; to this class belong those who
					are exposed to hatred or envy. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1373a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>And those against whom the wrongdoer can
					pretend that either their ancestors, or themselves, or their friends, have
					either committed, or intended to commit, wrong either against himself, or his
					ancestors, or those for whom he has great regard; for, as the proverb says,
					&ldquo;evil-doing only needs an excuse.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And both enemies and friends; for it is easy to injure the latter,
					and pleasant to injure the former. And those who are friendless. And those who
					are unskilled in speech or action; for either they make no attempt to prosecute,
					or come to terms, or accomplish nothing. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And
					those to whom it is no advantage to waste time waiting for the verdict or
					damages, such as strangers or husbandmen; for they are ready to compromise on
					easy terms and to drop proceedings. <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>And those
					who have committed numerous wrongs, or such as those from which they themselves
					are suffering; for it seems almost an act of justice that a man should suffer a
					wrong such as he had been accustomed to make others suffer; if, for instance,
					one were to assault a man who was in the habit of outraging others.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ai)ki/a</foreign>
						&lpar;assault&rpar; was a less serious offence than <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> &lpar;wanton outrage&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>And those who have already injured us, or
					intended, or intend, or are about to do so; for in such a case vengeance is both
					pleasant and honorable, and seems to be almost an act of justice. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>And those whom we wrong<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> i.e. supplying <foreign lang="greek">a)dikoume/nois</foreign>, &ldquo;by whose being

					with our friends, or persons whom we admire or love, or our masters, in a word,
					those by whom our life is ruled. <milestone unit="section" n="29"/>And those in
					reference to whom there is a chance of obtaining merciful consideration.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In our relations with whom, almost = from whom.
						Another interpretation is: &ldquo;In reference to whom there is a chance

						&lpar;Welldon&rpar;.</note> And those against whom we have a

							<persName><surname>Dion</surname></persName> knew what he intended to
							do, and would be likely to strike first, if he did not anticipate

					we do not attack first, since it is no longer possible to deliberate; thus,
					Aenesidemus is said to have sent the prize in the game of cottabus to

					what he had intended to do himself. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>And those
					to whom, after having injured them, we shall be enabled to do many acts of

					Thessalian<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Tyrant of Pherae.</note> said
					one should sometimes commit injustice, in order to be able also to do justice
					often.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="32"/>Men are ready to commit wrongs which all or
					many are in the habit of committing, for they hope to be pardoned for their
					offences. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>They steal objects that are easy to

					can easily be changed in form or color or composition; <milestone unit="section" n="34"/>things for which there are many convenient hiding-places, such as
					those that are easy to carry or stow away in a corner; <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>those of which a thief already possesses a considerable number
					exactly similar or hard to distinguish. Or they commit wrongs which the victims
					are ashamed to disclose, such as outrages upon the women of their family, upon
					themselves, or upon their children. And all those wrongs in regard to which
					appeal to the law would create the appearance of litigiousness; such are wrongs
					which are unimportant or venial. These are nearly all the dispositions which
					induce men to commit wrong, the nature and motive of the wrongs, and the kind of
					persons who are the victims of wrong. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1373b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us now
					classify just and unjust actions generally, starting from what follows. Justice
					and injustice have been defined in reference to laws and persons in two ways.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now there are two kinds of laws, particular
					and general. By particular laws I mean those established by each people in
					reference to themselves, which again are divided into written and unwritten; by
					general laws I mean those based upon nature. In fact, there is a general idea of
					just and unjust in accordance with nature, as all men in a manner divine, even
					if there is neither communication nor agreement between them. This is what
					Antigone in Sophocles<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Soph. Ant. 456">Soph. Ant. 456</bibl>.</note> evidently means, when she declares that
					it is just, though forbidden, to bury Polynices, as being naturally just: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>For neither to-day nor yesterday, but from all eternity, these
								statutes live and no man knoweth whence they came.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> And as Empedocles says in regard to not killing that which has life,
					for this is not right for some and wrong for others, <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>But a universal precept, which extends without a break throughout the
								wide-ruling sky and the boundless earth.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> Alcidamas<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, pupil of Gorgias. The oration is
						not extant, but the scholiast supplies his words: <foreign lang="greek">e)leuqe/rous a)fh=ke pa/ntas qeo/s: ou)de/na dou=lon h( fu/sis

						Nature has made none a slave&rdquo;&rpar;. The Messenians had
						revolted from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>.</note>
					also speaks of this precept in his <title>Messeniacus</title>. . . . <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And in relation to persons, there is a twofold
					division of law; for what one ought to do or ought not to do is concerned<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>with the community generally, or one of its members.</p>
				<p>Therefore there are two kinds of just and unjust acts, since they can be
					committed against a definite individual or against the community; he who commits
					adultery or an assault is guilty of wrong against a definite individual, he who
					refuses to serve in the army of wrong against the State. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>All kinds of wrong acts having been thus
					distinguished, some of which affect the State, others one or several
					individuals, let us repeat the definition of being wronged,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">1.10.3.</note> and then go on to the rest. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Being wronged is to suffer injustice at the hands of
					one who voluntarily inflicts it, for it has been established that injustice is a
					voluntary act. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And since the man who suffers
					injustice necessarily sustains injury and that against his will, it is evident
					from what has been said in what the injuries consist; for things good and bad
					have already been distinguished in themselves,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.6.</note> and it has been said that voluntary acts are all such as
					are committed with knowledge of the case.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">1.10.3.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Hence it necessarily follows that all
					accusations concern the State or the individual, the accused having acted either
					ignorantly and against his will, or voluntarily and with knowledge, and in the
					latter case with malice aforethought or from passion. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>We will speak of anger when we come to treat of the passions,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 2.2.</note> and we have already
					stated<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.11, 12.</note> in what
					circumstances and with what dispositions men act with deliberate purpose.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But since a man, while admitting the fact, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1374a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>often denies the description
					of the charge or the point on which it turns&mdash;for instance, admits that
					he took something, but did not steal it; that he was the first to strike, but
					committed no outrage; that he had relations, but did not commit adultery, with a
					woman; or that he stole something but was not guilty of sacrilege, since the
					object in question was not consecrated; or that he trespassed, but not on public
					land; or that he held converse with the enemy, but was not guilty of
					treason&mdash;for this reason it will be necessary that a definition should
					be given of theft, outrage, or adultery, in order that, if we desire to prove
					that an offence has or has not been committed, we may be able to put the case in
					a true light. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>In all such instances the
					question at issue is to know whether the supposed offender is a wrongdoer and a
					worthless person, or not; for vice and wrongdoing consist in the moral purpose,
					and such terms as outrage and theft further indicate purpose; for if a man has
					struck, it does not in all cases follow that he has committed an outrage, but
					only if he has struck with a certain object, for instance, to bring disrepute
					upon the other or to please himself. Again, if a man has taken something by
					stealth, it is by no means certain that he has committed theft, but only if he
					has taken it to injure another<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Roemer reads,
						after Dittmeyer, <foreign lang="greek">ei) e)pi\ bla/bh| &lsqb;tou/tou
							a)f' ou(= e)/labe&rsqb; kai\</foreign> . . . from the old Latin
						translation</note> or to get something for himself. It is the same in all
					other cases as in these.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>We have said that there are two kinds of just
					and unjust actions &lpar;for some are written, but others are
					unwritten&rpar;,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and have spoken of those
					concerning which the laws are explicit; of those that are unwritten there are
					two kinds. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>One kind arises from an excess of
					virtue or vice, which is followed by praise or blame, honor or dishonor, and
					rewards; for instance, to be grateful to a benefactor, to render good for good,
					to help one's friends, and the like;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Laws are
						special and general, the former being written or unwritten. The unwritten
						law, again, is of two kinds: &lpar;1&rpar; general;
						&lpar;2&rpar; supplementary to the special written law. This general
						law &lpar;not the same as the general law &ldquo;based upon
						nature&rdquo; sect. 2&rpar; refers to acts which go beyond the legal
						standard of virtuous or vicious acts and are characterized by a remarkable
						degree &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">kaq' u(perbolh/n</foreign>&rpar;
						of virtue or the opposite. For these laws do not prescribe any special
						reward or punishment, but acts are praised or blamed, honored or dishonored,
						rewarded or punished, in accordance with the general feeling of
						mankind.</note> the other kind contains what is omitted in the special written
					law. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>For that which is equitable seems to be
					just, and equity is justice that goes beyond the written law. These omissions
					are sometimes involuntary, sometimes voluntary, on the part of the legislators;
					involuntary when it may have escaped their notice, voluntary when, being unable
					to define for all cases, they are obliged to make a universal statement, which
					is not applicable to all, but only to most, cases; and whenever it is difficult
					to give a definition owing to the infinite number of cases,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Inexperience&rdquo;
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> as, for instance, the size and kind of an iron
					instrument used in wounding; for life would not be long enough to reckon all the
					possibilities. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>If then no exact definition is
					possible, but legislation is necessary, one must have recourse to general terms;
					so that, if a man wearing a ring lifts up his hand to strike or actually
					strikes, according to the written law he is guilty of wrongdoing, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1374b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but in reality he is not; and
					this is a case for equity.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>If then our definition of equity is correct, it
					is easy to see what things and persons are equitable or not. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Actions which should be leniently treated are cases
					for equity; errors, wrong acts, and misfortunes, must not be thought deserving
					of the same penalty. Misfortunes are all such things as are unexpected and not
					vicious; errors are not unexpected, but are not vicious; wrong acts are such as
					might be expected and vicious, for acts committed through desire arise from
					vice. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>And it is equitable to pardon human
					weaknesses, and to look, not to the law but to the legislator; not to the letter
					of the law but to the intention of the legislator; not to the action itself, but
					to the moral purpose; <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>not to the part, but to
					the whole; not to what a man is now, but to what he has been, always or
					generally; to remember good rather than ill treatment, and benefits received
					rather than those conferred; to bear injury with patience; to be willing to
					appeal to the judgement of reason rather than to violence;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;To be willing that a judicial sentence should be
						nominal rather than real&rdquo;
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>to
					prefer<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>arbitration to the law court, for the
					arbitrator keeps equity in view, whereas the dicast looks only to the law, and
					the reason why arbitrators were appointed was that equity might prevail. Let
					this manner of defining equity suffice.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Wrong acts are
					greater in proportion to the injustice from which they spring. For this reason
					the most trifling are sometimes the greatest, as in the charge brought by
					Callistratus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">1.7.13. Callistratus and
						Melanopus were rival orators. Nothing is known of this particular
						charge.</note> against Melanopus that he had fraudulently kept back three
					consecrated half-obols from the temple-builders<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The magistrates who superintended the building and repairing
						operations.</note>; whereas, in the case of just actions, it is quite the
					contrary. The reason is that the greater potentially inheres in the less; for he
					who has stolen three consecrated half-obols will commit any wrong whatever.
					Wrong acts are judged greater sometimes in this way, sometimes by the extent of
					the injury done. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A wrong act is greater when
					there is no adequate punishment for it, but all are insufficient; when there is
					no remedy, because it is difficult if not impossible to repair it;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Understanding <foreign lang="greek">i)a=sqai</foreign>. Or &ldquo;to punish adequately,&rdquo;
						supplying <foreign lang="greek">ou(= mh\ i)/sh timwri/a</foreign>.</note>
					and when the person injured cannot obtain legal satisfaction, since it is
					irremediable; for justice and punishment are kinds of remedies. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And if the sufferer, having been wronged, has
					inflicted some terrible injury upon himself, the guilty person deserves greater
					punishment; wherefore Sophocles,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">An orator,
						not the tragic poet.</note> when pleading on behalf of Euctemon, who had
					committed suicide after the outrage he had suffered, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1375a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>declared that he would not assess the punishment at
					less than the victim had assessed it for himself. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A wrong act is also greater when it is unprecedented, or the first of
					its kind, or when committed with the aid of few accomplices<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Or has been seldom paralleled&rdquo;
						&lpar;Cope, but cp. 1.9.38&rpar;.</note>; and when it has been
					frequently committed; or when because of it new prohibitions and penalties have
					been sought and found: thus, at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>
					the citizen owing to whom a new law has been passed, is punished, as well as
					those on whose account a new prison had to be built. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The crime is greater, the more brutal it is; or when it has been for
					a long time premeditated; when the recital of it inspires terror rather than
					pity. Rhetorical tricks of the following kind may be used:&mdash;the
					statement that the accused person has swept away or violated several principles
					of justice, for example, oaths, pledges of friendship, plighted word, the
					sanctity of marriage; for this amounts to heaping crime upon crime. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Wrong acts are greater when committed in the very
					place where wrongdoers themselves are sentenced, as is done by false witnesses;
					for where would a man not commit wrong, if he does so in a court of justice?
					They are also greater when accompanied by the greatest disgrace; when committed
					against one who has been the guilty person's benefactor, for in that case, the
					wrongdoer is guilty of wrong twice over, in that he not only does wrong, but
					does not return good for good. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>So too, again,
					when a man offends against the unwritten laws of right, for there is greater
					merit in doing right without being compelled<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">And therefore the violation of them is more discreditable.</note>; now the
					written laws involve compulsion, the unwritten do not. Looked at in another way,
					wrongdoing is greater, if it violates the written laws; for a man who commits
					wrongs that alarm him<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">When he thinks of the
						punishment they may entail.</note> and involve punishment, will be ready to
					commit wrong<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for which he will not be punished. Let this
					suffice for the treatment of the greater or less degree of wrongdoing.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Following on
					what we have just spoken of, we have now briefly to run over what are called the

					we must argue that, when the dicast takes an oath to decide to the best of his
					judgement, he means that he will not abide rigorously by the written laws;
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>that equity is ever constant and never
					changes, even as the general law, which is based on nature, whereas the written

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Again, it is necessary to see whether the law
					is contradictory to another approved law or to itself; for instance, one law
					enacts that all contracts should be binding, while another forbids making
					contracts contrary to the law. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>If the meaning
					of the law is equivocal, we must turn it about, and see in which way it is to be

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>But if the written law favors our case, we
					must say that the oath of the dicast &ldquo;to decide to the best of his

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Witnesses are of two kinds, ancient and recent;

					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>One should appeal to such witnesses for the
					past, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1376a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but also to interpreters
					of oracles for the future; thus, for instance, Themistocles interpreted the
					wooden wall to mean that they must fight at sea.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hdt. 7.141">Hdt. 7.141</bibl>.</note> Further,

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>By recent witnesses I mean all well-known
					persons who have given a decision on any point, for their decisions are useful
					to those who are arguing about similar cases. Thus for instance, Eubulus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Opponent of Demosthenes. Chares was an Athenian
						commander, both naval and military. Nothing is known of Archibius. Plato is
						probably the comic poet.</note> when attacking Chares in the law courts,
					made use of what Plato said against Archibius, namely, &ldquo;that the open
					confession of wickedness had increased in the city.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And those who share the risk of the trial, if they
					are thought to be perjurers. Such witnesses only serve to establish whether an
					act has taken place or not, whether it is or is not the case; but if it is a
					question of the quality of the act, for instance, whether it is just or unjust,
					expedient or inexpedient, <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>they are not
					competent witnesses; but witnesses from a distance<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;witnesses wholly unconnected with the
						case.&rdquo;</note> are very trustworthy even in regard to this. But
					ancient witnesses are the most trustworthy of all, for they cannot be corrupted.
					In regard to the confirmation of evidence, when a man has no witnesses, he can
					say that the decision should be given in accordance with probabilities, and that
					this is the meaning of the oath &ldquo;according to the best of one's
					judgement&rdquo;; that probabilities cannot<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>be bribed
					to deceive, and that they cannot be convicted of bearing false witness. But if a
					man has witnesses and his adversary has none, he can say that probabilities
					incur no responsibility, and that there would have been no need of evidence, if
					an investigation according to the arguments were sufficient. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Evidence partly concerns ourselves, partly our
					adversary, as to the fact itself or moral character; so that it is evident that
					one never need lack useful evidence. For, if we have no evidence as to the fact
					itself, neither in confirmation of our own case nor against our opponent, it
					will always be possible to obtain some evidence as to character that will
					establish either our own respectability or the worthlessness of our opponent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>As for all the other questions relative to
					a witness, whether he is a friend, an enemy, or neutral, of good or bad or
					middling reputation, and for all other differences of this kind, we must have
					recourse to the same topics as those from which we derive our enthymemes.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/>As for contracts, argument may be used to the
					extent of magnifying or minimizing their importance, of proving that they do or
					do not deserve credit. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1376b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>If we
					have them on our side, we must try to prove them worthy of credit and
					authoritative; but if they are on the side of our opponent, we must do the
					opposite. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>In view of rendering them worthy or
					unworthy of credit, the method of procedure is exactly the same as in the case
					of witnesses; for contracts are trustworthy according to the character of their
					signatories or depositaries. When the existence of the contract is admitted, if
					it is in our favor, we must strengthen it by asserting that the contract is a
					law, special and partial; and it is not the contracts that make the law
					authoritative, but it is the laws that give force to legal contracts. And in a
					general sense the law itself is a kind of contract, so that whoever disobeys or
					subverts a contract, subverts the laws. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Further, most ordinary and all voluntary transactions are carried out
					according to contract; so that if you destroy the authority of contracts, the
					mutual intercourse of men is destroyed. All other arguments suitable to the
					occasion are easy to see. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>But if the contract
					is against us and in favor of our opponents, in the first place those arguments
					are suitable which we should oppose to the law if it were against us; that it
					would be strange if, while we consider ourselves entitled to refuse to obey
					ill-made laws, whose authors have erred, we should be obliged to consider
					ourselves always bound by contracts.<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Or, that
					the judge<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>is the dispenser of justice; so that it is not
					the contents of the contract that he has to consider, but what is juster.
					<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Further, that one cannot alter justice
					either by fraud or compulsion, for it is based upon nature, whereas contracts
					may be entered into under both conditions. In addition to this, we must examine
					whether the contract is contrary to any written law of our own or foreign
					countries, or to any general law, or to other previous or subsequent contracts.
					For either the latter are valid and the former not, or the former are right and
					the latter fraudulent; we may put it in whichever way it seems fit. We must also
					consider the question of expediency&mdash;whether the contract is in any way
					opposed to the interest of the judges. There are a number of other arguments of
					the same kind, which are equally easy to discern.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Torture is a kind of evidence, which appears
					trustworthy, because a sort of compulsion is attached to it. Nor is it difficult
					to see what may be said concerning it, and by what arguments, if it is in our
					favor, we can exaggerate its importance by asserting that it is the only true
					kind of evidence; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1377a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but if it is
					against us and in favor of our opponent, we can destroy its value by telling the
					truth about all kinds of torture generally; for those under compulsion are as
					likely to give false evidence as true, some being ready to endure everything
					rather than tell the truth, while others are equally ready to make false charges
					against others, in the hope of being sooner released from torture. It is also
					necessary to be able to quote actual examples of the kind with which the judges
					are acquainted. It may also be said that evidence given under torture is not
					true; for many thick-witted and thick-skinned persons, and those who are
					stout-hearted heroically hold out under sufferings, while the cowardly and
					cautious, before they see the sufferings before them, are bold enough; wherefore
					evidence from torture may be considered utterly untrustworthy.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>As to oaths<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In Attic legal procedure, the challenge &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">pro/klhsis</foreign>&rpar; to take an oath on the question at issue
					was one method of deciding it. One party offered the other something to
					swear by &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">di/dwsi
						o(/rkon</foreign>&rpar;, this being the real meaning of <foreign lang="greek">o(/rkos</foreign>, and the other party either accepted
					&lpar; <foreign lang="greek">lamba/nei, de/xetai</foreign>&rpar; it
					or refused it. Both parties, of their own accord, might propose to take the
					oath.</note> four divisions may be made; for either we tender an oath and
					accept it, or we do neither, or one without the other, and in the last case we
					either tender but do not accept, or accept but do not tender. Besides this, one
					may consider whether the oath has already been taken by us or by the other
					party. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>If you do not tender the oath to the
					adversary, it is because men readily perjure themselves, and because, after he
					has taken the oath, he will refuse to repay the money, while, if he does not
					take the oath, you think that the dicasts will condemn him; and also because the
					risk incurred in leaving the decision to the dicasts is preferable, for you have
					confidence in them, but not in your adversary.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">There are three reasons for not tendering the oath: &lpar;1&rpar;
						men are always ready to perjure themselves, if they are likely to benefit by
						doing so; &lpar;2&rpar; if your adversary takes the oath, he will
						decline to pay, trusting that he will be acquitted, whereas, if he is not on
						his oath, he will probably be condemned; &lpar;3&rpar; there is less
						risk in leaving the decision to the dicasts, who can be trusted.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>If you refuse to take the oath yourself, you
					may argue that the oath is only taken with a view to money; that, if you had
					been a scoundrel, you would have taken it at once, for it is better to be a
					scoundrel for something than for nothing; that, if you take it, you will win
					your case, if not, you will probably lose it; consequently, your refusal to take
					it is due to moral excellence, not to fear of committing perjury. And the
					apophthegm of Xenophanes<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Born at <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName>, he migrated to <placeName key="perseus,Elea">Elea</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, where he founded the Eleatic school of
						philosophy.</note> is apposite&mdash; that &ldquo;it is unfair<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for an impious man to challenge a pious one,&rdquo;
					for it is the same as a strong man challenging a weak one to hit or be hit.
					<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>If you accept the oath, you may say that
					you have confidence in yourself, but not in your opponent, and, reversing the
					apophthegm of Xenophanes, that the only fair way is that the impious man should
					tender the oath and the pious man take it; and that it would be monstrous to
					refuse to take the oath yourself, while demanding that the judges should take it
					before giving their verdict. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>But if you tender
					the oath, you may say that it is an act of piety to be willing to leave the
					matter to the gods; that your opponent has no need to look for other judges, for
					you allow him to make the decision himself; <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>and that it would be ridiculous that he should be unwilling to take an oath in
					cases where he demands that the dicasts should take one.</p>
				<p>Now, since we have shown how we must deal with each case individually, it is
					clear how we must deal with them when taken two and two; for instance, if we
					wish to take the oath but not to tender it, to tender it but not to take it, to
					accept and tender it, or to do neither the one nor the other. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1377b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>For such cases, and similarly the
					arguments, must be a combination of those already mentioned. And if we have
					already taken an oath which contradicts the present one, we may argue that it is
					not perjury; for whereas wrongdoing is voluntary, and perjury is wrongdoing,
					what is done in error or under compulsion is involuntary. <milestone unit="section" n="33"/>Here we must draw the conclusion that perjury
					consists in the intention, not in what is said.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The defence in such cases is: &lpar;1&rpar; that the
						previous oath was taken as a result of fraud or compulsion;
						&lpar;2&rpar; that you did not mean what you said.</note> But if the
					opponent has taken such an oath, we may say that one who does not abide by what
					be has sworn subverts everything, for this is the reason why the dicasts take an
					oath before applying the laws; and &lsqb;we may make this appeal&rsqb;:
					&ldquo;They demand that you abide by your oath as judges, while they
					themselves do not abide by theirs.&rdquo; Further, we should employ all
					means of amplification. Let this suffice for the inartificial proofs.</p>

				<lb ed="Bekker" n="16"/>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such then are
					the materials which we must employ in exhorting and dissuading, praising and
					blaming, accusing and defending, and such are the opinions and propositions that
					are useful to produce conviction in these circumstances; for they are the
					subject and source of enthymemes,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>which are specially
					suitable to each class &lpar;so to say&rpar; of speeches.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This is Cope's interpretation. Jebb renders:
						&ldquo;If we take each branch of Rhetoric by itself.&rdquo; The
						classes are of course the deliberative, forensic, and epideictic.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But since the object of Rhetoric is
					judgement&mdash;for judgements are pronounced in deliberative rhetoric and
					judicial proceedings are a judgement&mdash;it is not only necessary to
					consider how to make the speech itself demonstrative and convincing, but also
					that the speaker should show himself to be of a certain character and should
					know how to put the judge into a certain frame of mind. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For it makes a great difference with regard to
					producing conviction&mdash;especially in demonstrative, and, next to this,
					in forensic oratory&mdash;that the speaker should show himself to be
					possessed of certain qualities and that his hearers should think that he is
					disposed in a certain way towards them; and further, that they themselves should
					be disposed in a certain way towards him.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The
						instructions given for enthymematic or logical proof should suffice; but
						since the function of Rhetoric is to find the available means of persuasion
						and its end is a judgement; and since an appeal to the speaker's own
						character and to the passions of those who are to give the judgement is
						bound to carry great weight, the speaker must be provided with rules for
						ethical and &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; &lpar;emotional&rpar;
						proofs. In Book 1.5 Aristotle mentions appeals to the emotions with
						disapproval, but this does not apply to all such appeals, but only to those
						which are likely to bias the judges unfairly &lpar;e.g. stirring up
						envy, hatred, a desire for revenge&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In deliberative oratory, it is more useful that
					the orator should appear to be of a certain character, in forensic, that the
					hearer should be disposed in a certain way; for opinions vary, according as men
					love or hate, are wrathful or mild, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1378a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and things appear either altogether different, or different in
					degree; for when a man is favorably disposed towards one on whom he is passing
					judgement, he either thinks that the accused has committed no wrong at all or
					that his offence is trifling; but if he hates him, the reverse is the case. And
					if a man desires anything and has good hopes of getting it, if what is to come
					is pleasant, he thinks that it is sure to come to pass and will be good; but if
					a man is unemotional or not hopeful<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Opposed to
						<foreign lang="greek">eu)e/lpidi</foreign>. Others render &ldquo;in
						a bad humor.&rdquo;</note> it is quite the reverse.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For the orator to produce conviction three
					qualities are necessary; for, independently of demonstrations, the things which
					induce belief are three in number. These qualities are good sense, virtue, and
					goodwill; for speakers are wrong both in what they say and in the advice they
					give, because they lack either all three or one of them. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For either through want of sense they form incorrect
					opinions, or, if their opinions are correct, through viciousness they do not say
					what they think, or, if they are sensible and good,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)pieikh/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">spoudai=os</foreign> both = <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqo/s</foreign>.

					they lack goodwill; wherefore it may happen that they do not give the best
					advice, although they know what it is. These qualities are all that are
					necessary, so that the speaker who appears to possess all three will necessarily
					convince his hearers. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The means whereby he may
					appear sensible and good<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">See previous
						note.</note> must be inferred from the classification of the virtues;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.9.</note> for to make himself appear
					such he would employ the same means as he would in the case of others. We must
					now speak of goodwill and friendship in our discussion of the emotions.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The emotions are all those affections which

					must be divided under three heads; for instance, in regard to anger, the
					disposition of mind which makes men angry, the persons with whom they are
					usually angry, and the occasions which give rise to anger. For if we knew one or
					even two of these heads, but not all three, it would be impossible to arouse

					of propositions<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In Book 1 generally

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us then

					for a real or apparent slight,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Gomperz

						apparent&rdquo;; Jebb omits <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nhs</foreign>
						and translates <foreign lang="greek">fainome/nhn</foreign>
						&ldquo;apparent&rdquo;; Cope confines both to the meaning
						&ldquo;manifest.&rdquo;</note> affecting a man himself or one of his
					friends, when such a slight is undeserved. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>If

					generally&rpar;, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1378b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and
					because this individual has done, or was on the point of doing, something
					against him or one of his friends; and lastly, anger is always accompanied by a
					certain pleasure, due to the hope of revenge to come. For it is pleasant to
					think that one will obtain what one aims at; now, no one aims at what is
					obviously impossible of attainment by him, and the angry man aims at what is
					possible for himself. Wherefore it has been well said of anger, that <quote>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Slighting is an actualization of opinion in
					regard to something which appears valueless; for things which are really bad or
					good, or tend to become so, we consider worthy of attention, but those which are
					of no importance or trifling<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or,
						&ldquo;those in which this tendency does not exist, or is
						trifling.&rdquo;</note> we ignore. Now there are three kinds of slight:
					disdain, spitefulness, and insult. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For he who
					disdains, slights, since men disdain those things which they consider valueless
					and slight what is of no account. And the spiteful man appears to show disdain;
					for spitefulness consists in placing obstacles in the way of another's wishes,
					not in order that any advantage may accrue to him who spites, but to prevent any
					accruing to the other. Since then he does not act in this manner from
					self-interest, it is a slight;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>for it is evident that he
					has no idea that the other is likely to hurt him, for in that case he would be
					afraid of him instead of slighting him; nor that he will be of any use to him
					worth speaking of, for in that case his thought would be how to become his
					friend.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;how to make him his
						friend,&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">fi/los</foreign> being for <foreign lang="greek">fi/lon</foreign> by attraction.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Similarly, he who insults another also slights
					him; for insult<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In Attic law <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign> &lpar;insulting, degrading
						treatment&rpar; was a more serious offence than <foreign lang="greek">ai)ki/a</foreign> &lpar;bodily ill-treatment&rpar;. It was the
						subject of a State criminal prosecution &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">grafh/</foreign>&rpar;, <foreign lang="greek">ai)ki/a</foreign> of
						a private action &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">di/kh</foreign>&rpar;
						for damages. The penalty was assessed in court, and might even be death. It
						had to be proved that the defendant struck the first blow
						&lpar;2.24.9&rpar;. One of the best known instances is the action
						brought by Demosthenes against Midias for a personal outrage on himself,
						when <emph>choregus</emph> of his tribe and responsible for the equipment of
						a chorus for musical competitions at public festivals.</note> consists in
					causing injury or annoyance whereby the sufferer is disgraced, not to obtain any
					other advantage for oneself besides the performance of the act, but for one's
					own pleasure; for retaliation is not insult, but punishment. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The cause of the pleasure felt by those who insult is
					the idea that, in ill-treating others, they are more fully showing superiority.
					That is why the young and the wealthy are given to insults; for they think that,
					in committing them, they are showing their superiority. Dishonor is
					characteristic of insult; and one who dishonors another slights him; for that
					which is worthless has no value, either as good or evil. Hence Achilles in his
					wrath exclaims: <quote>

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Further, men are angry at slights from
					those by whom they think they have a right to expect to be well treated; such
					are those on whom they have conferred or are conferring benefits, either
					themselves, or some one else for them, or one of their friends; and all those
					whom they desire, or did desire, to benefit.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>It is now evident from these considerations what
					is the disposition of those who are angry, with whom they are angry, and for
					what reasons. Men are angry when they are pained, because one who is pained aims
					at something; if then anyone directly opposes him in anything, as, for instance,
					prevents him from drinking when thirsty, or not directly, but seems to be doing
					just the same; and if anyone goes against him or refuses to assist him, or
					troubles him in any other way when he is in this frame of mind, he is angry with
					all such persons. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Wherefore the sick, the
					necessitous, &lsqb;those at war&rsqb;, the lovesick, the thirsty, in a
					word, all who desire something and cannot obtain it, are prone to anger and
					easily excited, especially against those who make light of their present
					condition; for instance, the sick man is easily provoked in regard to his
					illness,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">toi=s pro\s
						th\n no/son</foreign>: lit. &ldquo;the sick man &lsqb;is angry
						with those who slight him&rsqb; in regard to his illness,&rdquo;
						that is, by making light of it.</note> the necessitous in regard to his
					poverty, the warrior in regard <lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>to warlike affairs, the
					lover in regard to love affairs, and so with all the rest; for the passion<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;his suffering at the
						moment.&rdquo;</note> present in his mind in each case paves the way for
					his anger. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Again, men are angry when the event
					is contrary to their expectation, for the more unexpected a thing is, the more
					it pains; just as they are overjoyed if, contrary to expectation, what they
					desire comes to pass. From this it is obvious what are the seasons, times,
					states of mind, and conditions of age in which we are easily moved<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">eu)ki/nhtoi</foreign>
						refers grammatically to <foreign lang="greek">diaqe/seis</foreign> and
						<foreign lang="greek">h(liki/ai</foreign>.</note> to anger; and what are
					the various times, places, and reasons, which make us more prone to anger in
					proportion as we are subject to their influence.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Such then are the dispositions of those who are
					easily roused to anger. As to the objects of their anger, men are angry with
					those who ridicule, mock, and scoff at them, for this is an insult. And with
					those who injure them in ways that are indications of insult. But these acts
					must be of such a kind that they are neither retaliatory nor advantageous to
					those who commit them; for if they are, they then appear due to gratuitous
					insult. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And men are angry with those who speak
					ill of or despise things which they themselves consider of the greatest
					importance; for instance, if a man speaks contemptuously of philosophy or of
					personal beauty in the presence of those who pride themselves upon them; and so
					in all other cases. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But they are far more
					angry if they suspect that they do not possess these qualities, either not at
					all, or not to any great extent, or when others do not think they possess them.
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1379b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>For when they feel
					strongly that they do possess those qualities which are the subject of mockery,
					they pay no heed to it. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And they are more
					angry with those who are their friends than with those who are not, for they
					think that they have a right to be treated well by them rather than ill.
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And they are angry with those who have
					been in the habit of honoring and treating them with respect, if they no longer
					behave so towards them; for they think that they are being treated with contempt
					by them, otherwise they would treat them as before. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>And with those who do not return their kindnesses nor requite them
					in full; and with those who oppose them, if they are inferiors; for all such
					appear to treat them with contempt, the latter as if they regarded them as
					inferiors, the former as if they had received kindnesses from inferiors.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>And they are more angry with those who are of
					no account, if they slight them; for anger at a slight was assumed to be felt at
					those who ought not to behave In such a manner; for inferiors ought not to
					slight their superiors. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>And they are angry
					with friends, if they neither speak well of nor treat them well, and in an even
					greater degree, if they do the opposite. And if they fail to perceive that they
					want something from them, as Plexippus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Plexippus was the uncle of Meleager. The allusion is obscure. It may refer
						to Meleager giving the skin of the Calydonian boar to Atalanta, which his
						uncle wanted. One of Antiphon's tragedies was named <title>Meleager</title>
						&lpar;<title>T.G.F.</title> p.792&rpar;.</note> in Antiphon's
					tragedy reproached Meleager; for failure to perceive this is a sign of slight;
					since, when we care for people, these things are noticed.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Literally, &ldquo;for the things which &lpar;= the
						persons whom&rpar; one respects, do not escape notice.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And they are angry with those who rejoice, or
					in a general way are cheerful when they are unfortunate; for this is an
					indication of enmity or slight. And with those who do not care if they pain
					them;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>whence they are angry with those who bring bad
					news. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>And with those who listen to the tale of
					their faults, or look on them with indifference, for they resemble slighters or
					enemies; <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>for friends sympathize and all men
					are pained to see their own faults exposed.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The real friend, therefore, would feel as much pain as the other whose
						faults are exposed.</note> And further, with those who slight them before
					five classes of persons: namely, their rivals, those whom they admire, those by
					whom they would like to be admired, those whom they respect, or those who
					respect them; when anyone slights them before these, their anger is greater.
					<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>They are also angry with those who slight
					such persons as it would be disgraceful for them not to defend, for instance,
					parents, children, wives, and dependents.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cope
						translates &ldquo;rulers and governors&rdquo;; but can <foreign lang="greek">a)/rxesqai</foreign> be used in a middle sense?</note> And

					when they themselves are in earnest; <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>for irony
					shows contempt. And with those who do good to others, but not to them; for not
					to think them worthy of what they bestow upon all others also shows contempt.
					<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Forgetfulness also is a cause of anger,
					such as forgetting names, although it is a mere trifle, since even forgetfulness
					seems a sign of slight; for it is caused by indifference, and indifference is a
					slight. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1380a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>We have thus stated at one and the same time the
					frame of mind and the reasons which make men angry, and the objects of their
					anger. It is evident then that it will be necessary for the speaker, by his
					eloquence, to put the hearers into the frame of mind of those who are inclined
					to anger, and to show that his opponents are responsible for things which rouse
					men to anger and are people of the kind with whom men are angry.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And since
					becoming angry is the opposite of becoming mild, and anger of mildness, we must
					determine the state of mind which makes men mild, towards whom they become mild,
					and the reasons which make them so. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let us then
					define making mild as the quieting and appeasing of anger. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>If then men are angry with those who slight them, and
					slight is voluntary, it is evident that they are mild towards those who do none
					of these things, or do them involuntarily, or at least appear to be such;
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and towards those who intended the opposite
					of what they have done, and all who behave in the same way to themselves, for no
					one is likely to slight himself. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And towards
					those who admit and are sorry for a slight; for finding as it were satisfaction
					in the pain the offenders feel at what they have done, men cease to be angry.
					Evidence of this may be seen in the punishment of slaves; for we punish more
					severely those who contradict us and deny their offence, but cease to be angry
					with those who admit that they are justly punished. The reason is that to deny
					what is evident is disrespect, and disrespect<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>is slight
					and contempt; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>anyhow, we show no respect for
					those for whom we entertain a profound contempt. Men also are mild towards those
					who humble themselves before them and do not contradict them, for they seem to
					recognize that they are inferior; now, those who are inferior are afraid, and no
					one who is afraid slights another. Even the behavior of dogs proves that anger
					ceases towards those who humble themselves, for they do not bite those who sit
					down.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)capi/nhs d'
						*o)dush=a i)/don ku/nes u(lako/mwpoi: oi( me\n keklh/gontes e)pe/dramon:

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And men are mild towards those who are serious
					with them when they are serious, for they think they are being treated
					seriously, not with contempt. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And towards those
					who have rendered them greater services.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That
						is, greater than their present disservices.</note> And towards those who
					want something and deprecate their anger, for they are humbler. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And towards those who refrain from insulting, mocking,
					or slighting anyone, or any virtuous man, or those who resemble themselves.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And generally speaking, one can determine
					the reasons that make for mildness by their opposites. Thus, men are mild
					towards those whom they fear or respect, as long as they feel so towards them,
					for it is impossible to be afraid and angry at the same time. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And against those who have acted in anger they either
					feel no anger or in a less degree, for they do not seem to have acted from a
					desire to slight. For no one slights another when angry, since slight is free
					from pain, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1380b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but anger is
					accompanied by it. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>And men are not angry with
					those who usually show respect for them.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">They
						regard the disrespectful treatment as merely a temporary lapse.</note></p>
				<p>It is also evident that those are mild whose condition is contrary to that which
					excites anger, as when laughing, in sport, at a feast, in prosperity, in
					success, in abundance,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">plh/rwsis</foreign>: lit. &ldquo;filling up.&rdquo; The
						reference may be to the &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo; of one's desires,
						or to &ldquo;repletion&rdquo; in the matter of food &lpar;L. and
						S.&rpar;, which seems less likely; &ldquo;in fulness of
						content&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> and, in general, in
					freedom from pain, in pleasure which does not imply insult, or in virtuous hope.
					Further, those whose anger is of long standing and not in its full flush, for
					time appeases anger. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Again, vengeance
					previously taken upon one person appeases anger against another, even though it
					be greater. Wherefore Philocrates,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Opponent of
						Demosthenes, and one of the pro-Macedonian party. Impeached for his share in
						the disastrous &ldquo;Peace of Philocrates,&rdquo; he went into
						exile and was condemned to death during his absence.</note> when someone
					asked him why he did not justify himself when the people were angry with him,
					made the judicious reply, &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;When
					then?&rdquo; &ldquo;When I see someone accused of the same
					offence&rdquo;; for men grow mild when they have exhausted their anger upon
					another, as happened in the case of Ergophilus.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Ergophilus failed in an attack on Cotys, king of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, while Callisthenes concluded a
						premature peace with Perdiccas, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>.</note> For although the Athenians were more
					indignant with him than with Callisthenes, they acquitted him, because they had
					condemned CalIicrates to death on the previous day. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Men also grow mild towards those whom they pity<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Another reading is <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n
								e(/lwsi</foreign>, &ldquo;if they have convicted him.&rdquo; This is
							adopted by Roemer, who refers to <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 558a">Plat. Rep.

							enforced.</note>; and if an offender has suffered greater evil than those who
					are angry would have inflicted, for they have an idea that they have as it were
					obtained reparation. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And if they think that
					they themselves are wrong and deserve what they suffer, for anger is not aroused
					against what is just; they no longer think that they are being treated otherwise
					than they should be, which, as we have said, is the essence of anger. Wherefore
					we should inflict a preliminary verbal chastisement, for even slaves are less
					indignant at punishment<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>of this kind. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And men are milder if they think that those punished
					will never know that the punishment comes from <emph>them</emph> in requital for
					their own wrongs; for anger has to do with the individual, as is clear from our
					definition.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Therefore, if you think that a
						man will never learn <emph>who</emph> took vengeance on him, you will be
						less cruel; for anger is personal, and so Odysseus, because he was angry,
						inflicted a savage punishment, and wished Polyphemus to know it.</note>
					Wherefore it is justly said by the poet: <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>Tell him that it is Odysseus, sacker of cities,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 9.504">Hom. Od.

					</quote> as if Polyphemus would not have been punished,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;as if Odysseus would not have considered

					remained ignorant who had blinded him and for what. So that men are not angry
					either with any others who cannot know who punishes them,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;with any who can no longer feel their
						anger.&rdquo; Cope translates: &ldquo;with all the rest
						&lpar;besides those actually within reach&rpar; who are out of
						sight.&rdquo;</note> or with the dead, since they have paid the last
					penalty and can feel neither pain nor anything else, which is the aim of those
					who are angry.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">To make the offender
						<emph>feel</emph> pain as part of the punishment.</note> So then, in regard

					</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>It is evident, then, that men must have
					recourse to these topics when they desire to appease their audience, putting
					them into the frame of mind required and representing those with whom they are

					great services, or acted involuntarily, or as exceedingly grieved at what they
					have done.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us now

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let loving, then, be defined as wishing for

					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1381a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and procuring them for him
					as far as lies in our power. A friend is one who loves and is loved in return,

					friends. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This being granted, it necessarily
					follows that he is a friend who shares our joy in good fortune and our sorrow in
					affliction, for our own sake and not for any other reason. For all men rejoice
					when what they desire comes to pass and are pained when the contrary happens, so
					that pain and pleasure are indications of their wish. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And those are friends who have the same ideas of good and bad, and
					love and hate the same persons, since they necessarily wish the same things;

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>We also like those who have done good either to

					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And the self-controlled, because they are not

					those who do not oppose us when we are angry or occupied, for such persons are
					pugnacious; and those who show any good feeling towards us; for instance, if

					them; such are those who do not fear to mention even their faults.

					no one likes one whom he fears. <milestone unit="section" n="28"/>Companionship,

					been rendered for the sake of the friend, and not for any other reason. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1382a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/>As for enmity and hatred, it is evident that
					they must be examined in the light of their contraries. The causes which produce
					enmity are anger, spitefulness, slander. <milestone unit="section" n="31"/>Anger
					arises from acts committed against us, enmity even from those that are not; for
					if we imagine a man to be of such and such a character, we hate him. Anger has
					always an individual as its object, for instance Callias or <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, whereas
					hatred applies to classes; for instance, every one hates a thief or informer.
					Anger is curable by time, hatred not; the aim of anger is pain, of hatred evil;
					for the angry man wishes to see what happens;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">He wishes to see and know the result of the measures taken against those
						with whom he is angry. Or, it may mean that he wishes the object of his
						anger to feel his wrath, and to know by whom, and for what, he is
						punished.</note> to one who hates it does not matter. Now, the things which
					cause pain are all perceptible, while things which are especially bad, such as
					injustice or folly, are least perceptible; for the presence of vice causes no
					pain. Anger is accompanied by pain, but hatred not; for he who is angry suffers
					pain, but he who hates does not. One who is angry might feel compassion in many
					cases, but one who hates, never; for the former wishes that the object of his
					anger should suffer in his turn, the latter, that he should perish. <milestone unit="section" n="32"/>It is evident, then, from what we have just said,
					that it is possible to prove that men are enemies or friends, or to make them
					such if they are not; to refute those who pretend that they are, and when they
					oppose us through anger or enmity, to bring them over to whichever side may be
					preferred.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>The things and persons that men fear and
					in what frame of mind, will be evident from the following considerations.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let fear be
					defined as a painful or troubled feeling caused by the impression of an imminent
					evil that causes destruction or pain; for men do not fear all evils, for
					instance, becoming unjust or slow-witted, but only such as involve great pain or
					destruction, and only if they appear to be not far off but near at hand and
					threatening, for men do not fear things that are very remote; all know that they
					have to die, but as death is not near at hand, they are indifferent. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>If then this is fear, all things must be fearful that
					appear to have great power of destroying or inflicting injuries that tend to
					produce great pain. That is why even the signs of such misfortunes are fearful,
					for the fearful thing itself appears to be near at hand, and danger is the
					approach of anything fearful. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Such signs are
					the enmity and anger of those able to injure us in any way; for it is evident
					that they have the wish,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">By the definitions of
						anger and hatred.</note> so that they are not far from doing so. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And injustice possessed of power is fearful, for the
					unjust man is unjust through deliberate inclination.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">And therefore, having the inclination to be unjust, if he has
						the power, he will be so.</note>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1382b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And outraged virtue when it has power, for it is evident that it
					always desires satisfaction, whenever it is outraged, and now it has the power.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And fear felt by those able to injure us in
					any way, for such as these also must be ready to act. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And since most men are rather bad than good and the slaves of gain
					and cowardly in time of danger, being at the mercy of another is generally
					fearful, so that one who has committed a crime has reason to fear his
					accomplices as likely to denounce or leave him in the lurch. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And those who are able to ill-treat others are to be
					feared by those who can be so treated; for as a rule men do wrong whenever they
					can. Those who have been, or think they are being, wronged, are also to be
					feared, for they are ever on the look out for an opportunity. And those who have
					committed some wrong, when they have the power, since they are afraid of
					retaliation, <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>which was assumed to be something
					to be feared. And those who are our rivals for the same things, whenever it is
					impossible to share them, for men are always contending with such persons.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And those who are feared by those who are
					stronger than we are, for they would be better able to injure us, if they could
					injure those stronger than ourselves and those whom those who are stronger than
					ourselves are afraid of, for the same reason. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And those who have overthrown those who are stronger than us and those who
					attack those who are weaker, for they are either already to be feared, or will
					be, when they have grown stronger.</p>
				<p>And among those whom we have wronged, or are our enemies or rivals,we should fear
					not the hot-tempered or<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>outspoken, but those who are
					mild, dissemblers, and thorough rascals; for it is uncertain whether they are on
					the point of acting, so that one never knows whether they are far from it.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or simply, &ldquo;near . . . far from
						us.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>All things that are to be feared are more so
					when, after an error has once been committed, it is impossible to repair it,
					either because it is absolutely impossible, or no longer in our power, but in
					that of our opponents; also when there is no possibility of help or it is not
					easy to obtain. In a word, all things are to be feared which, when they happen,
					or are on the point of happening, to others, excite compassion. These are, so to
					say, nearly all the most important things which are to be feared and which men
					fear. Let us now state the frame of mind which leads men to fear.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>If then fear is accompanied by the expectation
					that we are going to suffer some fatal misfortune, it is evident that none of
					those who think that they will suffer nothing at all is afraid either of those
					things which he does not think will happen to him, or of those from whom he does
					not expect them, or at a time when he does not think them likely to happen. It
					therefore needs be that those who think they are likely to suffer anything
					should be afraid, either of the persons at whose hands they expect it, or of
					certain things, and at certain times. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Those
					who either are, or seem to be, highly prosperous do not think they are likely to
					suffer anything; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1383a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>wherefore
					they are insolent, contemptuous, and rash, and what makes them such is wealth,
					strength, a number of friends, power. It is the same with those who think that
					they have already suffered all possible ills and are coldly indifferent to the
					future, like those who are being beaten to death; for it is a necessary
					incentive to fear that there should remain some hope of being saved from the
					cause of their distress. A sign of this is that fear makes men deliberate,
					whereas no one deliberates about things that are hopeless. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>So that whenever it is preferable that the audience
					should feel afraid, it is necessary to make them think they are likely to
					suffer, by reminding them that others greater than they have suffered, and
					showing that their equals are suffering or have suffered, and that at the hands
					of those from whom they did not expect it, in such a manner and at times when
					they did not think it likely.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Now, since we have made clear what fear and
					fearful things are, and the frame of mind in each case which makes men fear, one
					can see from this what confidence is, what are the things that give it, and the
					frame of mind of those who possess it; for confidence is the contrary of fear
					and that which gives confidence of that which causes fear, so that the hope of
					what is salutary is accompanied by an impression that it is quite near at hand,
					while the things to be feared are either non-existent or far off. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Confidence is inspired by the remoteness of fearful
					things,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or by the nearness of things that justify
					it.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">ta\
						swth/ria</foreign> or some other word instead of <foreign lang="greek">ta\
							qarrale/a</foreign> would be expected, to avoid the tautology. The fact
						of remoteness inspires confidence, because we do not expect fearful things
						to happen; while salutary things inspire it if near at hand, because we
						expect them to happen.</note> If remedies are possible, if there are means
					of help, either great or numerous, or both; if we have neither committed nor
					suffered wrong if we have no rivals at all, or only such as are powerless, or,
					if they have power, are our friends, or have either done us good or have
					received it from us; if those whose interests are the same as ours are more
					numerous, or stronger, or both. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>We feel
					confidence in the following states of mind: if we believe that we have often
					succeeded and have not suffered, or if we have often been in danger and escaped
					it; for men are unaffected by fear in two ways, either because they have never
					been tested or have means of help; thus, in dangers at sea, those who have never
					experienced a storm and those who have means of help as the result of experience
					have confidence as to the future. <milestone unit="section" n="19"/>We are also
					reassured, when a thing does not inspire fear in our equals, our inferiors, or
					those to whom we think ourselves superior; and we think ourselves superior to
					those whom we have conquered, either themselves or their superiors or equals.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And if we think we possess more or more
					considerable advantages, such as make their possessors formidable; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1383b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>such are abundance of money,
					strength of body, friends, territory, military equipments, either all or the
					most important. And if we have never done wrong to anyone, or only to a few, or
					not to such as are to be feared; <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>and,
					generally, if it is well with us in regard to the gods, especially as to
					intimations from signs and oracles, and everything else of the kind; for anger
					inspires confidence, and it is the wrong that we suffer and not that which we
					inflict upon others that causes anger, and the gods are supposed to assist those
					who are wronged.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">It is assumed that the gods
						will be on our side if we have suffered wrong; suffering wrong rouses anger
						and at the same time inspires confidence, if our relations with the gods are
						such that we feel we can rely upon them for assistance.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Lastly, we feel confidence when, at the
					beginning of any undertaking, we do not expect disaster either in the present or
					future, or hope for success. Such are the things that inspire fear or
					confidence.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>What are the
					things of which men are ashamed or the contrary, and before whom, and in what
					frame of mind, will be clear from the following considerations. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let shame then be defined as a kind of pain or
					uneasiness in respect of misdeeds, past, present, or future, which seem to tend
					to bring dishonor; and shamelessness as contempt and indifference in regard to
					these same things. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>If this definition of shame
					is correct, it follows that we are ashamed of all such misdeeds as seem to be
					disgraceful, either for ourselves or for those whom we care for. Such are all
					those that are due to vice, such as throwing away one's shield or taking to
					flight, for this is due to cowardice;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or withholding a
					deposit, for this is due to injustice. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And
					illicit relations with any persons, at forbidden places or times, for this is
					due to licentiousness. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And making profit out of
					what is petty or disgraceful, or out of the weak, such as the indigent or dead;
					whence the proverb, &ldquo;to rob even a corpse,&rdquo; for this is due
					to base love of gain and stinginess. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And to
					refuse assistance in money matters when we are able to render it, or to give
					less than we can; to accept assistance from those less able to afford it than
					ourselves; <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>to borrow when anyone seems likely
					to ask for a loan, to ask for a loan from one who wants his money back, and
					asking for repayment from one who wants to borrow; to praise in order to seem to
					be asking for a loan, and when you have failed to obtain it to keep on asking;
					for all these are signs of stinginess. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And to
					praise people when they are present, to overpraise their good qualities and to
					palliate the bad, to show excessive grief at another's grief when present, and
					all similar actions; for they are signs of flattery.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And not to submit to toils, which those put up
					with who are older <pb ed="Bekker" n="1384a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>or live
					luxuriously or hold higher positions, or, generally speaking, are less fitted to
					do so; for all these are signs of effeminacy. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>To accept favors from another and often, and then to throw them in his teeth;
					for all these things are signs of littleness and abasement of soul. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And to speak at great length about oneself and to
					make all kinds of professions, and to take the credit for what another has done;
					for this is a sign of boastfulness. Similarly, in regard to each of all the
					other vices of character, the acts resulting from them, their signs, and the
					things which resemble them, all these are disgraceful, and should make us
					ashamed. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>It is also shameful not to have a
					share in the honorable things which all men, or all who resemble us, or the
					majority of them, have a share in. By those who resemble us I mean those of the
					same race, of the same city, of the same age, of the same family, and, generally
					speaking, those who are on an equality; for then it is disgraceful not to have a
					share, for instance, in education and other things, to the same extent. All
					these things are the more disgraceful, if the fault appears to be our own; for
					they are at once seen to be due rather to natural depravity if we ourselves are
					the cause of past, present, or future defects. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>And we are ashamed when we suffer or have suffered or are likely to suffer
					things which tend to ignominy and reproach; such are prostituting one's person
					or performing disgraceful actions, including unnatural lust. And of these
					actions those that promote licentiousness are disgraceful, whether voluntary or
					involuntary &lpar;the latter being those that are done under
					compulsion&rpar;,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>since meek endurance and the
					absence of resistance are the result of unmanliness or cowardice.</p>
				<p>These and similar things are those of which men are ashamed. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And since shame is an impression about dishonor, and
					that for its own sake and not for its results; and since no one heeds the
					opinion of others except on account of those who hold it, it follows that men
					feel shame before those whom they esteem. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Now
					men esteem those who admire them and those whom they admire, those by whom they
					wish to be admired, those whose rivals they are, and whose opinion they do not
					despise. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>They desire to be admired by those,
					and admire those who possess anything good that is greatly esteemed, or from
					whom they urgently require something which it is in their power to give, as is
					the case with lovers. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>And they are rivals of
					those who are like them; and they give heed to the men of practical wisdom as
					likely to be truthful; such are the older and well educated. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>They are also more ashamed of things that are done
					before their eyes and in broad daylight; whence the proverb, The eyes are the
					abode of shame.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Euripides,
						<title>Cresphontes</title>: <foreign lang="greek">ai)dw\s e)n o)fqalmoi=si
							gi/gnetai, te/knon</foreign> &lpar;<title>T.G.F.</title> frag.
						457&rpar;.</note> That is why they feel more ashamed before those who
					are likely to be always with them or who keep watch upon them, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1384b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>because in both cases they are under the
					eyes of others.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Men are also ashamed before those who are not
					open to the same accusations, for it is evident that their feelings are
					contrary. And before those who are not indulgent towards those who appear to
					err; for a man is supposed not to reproach others with what he does himself, so
					it is clear that what he reproaches them with is what he does not do himself.
					<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And before those who are fond of gossiping
					generally; for not to gossip about the fault of another amounts to not regarding
					it as a fault at all. Now those who are inclined to gossip are those who have
					suffered wrong, because they always have their eyes upon us; and slanderers,
					because, if they traduce the innocent, still more will they traduce the guilty.
					And before those who spend their time in looking for their neighbors' faults,
					for instance, mockers and comic poets; for they are also in a manner slanderers
					and gossips. And before those from whom they have never asked anything in
					vain,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Jebb translates, &ldquo;who have
						never seen us break down.&rdquo;</note> for they feel as if they were
					greatly esteemed. For this reason they feel ashamed before those who ask them
					for something for the first time, as never yet having lost their good opinion.
					Such are those who have recently sought their friendship &lpar;for they have
					only seen what is best in them, which is the point of the answer of Euripides to
					the Syracusans&rpar;,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The Greek scholiast
						says: &ldquo;Euripides, having been sent as ambassador to the
						Syracusans, to ask for peace and friendship, when they refused said: O
						Syracusans, if for no other reason than that we are just feeling the need of
						your friendship, you ought to respect our admiration.&rdquo; Nothing is
						known of this embassy. Hyperides has been suggested instead of
						Euripides.</note> or old acquaintances who know nothing against us. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>And men are ashamed not only of the disgraceful
					things we have spoken of, but also of indications of them, for instance, not
					only of sensual pleasures, but also of the indications of them; and not only of
					doing, <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>but also<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>of
					saying disgraceful things. Similarly, men are ashamed not only before those who
					have been mentioned, but also before those who will reveal their faults to them,
					such as their servants or friends. <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>In a word,
					they are not ashamed either before those whose opinion in regard to the truth
					they greatly despise&mdash;for instance, no one feels shame before children
					or animals&mdash;or of the same things before those who are known to them
					and those who are not; before the former, they are ashamed of things that appear
					really disgraceful, before strangers, of those which are only condemned by
					convention.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="24"/>Men are likely to feel shame in the following
					situations; first, if there are any who are so related to them as those before
					whom we said that they feel shame. These, as we pointed out, are those who are
					admired by them or who admire them, or by whom they wish to be admired, or from
					whom they need some service, which they will not obtain if they lose their
					reputation. These, again, are either persons who directly see what is going on
					&lpar;just as Cydias, when haranguing the people about the allotment of the
					territory of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, begged the
					Athenians to picture to themselves that the Greeks were standing round them and
					would not only hear, but also see what they were going to decree&rpar;; or
					neighbors; or those likely to be aware of what they say or do. That is why men
					do not like, when unfortunate, to be seen by those who were once their rivals,
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1385a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for rivalry presumes
					admiration. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Men also feel shame when they are
					connected with actions or things which entail disgrace,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This rendering involves a plural neuter with a plural verb.
						Others take the actions or things in a good sense, &ldquo;deeds and
						fortunes, their own <emph>or</emph> their ancestors, which they are likely
						to disgrace.&rdquo;</note> for which either they themselves, or their
					ancestors, or any others with whom they are closely connected are responsible.
					In a word, men feel shame for those whom they themselves respect;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e. when they have done anything
						disgraceful.</note> such are those mentioned and those who have any relation to
					them, for instance, whose teachers or advisers they have been; similarly, when
					they are in rivalry with others who are like them; <milestone unit="section" n="26"/>for there are many things which they either do or do not do owing to
					the feeling of shame which these men inspire. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>And they are more likely to be ashamed when they have to be seen and to
					associate openly with those who are aware of their disgrace. Wherefore the
					tragic poet Antiphon,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">When on an embassy to
						<placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, he was asked by
						Dionysius which was the best kind of brass. On his replying, &ldquo;that
						from which the Athenians made their statues of Harmodius and
						Aristogiton,&rdquo; Dionysius ordered him to be put to death.</note>
					when he was about to be flogged to death by order of Dionysius, seeing that
					those who were to die with him covered their faces as they passed through the
					gates, said, &ldquo;Why cover your faces? Is it because you are afraid that
					one of the crowd should see you tomorrow?&rdquo; Let this account of shame
					suffice; as for shamelessness, it is evident that we shall be able to obtain
					ample knowledge of it from the contrary arguments.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The persons
					towards whom men feel benevolent,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign> may mean &lpar;1&rpar;
						benevolence, the feeling which prompts a favor; &lpar;2&rpar; an
						actual favor conferred; &lpar;3&rpar; gratitude.</note> and for what
					reasons, and in what frame of mind, will be clear when we have defined what
					favor is. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let it then be taken to be the
					feeling in accordance with which one who has it is said to render a service to
					one who needs it, not in return for something nor in the interest of him who
					renders it, but in that of the recipient. And the favor will be great<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>if the recipient is in pressing need, or if the service
					or the times and circumstances are important or difficult, or if the benefactor
					is the only one, or the first who has rendered it, or has done so in the highest
					degree. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>By needs I mean longings, especially
					for things the failure to obtain which is accompanied by pain; such are the
					desires, for instance, love; also those which arise in bodily sufferings and
					dangers, for when a man is in pain or danger he desires something. That is why
					those who help a man who is poor or an exile, even if the service be ever so
					small, are regarded with favor owing to the urgency and occasion of the need;
					for instance, the man who gave the mat<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Probably given to a beggar or vagrant who had nothing to sleep on.</note>
					to another in the Lyceum. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>It is necessary then,
					if possible, that the service should be in the same direction<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That is, should have in view the satisfaction of urgent wants
						and desires &lpar;Cope&rpar;.</note>; if not, that it should apply
					to cases of similar or greater need.</p>
				<p>Since then it is evident on what occasions,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">o(/te</foreign>; others read <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign>, &ldquo;by whom.&rdquo;</note> for
					what reasons, and in what frame of mind a feeling of benevolence arises, it is
					clear that we must derive our arguments from this&mdash;to show that the one
					side either has been, or still is, in such pain or need, and that the other has
					rendered, or is rendering, such a service in such a time of need. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>It is evident also by what means it is possible to
					make out that there is no favor at all, or that those who render it are not
					actuated by benevolence<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">a)xari/stous</foreign>: the word generally means
						&ldquo;ungrateful,&rdquo; and so Jebb takes it here: &ldquo;and
						to make men ungrateful.&rdquo;</note>; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1385b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for it can either be said that they do, or have done so,
					for their own sake, in which case there is no favor; or that it was mere chance;
					or that they acted under compulsion; or that they were making a return, not a
					gift, whether they knew it or not; for in both cases it is an equivalent return,
					so that in this case also there is no favor. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And the action must be considered in reference to all the categories; for if
					there is a favor it is so because of substance, quantity, quality, time, or
					place.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The other five categories in
						Aristotle's list are: relation, position, possession, activity,
						passivity.</note> And it denotes lack of goodwill, if persons have not rendered
					a smaller service,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Because in that case their
						motives in rendering the greater service cannot be disinterested.</note> or
					if they have rendered similar, equal, or greater services to our enemies; for it
					is evident that they do not act for our sake in this case either. Or if the
					service was insignificant, and rendered by one who knew it; for no one admits
					that he has need of what is insignificant.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let this
					suffice for benevolence and the opposite. We will now state what things and
					persons excite pity, and the state of mind of those who feel it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let pity then be a kind of pain excited by the sight
					of evil, deadly or painful, which befalls one who does not deserve it; an evil
					which one might expect to come upon himself or one of his friends, and when it
					seems near. For it is evident that one who is likely to feel pity must be such
					as to think that he, or one of his friends, is liable to suffer some evil, and
					such an evil as has been stated in the definition, or one similar, or nearly
					similar. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Wherefore neither those who are
					utterly ruined,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>are capable of pity, for they think they
					have nothing more to suffer, since they have exhausted suffering; nor those who
					think themselves supremely fortunate, who rather are insolent. For if they think
					that all good things are theirs, it is clear that they think that they cannot
					possibly suffer evil, and this is one of the good things. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now those persons who think they are likely to suffer
					are those who have already suffered and escaped; the advanced in age, by reason
					of their wisdom and experience; and the weak, and those who are rather more
					timid; and the educated, for they reckon rightly; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and those who have parents, children, or wives, for these are part of
					them and likely to suffer the evils of which we have spoken; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and those who are not influenced by any courageous
					emotion, such as anger or confidence, for these emotions do not take thought of
					the future and those who are not in a wantonly insolent frame of mind, for they
					also take no thought of future suffering; but it is those who are between the
					two extremes that feel pity. Those who are not in great fear; for those who are
					panic-stricken are incapable of pity, because they are preoccupied with their
					own emotion. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And men feel pity if they think
					that some persons are virtuous; for he who thinks that no one is will think that
					all deserve misfortune. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1386a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>And,
					generally speaking, a man is moved to pity when he is so affected that he
					remembers that such evils have happened, or expects that they may happen, either
					to himself or to one of his friends.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>We have stated the frame of mind which leads men
					to pity; and the things which arouse this feeling are clearly shown by the
					definition. They are all painful and distressing things that are also
					destructive, and all that are ruinous; and all evils of which fortune is the
					cause, if they are great. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Things distressing
					and destructive are various kinds of death, personal ill-treatment and injuries,
					old age, disease, and lack of food. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The evils
					for which fortune is responsible are lack of friends, or few friends
					&lpar;wherefore it is pitiable to be torn away from friends and
					intimates&rpar;, ugliness, weakness, mutilation; if some misfortune comes to
					pass from a quarter whence one might have reasonably expected something good;
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>and if this happens often; and if good
					fortune does not come until a man has already suffered, as when the presents
					from the Great King were not dispatched to Diopithes until he was dead. Those
					also are to be pitied to whom no good has ever accrued, or who are unable to
					enjoy it when it has.</p>
				<p>These and the like things, then, excite pity. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>The persons men pity are those whom they know, provided they are not too
					closely connected with them for if they are, they feel the same as if they
					themselves were likely<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>to suffer. This is why Amasis<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hdt. 3.14">Hdt. 3.14</bibl>, where the
						story is told, not of Amasis, by of his son Psammenitus.</note> is said not
					to have wept when his son was led to execution, but did weep at the sight of a
					friend reduced to beggary, for the latter excited pity, the former terror. The
					terrible is different from the pitiable, for it drives out pity, and often
					serves to produce the opposite feeling. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Further, the nearness of the terrible makes men pity.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Jebb renders: &ldquo;Again men pity when the danger is
						near themselves,&rdquo; which may mean when they see something terrible
						happening to others and likely soon to befall themselves. Vahlen inserts
						<foreign lang="greek">ou) ga\r</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">e)/ti</foreign>: &ldquo;for men cease to pity when the terrible
						comes close to themselves.</note> Men also pity those who resemble them in
					age, character, habits, position, or family; for all such relations make a man
					more likely to think that their misfortune may befall him as well. For, in
					general, here also we may conclude that all that men fear in regard to
					themselves excites their pity when others are the victims. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And since sufferings are pitiable when they appear
					close at hand, while those that are past or future, ten thousand years backwards
					or forwards, either do not excite pity at all or only in a less degree, because
					men neither expect the one nor remember the other, it follows that those who
					contribute to the effect by gestures, voice, dress, and dramatic action
					generally, are more pitiable; for they make the evil appear close at hand,
					setting it before our eyes as either future or past. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1386b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And disasters
					that have just happened or are soon about to happen excite more pity for the
					same reason. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Pity is also aroused by signs and
					actions, such as the dress of those who have suffered, and all such objects, and
					the words and everything else that concerns those who are actually suffering,
					for instance, at the point of death. And when men show themselves undaunted<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;When the men, who are in such
						crises, are good men&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;. If they were not,
						their misfortune would appear deserved.</note> at such critical times it is
					specially pitiable; for all these things,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The
						signs and actions, and the demeanor of the sufferer.</note> because they
					come immediately under our observation, increase the feeling of pity, both
					because the sufferer does not seem to deserve his fate, and because the
					suffering is before our eyes.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now what is
					called indignation<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">nemesa=n</foreign>: &ldquo;the nobler brother of envy&rdquo;
						&lpar;Nietzsche&rpar;.</note> is the antithesis to pity; for the
					being pained at undeserved good fortune is in a manner contrary to being pained
					at undeserved bad fortune and arises from the same character. And both emotions
					show good character, <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>for if we sympathize with
					and pity those who suffer undeservedly, we ought to be indignant with those who
					prosper undeservedly; for that which happens beyond a man's deserts is unjust,
					wherefore we attribute this feeling even to gods. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It would seem that envy also is similarly opposed to pity, as being
					akin to or identical with indignation, although it is really different; envy
					also is indeed a disturbing pain and directed against good fortune, but not that
					of one who does not deserve it, but of one who is our equal and<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>like. Now, all who feel envy and indignation must have this in
					common, that they are disturbed, not because they think that any harm will
					happen to themselves, but on account of their neighbor; for it will cease to be
					indignation and envy, but will be fear, if the pain and disturbance arise from
					the idea that harm may come to themselves from another's good fortune.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And it is evident that these feelings will
					be accompanied by opposite feelings; for he who is pained at the sight of those
					who are undeservedly unfortunate will rejoice or will at least not be pained at
					the sight of those who are deservedly so; for instance, no good man would be
					pained at seeing parricides or assassins punished; we should rather rejoice at
					their lot, and at that of men who are deservedly fortunate; for both these<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">There is justice both in the punishment of the
						parricide and in the deserved good fortune of others. The conclusion must
						refer to the latter; if his like is fortunate, he hopes he may be.</note>
					are just and cause the worthy man to rejoice, because he cannot help hoping that
					what has happened to his like may also happen to himself. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And all these feelings arise from the same character
					and their contraries from the contrary; for he who is malicious is also envious,
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1387a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>since, if the envious man
					is pained at another's possession or acquisition of good fortune, he is bound to
					rejoice at the destruction or non-acquisition of the same. Wherefore all these
					emotions are a hindrance to pity, although they differ for the reasons stated;
					so that they are all equally useful for preventing any feeling of pity.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Let us then first speak of indignation, the
					persons with whom men feel indignant, for what reasons, and in what frame of
					mind; and then proceed to the rest of the emotions. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>What we have just said will make matters clear. For if indignation is
					being pained at the sight of good fortune that is apparently undeserved, in the
					first place it is clear that it is not possible to feel indignation at all good
					things; <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>for no one will be indignant with a man
					who is just or courageous, or may acquire any virtue &lpar;for one does not
					feel pity in the case of opposites of those qualities&rpar;,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Because it is a man's own fault, and pity is
						only felt for what is undeserved.</note> but men are indignant at wealth,
					power, in a word, at all the advantages of which good men are worthy.
					&lsqb;And those who possess natural advantages, such as noble birth, beauty,
					and all such things.&rsqb;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The first part
						of the sentence is clear: men are indignant when what good men deserve is
						possessed by those who are not good. The literal translation o the text as
						it stands is: &ldquo;Men are indignant . . . at all the advantages of
						which good men and those who possess natural advantages are
						worthy&rdquo;; but this cannot be right, since there is nothing in
						<emph>natural</emph> advantages to arouse moral indignation, there is no
						question of their being deserved or undeserved. Something may have fallen
						out like &ldquo;but they will not be indignant with those who possess
						natural advantages.&rdquo; Roemer &lpar;<title><persName><surname>Rhein</surname></persName>. Mus.</title> 39 p.
						504&rpar; suggests <foreign lang="greek">ou)d' ei) ta\ fu/sei e)/xousin
							a)gaqa/</foreign> &lpar;understanding <foreign lang="greek">nemesh/sei tou/tois</foreign>&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And since that which is old seems closely to
					resemble that which is natural, it follows that, if two parties have the same
					good, men are more indignant with the one who has recently acquired it and owes
					his prosperity to it; for the newly rich cause more annoyance than those who
					have long possessed or inherited wealth. The same applies to offices of
					state,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>power, numerous friends, virtuous children,
					and any other advantages of the kind. And if these advantages bring them some
					other advantage, men are equally indignant; for in this case also the newly rich
					who attain to office owing to their wealth cause more annoyance than those who
					have long been wealthy; and similarly in all other cases of the same kind.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>The reason is that the latter seem to
					possess what belongs to them, the former not; for that which all along shows
					itself in the same light suggests a reality, so that the former seem to possess
					what is not theirs.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">dokei=n</foreign> is a stronger word than <foreign lang="greek">fai/nesqai</foreign>, indicating an intellectual operation as opposed
						to an impression received through the senses. The idea is that where
						anything has been so long in a person's possession, it has come to he
						regarded as his by right.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And since every kind of good is not suitable
					to the first comer, but a certain proportion and suitability are necessary
					&lpar;as for instance beautiful weapons are not suitable to the just but to
					the courageous man, and distinguished marriages not to the newly rich but to the
					nobly born&rpar;, if a virtuous man does not obtain what is suitable to him,
					we feel indignant. Similarly, if the inferior contends with the superior,
					especially among those engaged in the same pursuit,&mdash;whence the saying
					of the poet, <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>He avoided battle with Ajax, son of Telamon,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.542">Hom. Il. 11.542</bibl>.

						</lg>
					</quote>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1387b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>or, if the pursuit is not the
					same, wherever the inferior contends with the superior in anything whatever, as
					for instance, the musician with the just man; for justice is better than music.</p>
				<p>From this it is clear, then, with whom men are indignant and for what reasons;
					they are these or of such a kind. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Men are
					prone to indignation, first, if they happen to deserve or possess the greatest
					advantages, for it is not just that those who do not resemble them should be
					deemed worthy of the same advantages; <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>secondly, if they happen to be virtuous and worthy,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">It has been suggested to insert <foreign lang="greek">mh\</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">tugxa/nwsi</foreign>:
						&ldquo;if, although virtuous and worthy, they do not happen to possess
						such advantages.&rdquo;</note> for they both judge correctly and hate
					what is unjust. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And those who are ambitious
					and long for certain positions, especially if they are those which others,
					although unworthy, have obtained.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or,
						&ldquo;of which others happen to be unworthy.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>And, in general, those who think themselves
					worthy of advantages of which they consider others unworthy, are inclined to be
					indignant with the latter and because of these advantages. This is why the
					servile and worthless and unambitious are not inclined to indignation; for there
					is nothing of which they think themselves worthy. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>It is evident from this what kind of men they are whose ill
					fortunes, calamities, and lack of success must make us rejoice or at least feel
					no pain; for the opposites are clear from what has been said. If then the
					speaker puts the judges into such a frame of mind and proves that<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>those who claim our pity &lpar;and the reasons why they do
					so&rpar; are unworthy to obtain it and deserve that it should be refused
					them, then pity will be impossible.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It is equally
					clear for what reason, and of whom, and in what frame of mind, men are envious,
					if envy is a kind of pain at the sight of good fortune in regard to the goods
					mentioned; in the case of those like themselves; and not for the sake of a man
					getting anything, but because of others possessing it. For those men will be
					envious who have, or seem to have, others &ldquo;like&rdquo; them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I mean like in birth, relationship, age,
					moral habit, reputation, and possessions. And those will be envious who possess
					all but one of these advantages<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">If some one
						else possesses the one thing which they think necessary to complete their
						happiness, they are envious of him, because they consider it ought to be
						theirs.</note>; that is why those who attempt great things and succeed are
					envious, because they think that every one is trying to deprive them of their
					own. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And those who are honored for some special
					reason, especially for wisdom or happiness. And the ambitious are more envious
					than the unambitious. And those who are wise in their own conceit, for they are
					ambitious of a reputation for wisdom; and, in general, those who wish to be
					distinguished in anything are envious in regard to it. And the little-minded,
					because everything appears to them to be great.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The advantages which excite envy have already
					been stated. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1388a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Nearly all the
					actions or possessions which make men desire glory or honor and long for fame,
					and the favors of fortune, create envy, especially when men long for them
					themselves, or think that they have a right to them, or the possession of which
					makes them slightly superior or slightly inferior.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And it is evident whom men envy, for it has just
					been stated by implication. They envy those who are near them in time, place,
					age, and reputation, whence it was said, <quote>

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And since men strive for honor with those who

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And those who have succeeded with difficulty or
					have failed envy those whose success has been rapid. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And those whose possessions or successes are a reproach to
					themselves, and these, too, are those near or like them; for it is clear that it
					is their own fault<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that they do not obtain the same
					advantage, so that this pains and causes envy. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And those who either have or have acquired what was naturally theirs or what
					they had once acquired; this is why an older man is envious of a younger one.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Those who have spent much envy those who
					have only spent little to obtain the same thing. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And it is clear at what things and persons the envious rejoice, and
					in what frame of mind; for, as when they do not possess certain things, they are
					pained, so when they do possess them, they will rejoice in the opposite
					circumstances.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;The same state
						of mind which is absent in the painful feeling will be present in the joy

						before <foreign lang="greek">e)/xontes</foreign>, &ldquo;For in the same
						frame of mind as they are pained &lpar;at another's good
						fortune&rpar; they will rejoice in the contrary state of
						things&rdquo; &lpar;at another's bad fortune&rpar;.</note> So
					that if the judges are brought into that frame of mind, and those who claim
					their pity or any other boon are such as we have stated, it is plain that they
					will not obtain pity from those with whom the decision rests.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The frame of
					mind in which men feel emulation, what things and persons give rise to it, will
					be clear from the following considerations. Let us assume that emulation is a
					feeling of pain at the evident presence of highly valued goods, which are
					possible for us to obtain, in the possession of those who naturally resemble
					us&mdash;pain not due to the fact that another possesses them, but to the
					fact that we ourselves do not. Emulation therefore is virtuous and
					characteristic of virtuous men, whereas envy is base and characteristic of base
					men; for the one, owing to emulation, fits himself to obtain such goods, while
					the object of the other, owing to envy, is to prevent his neighbor possessing
					them. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1388b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Necessarily, then, those
					are emulous who hold that they have a claim to goods that they do not
					possess;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Something like
						&ldquo;although they are within their grasp&rdquo; is needed to
						complete the sense.</note> for no one claims what seems impossible.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Hence the young and high-minded are
					emulous. And so are those who possess such advantages as are worthy of honorable
					men, which include wealth, a number of friends, positions of office, and all
					similar things. For, believing it their duty to be good, because such goods
					naturally belong to those who are good, they strive to preserve them. And those
					are emulous, whom others think worthy of them. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Honors obtained by ancestors, kinsfolk, intimates, nation, or city make men
					emulous in regard to such honors; for they think that these honors really belong
					to them and that they are worthy of them. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And
					if highly valued goods are the object of emulation, it necessarily follows that
					the virtues must be such and all things that are useful and beneficial to the
					rest of mankind, for benefactors and virtuous men are honored; to these we may
					add all the goods which our neighbors can enjoy with us, such as wealth and
					beauty, rather than health.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Spending one's
						money benefits one's neighbor to a certain extent, and beauty is always
						pleasant to look upon. One does not admire anyone because he is in good
						health, so much as because he is handsome.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>It is also evident who are the objects of
					emulation; for they are those who possess these or similar goods, such as have
					already been spoken of, for instance, courage, wisdom, authority; for those in
					authority, such as generals, orators, and all who have similar powers, can do
					good to many. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And those whom many desire to be
					like, or to be their acquaintances<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or friends;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Who have many acquaintances or
						friends&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> those whom many or

						Greek historians &lpar;or rather
						&ldquo;chroniclers&rdquo;&rpar;, or the writers of speeches for
						use in the law courts, or of panegyrics.</note> The opposite characters we
					despise; for contempt is the opposite of emulation, and the idea of emulation of
					the idea of contempt. And those who are in a condition which makes them emulate,
					or be emulated by, others, must be inclined to despise those persons<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kai\ e)pi\
							tou/tois</foreign>. According to Cope, an unnecessary parenthetical note

						both <foreign lang="greek">tou/twn</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">tou/tois</foreign> to persons: &ldquo;tend to show contempt to or

						translation above is that they suffer from the want of &ldquo;the highly
						valued goods.&rdquo;</note> &lpar;and for that reason&rpar; who
					suffer from defects contrary to the good things which excite emulation. That is
					why we often despise those who are fortunate, whenever their good fortune is not
					accompanied by highly valued goods. The means of producing and destroying the
					various emotions in men, from which the methods of persuasion that concern them
					are derived, have now been stated.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us now

					mean anger, desire, and the like, of which we have already spoken; by habits
					virtues and vices, of which also we have previously spoken, as well as the kind

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The young, as to character, are ready to desire
					and to carry out what they desire. Of the bodily desires they chiefly obey those
					of sensual pleasure and these they are unable to control. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Changeable in their desires and soon tiring of them,
					they desire with extreme ardor, but soon cool; for their will, like the hunger
					and thirst of the sick, is keen rather than strong. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They are passionate, hot-tempered, and carried away by impulse, and
					unable to control their passion; for owing to their ambition they cannot endure
					to be slighted, and become indignant when they think they are being wronged.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>They are ambitious of honor, but more so of
					victory; for youth desires superiority, and victory is a kind of superiority.
					And their desire for both these is greater than their desire for money, to which
					they attach only the slightest value, because they have never yet experienced
					want, as Pittacus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">One of the Seven Wise Men of
						<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</note> said in his
					pithy remark on Amphiaraus. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They are not
					ill-natured but simple-natured,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or,
						&ldquo;they do not look at things in a bad light, but in a
						good,&rdquo; i.e., they are not always ready to suspect.</note> because
					they have never yet witnessed much depravity; confiding, because they have as
					yet not been often deceived; <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>full of hope, for
					they are naturally as hot-blooded as those who are drunken with wine, and
					besides they have<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>not yet experienced many failures. For
					the most part they live in hope, for hope is concerned with the future as memory
					is with the past. For the young the future is long, the past short; for in the
					morning of life it is not possible for them to remember anything, but they have
					everything to hope; which makes them easy to deceive, for they readily hope.
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And they are more courageous, for they are
					full of passion and hope, and the former of these prevents them fearing, while
					the latter inspires them with confidence, for no one fears when angry, and hope
					of some advantage inspires confidence. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And
					they are bashful, for as yet they fail to conceive of other things that are
					noble, but have been educated solely by convention.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Social convention is the only law that they know, and they
						are ashamed if they violate it, because as yet they have no idea of higher
						laws which may command them to do so.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>They are high-minded, for they have not yet
					been humbled by life nor have they experienced the force of necessity; further,
					there is high-mindedness in thinking oneself worthy of great things, a feeling
					which belongs to one who is full of hope.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>In their actions, they prefer the noble to the
					useful; their life is guided by their character<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> &ldquo;in the
						widest sense, includes all that is habitual and characteristic; in a limited
						sense, it expresses the habitual temper or disposition&rdquo;
						&lpar;Twining&rpar;.</note> rather than by calculation, for the
					latter aims at the useful, virtue at the noble. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>At this age more than any other they are fond of their friends and companions
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1389b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>because they take pleasure
					in living in company and as yet judge nothing by expediency, not even their
					friends. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>All their errors are due to excess
					and vehemence and their neglect of the maxim of Chilon,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">One of the Seven Wise Men of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. The maxim was <foreign lang="greek">*mhde\n
								a)/gan</foreign>, <emph>Ne quid nimis</emph>, Never go to extremes.</note>
					for they do everything to excess, love, hate, and everything else. And they
					think they know everything, and confidently affirm it, and this is the cause of
					their excess in everything. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>If they do wrong,
					it is due to insolence, not to wickedness. And they are inclined to pity,
					because they think all men are virtuous and better than themselves<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;better than they really
						are.&rdquo;</note>; for they measure their neighbors by their own
					inoffensiveness, so that they think that they suffer undeservedly. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>And they are fond of laughter, and therefore witty;
					for wit is cultured insolence. Such then is the character of the young.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Older men and
					those who have passed their prime have in most cases characters opposite to
					those of the young. For, owing to their having lived many years and having been
					more often deceived by others or made more mistakes themselves, and since most
					human things turn out badly, they are positive about nothing, and in everything
					they show an excessive lack of energy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They
					always &ldquo;think,&rdquo; but &ldquo;know&rdquo; nothing; and
					in their hesitation they always add &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; or
					&ldquo;maybe&rdquo;; all their<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>statements are of
					this kind, never unqualified. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They are
					malicious; for malice consists in looking upon the worse side of everything.
					Further, they are always suspicious owing to mistrust, and mistrustful owing to
					experience. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And neither their love nor their
					hatred is strong for the same reasons; but, according to the precept of
					Bias,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">One of the Seven Wise Men of
						<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</note> they love as if
					they would one day hate, and hate as if they would one day love. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And they are little-minded, because they have been
					humbled by life; for they desire nothing great or uncommon, but only the
					necessaries of life. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>They are not generous, for
					property is one of these necessaries, and at the same time, they know from
					experience how hard it is to get and how easy to lose. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And they are cowardly and inclined to anticipate evil, for their
					state of mind is the opposite of that of the young; they are chilled, whereas
					the young are hot, so that old age paves the way for cowardice, for fear is a
					kind of chill. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And they are fond of life,
					especially in their last days, because desire is directed towards that which is
					absent and men especially desire what they lack. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And they are unduly selfish, for this also is littleness of mind. And they
					live not for the noble, but for the useful, more than they ought, because they
					are selfish; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1390a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for the useful is
					a good for the individual, whereas the noble is good absolutely.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And they are rather shameless than modest; for
					since they do not care for the noble so much as for the useful, they pay little
					attention to what people think. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And they are
					little given to hope owing to their experience, for things that happen are
					mostly bad and at all events generally turn out for the worse, and also owing to
					their cowardice. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>They live in memory rather
					than in hope; for the life that remains to them is short, but that which is past
					is long, and hope belongs to the future, memory to the past. This is the reason
					of their loquacity; for they are incessantly talking of the past, because they
					take pleasure in recollection. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Their outbursts
					of anger are violent, but feeble; of their desires some have ceased, while
					others are weak, so that they neither feel them nor act in accordance with them,
					but only from motives of gain. Hence men of this age are regarded as
					self-controlled, for their desires have slackened, and they are slaves to gain.
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>In their manner of life there is more
					calculation than moral character, for calculation is concerned with that which
					is useful, moral character with virtue. If they commit acts of injustice it is
					due to vice rather than to insolence. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>The old,
					like the young, are inclined to pity, but not for the same reason; the latter
					show pity<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>from humanity, the former from weakness,
					because they think that they are on the point of suffering all kinds of
					misfortunes, and this is one of the reasons that incline men to pity. That is
					why the old are querulous, and neither witty nor fond of laughter; for a
					querulous disposition is the opposite of a love of laughter. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Such are the characters of the young and older men.
					Wherefore, since all men are willing to listen to speeches which harmonize with
					their own character and to speakers who resemble them,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;speeches which resemble &lpar;or
						reflect&rpar; it&rdquo; &lpar;their character&rpar;.</note>
					it is easy to see what language we must employ so that both ourselves and our
					speeches may appear to be of such and such a character.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It is evident
					that the character of those in the prime of life will be the mean between that
					of the other two, if the excess in each case be removed. At this age, men are
					neither over-confident, which would show rashness, nor too fearful, but
					preserving a right attitude in regard to both, <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>neither trusting nor distrusting all, but judging rather in accordance with
					actual facts. Their rule of conduct is neither the noble nor the useful alone,
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1390b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but both at once. They are
					neither parsimonious nor prodigal, but preserve the due mean. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It is the same in regard to passion and desire. Their
					self-control is combined with courage and their courage with self-control,
					whereas in the young and old these qualities are found separately; for the young
					are courageous but without self-control, the old are self-controlled but
					cowardly. Speaking generally, all the advantages that youth and old age possess
					separately, those in the prime of life possess combined; and all cases of excess
					or defect in the other two are replaced by due moderation and fitness.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The body is most fully developed from
					thirty to thirty-five years of age, the mind at about forty-nine. Let this
					suffice for youth, old age, and the prime of life, and the characters which
					belong to each.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us next
					speak of the goods that are due to fortune, all those, at least, which produce
					certain characters in men. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A characteristic of
					noble birth is that he who possesses it is more ambitious; for all men, when
					they start with any good, are accustomed to heap it up, and noble birth is a
					heritage of honor from one's ancestors. Such men are prone to look down even
					upon those who are as important as their ancestors,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>because the same things<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e., the advantages
						and distinctions the family possessed of old; such distinctions, when
						possessed by those of later date, are less thought of.</note> are more
					honorable and inspire greater vanity when remote than when they are recent.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The idea of noble birth refers to
					excellence of race, that of noble character to not degenerating from the family
					type, a quality not as a rule found in those of noble birth, most of whom are
					good for nothing. For in the generations of men there is a kind of crop as in
					the fruits of the field; sometimes, if the race is good, for a certain period
					men out of the common are born in it, and then it deteriorates. Highly gifted
					families often degenerate into maniacs, as, for example, the descendants of
					Alcibiades and the elder Dionysius; those that are stable into fools and
					dullards, like the descendants of Cimon, Pericles, and <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The characters
					which accompany wealth are plain for all to see. The wealthy are insolent and
					arrogant, being mentally affected by the acquisition of wealth, for they seem to
					think that they possess all good things; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1391a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for wealth is a kind of standard of value of everything
					else, so that everything seems purchasable by it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They are luxurious and swaggerers, luxurious because of their luxury
					and the display of their prosperity, swaggerers and ill-mannered because all men
					are accustomed to devote their attention to what they like and admire, and the
					rich suppose that what they themselves are emulous of is the object of all other
					men's emulation. At the same time this feeling is not unreasonable; for those
					who have need of the wealthy are many in number. Hence the answer of Simonides
					to the wife of Hiero concerning the wise and the rich, when she asked which was
					preferable, to be wise or to be rich. &ldquo;Rich,&rdquo; he answered,
					&ldquo;for we see the wise spending their time at the doors of the
					rich.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And the rich think they are
					worthy to rule, because they believe they possess that which makes them so.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;What makes power worth
						having&rdquo; &lpar;Cope&rpar;.</note> In a word, the character
					of the rich man is that of a fool favored by fortune. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At the same time there is a difference between the character of the
					newly rich and of those whose wealth is of long standing, because the former
					have the vices of wealth in a greater degree and more; for, so to say, they have
					not been educated to the use of wealth. Their unjust acts are not due to malice,
					but partly to insolence, partly to incontinence, which tends to make them commit
					assault and battery and adultery. <lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In regard to
					power, nearly all the characters to which it gives rise are equally clear; for
					power, compared with wealth, exhibits partly identical, and partly superior
					characteristics. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Thus, the powerful are more
					ambitious and more manly in character than the rich, since they aim at the
					performance of deeds which their power gives them the opportunity of carrying
					out. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And they are more energetic; for being
					obliged to look after their power, they are always on the watch.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">e)n
							e)pimelei/a|</foreign>: &ldquo;because they are
						administrators&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And they are dignified rather than heavily
					pompous; for their rank renders them more conspicuous, so that they avoid
					excess; and this dignity is a mild and decent pomposity. And their wrongdoings
					are never petty, but great.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Good fortune in its divisions<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The three divisions are noble birth, wealth, and power. The
					meaning is that the highest kinds of good fortune tend or converge to these
					&lpar;i.e., to noble birth, wealth, and power&rpar;. <foreign lang="greek">kata\ ta\ mo/ria</foreign> might also mean &ldquo;in
					part.&rdquo; Hobbes, in his <title>Brief of the Art of
						Rhetorick</title>, paraphrases: &ldquo;the manners of men that prosper,
					are compounded of the manners of the nobility, the rich, and those that are
					in power, for to some of these all prosperity appertains.&rdquo;</note>
					exhibits characters corresponding to those which have just been mentioned; for
					those which appear to be the most important kinds of good fortune tend in their
					direction; further, good fortune furnishes advantages over others in the
					blessing of children and bodily goods. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1391b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Now, although men are
					more arrogant and thoughtless owing to good fortune, it is accompanied by a most
					precious quality. Fortunate men stand in a certain relation to the divinity and
					love the gods, having confidence in them owing to the benefits they have
					received from fortune. We have spoken<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book
						2.12-14, 15-17.</note> of the characters associated with different ages and
					fortunes; the opposite characters to those described, for instance, of the poor,
					of the unfortunate, and of the weak, are obvious from their opposites.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Having dealt with ethical and pathetic proofs,
					Aristotle proceeds to the discussion of topics of enthymemes common to all
					three kinds of Rhetoric. The difficulty <emph>in the Greek</emph> lies in
					the absence of a suitable apodosis to the long sentence beginning <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\ de\ h( tw=n piqanw=n</foreign>. Grammatically, it
					might be <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste diwrisme/non a)\n ei)/h</foreign>, but
					it by no means follows that &ldquo;since the employment of persuasive
					speeches is directed towards a judgement . . . <emph>therefore</emph> it has
					been determined how . . . we must make our speeches ethical.&rdquo;
					Spengel, regarding <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\ de\ . . .
						bouleu/ontai</foreign> merely as an enlargement of Book 2.1, 2, brackets the
					passage. Cope suggests that something has fallen out after <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/ontai</foreign>: &ldquo;Since in all the three
					kinds of Rhetoric the object is to secure a judgement, &lsqb;I have
					shown how to put the judges into a certain frame of mind in the discussion
					of the characters and emotions&rsqb;. I have also spoken of the
					characters of the forms of government; so that this part of the subject need
					no longer detain us.&rdquo; It is generally agreed that we have not the
					chapter as originally arranged, although it is not supposed that any part of
					it is non-Aristotelian &lpar;see Cope and note in Jebb's
					translation&rpar;.</note> the employment of persuasive speeches is
					directed towards a judgement; for when a thing is known and judged, there is no
					longer any need of argument. And there is judgement, whether a speaker addresses
					himself to a single individual and makes use of his speech to exhort or
					dissuade, as those do who give advice or try to persuade, for this single
					individual is equally a judge, since, speaking generally, he who has to be
					persuaded is a judge; if the speaker is arguing against an opponent or against
					some theory, it is just the same, for it is necessary to make use of speech to
					destroy the opposing arguments, against which he speaks as if they were the
					actual opponent; and similarly in epideictic speeches, for the speech is put
					together with reference to the spectator as if he were a judge. Generally
					speaking, however, only he who decides questions at issue in civil
					controversies<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Both forensic and
						deliberative.</note> is a judge in the proper sense of the word, for in
					judicial cases the point at issue is the state of the case, in deliberative the
					subjects of deliberation.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;for
						in both forensic and deliberative arguments the issue is the state of the
						case.&rdquo;</note> We have already spoken of the characters of forms of
					government in treating<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>of deliberative rhetoric,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.8.</note> so that it has been determined
					how and by what means we must make our speeches conform to those characters.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now, since each kind of Rhetoric, as was
					said,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.3.</note> has its own special
					end, and in regard to all of them we have gathered popular opinions and premises
					whence men derive their proofs in deliberative, epideictic, and judicial
					speeches,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.4-8.</note> and, further,
					we have determined<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.9, 10-15.</note> the
					special rules according to which it is possible to make our speeches ethical, it
					only remains to discuss the topics common to the three kinds of rhetoric.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For all orators are obliged, in their
					speeches, also to make use of the topic of the possible and impossible, and to
					endeavor to show, some of them that a thing will happen, others that it has
					happened. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Further, the topic of magnitude is
					common to all kinds of Rhetoric, for all men employ extenuation or amplification
					whether deliberating, praising or blaming, accusing or defending. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1392a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When these topics have been determined, we will endeavor to say what
					we can in general about enthymemes and examples, in order that, when we have
					added what remains, we may carry out what we proposed at the outset. Now, of the
					commonplaces amplification is most appropriate to epideictic rhetoric, as has
					been stated;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">1.9.40. Amplication is to be
						understood of the exaggeration of both great and small things. It is most
						suited to epideictic oratory, in which there is no doubt as to the facts; so
						that it is only necessary to accentuate their importance or
						non-importance.</note> the past to forensic, since things past are the subject
					of judgement; and the possible and future to deliberative.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us first
					speak of the possible and the impossible. If of two contrary things it is
					possible that one should exist or come into existence, then it would seem that
					the other is equally possible; for instance, if a man can be cured, he can also
					be ill; for the potentiality of contraries, <emph>qua</emph> contraries, is the
					same.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">As a general rule, from their nature
						as contraries, although it may not be true in particular cases. If a man is
						ill, he may also be well, although in particular cases certain qualities may
						make him more liable to one or the other, e.g. he may suffer from an
						incurable disease &lpar;Schrader&rpar;.</note> Similarly, if of two
					like things the one is possible, so also is the other. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And if the harder of two things is possible, so also is the easier.
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And if it is possible for a thing to be
					made excellent or beautiful, <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>it is possible for
					it to be made in general; for it is harder for a beautiful house to be made than
					a mere house.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">An argument <emph>a
						fortiori.</emph> If a beautiful house can be built, so can a house of any
						kind; for this is easier.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Again, if the beginning is possible, so also is
					the end; for no impossible thing comes, or begins to come, into existence; for
					instance, that the diameter of a square should be commensurable with the side of
					a square is neither possible nor could be possible. And when the end is
					possible, so also is the beginning; for all things arise from a beginning.
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And if that which is subsequent in<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>being or generation can come into being, so then can
					that which is antecedent; for instance, if a man can come into being, so can a
					child, for the child is antecedent; and similarly, if a child can come into
					being, so can a man, for the child is a beginning. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And things which we love or desire naturally are possible; for as a
					rule no one loves the impossible or desires it. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And those things which form the subject of sciences or arts can also exist and
					come into existence. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And so with all those
					things, the productive principles of which reside in those things which we can
					control by force or persuasion, when they depend upon those whose superiors,
					masters, or friends we are. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And if the parts
					are possible, so also is the whole; and if the whole is possible, so also are
					the parts, speaking generally; for instance, if the front, toe-cap, and upper
					leather,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The meaning of the Greek words is
						quite uncertain.</note> can be made, then shoes can be made, and if shoes,
					then the above parts. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>And if the whole genus
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1392b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>is among things possible
					to be made, so is the species, and if the species, so the genus; for example, if
					a vessel can be built, so can a trireme, if a trireme can, so can a vessel.
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>If of two naturally corresponding things
					one is possible, so also is the other; for instance, if the double is possible,
					so is the half, if the half, so the double. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>If
					a thing can be made without art or preparation, much the more can it be made
					with the help of art and carefulness. Whence it was said by Agathon<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><title>T.G.F.</title> p. 765.</note>: <quote>
							<lg type="iamb">
								<l>And moreover we have to do some things by art, while others fall to
									our lot by compulsion or chance.</l>
							</lg>
						</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>And if a thing is possible for those who are
					inferior, or weaker, or less intelligent, it will be still more so for those
					whose qualities are the opposite; as Isocrates said, it would be very strange if
					he were unable by himself to find out what Euthynus had learnt &lsqb;with
					the help of others&rsqb;. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>As for the
					impossible, it is clear that there is a supply of arguments to be derived from
					the opposite of what has been said about the possible.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>The question whether a thing has or has not
					happened must be considered from the following points of view. <milestone unit="section" n="17"/>In the first place, if that which is naturally less
					likely has happened, then that which is more likely will most probably have
					happened. If that which usually happens afterwards has happened, then that which
					precedes must also have happened; for instance, if a man has forgotten a thing,
					he must once have learnt it. <milestone unit="section" n="18"/>If a man was able
					and wished to do a thing, he has done it; for all men<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>do
					a thing, when they are able and resolve to do it, for nothing hinders them.
					<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Further, if a man wished to do it and
					there was no external obstacle; if he was able to do it and was in a state of
					anger; if he was able and desired to do it; for men as a rule, whenever they
					can, do those things which they long for, the vicious owing to want of
					self-control, the virtuous because they desire what is good. <milestone unit="section" n="20"/>And if anything was on the point of being done, it
					most probably was done; for it is likely that one who was on the point of doing
					something has carried it out. <milestone unit="section" n="21"/>And if all the
					natural antecedents or causes of a thing have happened; for instance, if it has
					lightened, it has also thundered; and if a man has already attempted a crime, he
					has also committed it. And if all the natural consequences or motives of actions
					have happened, then the antecedent or the cause has happened; for instance, if
					it has thundered, it has also lightened, and if a man has committed a crime, he
					has also attempted it. <milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Of all these things
					some are so related necessarily, others only as a general rule. To establish
					that a thing has not happened, it is evident that our argument must be derived
					from the opposite of what has been said. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1393a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>In regard to the future, it is clear that one
					can argue in the same way; for if we are able and wish to do a thing, it will be
					done; and so too will those things which desire, anger, and reasoning urge us to
					do, if we have the power. For this reason also, if a man has an eager desire, or
					intention, of doing a thing, it will probably be done; since, as a rule, things
					that are about to happen are more likely to happen than those which are not.
					<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>And if all the natural antecedents have
					happened; for instance, if the sky is cloudy, it will probably rain. <milestone unit="section" n="25"/>And if one thing has been done with a view to
					another, it is probable that the latter will also be done; for instance, if a
					foundation has been laid, a house will probably be built.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>What we have previously said clearly shows the
					nature of the greatness and smallness of things, of the greater and less, and of
					things great and small generally. For, when treating of deliberative
					rhetoric,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 1.7.</note> we spoke of
					greatness of goods, and of the greater and less generally. Therefore, since in
					each branch of Rhetoric the end set before it is a good, such as the expedient,
					the noble, or the just, it is evident that all must take the materials of
					amplification from these. <milestone unit="section" n="27"/>To make any further
					inquiry as to magnitude and superiority absolutely would be waste of words; for
					the particular has more authority than the general for practical purposes.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>Let this suffice for the possible and impossible; for
					the question whether a thing has happened, or will happen, or not; and for the
					greatness or smallness of things.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It remains to
					speak of the proofs common to all branches of Rhetoric, since the particular
					proofs have been discussed. These common proofs are of two kinds, example and
					enthymeme &lpar;for the maxim is part of an enthymeme&rpar;. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let us then first speak of the example; for the
					example resembles induction, and induction is a beginning.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">As a starting-point and first principle of knowledge.</note></p>
				<p>There are two kinds of examples; namely, one which consists in relating things
					that have happened before, and another in inventing them oneself. The latter are
					subdivided into comparisons or fables, <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>such as
					those of Aesop and the Libyan.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The Libyan
						fables were of African origin. They are mentioned by Quintilian
						&lpar;<bibl n="Quint. Inst. 5.11.20">Quint. Inst. Orat.
							5.11.20</bibl>&rpar; and belonged to the class of animal
						fables.</note> It would be an instance of the historical kind of example, if one
					were to say that it is necessary to make preparations against the Great King and
					not to allow him to subdue <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; for
					Darius did not cross over to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>
					until he had obtained possession of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1393b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>but as
					soon as he had done so, he did. Again, Xerxes did not attack us until he had
					obtained possession of that country, but when he had, he crossed over;
					consequently, if the present Great King shall do the same, he will cross over,
					wherefore it must not be allowed. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Comparison is
					illustrated by the sayings of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>; for instance, if one were to say that
					magistrates should not be chosen by lot, for this would be the same as choosing
					as representative athletes not those competent to contend, but those on whom the
					lot falls; or as choosing any of the sailors as the man who should take the
					helm, as if it were right that the choice should be decided by lot, not by a
					man's knowledge.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="greek">parabolh/</foreign> as understood by Aristotle is a comparison and
						application of cases easily supposable and such as occur in real life, for
						the purpose of illustrating the point in question; the fable, on the other
						hand, is pure fiction.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A fable, to give an example, is that of
					Stesichorus concerning Phalaris, or that of Aesop on behalf of the demagogue.
					For Stesichorus, when the people of Himera had chosen Phalaris dictator and were
					on the point of giving him a body-guard, after many arguments related a fable to
					them: &ldquo;A horse was in sole occupation of a meadow. A stag having come
					and done much damage to the pasture, the horse, wishing to avenge himself on the
					stag, asked a man whether he could help him to punish the stag. The man
					consented, on condition that the horse submitted to the bit and allowed him to
					mount him javelins in hand. The horse agreed to the terms and the man mounted
					him, but instead of obtaining vengeance on the stag, the horse from that time
					became the man's slave. So then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you take care
					lest, in your desire to avenge yourselves on the enemy,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>you be treated like the horse. You already have the bit, since you have chosen
					a dictator; if you give him a body-guard and allow him to mount you, you will at
					once be the slaves of Phalaris.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Aesop, when defending at <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> a
					demagogue who was being tried for his life, related the following anecdote.
					&ldquo;A fox, while crossing a river, was driven into a ravine. Being unable
					to get out, she was for a long time in sore distress, and a number of dog-fleas
					clung to her skin. A hedgehog, wandering about, saw her and, moved with
					compassion, asked her if he should remove the fleas. The fox refused and when
					the hedgehog asked the reason, she answered: &lsquo;They are already full of
					me and draw little blood; but if you take them away, others will come that are
					hungry and will drain what remains to me.&rsquo; You in like manner, O
					Samians, will suffer no more harm from this man, for he is wealthy; but if you
					put him to death, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1394a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>others will
					come who are poor, who will steal and squander your public funds.&rdquo;
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Fables are suitable for public speaking,
					and they have this advantage that, while it is difficult to find similar things
					that have really happened in the past, it is easier to invent fables; for they
					must be invented, like comparisons, if a man is capable of seizing the analogy;
					and this is easy if one studies philosophy.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Literary knowledge&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;;
						&ldquo;literature&rdquo; &lpar;Cope, Introd. p. 256, who,
						however, in his annotated ed. explains: &ldquo;intellectual study and
						mental exercises in general&rdquo;&rpar;.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Thus, while the lessons conveyed by fables are
					easier to provide, those derived from facts are more useful for deliberative
					oratory, because as a rule the future resembles the past.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>If we have no enthymemes, we must employ
					examples as demonstrative proofs, for conviction is produced by these; but if we
					have them, examples must be used as evidence and as a kind of epilogue to the
					enthymemes.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">If we have no enthymemes, we
						must use examples instead of them; for they are useful for persuasion,
						although they do not really demonstrate anything. If we have enthymemes, we
						must use examples in corroboration of them &lpar;see 21.3
						note&rpar;.</note> For if they stand first, they resemble induction, and
					induction is not suitable to rhetorical speeches except in very few cases; if
					they stand last they resemble evidence, and a witness is in every case likely to
					induce belief. Wherefore also it is necessary to quote a number of examples if
					they are put first, but one alone is sufficient if they are put last; for even a
					single trustworthy witness is of use. We have thus stated how many kinds of
					examples there are, and how and when they should be made use of.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="21"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In regard to
					the use of maxims, it will most readily be evident<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>on
					what subjects, and on what occasions, and by whom it is appropriate that maxims
					should be employed in speeches, after a maxim has been defined. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now, a maxim is a statement, not however concerning
					particulars, as, for instance, what sort of a man Iphicrates was, but general;
					it does not even deal with all general things, as for instance that the straight
					is the opposite of the crooked, but with the objects of human actions, and with
					what should be chosen or avoided with reference to them. And as the enthymeme
					is, we may say,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Putting the comma after
						<foreign lang="greek">sxedo/n</foreign>.</note> the syllogism dealing
					with such things, maxims are the premises or conclusions of enthymemes without
					the syllogism. For example: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>No man who is sensible ought to have his children taught to be
								excessively clever,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Eur. Med. 294-297">Eur. Med. 294-297</bibl>.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> is a maxim; but when the why and the wherefore are added, the whole
					makes an enthymeme; for instance, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>for, not to speak of the charge of idleness brought against
								them,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;The idle
									habits which they contract&rdquo;
									&lpar;Cope&rpar;.</note> they earn jealous hostility from
								the citizens.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1394b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Another example: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>There is no man who is happy in everything;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Euripides, <title>Stheneboea</title>
								&lpar;frag. 661, <title>T.G.F.</title>&rpar;.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> or, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>There is no man who is really free.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> The latter is a maxim, but taken with the next verse it is an
					enthymeme: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>for he is the slave of either wealth or fortune.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Eur. Hec. 864">Eur. Hec.
									864-865</bibl>.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now, if a maxim is what we have stated, it
					follows that maxims are of four kinds; for they are either accompanied by an
					epilogue or not.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Maxims with an epilogue are
						&lpar;1&rpar; imperfect enthymemes, or &lpar;2&rpar;
						enthymematic in character, but not in form; those without an epilogue are
						&lpar;1&rpar; such as are well known, or &lpar;2&rpar; such
						as are clear as soon as they are uttered.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now all those that state anything that is
					contrary to the general opinion or is a matter of dispute, need demonstrative
					proof; but those that do not, need no epilogue,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Something added as a supplementary proof, the why and the
						wherefore; in Book 3.19 it is used for the peroration of a speech.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>either because they are already known, as, for
					instance, <quote>
						<lg type="troch">
							<l>Health is a most excellent thing for a man, at least in our
								opinion,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">From Simonides or
									Epicharmus.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> for this is generally agreed; or because, no sooner are they uttered
					than they are clear to those who consider them, for instance, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>He is no lover who does not love always.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Eur. Tro. 1051">Eur. Tro.
									1051</bibl>.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>As for the maxims that are accompanied by an
					epilogue, some form part of an enthymeme, as <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>No one who is sensible, etc.,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">See
								sect. 2.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote><lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>while others are enthymematic, but are not part
					of an enthymeme;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">They partake of the nature
						of, but not of the form of, enthymemes.</note> and these are most highly
					esteemed. Such are those maxims in which the reason of what is said is apparent:
					for instance, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>Being a mortal, do not nourish immortal wrath;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Author unknown &lpar;<title>T.G.F.</title> p.
								854&rpar;.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> to say that one should not always nourish immortal wrath is a maxim,
					but the addition &ldquo;being a mortal&rdquo; states the reason. It is
					the same with <quote>
						<lg type="troch">
							<l>A mortal should have mortal, not immortal thoughts.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">According to <persName><surname>Bentley</surname></persName>, from
								Epicharmus.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>It is evident, therefore, from what has been
					said, how many kinds of maxims there are, and to what it is appropriate to apply
					them in each case. For in the case of matters of dispute or what is contrary to
					the general opinion, the epilogue is necessary; but either the epilogue may be
					put first and the conclusion used as a maxim, as, for example, if one were to
					say, &ldquo;As for me, since one ought neither to be the object of jealousy
					nor to be idle, I say that children ought not to be educated&rdquo;; or put
					the maxim first and append the epilogue. In all cases where the statements made,
					although not paradoxical, are obscure, the reason should be added as concisely
					as possible. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In such cases Laconic apophthegms
					and riddling sayings are suitable; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1395a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>as, for instance, to say what Stesichorus said to the Locrians, that
					they ought not to be insolent, lest their cicadas should be forced to chirp from
					the ground.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Meaning that the land would be
						devastated and the trees cut down.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The use of maxims is suitable for one who is
					advanced in years, and in regard to things in which one has experience; since
					the use of maxims before such an age is unseemly, as also is story-telling; and
					to speak about things of which one has no experience shows foolishness and lack
					of education. A sufficient proof of this is that rustics especially are fond of
					coining maxims and ready to make display of them.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>To express in general terms what is not general
					is especially suitable in complaint or exaggeration, and then either at the
					beginning or after the demonstration. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>One
					should even make use of common and frequently quoted maxims, if they are useful;
					for because they are common, they seem to be true, since all as it were
					acknowledge them as such; for instance, one who is exhorting his soldiers to
					brave danger before having sacrificed may say, <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>The best of omens is to defend one's country,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 12.243">Hom. Il.
									12.243</bibl>.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> and if they are inferior in numbers, <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>The chances of war are the same for both,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.309">Hom. Il.
									18.309</bibl>.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> and if advising them to destroy the children of the enemy even though
					they are innocent of wrong, <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>Foolish is he who, having slain the father, suffers the children to
								live.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">1.15.14.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Further, some proverbs are also maxims; for
					example,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>&ldquo;An Attic
					neighbor.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.70">Thuc. 1.70</bibl>, where the Corinthians complain of the
						lack of energy shown by the Spartans, as compared with their own restless
						and troublesome neighbors, the Athenians.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Maxims should also be used even when contrary
					to the most popular sayings, such as &ldquo;Know thyself&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;Nothing in excess,&rdquo; either when one's character is thereby
					likely to appear better, or if they are expressed in the language of passion. It
					would be an instance of the latter if a man in a rage were to say, &ldquo;It
					is not true that a man should know himself; at any rate, such a man as this, if
					he had known himself, would never have claimed the chief command.&rdquo; And
					one's character would appear better, if one were to say that it is not right, as
					men say, to love as if one were bound to hate, but rather to hate as if one were
					bound to love. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The moral purpose also should
					be made clear by the language, or else one should add the reason; for example,
					either by saying &ldquo;that it is right to love, not as men say, but as if
					one were going to love for ever, for the other kind of love would imply
					treachery&rdquo;; or thus, &ldquo;The maxim does not please me, for the
					true friend should love as if he were going to love for ever. Nor do I approve
					the maxim &lsquo;Nothing in excess,&rsquo; for one cannot hate the
					wicked too much.&rdquo; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1395b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Further, maxims are of great assistance to
					speakers, first, because of the vulgarity<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Want of cultivation and intelligence&rdquo;
						&lpar;Cope&rpar;. &ldquo;<emph>Amour-propre</emph>&rdquo;
						&lpar;St. Hilaire&rpar;.</note> of the hearers, who are pleased if
					an orator, speaking generally, hits upon the opinions which they specially
					hold.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In reference to their own particular
						case.</note> What I mean will be clear from the following, and also how one
					should hunt for maxims. The maxim, as we have said, is a statement of the
					general; accordingly, the hearers are pleased to hear stated in general terms
					the opinion which they have already specially formed. For instance, a man who
					happened to have bad neighbors or children would welcome any one's statement
					that nothing is more troublesome than neighbors or more stupid than to beget
					children. Wherefore the speaker should endeavor to guess how his hearers formed
					their preconceived opinions and what they are, and then express himself in
					general terms in regard to them. <milestone unit="section" n="16"/>This is one
					of the advantages of the use of maxims, but another is greater; for it makes
					speeches ethical. Speeches have this character, in which the moral purpose is
					clear. And this is the effect of all maxims, because he who employs them in a
					general manner declares his moral preferences; if then the maxims are good, they
					show the speaker also to be a man of good character. Let this suffice for what
					we had to say concerning maxims, their nature, how many kinds of them there are,
					the way they should be used, and what their advantages are. <lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="22"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let us now
					speak of enthymemes in general and the manner of looking for them, and next of
					their topics; for each of these things is different in kind. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>We have already said that the enthymeme is a kind of
					syllogism, what makes it so, and in what it differs from the dialectic
					syllogisms; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for the conclusion must neither be
					drawn from too far back<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The conclusion must
						not be reached by means of a long series of arguments, as it were strung
						together in a chain: cp. 1.2.12, where the hearers are spoken of as unable
						to take in at a glance a long series of arguments or &ldquo;to follow a
						long chain of reasoning&rdquo; &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\
							logi/zesqai po/rrwqen</foreign>&rpar;.</note> nor should it include
					all the steps of the argument. In the first case its length causes obscurity, in
					the second, it is simply a waste of words, because it states much that is
					obvious. It is this that makes the ignorant more persuasive than the educated in
					the presence of crowds; as the poets say, &ldquo;the ignorant are more
					skilled at speaking before a mob.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 989">Eur. Hipp. 989</bibl>.</note> For the educated
					use commonplaces and generalities, whereas the ignorant speak of what they know
					and of what more nearly concerns the audience. Wherefore one must not argue from
					all possible opinions, but only from such as are definite and admitted, for
					instance, either by the judges themselves or by those of whose judgement they
					approve. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1396a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Further, it should be
					clear that this is the opinion of all or most of the hearers; and again,
					conclusions should not be drawn from necessary premises alone, but also from
					those which are only true as a rule.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>First of all, then, it must be understood that,
					in regard to the subject of our speech or reasoning, whether it be political or
					of any other kind, it is necessary to be also acquainted with the elements of
					the question, either entirely or in part; for if you know none of these things,
					you will have nothing from which to draw a conclusion. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>I should like to know, for instance, how we are to give advice to the
					Athenians as to making war or not, if we do not know in what their strength
					consists, whether it is naval, military, or both, how great it is, their sources
					of revenue, their friends and enemies, and further, what wars they have already
					waged, with what success, and all similar things?<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Again, how could we praise them, if we did not know of the naval engagement at
					<placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> or the battle of Marathon,
					or what they did for the Heraclidae, and other similar things? for men always
					base their praise upon what really are, or are thought to be, glorious deeds.
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Similarly, they base their censure upon
					actions that are contrary to these, examining whether those censured have
					really, or seem to have, committed them; for example, that the Athenians
					subjugated the Greeks, and reduced to slavery the Aeginetans and Potidaeans<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>who had fought with distinction on their side against
					the barbarians, and all such acts, and whatever other similar offences may have
					been committed by them. Similarly, in accusation and defence, speakers argue
					from an examination of the circumstances of the case. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>It makes no difference in doing this, whether it is a question of
					Athenians or Lacedaemonians, of a man or a god. For, when advising Achilles,
					praising or censuring, accusing or defending him, we must grasp all that really
					belongs, or appears to belong to him, in order that we may praise or censure in
					accordance with this, if there is anything noble or disgraceful; defend or
					accuse, if there is anything just or unjust; advise, if there is anything
					expedient or harmful. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And similarly in regard
					to any subject whatever. For instance, in regard to justice, whether it is good
					or not, we must consider the question in the light of what is inherent in
					justice or the good.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Therefore, since it is evident that all men
					follow this procedure in demonstration, whether they reason strictly <pb ed="Bekker" n="1396b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>or loosely&mdash;since
					they do not derive their arguments from all things indiscriminately, but from
					what is inherent in each particular subject, and reason makes it clear that it
					is impossible to prove anything in any other way<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;by means of the <emph>speech</emph> it is
						impossible to prove anything otherwise&rdquo;
						&lpar;Cope&rpar;.</note>&mdash;it is evidently necessary, as has
					been stated in the <title>Topics</title>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Top. 1.14">Aristot. Top. 1.14</bibl>. <foreign lang="greek">prw=ton</foreign>: i.e. &ldquo;the speaker's chief care
						should be . . .&rdquo;</note> to have first on each subject a selection
					of premises about probabilities and what is most suitable. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>As for those to be used in sudden emergencies, the
					same method of inquiry must be adopted; we must look, not at what is indefinite
					but at what is inherent in the subject treated of in the speech, marking off as
					many facts as possible, particularly those intimately connected with the
					subject; for the more facts one has, the easier it is to demonstrate, and the
					more closely connected they are with the subject, the more suitable are they and
					less common.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The more suitable they will be,
						and the less they will resemble ordinary, trivial generalities.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>By common I mean, for instance, praising
					Achilles because he is a man, or one of the demigods, or because he went on the
					expedition against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; for this is
					applicable to many others as well, so that such praise is no more suited to
					Achilles than to Diomedes. By particular I mean what belongs to Achilles, but to
					no one else; for instance, to have slain Hector, the bravest of the Trojans, and
					Cycnus, who prevented all the Greeks from disembarking, being invulnerable; to
					have gone to the war when very young, and without having taken the oath; and all
					such things.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>One method of selection then, and this the
					first, is the topical.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>Let us now speak of the elements
					of enthymemes &lpar;by element and topic of enthymeme I mean the same
					thing&rpar;. But let us first make some necessary remarks. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>There are two kinds of enthymemes, the one
					demonstrative, which proves that a thing is or is not, and the other refutative,
					the two differing like refutation and syllogism in Dialectic. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>The demonstrative enthymeme draws conclusions from
					admitted premises, the refutative draws conclusions disputed by the
					adversary.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The demonstrative enthymeme
						draws its conclusion from facts admitted by the opponent; the refutative
						draws its conclusion from the same, but the conclusion is one which is
						disputed by the opponent.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>We know nearly all the general heads of each
					of the special topics that are useful or necessary; for the propositions
					relating to each have been selected, so that we have in like manner already
					established all the topics from which enthymemes may be derived on the subject

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="23"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>One topic of

					is;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Assuming that self-control is good,

					<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Another topic is derived from similar
					inflections, for in like manner the derivatives must either be predicable of the
					subject or not; for instance, that the just is not entirely good, for in that
					case good would be predicable of anything that happens justly; but to be justly
					put to death is not desirable.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Another topic is derived from relative terms.
					For if to have done rightly or justly may be predicated of one, then to have
					suffered similarly may be predicated of the other; there is the same relation
					between having ordered and having carried out, as Diomedon the tax-gatherer said
					about the taxes, &ldquo;If selling is not disgraceful for you, neither is
					buying disgraceful for us.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The
						argument is that if there was no disgrace in selling the right of farming
						the taxes, there could be none in purchasing this right.</note> And if
					rightly or justly can be predicated of the sufferer, it can equally be
					predicated of the one who inflicts suffering; if of the latter, then also of the
					former. However, in this there is room for a fallacy. For if a man has suffered
					justly, he has suffered justly, but perhaps not at your hands. Wherefore one
					must consider separately whether the sufferer deserves to suffer, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1397b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and whether he who inflicts
					suffering is the right person to do so, and then make use of the argument either
					way; for sometimes there is a difference in such a case, and nothing prevents
					&lsqb;its being argued&rsqb;, as in the <title>Alcmaeon</title> of
					Theodectes<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Pupil of Plato and Isocrates,
						great friend of Aristotle, the author of fifty tragedies and also of an
						&ldquo;Art&rdquo; of Rhetoric. Alcmaeon murdered his mother
						Eriphyle. Alphesiboea, his wife, says to him, Was not your mother hated? To
						this he replied, Yes, but there is a distinction; they said she deserved to

						<lg type="iamb">

					</quote> Another example may be found in the trial of Demosthenes and those who
					slew Nicanor.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Nothing is known of this

					injustice.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Another topic is derived from the more and less.
					For instance, if not even the gods know everything, hardly can men; for this
					amounts to saying that if a predicate, which is more probably affirmable of one
					thing, does not belong to it, it is clear that it does not belong to another of
					which it is less probably affirmable. And to say that a man who beats his father
					also beats his neighbors, is an instance of the rule that, if the less exists,
					the more also exists.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The argument is that
						since men beat their fathers less commonly than they do their neighbors, if
						they beat their fathers they will also beat their neighbors, and the
						<persName><surname>Paris</surname></persName> ms. in a longer form of
						this argument has an explanatory addition to this effect, inserting after
						<foreign lang="greek">u(pa/rxei</foreign> the words <foreign lang="greek">tou\s ga\r pate/ras h(=tton tu/ptousin h)\ tou\s

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Another topic is derived from the consideration
					of time. Thus Iphicrates, in his speech against Harmodius, says: &ldquo;If,
					before accomplishing anything, I had demanded the statue from you in the event
					of my success, you would have granted it; will you then refuse it, now that I
					have succeeded? Do not therefore make a promise when you expect something, and

					Philip to pass through their territory into <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1398a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>they were
					told that &ldquo;if he had made this request before helping them against the
					Phocians, they would have promised; it would be absurd, therefore, if they
					refused to let him through now, because he had thrown away his opportunity and
					had trusted them.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Another topic consists in turning upon the
					opponent what has been said against ourselves; and this is an excellent
					method.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;the ways of doing
						this are various&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> For instance,
					in the <title>Teucer</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The illustration
						is lost or perhaps purposely omitted as well known. The
						<title>Teucer</title> was a tragedy of Sophocles.</note> . . . and
					Iphicrates employed it against Aristophon, when he asked him whether he would
					have betrayed the fleet for a bribe; when Aristophon said no,
					&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; retorted Iphicrates, &ldquo;if you, Aristophon,
					would not have betrayed it, would I, Iphicrates, have done so?&rdquo; But
					the opponent must be a man who seems the more likely to have committed a crime;
					otherwise, it would appear ridiculous, if anyone were to make use of such an
					argument in reference to such an opponent, for instance, as Aristides<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">It would be absurd to use such an argument
						against the accusation of a &ldquo;just man&rdquo; like Aristides,
						and to pretend that he is more likely to have committed the crime. It must
						only be used when the opponent's character is suspect, and lends itself to
						such a retort.</note>; it should only be used to discredit the accuser. For
					in general the accuser aspires to be better than the defendant; accordingly, it
					must always be shown that this is not the case. And generally, it is ridiculous
					for a man to reproach others for what he does or would do himself, or to
					encourage others to do what he does not or would not do himself.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Another topic is derived from definition. For
					instance, that the <emph>daimonion</emph><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The
						reference is obviously to <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, who claimed that a
						<emph>daimonion</emph> &lpar;a certain divine principle that acted as
						his internal monitor&rpar; checked his action in many cases. When
						accused of not believing in the gods, he was able to prove, by his
						definition of the <emph>daimonion</emph>, that he was no atheist. Similarly,
						Iphicrates, by his definition of <foreign lang="greek">gennai=os</foreign>
						and <foreign lang="greek">suggenh/s</foreign> could refute the allegation
						that he was ignoble and show that his deeds were more akin to those of
						Harmodius and Aristogiton than to those of his opponents. <persName><surname>Paris</surname></persName> could say that he was not
						intemperate, because he was satisfied with Helen alone. Lastly, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>
						refused an invitation to visit Archelaus, king of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, because he would be unable to
						return the benefits received, which would imply his being put to shame, and
						make the invitation a kind of insult.</note> is nothing else than a god or
					the work of a god; but he who thinks it to be the work of a god necessarily
					thinks that gods exist. When Iphicrates desired to prove that the best man is
					the noblest, he declared that there was nothing noble attaching to Harmodius and
					Aristogiton, before they did something<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>noble; and,
					&ldquo;I myself am more akin to them than you; at any rate, my deeds are
					more akin to theirs than yours.&rdquo; And as it is said in the
					Alexander<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of Polycrates.</note> that it
					would be generally admitted that men of disorderly passions are not satisfied
					with the enjoyment of one woman's person alone. Also, the reason why <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>
					refused to visit Archelaus, declaring that it was disgraceful not to be in a
					position to return a favor as well as an injury.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Just as it is to requite them with evil&rdquo;
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> In all these cases, it is by definition and
					the knowledge of what the thing is in itself that conclusions are drawn upon the
					subject in question.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Another topic is derived from the different
					significations of a word, as explained in the <title>Topics</title>, where the
					correct use of these terms has been discussed.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Supplying <foreign lang="greek">&lsqb;lele/ktai&rsqb; peri\ tou=

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Another, from division. For example,
					&ldquo;There are always three motives for wrongdoing; two are excluded from
					consideration as impossible; as for the third, not even the accusers assert
					it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Another, from induction. For instance, from the
					case of the woman of Peparethus, it is argued that in matters of parentage women
					always discern the truth; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1398b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>similarly, at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, when Mantias
					the orator was litigating with his son, the mother declared the truth;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Mantias had one legitimate son Mantitheus and

					Thettaliscus being accordingly recognized as the son of Ismenias. There is
					another instance in the &ldquo;law&rdquo; of Theodectes: &ldquo;If
					we do not entrust our own horses to those who have neglected the horses of
					others, or our ships to those who have upset the ships of others; then, if this
					is so in all cases, we must not entrust our own safety to those who have failed
					to preserve the safety of others.&rdquo; Similarly, in order to prove that
					men of talent are everywhere honored, Alcidamas said: &ldquo;The Parians
					honored Archilochus, in spite of his evil-speaking; the Chians Homer, although

					.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Something has fallen out, what follows

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Another topic is that from a previous judgement
					in regard to the same or a similar or contrary matter, if possible when the

					that of the majority, or of the wise, either all or most, or of the good; or of
					the judges themselves or of those whose judgement they accept, or of those whose

					himself too presumptuously, said, &ldquo;Our friend at any rate never spoke
					like that,&rdquo; referring to <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>. Hegesippus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The story is told of Agesipolis &lpar;which others read

						&lpar;one of the Spartan kings&rpar; consulted the oracle of Zeus at
						<placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName> to ask whether he
						was to respect such a truce. The reply of the oracle was that he might

						&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Apollo. Agesipolis thereupon

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Another topic is that from enumerating the
					parts, as in the <title>Topics</title>: What kind of movement is the soul? for
					it must be this or that.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">If the genus can be
						affirmed of any subject, then one or other of the species, which make up the

						is, the soul is moved, it is necessary to examine whether any of the
						different kinds of motion &lpar;increase, decrease, decay, change of
						place, generation, alteration&rpar; can be predicated of the soul. If
						not, the generic predicate is not applicable, and the proposition is
						refuted.</note> There is an instance of this in the <title>Socrates</title>
					of Theodectes: &ldquo;What holy place has he profaned? Which of the gods

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Again, since in most human affairs the same
					thing is accompanied by some bad or good result, another topic consists in
					employing the consequence to exhort or dissuade, accuse or defend, praise or
					blame. For instance, education is attended by the evil of being envied, and by
					the good of being wise; therefore we should not be educated, for we should avoid
					being envied; nay rather, we <emph>should</emph> be educated, for we should be
					wise. This topic is identical with the &ldquo;Art&rdquo; of Callippus,
					when you have also included the topic of the possible and the others which have
					been mentioned.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Another topic may be employed when it is
					necessary to exhort or dissuade<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>in regard to two
					opposites, and one has to employ the method previously stated in the case of
					both. But there is this difference, that in the former case things of any kind
					whatever are opposed, in the latter opposites. For instance, a priestess refused
					to allow her son to speak in public; &ldquo;For if,&rdquo; said she,
					&ldquo;you say what is just, men will hate you; if you say what is unjust,
					the gods will.&rdquo; On the other hand, &ldquo;you <emph>should</emph>
					speak in public; for if you say what is just, the gods will love you, if you say
					what is unjust, men will.&rdquo; This is the same as the proverb,
					&ldquo;To buy the swamp with the salt&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The bad with the good. The exact meaning of <foreign lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> has not been satisfactorily explained.
						In the definition given of the retortion of a dilemma, the two opposite
						things would be speaking truth or untruth; the two opposite consequences,
						pleasing men and pleasing God.</note>; and retorting a dilemma on its
					proposer takes place when, two things being opposite, good and evil follow on
					each, the good and evil being opposite like the things themselves.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="16"/>Again, since men do not praise the same things
					in public and in secret, but in public chiefly praise what is just and
					beautiful, and in secret rather wish for what is expedient, another topic
					consists in endeavoring to infer its opposite from one or other of these
					statements.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">e.g. a man may
						<emph>say</emph> that an honorable death should be preferred to a pleasant
						life, and honest poverty to ill-acquired wealth, whereas really he
						<emph>wishes</emph> the opposite. &ldquo;If then his words are in
						accordance with his real wishes, he must be confronted with his public
						statements; if they are in accordance with the latter, he must be confronted

					the most weighty of those that deal with paradox.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="17"/>Another topic is derived from analogy in
					things. For instance, Iphicrates, when they tried to force his son to perform
					public services because he was tall, although under the legal age, said:
					&ldquo;If you consider tall boys men, you must vote that short men are
					boys.&rdquo; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1399b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Similarly,
					Theodectes in his &ldquo;law,&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This &ldquo;law&rdquo; &lpar;already mentioned in
						23.11&rpar; is said to have been an oration on the legal position of

					citizenship upon mercenaries such as Strabax and Charidemus on account of their
					merits, will you not banish those of them who have wrought such irreparable
					misfortunes?&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="18"/>Another topic consists in concluding the
					identity of antecedents from the identity of results.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cause and effect.</note> Thus Xenophanes said:
					&ldquo;There is as much impiety in asserting that the gods are born as in
					saying that they die; for either way the result is that at some time or other
					they did not exist.&rdquo; And, generally speaking, one may always regard as
					identical the results produced by one or other of any two things: &ldquo;You
					are about to decide, not about Isocrates alone, but about education generally,
					whether it is right to study philosophy.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Isoc. 15.173">Isoc. 15.173</bibl>.</note> And,

					orders.&rdquo; Of two alternatives, you should take that which is useful.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="19"/>Another topic is derived from the fact that the
					same men do not always choose the same thing before and after, but the contrary.
					The following enthymeme is an example: &ldquo;If, when in exile, we fought
					to return to our country &lsqb;it would be monstrous&rsqb; if, now that
					we have returned, we were to return to exile to avoid fighting&rdquo;!<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Lys. 34.11">Lys. 34.11</bibl>.</note>

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="20"/>Another topic consists in maintaining that the

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="21"/>Another topic common to forensic and
					deliberative rhetoric consists in examining what is hortatory and dissuasive,
					and the reasons which make men act or not. Now, these are the reasons which, if
					they exist, determine us to act, if not, not; for instance, if a thing is
					possible, easy, or useful to ourselves or our friends, or injurious and
					prejudicial to our enemies, or if the penalty is less than the profit. From
					these grounds we exhort, and dissuade from their contraries. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1400a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>It is on the same grounds that we accuse
					and defend; for what dissuades serves for defence,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">By pointing out what is likely to deter a man from committing
						a crime, and <emph>vice versa</emph>.</note> what persuades, for accusation.
					This topic comprises the whole &ldquo;Art&rdquo; of Pamphilus and
					Callippus.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="22"/>Another topic is derived from things which are
					thought to happen but are incredible, because it would never have been thought
					so, if they had not happened or almost happened. And further, these things are
					even more likely to be true; for we only believe in that which is, or that which
					is probable: if then a thing is incredible and not probable, it will be true;
					for it is not because it is probable and credible that we think it true.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The argument is: we accept either that which
						really is, or that which is probable; if then a statement is made which is
						incredible and improbable, we assume that it would not have been made,
						unless it was true.</note> Thus, Androcles<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Athenian demagogue and opponent of Alcibiades, for whose banishment he was

					similarly, pressed olives need oil, although it is incredible that what produces
					oil should itself need oil.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="23"/>Another topic, appropriate to refutation,
					consists in examining contradictories, whether in dates, actions, or words,
					first, separately in the case of the adversary, for instance, &ldquo;he says
					that he loves you, and yet he conspired with the Thirty;&rdquo; next,
					separately in your own case, &ldquo;he says that I am litigious, but he
					cannot<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>prove that I have ever brought an action
					against anyone&rdquo;; lastly, separately in the case of your adversary and
					yourself together: &ldquo;he has never yet lent anything, but I have

						them.&rdquo;</note> consists in stating the reason for the false
					opinion; for there must be a reason for the supposition of guilt. For example, a
					woman embraced her son in a manner that suggested she had illicit relations with
					him, but when the reason was explained, the slander was quashed. Again, in the
					<title>Ajax</title> of Theodectes, Odysseus explains to Ajax why, although
					really more courageous than Ajax, he is not considered to be so.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="25"/>Another topic is derived from the cause. If the
					cause exists, the effect exists; if the cause does not exist, the effect does
					not exist; for the effect exists with the cause, and without cause there is
					nothing. For example, Leodamas, when defending himself against the accusation of
					Thrasybulus that his name had been posted in the Acropolis<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The names of traitors were inscribed on a brazen pillar in
						the Acropolis. Leodamas supported the oligarchic, Thrasybulus the democratic
						party. In answer to the charge that he had had his name removed from the
						pillar when his party came into power, Leodamas replied that, if he had been
						originally posted as an enemy of the people and a hater of democracy, he
						would have preferred to keep the record, as likely to increase the
						confidence of the Thirty in him, than to have it erased, even though it
						branded him as a traitor.</note> but that he had erased it in the time of
					the Thirty, declared that it was impossible, for the Thirty would have had more
					confidence in him if his hatred against the people had been graven on the stone.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="26"/>Another topic consists in examining whether
					there was or is another better course than that which is advised, or is being,
					or has been, carried out. For it is evident that, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1400b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>if this has not been done,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">If a person has not taken the better course, when he had the
							chance of doing so, he cannot be guilty.</note> a person has not committed a
					certain action; because no one, purposely or knowingly, chooses what is bad.
					However, this argument may be false; for often it is not until later that it
					becomes clear what was the better course, which previously was uncertain.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="27"/>Another topic, when something contrary to what
					has already been done is on the point of being done, consists in examining them
					together. For instance, when the people of <placeName key="perseus,Elea">Elea</placeName> asked Xenophanes if they ought to sacrifice and sing dirges to
					Leucothea,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Leucothea was the name of the
						deified Ino. She was the daughter of Cadmus and the wife of Athamas king of
						<placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. The latter went mad
						and, in order to escape from him, Ino threw herself into the sea with her
						infant son Melicertes. Both became marine deities.</note> or not, he advised
					them that, if they believed her to be a goddess they ought not to sing dirges,
					but if they believed her to be a mortal, they ought not to sacrifice to her.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="28"/>Another topic consists in making use of errors
					committed, for purposes of accusation or defence. For instance, in the
					<title>Medea</title> of Carcinus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Tragic
						poet, contemporary of Aristophanes &lpar;<title>T.G.F.</title> p.
						798&rpar;.</note> some accuse Medea of having killed her
					children,&mdash;at any rate, they had disappeared; for she had made the
					mistake of sending them out of the way. Medea herself pleads that she would have
					slain, not her children, but her husband Jason; for it would have been a mistake
					on her part not to have done this, if she had done the other. This topic and
					kind of enthymeme is the subject of the whole of the first
					&ldquo;Art&rdquo; of Theodorus.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">An
						early edition, afterwards enlarged. It must have contained something more
						than the topic of &ldquo;errors&rdquo; to be of any use.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="29"/>Another topic is derived from the meaning of a
					name. For instance, Sophocles says, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="30"/>Enthymemes that serve to refute are more
					popular than those that serve to demonstrate, because the former is a conclusion
					of opposites<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Admitting the apparent
						correctness of the opposing argument, we may prove the contradictory of its
						conclusion by an unassailable argument of our own, which is then called an
						elenchus&rdquo; &lpar;Thomson, <title>Laws of Thought</title>, section
						127&rpar;.</note> in a small compass, and things in juxtaposition are always
					clearer to the audience. But of all syllogisms, whether refutative or
					demonstrative, those are specially applauded, the result of which the hearers
					foresee as soon as they are begun, and not because they are superficial
					&lpar;for as they listen they congratulate themselves on anticipating the
					conclusion&rpar;; and also those which the hearers are only so little behind
					that they understand what they mean as soon as they are delivered.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="24"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But as it is
					possible that some syllogisms may be real, and others not real but only
					apparent, there must also be real and apparent enthymemes, since the enthymeme
					is a kind of syllogism. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1401a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now, of the topics of apparent enthymemes one is
					that of diction, which is of two kinds. The first, as in Dialectic, consists in
					ending with a conclusion syllogistically expressed, although there has been no
					syllogistic process, &ldquo;therefore it is neither this nor
					that,&rdquo; &ldquo;so it must be this or that&rdquo;; and similarly
					in rhetorical arguments a concise and antithetical statement is supposed to be
					an enthymeme; for such a style appears to contain a real enthymeme. This fallacy
					appears to be the result of the form of expression. For the purpose of using the
					diction to create an impression of syllogistic reasoning it is useful to state
					the heads of several syllogisms: &ldquo;He saved some, avenged others, and
					freed the Greeks&rdquo;;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Isoc. 9.65">Isoc. 9.65-69</bibl>.</note> for each of these
					propositions has been proved by others, but their union appears to furnish a
					fresh conclusion.</p>
				<p>The second kind of fallacy of diction is homonymy.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or equivocation, in which a single term has a double
					meaning.</note> For instance, if one were to say that the mouse is an important
					animal, since from it is derived the most honored of all religious festivals,
					namely, the mysteries<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Deriving <foreign lang="greek">musth/ria</foreign> &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">mu/ein</foreign>, to close the lips&rpar; from <foreign lang="greek">mu=s</foreign> &lpar;mouse&rpar;.</note>; or if, in praising
					the dog, one were to include the dog in heaven &lpar;Sirius&rpar;, or
					Pan, because Pindar said,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A fragment from the
						<title>Parthenia</title> &lpar;songs sung by maidens to the
						accompaniment of the flute&rpar;. Pan is called &ldquo;the dog of
						Cybele,&rdquo; the great nature-goddess of the Greeks, as being always
						in attendance on her, being himself a nature-god. The fact that Pindar calls
						Pan &ldquo;dog&rdquo; is taken as a glorification of that animal.</note>
					<quote>
						<lg type="lyric">
							<l>O blessed one, whom the Olympians call dog of the Great Mother,
								taking every form,</l>
						</lg>
					</quote>
					<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or were to say that the dog is an honorable animal,
					since to be without a dog is most dishonorable. And to say that Hermes is the
					most sociable of the gods, because he alone is called common;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">koino\s *e(rmh=s</foreign> is an
						expression meaning &ldquo;halves!&rdquo; When anyone had a stroke of
						luck, such as finding a purse full of money in the street, anyone with him

						called <foreign lang="greek">e(rmai=on. koinwniko/s</foreign> is taken to
						mean &lpar;1&rpar; liberal to others, or &lpar;2&rpar;
						sociable.</note> and that words are most excellent, since good men are
					considered worthy, not of riches but of consideration; for <foreign lang="greek">lo/gou a)/cios</foreign> has a double meaning.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign>: &lpar;1&rpar;
							speech; &lpar;2&rpar; account, esteem.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Another fallacy consists in combining what is
					divided or dividing what is combined. For since a thing which is not the same as
					another often appears to be the same, one may adopt the more convenient
					alternative. Such was the argument of Euthydemus, to prove, for example, that a
					man knows that there is a trireme in the <placeName key="tgn,7011384">Piraeus</placeName>, because he knows the existence of two things, the
					<placeName key="tgn,7011384">Piraeus</placeName> and the trireme;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Very obscure and no explanation is
						satisfactory. The parallel passage in <bibl n="Aristot. SE 20.6">Aristot. Sophist. Elenchi 20.6</bibl>
						is: &ldquo;Do you being in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> now know that there are triremes in the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>?&rdquo; The ambiguity lies
						in the position of &ldquo;now,&rdquo; whether it is to be taken with
						&ldquo;in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>&rdquo; or
						with &ldquo;in the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>.&rdquo; At the moment when a man is in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> he cannot know that there are at
						this time triremes in the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>; but being in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> he can certainly know of the ships in the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>, which should be there, but
						are now in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
						&lpar;Kirchmann&rpar;. St. Hilaire suggests that the two clauses
						are: Do you now, being in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,
						see the triremes which are in the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>? and, Did you when in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, see the triremes which are now in the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>? The fallacy consists in the
						two facts &lpar;being in the <placeName key="perseus,Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName> and the existence of triremes in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>&rpar;, true separately, being
						untrue combined.</note> or that, when one knows the letters, one also knows
					the word made of them, for word and letters are the same thing. Further, since
					twice so much is unwholesome, one may argue that neither is the original amount
					wholesome; for it would be absurd that two halves separately should be good, but
					bad combined. In this way the argument may be used for refutation, in another
					way for demonstration, if one were to say, one good thing cannot make two bad
					things. But the whole topic is fallacious. Again, one may quote what Polycrates
					said of Thrasybulus, that he deposed thirty tyrants,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Thrasybulus deposed the thirty individuals and put down the
						single tyranny which they composed; he then claimed a thirtyfold reward, as
						having put down thirty tyrannies.</note> for here he combines them; or the
					example of the fallacy of division in the <title>Orestes</title> of
					Theodectes:<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Frag. 5
						&lpar;<title>T.G.F.</title>&rpar;.</note> &ldquo;It is just
					that a woman who has killed her husband&rdquo; should be put to death, and
					that the son should avenge the father; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1401b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and this in fact is what has been done. But if they are
					combined, perhaps the act ceases to be just. The same might also be classed as
					an example of the fallacy of omission; for the name of the one who should put
					the woman to death is not mentioned.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Another topic is that of constructing or
					destroying by exaggeration, which takes place when the speaker, without having
					proved that any crime has actually been committed, exaggerates the supposed
					fact; for it makes it appear either that the accused is not guilty, when he
					himself exaggerates it, or that he is guilty, when it is the accuser who is in a
					rage. Therefore there is no enthymeme; for the hearer falsely concludes that the
					accused is guilty or not, although neither has been proved.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Another fallacy is that of the sign, for this
					argument also is illogical. For instance, if one were to say that those who love
					one another are useful to States, since the love of Harmodius and Aristogiton
					overthrew the tyrant Hipparchus; or that Dionysius is a thief, because he is a
					rascal; for here again the argument is inconclusive; not every rascal is a thief
					although every thief is a rascal.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Another fallacy is derived from accident; for
					instance, when Polycrates says of the mice, that, they rendered great service by
					gnawing the bowstrings.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hdt. 2.141">Hdt. 2.141</bibl>. The story was that, when Sennacherib invaded
						<placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, a host of field-mice
						devoured all the quivers, bowstrings and leather shield-holders of the
						Assyrians. Apollo was called Smintheus &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">smi/nqos</foreign>, mouse&rpar; and was represented on coins with a
						mouse in his hand, either as the mouse-slayer and protector of crops, or
						because the animal was sacred to him. The story, alluded to elsewhere, was
						of Greek, not of Egyptian origin. Similar panegyrics on ridiculous things or
						animals included pots, counters, salt, flies, bees, and such subjects as
						death, sleep, and food.</note> Or if one were to say that nothing is more
					honorable than to be invited to a dinner, for because he was not invited
					Achilles was angry with the Achaeans at <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName>; whereas he was really angry because he had been treated
					with disrespect, but this was an accident due to his not having been
					invited.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Sophocles, <title>The Gathering
						of the Greeks</title> &lpar;<title>T.G.F.</title> p. 161&rpar;,
						a satyric drama. His not being invited was a mere accident of the
						disrespect.</note>
					<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Another fallacy is that of the Consequence.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Assuming a proposition to be convertible, when
					it is not; it does not follow, assuming that all the high-minded dwell by
					themselves, that all who dwell by themselves are highminded.</note> For
					instance, in the <title>Alexander</title> <persName><surname>Paris</surname></persName> it is said that <persName><surname>Paris</surname></persName> was high-minded, because he despised the companionship of
					the common herd and dwelt on Ida by himself; for because the high-minded are of
					this character, <persName><surname>Paris</surname></persName> also might be
					thought high-minded. Or, since a man pays attention to dress and roams about at
					night, he is a libertine, because libertines are of this character. Similarly,
					the poor sing and dance in the temples, exiles can live where they please; and
					since these things belong to those who are apparently happy, those to whom they
					belong may also be thought happy. But there is a difference in conditions;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The poor want to get money; the rich dance and
						sing to amuse themselves, or to show that they can do as they like. Exiles
						can certainly live where they like in a foreign land, but would prefer to
						live in their own country; the rich, who are not exiles, travel to amuse
						themselves.</note> wherefore this topic also falls under the head of
					omission.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Another fallacy consists of taking what is not
					the cause for the cause, as when a thing has happened at the same time as, or
					after, another; for it is believed that what happens after is produced by the
					other, especially by politicians. Thus, Demades declared that the policy of
					Demosthenes was the cause of all the evils that happened, since it was followed
					by the war.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Another fallacy is the omission of when and how.
					For instance, Alexander <persName><surname>Paris</surname></persName> had a right to carry off Helen, for the choice of a
					husband had been given her by her father. But &lpar;this was a
					fallacy&rpar;, for it was not, as might be thought, for all time, but only
					for the first time; for the father's authority only lasts till then. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1402a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Or, if one should say that it
					is wanton outrage to beat a free man; for this is not always the case, but only
					when the assailant gives the first blow.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Further, as in sophistical disputations, an
					apparent syllogism arises as the result of considering a thing first absolutely,
					and then not absolutely, but only in a particular case. For instance, in
					Dialectic, it is argued that that which is not <emph>is</emph>, for that which
					is not <emph>is</emph> that which is not<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The
						first &ldquo;is&rdquo; means &ldquo;has a real, absolute
						existence&rdquo;; the second &ldquo;is&rdquo; merely expresses
						the identity of the terms of the proposition, and is particular; but the
						sophistical reasoner takes it in the same sense as the first. The same
						applies to the argument about the unknown.</note>; also, that the unknown
					can be known, for it can be known of the unknown that it is unknown. Similarly,
					in Rhetoric, an apparent enthymeme may arise from that which is not absolutely
					probable but only in particular cases. But this is not to be understood
					absolutely, as Agathon says: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>One might perhaps say that this very thing is probable, that many
								things happen to men that are not probable;</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> for that which is contrary to probability nevertheless does happen, so
					that that which is contrary to probability is probable. If this is so, that
					which is improbable will be probable. But not absolutely; but as, in the case of
					sophistical disputations, the argument becomes fallacious when the
					circumstances, reference, and manner are not added, so here it will become so
					owing to the probability being not probable absolutely but only in particular
					cases. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The &ldquo;Art&rdquo; of Corax
					is composed of this topic. For if a man is not likely to be guilty of what he is
					accused of, for instance if, being weak, he is accused of assault and battery,
					his defence will be that the crime is not probable; but if he is likely to be
					guilty, for instance,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>if he is strong, it may be argued
					again that the crime is not probable, for the very reason that it was bound to
					appear so. It is the same in all other cases; for a man must either be likely to
					have committed a crime or not. Here, both the alternatives appear equally
					probable, but the one is really so, the other not probable absolutely, but only
					in the conditions mentioned. And this is what &ldquo;making the worse appear
					the better argument&rdquo; means. Wherefore men were justly disgusted with
					the promise of Protagoras<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This utterance of
						Protagoras gave particular offense as apparently implying that the weaker
						cause was really identical with the worse, so that to support it was to
						support injustice. But, considering the high moral character ascribed to
						Protagoras, it seems more probable to take the formula as a statement of the
						aim of all ancient orators&mdash;how to overcome stronger arguments by
						arguments weaker in themselves.</note>; for it is a lie, not a real but an
					apparent probability, not found in any art except Rhetoric and Sophistic. So
					much for real or apparent enthymemes.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Next to what
					has been said we must speak of refutation. An argument may be refuted either by
					a counter-syllogism<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In which the contrary of
						an opponent's conclusion is proved.</note> or by bringing an objection.
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>It is clear that the same topics may
					furnish counter-syllogisms; for syllogisms are derived from probable materials
					and many probabilities are contrary to one another. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>An objection is brought, as shown in the <title>Topics</title>, in
					four ways: it may be derived either from itself,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e., the <emph>opponent's</emph> enthymeme.</note> or from
					what is similar, or from what is contrary, or from what has been decided.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In the first case, if for instance the
					enthymeme was intended to prove that love is good, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1402b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>two objections might be made; either the general
					statement that all want<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Love is regarded as a
						desire, and therefore as bad as any other desire. It is here included under
						the general head of want.</note> is bad, or in particular, that Caunian
					love<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Incest: <bibl n="Ov. Met. 9.454">Ovid Met. 9.454</bibl>.</note> would not have become proverbial,
					unless some forms of love had been bad. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>An
					objection from what is contrary is brought if, for instance, the enthymeme is
					that the good man does good to all his friends; it may be objected: But the bad
					man does not do harm &lsqb;to all his friends&rsqb;.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The contrary of &ldquo;good men do good to all their
						friends&rdquo; is &ldquo;bad men do harm to all their
						friends,&rdquo; but this is not always true. Jebb gives the objection
						as: &ldquo;No, the bad man does not do evil to all his
						enemies.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>An objection from what is similar is brought,
					if the enthymeme is that those who have been injured always hate, by arguing
					that those who have been benefited do not always love. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The fourth kind of objection is derived from the former decisions of
					well-known men. For instance, if the enthymeme is that one should make allowance
					for those who are drunk, for their offence is the result of ignorance, it may be
					objected that Pittacus then is unworthy of commendation, otherwise he would not
					have laid down severer punishment for a man who commits an offence when drunk.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now the material of enthymemes is derived from
					four sources&mdash;probabilities, examples, necessary signs, and signs.
					Conclusions are drawn from probabilities, when based upon things which most
					commonly occur or seem to occur; from examples, when they are the result of
					induction from one or more similar cases, and when one assumes the general and
					then concludes the particular by an example; from necessary signs, when based
					upon that which is necessary and ever<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Translating <foreign lang="greek">a)ei/</foreign> inserted by Vahlen before
						<foreign lang="greek">o)/ntos</foreign>.</note> exists; from signs, when
					their material is the general or<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>the particular, whether
					true or not. Now, the probable being not what occurs invariably but only for the
					most part, it is evident that enthymemes of this character can always be refuted
					by bringing an objection. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But the objection is
					often only apparent, not real; for he who brings the objection endeavors to
					show, not that the argument is not probable, but that it is not necessary.
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Wherefore, by the employment of this
					fallacy, the defendant always has an advantage over the accuser. For since the
					latter always bases his proof upon probabilities, and it is not the same thing
					to show that an argument is not probable as to show that it is not necessary,
					and that which is only true for the most part is always liable to objection
					&lpar;otherwise it would not be probable, but constant and
					necessary&rpar;,&mdash;then the judge thinks, if the refutation is made
					in this manner,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That is, if the argument is
						shown to be not &ldquo;necessary.&rdquo;</note> either that the
					argument is not probable, or that it is not for him to decide,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The important point in the conclusion drawn is
						that the judge thinks it is not his business to decide, because the argument
						is not necessary, whereas his duty is to decide, not about things that are
						necessary but about things that are probable.</note> being deceived by the
					fallacy, as we have just indicated. For his judgement must not rest upon
					necessary arguments alone, but also upon probabilities; for this is what is
					meant by deciding according to the best of one's judgement. It is therefore not
					enough to refute an argument by showing that it is not necessary; it must also
					be shown that it is not probable. This will be attained if the objection itself
					is specially based upon what happens generally. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>This may take place in two ways, from consideration either of the time or of
					the facts.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">xro/nw| . . .
						pra/gmasin</foreign>. If <foreign lang="greek">xro/nw|</foreign> be
						taken to mean the date, there are the following alternatives. The date may
						be questioned, the facts admitted; both date and facts may be questioned;
						both date and facts may be admitted, but circumstances may have altered
						&lpar;a pound was worth twenty shillings in <date value="1914">1914</date>, not in <date value="1924">1924</date>&rpar;. Others take
						<foreign lang="greek">xro/nw|</foreign> to mean the greater number of
						times the same fact has occurred, <foreign lang="greek">pra/gmasi</foreign>
						the more numerous facts that increase probability. But <foreign lang="greek">xro/nw|</foreign> can hardly bear this meaning &lpar;see Jebb's
						note&rpar;.</note> The strongest objections are those in which both are
					combined; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1403a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for a thing is more
					probable, the greater the number of similar cases.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Signs and enthymemes based upon signs, even if
					true, may be refuted in the manner previously stated<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">1.2.18; or, &ldquo;at the beginning,&rdquo; i.e., of
						this book.</note>; for it is clear from the <title>Analytics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. APr. 2.27">Aristot. Pr.
								Anal. 2.27</bibl>.</note> that no sign can furnish a logical conclusion.
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>As for enthymemes derived from examples,
					they may be refuted in the same manner as probabilities. For if we have a single
					fact that contradicts the opponent's example, the argument is refuted as not
					being necessary, even though examples, more in number and of more common
					occurrence, are otherwise<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">On the other side,
						in the opponent's favor.</note>; but if the majority and greater frequency
					of examples is on the side of the opponent, we must contend either that the
					present example is not similar to those cited by him, or that the thing did not
					take place in the same way, or that there is some difference. <milestone unit="section" n="14"/>But necessary signs and the enthymemes derived from
					them cannot be refuted on the ground of not furnishing a logical conclusion, as
					is clear from the <title>Analytics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. APr. 2.27">Aristot. Pr. Anal.
							2.27</bibl>.</note>; the only thing that remains is to prove that the thing
					alleged is non-existent. But if it is evident that it is true and that it is a
					necessary sign, the argument at once becomes irrefutable; for, by means of
					demonstration, everything at once becomes clear.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">That is, &ldquo;when the <emph>tekm&emacr;rion</emph>
						is converted into a syllogism.&rdquo; For
						<emph>tekm&emacr;rion</emph> see 1.2.16.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="26"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Amplification
					and depreciation are not elements of enthymeme &lpar;for I regard element
					and topic as identical&rpar;, since element &lpar;or topic&rpar; is
					a head under which several enthymemes are included, but they are enthymemes
					which serve to show that a thing is great or small,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>just
					as others serve to show that it is good or bad, just or unjust, or anything
					else. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>All these are the materials of syllogisms
					and enthymemes; so that if none of these is a topic of enthymeme, neither is
					amplification or depreciation. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Nor are
					enthymemes by which arguments are refuted of a different kind from those by
					which they are established; for it is clear that demonstration or bringing an
					objection is the means of refutation. By the first the contrary of the
					adversary's conclusion is demonstrated; for instance, if he has shown that a
					thing has happened, his opponent shows that it has not; if he has shown that a
					thing has not happened, he shows that it has. This, therefore, will not be the
					difference between them; for both employ the same arguments; they bring forward
					enthymemes to show that the thing is or that it is not. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And the objection is not an enthymeme, but, as I said
					in the <title>Topics</title>, it is stating an opinion which is intended to make
					it clear that the adversary's syllogism is not logical, or that he has assumed
					some false premise. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now, since there are three
					things in regard to speech, to which special attention should be devoted, let
					what has been said suffice for examples, maxims, enthymemes, and what concerns
					the intelligence<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Intellectual
						capacity, as evinced in language &lpar;or actions&rpar;, and seen

					arguments and the means of refuting them. It only remains to speak of style and
					arrangement.</p>
			</div1>
			<div1 n="3" type="book">
				<lb ed="Bekker" n="6"/>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There are three
					things which require special attention in regard to speech: first, the sources
					of proofs; secondly, style; and thirdly, the arrangement of the parts of the
					speech. We have already spoken of proofs and stated that they are three in
					number, what is their nature, and why there are only three; for in all cases
					persuasion is the result either of the judges themselves being affected in a
					certain manner, or because they consider the speakers to be of a certain
					character, or because something has been demonstrated. We have also stated the
					sources from which enthymemes should be derived&mdash;some of them being
					special, the others general commonplaces.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>We have therefore next to speak of style; for it
					is not sufficient to know what one ought to say, but one must also know how to
					say it, and this largely contributes to making the speech appear of a certain
					character. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In the first place, following the
					natural order, we investigated that which first presented itself&mdash;what
					gives things themselves their persuasiveness;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>in the
					second place, their arrangement by style; and in the third place, delivery,
					which is of the greatest importance but has not yet been treated of by anyone.
					In fact, it only made its appearance late in tragedy and rhapsody, for at first
					the poets themselves acted their tragedies.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Since the authors of tragedies acted their own plays, there was no need for
						professional actors, nor for instruction in the art of delivery or acting.
						This explains why no attempt had been made to deal with the question.
						Similarly, the rhapsodists &lpar;reciters of epic poems&rpar; were
						at first as a rule the composers of the poems themselves.</note> It is
					clear, therefore, that there is something of the sort in rhetoric as well as in
					poetry, and it has been dealt with by Glaucon of <placeName key="perseus,Teos">Teos</placeName> among others. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now
					delivery is a matter of voice, as to the mode in which it should be used for
					each particular emotion; when it should be loud, when low, when intermediate;
					and how the tones, that is, shrill, deep, and intermediate, should be used; and
					what rhythms are adapted to each subject. For there are three qualities that are
					considered,&mdash;volume, harmony, rhythm. Those who use these properly
					nearly always carry off the prizes in dramatic contests, and as at the present
					day actors have greater influence on the stage than the poets, it is the same In
					political<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In the law courts and public
						assembly.</note> contests, owing to the corruptness of our forms of
					government. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But no treatise has yet been
					composed on delivery, since the matter of style itself only lately came into
					notice; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1404a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and rightly considered
					it is thought vulgar.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cope prefers:
						&ldquo;is thought vulgar, and rightly so considered.&rdquo;</note>
					But since the whole business of Rhetoric is to influence opinion,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;is concerned with
						appearance.&rdquo;</note> we must pay attention to it, not as being
					right, but necessary; for, as a matter of right, one should aim at nothing more
					in a speech than how to avoid exciting pain or pleasure. For justice should
					consist in fighting the case with the facts alone, so that everything else that
					is beside demonstration is superfluous; nevertheless, as we have just said, it
					is of great importance owing to the corruption of the hearer. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>However, in every system of instruction there is some
					slight necessity to pay attention to style; for it does make a difference, for
					the purpose of making a thing clear, to speak in this or that manner; still, the
					difference is not so very great, but all these things<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e. style, delivery, and acting, which are of no use to
						serious students.</note> are mere outward show for pleasing the hearer;
					wherefore no one teaches geometry in this way.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now, when delivery comes into fashion, it will
					have the same effect as acting. Some writers have attempted to say a few words
					about it, as Thrasymachus, in his <title>Eleoi</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A treatise on Pathos.</note>; and in fact, a gift for acting
					is a natural talent and depends less upon art, but in regard to style it is
					artificial. Wherefore people who excel in this in their turn obtain prizes, just
					as orators who excel in delivery; for written speeches owe their effect not so
					much to the sense as to the style. <lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The poets, as was natural, were the first to
					give an impulse to style; for words are imitations, and the voice also, which of
					all our parts is best adapted for imitation, was ready to hand; thus the arts of
					the rhapsodists, actors, and others, were fashioned. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>And as the poets, although their utterances were devoid of sense,
					appeared to have gained their reputation through their style, it was a poetical
					style that first came into being, as that of Gorgias.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of Leontini in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, Greek sophist and rhetorician &lpar;see
						Introduction&rpar;.</note> Even now the majority of the uneducated think
					that such persons express themselves most beautifully, whereas this is not the
					case, for the style of prose is not the same as that of poetry. And the result
					proves it; for even the writers of tragedies do not employ it in the same
					manner, but as they have changed from the tetrametric to the iambic meter,
					because the latter, of all other meters, most nearly resembles prose, they have
					in like manner discarded all such words as differ from those of ordinary
					conversation, with which the early poets used to adorn their writings, and which
					even now are employed by the writers of hexameters. It is therefore ridiculous
					to imitate those who no longer employ that manner of writing. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Consequently, it is evident that we need not enter
					too precisely into all questions of style, but only those which concern such a
					style as we are discussing. As for the other kind of style,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e. the poetic style. See <bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1458a">Aristot. Poet. 22</bibl>, where the choice of words and the extent to
						which out-of-the-way words and phrases may be used in poetry is
						discussed.</note> it has already been treated in the <title>Poetics.</title>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1404b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let this
					suffice for the consideration of these points. In regard to style, one of its
					chief merits may be defined as perspicuity. This is shown by the fact that the
					speech, if it does not make the meaning clear, will not perform its proper
					function; neither must it be mean, nor above the dignity of the subject, but
					appropriate to it; for the poetic style may be is not mean, but it is not
					appropriate to prose. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Of nouns and verbs it is
					the proper ones that make style perspicuous<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">&ldquo;Nouns and verbs&rdquo; is a conventional expression for all
						the parts of speech. Cp. <bibl n="Hor. Ars 240">Hor. AP 240</bibl>
						&ldquo;non ego inornata et dominantia nomina solum verbaque,&rdquo;
						where <emph>dominantia</emph> is a literal adaptation of <foreign lang="greek">ku/ria</foreign>, the usual Latin equivalent for which is
						<emph>propria.</emph></note>; all the others which have been spoken of
					in the <title>Poetics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1457a">Aristot. Poet. 21</bibl>.</note> elevate and make
					it ornate; for departure from the ordinary makes it appear more dignified. In
					this respect men feel the same in regard to style as in regard to foreigners and
					fellow-citizens. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Wherefore we should give our
					language a &ldquo;foreign<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">It is impossible
						to find a satisfactory English equivalent for the terms <foreign lang="greek">ce/nos, ceniko/s, to\ ceni/zon</foreign>, as applied to
						style. &ldquo;Foreign&rdquo; does not really convey the idea, which
						is rather that of something opposed to
						&ldquo;home-like,&rdquo;&mdash;out-of-the-way, as if from
						&ldquo;abroad.&rdquo; Jebb suggests
						&ldquo;distinctive.&rdquo;</note> air&rdquo;; for men admire
					what is remote, and that which excites admiration is pleasant. In poetry many
					things conduce to this and there it is appropriate; for the subjects and persons
					spoken of are more out of the common. But in prose such methods are appropriate
					in much fewer instances, for the subject is less elevated; and even in poetry,
					if fine language were used by a slave or a very young man, or about quite
					unimportant matters, it would be hardly becoming; for even here due proportion
					consists in contraction and amplification as the subject requires. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Wherefore those who practise this artifice must
					conceal it and avoid the appearance of speaking artificially instead of
					naturally; for that which is natural persuades,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>but the
					artificial does not. For men become suspicious of one whom they think to be
					laying a trap for them, as they are of mixed wines. Such was the case with the
					voice of Theodorus as contrasted with that of the rest of the actors; for his
					seemed to be the voice of the speaker, that of the others the voice of someone
					else. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Art is cleverly concealed when the
					speaker chooses his words from ordinary language<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Hor. Ars 46">Hor. AP. 46</bibl>, where it is
						said that the choice and use of words requires subtlety and care, skill in
						making an old word new by clever combination &lpar;<emph>callida
							iunctura</emph>&rpar; being especially praised.</note> and puts them
					together like Euripides, who was the first to show the way.</p>
				<p>Nouns and verbs being the components of speech, and nouns being of the different
					kinds which have been considered in the <title>Poetics</title>, of these we
					should use strange, compound, or coined words only rarely and in few places. We
					will state later<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Chaps. 3 and 7.</note> in
					what places they should be used; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>the reason for
					this has already been mentioned, namely, that it involves too great a departure
					from suitable language. Proper and appropriate words and metaphors are alone to
					be employed in the style of prose; this is shown by the fact that no one employs
					anything but these. For all use metaphors in conversation, as well as proper and
					appropriate words; wherefore it is clear that, if a speaker manages well, there
					will be some thing &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; about his speech, while
					possibly the art may not be detected, and his meaning will be clear. And this,
					as we have said, is the chief merit of rhetorical language. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>&lpar;In regard to nouns, homonyms are most useful
					to the sophist, for it is by their aid that he employs captious arguments, and
					synonyms to the poet. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1405a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Instances of words that are both proper and synonymous are
					&ldquo;going&rdquo; and &ldquo;walking&rdquo;: for these two
					words are proper and have the same meaning.&rpar;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This is a parenthetical note.</note></p>
				<p>It has already been stated, as we have said, in the <title>Poetics</title>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1457a">Aristot. Poet.
						21, 22</bibl>.</note> what each of these things<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The different kinds of words.</note> is, how many kinds of
					metaphor there are, and that it is most important both in poetry and in prose.
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But the orator must devote the greater
					attention to them in prose, since the latter has fewer resources than verse. It
					is metaphor above all that gives perspicuity, pleasure, and a foreign air, and
					it cannot be learnt from anyone else;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1458b">Aristot. Poet. 22.9</bibl>: &ldquo;for this
						alone cannot be borrowed from another.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>but we must make use of metaphors and epithets
					that are appropriate. This will be secured by observing due proportion;
					otherwise there will be a lack of propriety, because it is when placed in
					juxtaposition that contraries are most evident. We must consider, as a red cloak
					suits a young man, what suits an old one; <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>for
					the same garment is not suitable for both. And if we wish to ornament our
					subject, we must derive our metaphor from the better species under the same
					genus; if to depreciate it, from the worse. Thus, to say &lpar;for you have
					two opposites belonging to the same genus&rpar; that the man who begs prays,
					or that the man who prays begs &lpar;for both are forms of
					asking&rpar;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Begging &lpar;as a
						beggar does&rpar; and praying &lpar;as a priest might&rpar; are
						both forms of asking, and by substituting one for the other, you can amplify
						or depreciate.</note> is an instance of doing this; as, when Iphicrates<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">See 1.7.32.</note> called Callias<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Head of a distinguished Athenian family which
								held the office of torch-bearer at the Eleusinian mysteries. A man of
								notoriously dissipated character, he took some part in politics.</note><lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>a mendicant priest instead of a torch-bearer, Callias
					replied that Iphicrates himself could not be initiated, otherwise he would not
					have called him mendicant priest but torch-bearer<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The <foreign lang="greek">da|dou=xos</foreign> or hereditary
						torch-bearer ranked next to the hierophant or chief priest. In addition to
						holding the torch during the sacrifices, he took part in the recitation of
						the ritual and certain purificatory ceremonies. The <foreign lang="greek">mhtragu/rtai</foreign> or mendicant priests collected alms on behalf of
						various deities, especially the great Mother Cybele &lpar;whence their
						name&rpar;. They included both men and women of profligate character,
						addicted to every kind of lewdness.</note>; both titles indeed have to do
					with a divinity, but the one is honorable, the other dishonorable. And some call
					actors flatterers of Dionysus, whereas they call themselves
					&ldquo;artists.&rdquo; Both these names are metaphors, but the one is a
					term of abuse, the other the contrary. Similarly, pirates now call themselves
					purveyors<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cf.
						&ldquo;&lsquo;convey&rsquo; the wise it call&rdquo;
						&lpar;<title>Merry Wives,</title> I. iii.&rpar;. Either the
						euphemistic or unfavorable application of the term may be adopted.</note>;
					and so it is allowable to say that the man who has committed a crime has
					&ldquo;made a mistake,&rdquo; that the man who has &ldquo;made a
					mistake&rdquo; is &ldquo;guilty of crime&rdquo;, and that one who
					has committed a theft has either &ldquo;taken&rdquo; or
					&ldquo;ravaged.&rdquo; The saying in the <title>Telephus</title> of
					Euripides, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>Ruling over the oar and having landed in <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>,</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> is inappropriate, because the word ruling exceeds the dignity of the
					subject, and so the artifice can be seen. <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Forms of words also are faulty, if they do not express an agreeable sound; for
					instance, Dionysius the Brazen<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">According to
						<bibl n="Ath. 16.669">Athenaeus, p. 669</bibl>, he was a poet
						and rhetorician who recommended the Athenians to use bronze money.</note> in
					his elegiacs speaks of poetry as <quote>
						<lg type="eleg">
							<l>the scream of Calliope;</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> both are sounds, but the metaphor is bad, because the sounds have no
					meaning.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A scream is neither articulate
						nor agreeable, like the sound of poetry, although both are voices or sound,
						and to that extent the metaphor is correct.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Further, metaphors must not be far-fetched, but
					we must give names to things that have none by deriving the metaphor from what
					is akin and of the same kind, so that, as soon as it is uttered, it is clearly
					seen to be akin, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1405b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>as in the
					famous enigma, <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>I saw a man who glued bronze with fire upon another.</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> There was no name for what took place, but as in both cases there is a
					kind of application, he called the application of the cupping-glass gluing.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Ath. 10.452">Athenaeus, p.
							452</bibl>.</note> And, generally speaking, clever enigmas furnish good
					metaphors; for metaphor is a kind of enigma, so that it is clear that the
					transference is clever. <milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Metaphors should also
					be derived from things that are beautiful, the beauty of a word consisting, as
					Licymnius says, in its sound or sense, and its ugliness in the same. There is a
					third condition, which refutes the sophistical argument; for it is not the case,
					as Bryson<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Rhetorician and sophist of
						<placeName key="tgn,7008299">Heraclea</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Pontus</placeName>.</note> said, that no one ever uses
					foul language, if the meaning is the same whether this or that word is used;
					this is false; for one word is more proper than another, more of a likeness, and
					better suited to putting the matter before the eyes. Further, this word or that
					does not signify a thing under the same conditions; thus for this reason also it
					must be admitted that one word is fairer or fouler than the other. Both, indeed,
					signify what is fair or foul, but not <emph>qua</emph> fair or foul; or if they
					do, it is in a greater or less degree. Metaphors therefore should be derived
					from what is beautiful either in sound, or in signification, or to sight, or to
					some other sense. For it does make a difference, for instance, whether one says
					&ldquo;rosy-fingered morn,&rdquo; rather than
					&ldquo;purple-fingered,&rdquo;<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>or, what is
					still worse, &ldquo;red-fingered.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>As for epithets, they may be applied from what
					is vile or disgraceful, for instance, &ldquo;the matricide,&rdquo; or
					from what is more honorable, for instance, &ldquo;the avenger of his
					father.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Eur. Orest. 1588">Eur. Orest. 1588</bibl>. In the preceding line

					When the winner in a mule-race offered Simonides a small sum, he refused to

					</quote> and yet they were also the daughters of asses. Further, the use of
					diminutives amounts to the same. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>It is the
					diminutive which makes the good and the bad appear less, as Aristophanes in the
					<title>Babylonians</title> jestingly uses &ldquo;goldlet, cloaklet,
					affrontlet, diseaselet&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;gold, cloak, affront,
					disease.&rdquo; But one must be careful to observe the due mean in their use
					as well as in that of epithets.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Frigidity of
					style arises from four causes: first, the use of compound words, as when
					Lycophron<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A sophist, not the poet
						&lpar;author of the obscure <title>Alexander</title> or
						<title>Cassandra</title>&rpar;, who was later than Aristotle.</note>
					speaks of the &ldquo;many-faced sky of the mighty-topped earth,&rdquo;
					&ldquo;narrow-passaged shore&rdquo;; and Gorgias of &ldquo;a
					begging-poet flatterer,&rdquo; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1406a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>&ldquo;those who commit perjury and those who swear right
					solemnly.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Lobeck conjectured <foreign lang="greek">katepiorkh/santas</foreign>, &ldquo;who commit
						out-and-out perjury.&rdquo;</note>&rdquo; And as Alcidamas says,
					&ldquo;the soul full of anger and the face fire-colored,&rdquo;
					&ldquo;he thought that their zeal would be end-accomplishing,&rdquo;
					&ldquo;he made persuasive words end-accomplishing,&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;the azure-colored floor of the sea,&rdquo; for all these appear
					poetical because they are compound.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>This is one cause of frigidity; another is the
					use of strange words; as Lycophron calls Xerxes &ldquo;a monster of a
					man,&rdquo; Sciron &ldquo;a human scourge<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Sciron and Sinnis were both robbers slain by Theseus, by
						Lycophron turns Sinnis into a <foreign lang="greek">glw=tta</foreign>, using
						it adjectivally = &ldquo;destructive&rdquo;; cf. <foreign lang="greek">si=nos</foreign>, &ldquo;harm&rdquo;; <foreign lang="greek">si/nths</foreign> = <foreign lang="greek">si/nnis</foreign>.</note>&rdquo;; and Alcidamas says
					&ldquo;plaything in poetry,&rdquo; &ldquo;the audaciousness of
					nature,&rdquo; &ldquo;whetted with unmitigated wrath of
					thought.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>A third cause is the use of epithets that are
					either long or unseasonable or too crowded; thus, in poetry it is appropriate to
					speak of white milk, but in prose it is less so; and if epithets are employed to
					excess, they reveal the art and make it evident that it is poetry. And yet such
					may be used to a certain extent, since it removes the style from the ordinary
					and gives a &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; air. But one must aim at the mean, for
					neglect to do so does more harm than speaking at random; for a random style
					lacks merit, but excess is vicious. That is why the style of Alcidamas appears
					frigid; for he uses epithets not as a seasoning but as a regular dish, so
					crowded,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>so long, and so glaring are they. For
					instance, he does not say &ldquo;sweat&rdquo; but &ldquo;damp
					sweat&rdquo;; not &ldquo;to the Isthmian games&rdquo; but
					&ldquo;to the solemn assembly of the Isthmian games&rdquo;; not
					&ldquo;laws&rdquo;, but &ldquo;the laws, the rulers of
					states&rdquo;; not &ldquo;running&rdquo;, but &ldquo;with a
					race-like impulse of the soul&rdquo;; not &ldquo;museum&rdquo;, but
					&ldquo;having taken up the museum of nature&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The meaning of <foreign lang="greek">paralabw/n</foreign> is
						quite obscure: various renderings are &ldquo;having taken to
						himself,&rdquo; &ldquo;received,&rdquo;
						&ldquo;grasped,&rdquo; &ldquo;inherited.&rdquo; The word
						<foreign lang="greek">mousei=on</foreign>, originally a haunt of the
						Muses, came to mean a school of art or literature. The fault appears to
						consist in the addition of <foreign lang="greek">th=s fu/sews</foreign>, but
						it is difficult to see why. Cope confesses his inability to understand the
						passage. Jebb translates: &ldquo;he does not say, &lsquo;having
						taken to himself a school of the Muses,&rsquo; but &lsquo;to
						<emph>Nature's</emph> school of the Muses.&rsquo;&rdquo;</note>;
					and &ldquo;the scowling anxiety of the soul&rdquo;;
					&ldquo;creator&rdquo;, not &ldquo;of favor&rdquo;, but
					&ldquo;all-popular favor&rdquo;; and &ldquo;dispenser of the
					pleasure of the hearers&rdquo;; &ldquo;he hid,&rdquo; not
					&ldquo;with branches,&rdquo; but &ldquo;with the branches of the
					forest&rdquo;; &ldquo;he covered,&rdquo; not &ldquo;his
					body,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the nakedness of his body.&rdquo; He also
					calls desire &ldquo;counter-initiative of the soul&rdquo;&mdash;an
					expression which is at once compound and an epithet, so that it becomes
					poetry&mdash;and &ldquo;the excess of his depravity so beyond all
					bounds.&rdquo; Hence those who employ poetic language by their lack of taste
					make the style ridiculous and frigid, and such idle chatter produces obscurity;
					for when words are piled upon one who already knows, it destroys perspicuity by
					a cloud of verbiage. People use compound words, when a thing has no name and the
					word is easy to combine, as <foreign lang="greek">xronotribei=n</foreign>, to
					pass time; but if the practice is abused, the style becomes entirely poetical.
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1406b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>This is why compound words
					are especially employed by dithyrambic poets, who are full of noise; strange
					words by epic poets, for they imply dignity and self-assertion; metaphor to
					writers of iambics, who now employ them, as we have stated.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The fourth cause of frigidity of style is to be
					found in metaphors; for metaphors also are inappropriate, some because they are
					ridiculous&mdash;for the comic poets also employ them&mdash;others
					because they are too dignified and somewhat tragic; and if they are farfetched,
					they are obscure, as when Gorgias says: &ldquo;Affairs pale and
					bloodless&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">On this passage
						Thompson
						&lpar;<title>Gorgias</title>, p. 179&rpar; says: &ldquo;The
						metaphor of reaping and sowing is a mere commonplace . . . but
						&lsquo;pallid and bloodless affairs&rsquo; is a phrase which would
						need apology even from a modern.&rdquo; On the other hand, it is
						difficult to see what objection there is to calling the
						<title>Odyssey</title> &ldquo;a beautiful mirror of human
						life.&rdquo; Another reading is <foreign lang="greek">e)/naima</foreign>, which Cope translates &ldquo;events fresh with the
						blood in them.&rdquo; If the two extracts are taken together, it is
						suggested &lpar;apparently by the editor of Cope's notes&rpar; that
						the sense may be: &ldquo;things green and unripe &lpar;flushed with
						sap&rpar;, and this was the crop which you . . .,&rdquo; the
						adjectives referring to green and unripe stalks of corn.</note>;
					&ldquo;you have sown shame and reaped misfortune&rdquo;; for this is too
					much like poetry. And as Alcidamas calls philosophy &ldquo;a bulwark of the
					laws,&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;a barrier
						against the laws.&rdquo; This is the general meaning of <foreign lang="greek">e)pitei/xisma</foreign>, a border fortress commanding an
						enemy's country.</note> and the <title>Odyssey</title> &ldquo;a
					beautiful mirror of human life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;introducing no such
					plaything in poetry.&rdquo; All these expressions fail to produce
					persuasion, for the reasons stated. As for what Gorgias said to the swallow
					which, flying over his head, let fall her droppings upon him, it was in the best
					tragic style. He exclaimed, &ldquo;Fie, for shame, Philomela!&rdquo;;
					for there would have been nothing in this act disgraceful for a bird, whereas it
					would have been for a young lady. The reproach therefore was appropriate,
					addressing her as she was, not as she is. <lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The simile also
					is a metaphor; for there is very little difference. When the poet says of
					Achilles,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Compare <bibl n="Hom. Il. 22.164">Hom. Il. 22.164</bibl>

					similes. Androtion<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Pupil of Isocrates and

					similes or metaphors, so that all that are approved as metaphors will obviously
					also serve as similes which are metaphors without the details. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But in all cases the metaphor from proportion should
					be reciprocal and applicable to either of the two things of the same genus; for
					instance, if the goblet is the shield of Dionysus, then the shield may properly
					be called the goblet of Ares.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">As the shield is

						as &ldquo;an equality of ratios, implying four terms at the

						metaphor substitute the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth.
						Let A be Dionysus, B a goblet, C Ares, D a shield. Then by the definition,

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such then are
					the elements of speech. But purity,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>which is the
					foundation of style, depends upon five rules. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>First, connecting particles should be introduced in their natural order,
					before or after, as they require; thus, <foreign lang="greek">me/n</foreign> and
					<foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ me/n</foreign> require to be followed by
					<foreign lang="greek">de/</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">o(
						de/</foreign>. Further, they should be made to correspond whilst the hearer
					still recollects; they should not be put too far apart, nor should a clause be
					introduced before the necessary connection<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The
						apodosis. <foreign lang="greek">a)podido/nai</foreign> is used in the sense
						of introducing a clause answering to the <foreign lang="greek">pro/tasis</foreign>, and <foreign lang="greek">a)po/dosis</foreign> for
						this answering clause.</note>; for this is rarely appropriate. For instance,
					&ldquo;As for me, I, after he had told me&mdash;for Cleon came begging
					and praying&mdash;set out, taking them with me.&rdquo; For in this
					phrase several connecting words have been foisted in before the one which is to
					furnish the apodosis; and if the interval between &ldquo;I&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;set out&rdquo; is too great, the result is obscurity. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The first rule therefore is to make a proper use of
					connecting particles; the second, to employ special, not generic terms.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The third consists in avoiding ambiguous
					terms, unless you deliberately intend the opposite, like those who, having
					nothing to say, yet pretend to say something; such people accomplish this by the
					use of verse, after the manner of Empedocles.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName> &lpar;c.
						490-430&rpar;, poet, philosopher, and physician. Among other legends

						<placeName key="tgn,7003867">Etna</placeName>, so that by suddenly
						disappearing he might be thought to be a god. His chief work was a poem
						called Nature, praised by Lucretius. The principles of things are the four
						elements, fire, air, water, and earth, which are unalterable and
						indestructible. Love and hate, alternately prevailing, regulate the periods
						of the formation of the world. The existing fragments corroborate
						Aristotle's statement.</note> For the long circumlocution takes in the
					hearers, who find themselves affected like the majority of those who listen to
					the soothsayers. For when the latter utter their ambiguities, they also assent;
					for example, <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>Croesus, by crossing the Halys, shall ruin a mighty dominion.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hdt. 1.53">Hdt.
									1.53</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 1.91">Hdt. 1.91</bibl>. Croesus

						</lg>
					</quote>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1407b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>And as there is less chance of
					making a mistake when speaking generally, diviners express themselves in general
					terms on the question of fact; for, in playing odd or even, one is more likely
					to be right if he says &ldquo;even&rdquo; or &ldquo;odd&rdquo;
					than if he gives a definite number, and similarly one who says &ldquo;it
					will be&rdquo; than if he states &ldquo;when.&rdquo; This is why
					soothsayers do not further define the exact time. All such ambiguities are
					alike, wherefore they should be avoided, except for some such reason.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The deliberate intention to mislead.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The fourth rule consists in keeping the genders
					distinct&mdash;masculine, feminine, and neuter,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">skeu/h</foreign>, &ldquo;inanimate
						things,&rdquo; the classification probably being male, female, and
						inanimate, not the grammatical one of masculine, feminine, and
						neuter.</note> as laid down by Protagoras; these also must be properly
					introduced: <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>&ldquo;She, having come
					&lpar;<emph>fem</emph>.&rpar; and having conversed
					&lpar;<emph>fem</emph>.&rpar; with me, went away.&rdquo; The
					fifth rule consists in observing number, according as many, few, or one are
					referred to: &ldquo;They, having come &lpar;<emph>pl</emph>.&rpar;,
					began to beat &lpar;<emph>pl</emph>.&rpar; me.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Generally speaking, that which is written should be easy to read or easy to
					utter, which is the same thing. Now, this is not the case when there is a number
					of connecting particles, or when the punctuation is hard, as in the writings of
					Heraclitus.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Heraclitus of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> &lpar;c. 535-475&rpar;.
						His chief work was on Nature. From the harshness of his language and the
						carelessness of his style he was called <foreign lang="greek">o(
							skoteino/s</foreign> &lpar;the obscure&rpar;. According to him, fire
						was the origin of all things; all things become fire, and then fire becomes
						all other things. All things are in a constant state of flux; all is the
						same and yet not the same. Knowledge is founded upon sensual perception, but
						only the gods possess knowledge in perfection.</note> For it is hard, since
					it is uncertain to which word another belongs, whether to that which follows or
					that which precedes; for instance, at the beginning of his composition he says:
					&ldquo;Of this reason which exists<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or,
						&ldquo;although this reason exists for ever men are born . . . without
						understanding&rdquo; &lpar;Welldon&rpar;.</note> always men are
					ignorant,&rdquo; where it is uncertain whether &ldquo;always&rdquo;
					should go with &ldquo;which exists&rdquo; or with &ldquo;are
					ignorant.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Further, a solecism
					results from not appropriately connecting or joining two words with a word which
					is equally suitable to both.<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>For instance, in speaking of
					&ldquo;sound&rdquo; and &ldquo;color&rdquo;, the word
					&ldquo;seeing&rdquo; should not be used, for it is not suitable to both,
					whereas &ldquo;perceiving&rdquo; is. It also causes obscurity, if you do
					not say at the outset what you mean, when you intend to insert a number of
					details in the middle; for instance, if you say: &ldquo;I intended after
					having spoken to him thus and thus and in this way to set out&rdquo; instead
					of &ldquo;I intended to set out after having spoken to him,&rdquo; and
					then this or that happened, in this or that manner.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The following
					rules contribute to loftiness of style. Use of the description instead of the
					name of a thing; for instance, do not say &ldquo;circle,&rdquo; but
					&ldquo;a plane figure, all the points of which are equidistant from the
					center.&rdquo; But for the purpose of conciseness the reverse&mdash;use
					the name instead of the description. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>You should
					do the same to express anything foul or indecent; if the foulness is in the
					description, use the name; if in the name, the description. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Use metaphors and epithets by way of illustration,
					taking care, however, to avoid what is too poetical. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Use the plural for the singular, after the manner of the poets, who,
					although there is only one harbor, say <quote>
						<lg type="lyric">

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>You should avoid linking up, but each word

						h(mete/ras</foreign>. But for conciseness, the reverse: <foreign lang="greek">th=s h(mete/ras gunaiko/s</foreign>. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Employ a connecting particle or for conciseness omit it, but avoid
					destroying the connection; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1408a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for
					instance &ldquo;having gone and having conversed with him,&rdquo; or,
					&ldquo;having gone, I conversed with him.&rdquo;<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Also the practice of Antimachus is useful, that of
					describing a thing by the qualities it does not possess; thus, in speaking of
					the hill Teumessus,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>. The quotation is from the <title>

						B.C.&rpar;. The Alexandrians placed him next to Homer among the epic

						</quote> for in this way amplification may be carried on <emph>ad

					as a melody &ldquo;without strings&rdquo; or &ldquo;without the
					lyre&rdquo;; for they employ epithets from negations, a course which is
					approved in proportional metaphors, as for instance, to say that the sound of
					the trumpet is a melody without the lyre.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Propriety of
					style will be obtained by the expression of emotion and character, and by
					proportion to the subject matter. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Style is
					proportionate to the subject matter when neither weighty matters are treated
					offhand, nor trifling matters with dignity, and no embellishment is attached to
					an ordinary word; otherwise there is an appearance of comedy, as in the poetry

						tragic poet spoken of in <bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1448a">Aristot. Poet. 2</bibl>.

						they were goddesses or ordinary women.</note> who used certain expressions
					that reminded one of saying &ldquo;madam fig.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Style expresses emotion, when a man speaks with anger
					of wanton outrage; with indignation and reserve, even in mentioning them, of
					things foul or impious; with admiration of things praiseworthy; with lowliness
					of things pitiable; and so in all other cases. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Appropriate style<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>also makes the fact appear credible;

					hearer always sympathizes with one who speaks emotionally, even though he really
					says nothing. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This is why speakers often
					confound their hearers by mere noise.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Character also may be expressed by the proof
					from signs, because to each class and habit there is an appropriate style. I
					mean class in reference to age&mdash;child, man, or old man; to
					sex&mdash;man or woman; to country&mdash;Lacedaemonian or Thessalian. I
					call habits those moral states which form a man's character in life; <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>for not all habits do this. If then anyone uses the
					language appropriate to each habit, he will represent the character; for the
					uneducated man will not say the same things in the same way as the educated. But
					the hearers also are impressed in a certain way by a device employed <emph>ad
						nauseam</emph> by writers of speeches:<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Alluding to Isocrates.</note> &ldquo;Who does not know?&rdquo;
					&ldquo;Everybody knows&rdquo;; for the hearer agrees, because he is
					ashamed to appear not to share what is a matter of common knowledge.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The opportune or inopportune use of these
					devices <pb ed="Bekker" n="1408b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>applies to all kinds
					of Rhetoric.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;to all the special
						rules given above.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>But whenever one has gone too far, the remedy
					may be found in the common piece of advice&mdash;that he should rebuke
					himself in advance;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The exaggeration should be
						brought forward first, by way of forestalling the objection, and accompanied
						by some limiting phrase. Quintilian &lpar;<bibl n="Quint. Inst. Orat. 8.3.37">Quint. Inst. Orat. 8.3.37</bibl>&rpar;
						gives as examples: &ldquo;so to say,&rdquo; &ldquo;if I may be

					orator is obviously aware of what he is doing. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Further, one ought not to make use of all kinds of correspondence<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Adaptation of voice, features, etc., to the
						subject.</note> together; for in this manner the hearer is deceived. I mean,
					for instance, if the language is harsh, the voice, features, and all things
					connected should not be equally harsh; otherwise what each really is becomes
					evident. But if you do this in one instance and not in another, the art escapes
					notice, although the result is the same. If mild sentiments are harshly
					expressed or harsh sentiments mildly, the speech lacks persuasiveness.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Compound words, a number of epithets, and
					&ldquo;foreign&rdquo; words especially, are appropriate to an emotional
					speaker; for when a man is enraged it is excusable for him to call an evil
					&ldquo;high-as-heaven&rdquo; or &ldquo;stupendous.&rdquo; He may
					do the same when he has gripped his audience and filled it with enthusiasm,
					either by praise, blame, anger, or friendliness, as Isocrates does at the end of
					his <title>Panegyricus</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Isoc. 4.186">Isoc. 4.186</bibl>, where <foreign lang="greek">mnh/mh</foreign> is the reading, translated &ldquo;name&rdquo;

						misquotation.</note>: &ldquo;Oh, the fame and the name!&rdquo; and
					&ldquo;In that they endured.&rdquo; For such is the language of
					enthusiastic orators, and it is clear that the hearers accept what they say in a
					sympathetic spirit. Wherefore this style is appropriate to poetry; for there is
					something inspired in poetry. It should therefore be used either in this way
					or<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>when speaking ironically, after the manner of
					Gorgias, or of Plato in the <title>Phaedrus.</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 238d">Plat. Phaedrus 238d</bibl>,
						<bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 241e">Plat. Phaedrus 241e</bibl>. In the first

						&lpar;2.2.25&rpar;&rpar; of Gorgias is given in <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 3.1274b">Aristot. Pol. 3.1</bibl>. When asked how a person

						&lpar;1&rpar; artisan, &lpar;2&rpar; magistrate,

						may mean &ldquo;kettle-makers,&rdquo; from <foreign lang="greek">la/risa</foreign> &ldquo;a kettle,&rdquo; so called from having
						been first made at Larissa, but this seems unnecessary. The point is that
						Gorgias maintained that all were citizens who were made so by the

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The form of

				<p>The paean is a third kind of rhythm closely related to those already mentioned;

						</lg>
					</quote> This is a suitable ending, for the short syllable, being incomplete,

					scribe nor by a punctuation mark,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A dash below
						the first word of a line, indicating the end of a sentence.</note> but by
					the rhythm itself. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>That the style should be
					rhythmical and not unrhythmical, and what rhythms and what arrangement of them
					make it of this character, has now been sufficiently shown.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The style must
					be either continuous and united by connecting particles, like the dithyrambic
					preludes, or periodic, like the antistrophes of the ancient poets. The
					continuous style is the ancient one; for example, <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>&ldquo;This is the exposition of the investigation of Herodotus
					of <placeName key="perseus,Thurii">Thurii</placeName>.&rdquo; It was
					formerly used by all, but now is used only by a few. By a continuous style I
					mean that which has no end in itself and only stops when the sense is complete.
					It is unpleasant, because it is endless, for all wish to have the end in sight.
					That explains why runners, just when they have reached the goal,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">kampth=res</foreign>,
						properly the turning-point of the <foreign lang="greek">di/aulos</foreign>
						or double course, is here used for the goal itself.</note> lose their breath
					and strength, whereas before, when the end is in sight, they show no signs of
					fatigue. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Such is the continuous style. The
					other style consists of periods, and by period I mean a sentence that has a
					beginning and end in itself and a magnitude that can be easily grasped. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1409b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>What is written in this style
					is pleasant and easy to learn, pleasant because it is the opposite of that which
					is unlimited, because the hearer at every moment thinks he is securing something
					for himself and that some conclusion has been reached; whereas it is unpleasant
					neither to foresee nor to get to the end of anything. It is easy to learn,
					because it can be easily retained in the memory. The reason is that the periodic
					style has number, which of all things is the easiest to remember; that explains
					why all learn verse with greater facility than prose,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">tw=n xu/dhn</foreign>: lit. what is
						poured fourth promiscuously: in flowing, unfettered language
						&lpar;Liddell and <persName><surname>Scott</surname></persName>&rpar;.</note> for it has number by which it can be
					measured. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But the period must be completed with
					the sense and not stop short, as in the iambics of Sophocles,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Really from the <title>Meleager</title> of Euripides, Frag.
						515 &lpar;<title>T.G.F.</title>&rpar;. The break in the sense comes
						after <foreign lang="greek">gai=a, *pelopi/as xqono/s</foreign> really
						belonging to the next line: <foreign lang="greek">e)n a)ntipo/rqmois pe/di'
							e)/xous' eu)dai/mona</foreign>. As it stands in the text, the line
						implies that Calydon was in <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, which of course it was not. The meaning then is:
						&ldquo;This is the land of Calydon, with its fertile plains in the
						country over against <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>&rdquo; &lpar;on the opposite side of the

					<quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>This is Calydon, territory of the land of Pelops;</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> for by a division of this kind it is possible to suppose the contrary
					of the fact, as in the example, that Calydon is in <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A period may be composed of clauses, or simple.
					The former is a complete sentence, distinct in its parts and easy to repeat in a
					breath, not divided like the period in the line of Sophocles above, but when it
					is taken as a whole.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">It does not consist in
						simply dividing off any words from the context as the speaker pleases, but
						the parts of the sentence as a whole are properly constructed and
						distinguished and the sense also is complete.</note> By clause I mean one of
					the two parts of this period, and by a simple period one that consists of only
					one clause. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But neither clauses nor periods
					should be curtailed or too long. If too short, they often make the hearer
					stumble; for when he is hurrying on<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>towards the measure
					of which he already has a definite idea, if he is checked by the speaker
					stopping, a sort of stumble is bound to occur in consequence of the sudden stop.
					If too long, they leave the hearer behind, as those who do not turn till past
					the ordinary limit leave behind those who are walking with them. Similarly long
					periods assume the proportions of a speech and resemble dithyrambic preludes.
					This gives rise to what Democritus of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">A well-known
							musician.</note> jokingly rebuked in Melanippides,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of <placeName key="tgn,7010922">Melos</placeName>. He wrote

					hearer himself is carried away headlong.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The clauses of the periodic style are divided or

					&ldquo;following,&rdquo; &ldquo;sufficient,&rdquo;
					&ldquo;more&rdquo; are contraries. Again: &ldquo;to those who need

					&ldquo;enjoying&rdquo; is contrary to &ldquo;acquiring.&rdquo;
					Again: &ldquo;It often happens in these vicissitudes that the wise are

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Having settled
					these questions, we must next state the sources of smart and popular sayings.
					They are produced either by natural genius or by practice; to show what they are
					is the function of this inquiry. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let us
					therefore begin by giving a full list of them, and let our starting-point be the
					following. Easy learning is naturally pleasant to all, and words mean something,
					so that all words which make us learn something are most pleasant. Now we do not
					know the meaning of strange words, and proper terms we know already. It is
					metaphor, therefore, that above all produces this effect; for when Homer<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 24.213">Hom. Od. 24.213</bibl>
						<foreign lang="greek">a)ll' e)/mphs kala/mhn ge/ s' o)i+/mai ei)soro/wnta

						changed into an old beggar, to Eumaeus, his faithful swineherd, in whose
						house he was staying unrecognized.</note> calls old age stubble, he teaches
					and informs us through the genus; for both have lost their bloom. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The similes of the poets also have the same effect;
					wherefore, if they are well constructed, an impression of smartness is produced.
					For the simile, as we have said, is a metaphor differing only by the addition of
					a word,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">prosqe/sei</foreign>: the addition of the particle of comparison <foreign lang="greek">w(s. proqe/sei</foreign> &lpar;the reading of the
						<persName><surname>Paris</surname></persName> ms.&rpar; would mean,
						&lpar;1&rpar; &ldquo;manner of setting forth&rdquo;
						&lpar;Cope&rpar;, or &lpar;2&rpar; &ldquo;a metaphor,
						with a preface&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar; &lpar;but the meaning
						of this is not clear&rpar;. The simile only says that one thing
						<emph>resembles</emph> another, not, like the metaphor, that it
						<emph>is</emph> another; since the speaker does not say this, the result is
						that the mind of the hearer does not go into the matter, and so the chance
						of instruction, of acquiring some information, is lost.</note> wherefore it
					is less pleasant because it is longer; it does not say that this <emph>is</emph>
					that, so that<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>the mind does not even examine this.
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Of necessity, therefore, all style and
					enthymemes that give us rapid information are smart. This is the reason why
					superficial enthymemes, meaning those that are obvious to all and need no mental
					effort, and those which, when stated, are not understood, are not popular, but

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Of the four kinds of metaphor<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In <bibl n="Aristot. Poet. 1457a">Aristot. Poet. 21</bibl>
					metaphor and its four classes are defined: &ldquo;Metaphor consists in
					assigning to a thing the name of something else; and this may take place
					either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to
					species, or proportionally. An instance of a metaphor from genus to species
					is &lsquo;here stands my ship,&rsquo; for
					&lsquo;standing&rsquo; is a genus, &lsquo;being
					moored&rsquo; a species; from species to genus: &lsquo;Odysseus
					truly has wrought a myriad good deeds,&rsquo; for
					&lsquo;myriad&rsquo; is a specific large number, used for the
					generic &lsquo;multitude&rsquo;; from species to species:
					&lsquo;having drawn off the life with the bronze&rsquo; and
					&lsquo;having cut it with the unyielding bronze,&rsquo; where
					&lsquo;drawn off&rsquo; is used in the sense of
					&lsquo;cut,&rsquo; and &lsquo;cut&rsquo; in the sense of
					&lsquo;drawn off,&rsquo; both being species of &lsquo;taking
					away.&rsquo;&rdquo; For the proportional metaphor see note on 4.4
					above.</note>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1411a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>the most popular are those
					based on proportion. Thus, Pericles said that the youth that had perished during

					take care not to hold their &ldquo;concourses&rdquo; too often; and in
					the same way Isocrates, who spoke of those &ldquo;who rush

					&ldquo;freedom&rdquo; by the side of &ldquo;valor&rdquo;
					produces a kind of antithesis. And as Iphicrates said, &ldquo;The path of my
					words leads through the center of the deeds of Chares&rdquo;; here the
					metaphor is proportional and the words &ldquo;through the center&rdquo;
					create vividness. Also, to say that one &ldquo;calls upon dangers to help

					Chabrias said, &ldquo;not even reverencing the suppliant attitude of his

						attitude.</note> a metaphor for the moment, not for all time, but still
					vivid; for when Chabrias is in danger, the statue intercedes for him, the

					&ldquo;the eager spear-point,&rdquo; and the rest express actuality.
					Homer has attached these attributes by the employment of the proportional
					metaphor; for as the stone is to Sisyphus, so is the shameless one to the one
					who is shamelessly treated. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In his popular

					</quote> for he gives movement and life to all, and actuality is movement.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As we have said before, metaphors should be
					drawn from objects which are proper to the object, but not too obvious; just as,
					for instance, in philosophy it needs sagacity to grasp the similarity in things
					that are apart. Thus Archytas said that there was no difference between an
					arbitrator and an altar, for the wronged betakes itself to one or the other.
					Similarly, if one were to say that an anchor and a pot-hook hung up were

					apart&mdash;the equality of &ldquo;levelling&rdquo; in regard to
					superficies and resources.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cope, retaining
						<foreign lang="greek">a)nwmali/sqai</foreign> &lpar;as if from
						<foreign lang="greek">a)nomali/zein</foreign>, <emph>aequalitatem

						meaning &lpar;1&rpar; have been levelled to the ground
						&lpar;although the Lexica give no instance of this use&rpar;,
						&lpar;2&rpar; reduced to the same level of weakness.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Most smart sayings are derived from metaphor,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>and also from misleading the hearer beforehand.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">proecapata=n</foreign>.
						Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">prosecapata=n</foreign>, &ldquo;by
						adding deception.&rdquo;</note> For it becomes more evident to him that
					he has learnt something, when the conclusion turns out contrary to his
					expectation, and the mind seems to say, &ldquo;How true it is! but I missed
					it.&rdquo; And smart apophthegms arise from not meaning what one says, as in
					the apophthegm of Stesichorus, that &ldquo;the grasshoppers will sing to
					themselves from the ground.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">See
						2.21.8.</note> And clever riddles are agreeable for the same reason; for
					something is learnt, and the expression is also metaphorical. And what Theodorus
					calls &ldquo;novel expressions&rdquo; arise when what follows is
					paradoxical, and, as he puts it, not in accordance with our previous
					expectation; just as humorists make use of slight changes in words. The same
					effect is produced by jokes that turn on a change of letter; for they are
					deceptive. These novelties occur in poetry as well as in prose; for instance,
					the following verse does not finish as the hearer expected: <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>And he strode on, under his feet&mdash;chilblains,</l>
						</lg>
					</quote> whereas the hearer thought he was going to say
					&ldquo;sandals.&rdquo; This kind of joke must be clear from the moment
					of utterance. Jokes that turn on the word are produced, not by giving it the
					proper meaning, but by perverting it; for instance, when Theodorus said to
					Nicon, the player on the cithara, &ldquo;you are troubled&rdquo;
					&lpar; <foreign lang="greek">qra/ttei</foreign>&rpar;; for while
					pretending to say &ldquo;something troubles you,&rdquo; he deceives us;
					for he means something else.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">According to

						better than a Thracian slave-girl.&rdquo;</note>
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1412b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>Therefore the joke is only
					agreeable to one who understands the point; for if one does not know that Nicon
					is a Thracian, he will not see any joke in it. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Similarly, &ldquo;you wish to destroy him &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">pe/rsai</foreign>&rpar;.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">There is obviously a play on <foreign lang="greek">pe/rsai</foreign>
							&lpar;aor. 1 infin. of <foreign lang="greek">pe/rqw</foreign>&rpar;
							and <foreign lang="greek">*pe/rsai</foreign> &lpar;Persians&rpar;,
							but no satisfactory interpretation of the joke has been suggested.</note>
					Jokes of both these kinds<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The paradoxical and
						verbal. &ldquo;Suitably&rdquo; may refer to the manner of delivery;
						to being used at the proper time; or to taking care that the word is one
						that may be used in the two senses.</note> must be suitably expressed.
					Similar instances are such witticisms as saying that &ldquo;the empire of
					the sea&rdquo; was not &ldquo;the beginning of misfortunes&rdquo;
					for the Athenians, for they benefited by it; or, with Isocrates,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Isoc. 5.61">Isoc. 5.61</bibl>; <bibl n="Isoc. 8.101">Isoc. 8.101</bibl>. The point in the illustrations lies
						in the use of <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign>, first in the sense of
						&ldquo;empire,&rdquo; then in that of
						&ldquo;beginning.&rdquo; It could be said that the
						&ldquo;empire&rdquo; of the sea was or was not &ldquo;the
						beginning of misfortunes&rdquo; for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; for at first it was highly beneficial to them, but
						in the end brought disaster, and thus was the
						&ldquo;beginning&rdquo; of evil.</note> that
					&ldquo;empire&rdquo; was &ldquo;the beginning of misfortunes for the
					city&rdquo;; in both cases that which one would not have expected to be said
					is said, and recognized as true. For, in the second example, to say that
					&ldquo;empire is empire&rdquo; shows no cleverness, but this is not what
					he means, but something else; in the first, the <foreign lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign> which is negatived is used in a different sense. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>In all these cases, success is attained when a word is
					appropriately applied, either by homonym or by metaphor. For example, in the
					phrase Anaschetos &lpar;Bearable&rpar; is Unbearable,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Usually translated, &ldquo;There is no bearing
						Baring.&rdquo;</note> there is a contradiction of the homonym, which is
					only appropriate, if Anaschetus is an unbearable person. And, &ldquo;Thou
					shalt not be more of a stranger than a stranger,&rdquo; or &ldquo;not
					more than you should be,&rdquo; which is the same thing. And again, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>The stranger must not always be a stranger,</l>

						<foreign lang="greek">ce/nos</foreign> is apparently to be taken in the

						or somebody else, opposed to <foreign lang="greek">oi)kei=on</foreign>&rpar;. But the whole passage is obscure.</note> It

					one does not<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>deserve to die,&rdquo; or, that
					&ldquo;it is worthy to die when one is not worthy of death,&rdquo; or,
					&ldquo;when one does nothing that is worthy of death.&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Now the form of expression of these sayings is the
					same; but the more concisely and antithetically they are expressed, the greater
					is their popularity. The reason is that antithesis is more instructive and
					conciseness gives knowledge more rapidly. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Further, in order that what is said may be true and not superficial, it must
					always either apply to a particular person or be suitably expressed; for it is
					possible for it to have one quality and not the other. For instance,
					&ldquo;One ought to die guiltless of any offence,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
					worthy man should take a worthy woman to wife.&rdquo; There is no smartness
					in either of these expressions, but there will be if both conditions are
					fulfilled: &ldquo;It is worthy for a man to die, when he is not worthy of
					death.&rdquo; The more special qualities the expression possesses, the
					smarter it appears; for instance, if the words contain a metaphor, and a
					metaphor of a special kind, antithesis, and equality of clauses, and actuality.</p>

						greater detail &lpar;a characteristic of the simile&rpar;,
						distinctly bring out the contrast of the two terms and make a simile,

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="14"/>Proverbs also are metaphors from species to

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="15"/>Approved hyperboles are also metaphors. For

					would have thought he was a basket of mulberries,&rdquo; because the black
					eye is something purple, but the great quantity constitutes the hyperbole.
					Again, when one says &ldquo;like this or that&rdquo; there is a
					hyperbole differing only in the wording: <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>Like Philammon punching the leather sack,</l>

				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But we must
					not lose sight of the fact that a different style is suitable to each kind of
					Rhetoric. That of written compositions is not the same as that of debate; nor,
					in the latter, is that of public speaking the same as that of the law courts.
					But it is necessary to be acquainted with both; for the one requires a knowledge
					of good Greek, while the other prevents the necessity of keeping silent when we
					wish to communicate something to others, which happens to those who do not know
					how to write. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The style of written compositions
					is most precise, that of debate is most suitable for delivery. Of the latter
					there are two kinds, ethical and emotional; this is why actors are always
					running after plays of this character, and poets after suitable actors. However,
					poets whose works are only meant for reading are also popular, as Chaeremon, who
					is as precise as a writer of speeches, and Licymnius<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">See 2.13 of this book.</note> among dithyrambic poets. When
					compared, the speeches of writers appear meagre in public debates, while those
					of the rhetoricians, however well delivered, are amateurish when read. The
					reason is that they are only suitable to public debates; hence speeches suited
					for delivery, when delivery is absent, do not fulfil their proper function and
					appear silly. For instance, asyndeta and frequent<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>repetition of the same word are rightly disapproved in written speech, but in
					public debate even rhetoricians make use of them, for they lend themselves to
					acting.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">What follows, to the end of sect.

					declamation:<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The variation in the form of
						the expression suggests a similar variation in the form of the delivery or
						declamation.</note> as, &ldquo;This is he who robbed you, this is he who
					deceived you, this is he who at last attempted to betray you.&rdquo; This is
					what Philemon the actor did in <title>The Old Man's Folly</title> of
					Anaxandrides, when he says &ldquo;Rhadamanthus and Palamedes,&rdquo; and
					when he repeats the word &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the prologue to <title>The
						Pious</title>.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The meaning of this has not
							been satisfactorily explained. On the face of it, it seems to mean that the
							excellence of Philemon's delivery consisted in his way of declaiming
							passages in which the same words were repeated. Philemon is not to be
							confused with the writer of the New Comedy, the rival and contemporary of
							Menander.</note> For unless such expressions are varied by action, it is a
					case of &ldquo;the man who carries the beam&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Used of a stiff, ungraceful speaker.</note> in the
					proverb.&rpar;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>It is the same with asyndeta: &ldquo;I came,
					I met, I entreated.&rdquo; For here delivery is needed, and the words should
					not be pronounced with the same tone and character, as if there was only one
					clause. Further, asyndeta have a special characteristic; for in an equal space
					of time many things appear to be said, because the connecting particle makes
					many things one, so that, if it be removed, it is clear that the contrary will
					be the case, and that the one will become many. Therefore an asyndeton produces
					amplification: thus, in &ldquo;I came, I conversed, I besought,&rdquo;
					<pb ed="Bekker" n="1414a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>the hearer seems to be

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The deliberative style is exactly like a rough

					the greater the crowd, the further off is the point of view; wherefore in both
					too much refinement is a superfluity and even a disadvantage. But the forensic
					style is more finished, and more so before a single judge, because there is
					least opportunity of employing rhetorical devices, since the mind more readily
					takes in at a glance what belongs to the subject and what is foreign to it;
					there is no discussion,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The meaning apparently
						is that there is no discussion, as might be the case when there were several

								le/cis</foreign> are terms used for debate &lpar;e.g. in the law

						&ldquo;unclouded&rdquo;&rpar;.</note> so the judgement is clear.
					This is why the same orators do not excel in all these styles; where action is
					most effective, there the style is least finished, and this is a case in which
					voice, especially a loud one, is needed.</p>
				<p>The epideictic style is especially suited to written compositions, for its
					function is reading;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">This does not seem to
						agree with the general view. Funeral orations of the nature of panegyrics,

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and next to it comes the forensic style. It is
					superfluous to make the further distinction<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>that style
					should be pleasant or magnificent. Why so, any more than temperate, liberal, or
					anything else that indicates moral virtue? For it is evident that, if virtue of
					style has been correctly defined, what we have said will suffice to make it
					pleasant. For why, if not to please, need it be clear, not mean, but
					appropriate? If it be too diffuse, or too concise, it will not be clear; but it
					is plain that the mean is most suitable. What we have said will make the style
					pleasant, if it contains a happy mixture of proper and
					&ldquo;foreign&rdquo; words, of rhythm, and of persuasiveness resulting
					from propriety. This finishes what we had to say about style; of all the three
					kinds of Rhetoric in general, and of each of them in particular. It only remains
					to speak of arrangement.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A speech has
					two parts. It is necessary to state the subject, and then to prove it. Wherefore
					it is impossible to make a statement without proving it, or to prove it without
					first putting it forward; for both he who proves proves something, and he who
					puts something forward does so in order to prove it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The first of these parts is the statement of the case, the second the
					proof, a similar division to that of problem and demonstration. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the division now generally made is absurd; for
					narrative only belongs in a manner to forensic speech, but in epideictic or
					deliberative speech how is it possible that there should be narrative as it is
					defined, or a refutation; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1414b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>or
					an epilogue in demonstrative speeches?<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The
						generally accepted divisions are: <foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>
						&lpar;exordium&rpar;, <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>
						&lpar;narrative&rpar;, <foreign lang="greek">pi/stis</foreign>
						&lpar;proof&rpar;, <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/logos</foreign>
						&lpar;peroration&rpar;. &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> is a species of <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign>, which is used instead of it just before.&rpar;
						Aristotle objects that it is &lpar;as a rule&rpar; only the forensic
						speech which requires a regular <foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>, a
						full and detailed statement of what has happened before. In epideictic and
						demonstrative &lpar;deliberative&rpar; speeches, the object of which
						is to prove something, there is no need of another existing division called
						the refutation of the adversary, and in the demonstrative there can be no
						room for an epilogue, which is not a summary of <emph>proofs and
							arguments</emph>. Thus the necessary divisions of a speech are really only
						two; <foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">pi/stis</foreign>, or at most four.</note> In deliberative speeches,
					again, exordium, comparison, and recapitulation are only admissible when there
					is a conflict of opinion. For both accusation and defence are often found in
					deliberative, but not <emph>qua</emph> deliberative speech. And further, the
					epilogue does not even belong to every forensic speech, for instance, when it is
					short, or the matter is easy to recollect; for in the epilogue what happens is
					that there is a reduction of length.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e. its
						use is to recall the main facts briefly &lpar;sect. 4 end&rpar;,
						which in a short speech is needless.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So then the necessary parts of a speech are the
					statement of the case and proof. These divisions are appropriate to every
					speech, and at the most the parts are four in number&mdash;exordium,
					statement, proof, epilogue; for refutation of an opponent is part of the proofs,
					and comparison is an amplification of one's own case, and therefore also part of
					the proofs; for he who does this proves something, whereas the exordium and the
					epilogue are merely aids to memory. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Therefore,
					if we adopt all such divisions we shall be following Theodorus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 266d">Plat. Phaedrus
							266d</bibl>, where the additional kinds of narrative are omitted, and
						their place taken by <foreign lang="greek">pi/stwsis</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)pipi/stwsis</foreign> &lpar;confirmation of the
						proof&rpar;.</note> and his school, who distinguished narrative,
					additional narrative, and preliminary narrative, refutation and additional
					refutation. But one must only adopt a name to express a distinct species or a
					real difference; otherwise, it becomes empty and silly, like the terms
					introduced by Licymnius in his &ldquo;Art,&rdquo; where he speaks of
					&ldquo;being wafted along,&rdquo; &ldquo;wandering from the
					subject,&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or,
						&ldquo;diverting the judge's attention.&rdquo;</note> and
					&ldquo;ramifications.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The exordium
					is the beginning of a speech, as<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>the prologue in poetry
					and the prelude in flute-playing; for all these are beginnings, and as it were a
					paving the way for what follows. The prelude resembles the exordium of
					epideictic speeches; for as flute-players begin by playing whatever they can
					execute skilfully and attach it to the key-note, so also in epideictic speeches
					should be the composition of the exordium; the speaker should say at once
					whatever he likes, give the key-note and then attach the main subject. And all
					do this, an example being the exordium of the <title>Helen</title> of Isocrates;
					for the eristics and Helen have nothing in common.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The subject of the oration was the praise of Helen, but
						Isocrates took the opportunity of attacking the sophists. This exemplifies
						his skill in the introduction of matter not strictly proper to, or in common
						with, the subject. The key-note is Helen; but the exordium is an attack on
						the Eristics, with special allusion to the Cynics and the Megarians.</note>
					At the same time, even if the speaker wanders from the point, this is more
					appropriate than that the speech should be monotonous.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In epideictic speeches, the sources of the
					exordia are praise and blame, as Gorgias, in the <title>Olympiacus,</title>
					says, &ldquo;Men of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, you are
					worthy to be admired by many,&rdquo; where he is praising those who
					instituted the solemn assemblies. Isocrates on the other hand blames them
					because they rewarded bodily excellences, but instituted no prize for men of
					wisdom. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Exordia may also be derived from
					advice, for instance, one should honor the good, wherefore the speaker praises
					Aristides, or such as are neither famous nor worthless, but who, although they
					are good, remain obscure, as Alexander, son of Priam; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1415a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>for this is a piece of advice. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Again, they may be derived from forensic exordia, that
					is to say, from appeals to the hearer, if the subject treated is paradoxical,
					difficult, or commonly known, in order to obtain indulgence, like Choerilus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, epic poet, author of a poem on the Persian war, from
						which this half-line and the context preserved in the Scholiast are taken.
						He complains that whereas the poets of olden times had plenty to write
						about, the field of poetry being as yet untilled, it was now all

					</quote> It is the same in comedy. So then the most essential and special
					function of the exordium is to make clear what is the end or purpose of the
					speech; wherefore it should not be employed, if the subject is quite clear or
					unimportant. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>All the other forms of exordia in

					Rhetoric. These are derived from the speaker, the hearer, the subject, and the
					opponent. From the speaker and the opponent, all that helps to destroy or create
					prejudice. But this must not be done in the same way; for the defendant must
					deal with this at the beginning, the accuser in the epilogue. The reason is
					obvious. The defendant, when about to introduce himself, must remove all
					obstacles, so that he must first clear away all prejudice; the accuser must
					create prejudice in the epilogue, that his hearers may have a livelier
					recollection of it.</p>
				<p>The object of an appeal to the hearer is to make him well disposed or to arouse
					his indignation, and sometimes to engage his attention or the opposite; for it
					is not always expedient to engage his attention, which is the reason why many
					speakers try to make their hearers laugh. As for rendering the hearers
					tractable, everything will lead up to it if a person wishes, including the
					appearance of respectability, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1415b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>because respectable persons command more attention. Hearers pay most attention
					to things that are important, that concern their own interests, that are
					astonishing, that are agreeable; wherefore one should put the idea into their
					heads that the speech deals with such subjects. To make his hearers inattentive,
					the speaker must persuade them that the matter is unimportant, that it does not
					concern them, that it is painful.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>But we must not lose sight of the fact that all
					such things are outside the question, for they are only addressed to a hearer
					whose judgement is poor and who is ready to listen to what is beside the case;
					for if he is not a man of this kind, there is no need of an exordium, except
					just to make a summary statement of the subject, so that, like a body, it may
					have a head. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Further, engaging the hearers'
					attention is common to all parts of the speech, if necessary; for attention
					slackens everywhere else rather than at the beginning. Accordingly, it is
					ridiculous to put this<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">i.e., to claim the
						hearer's attention at the beginning, for every one is keen to listen then,
						but later on attention slackens.</note> at the beginning, at a time when all
					listen with the greatest attention. Wherefore, when the right moment comes, one
					must say, &ldquo;And give me your attention, for it concerns you as much as
					myself&rdquo;; and, &ldquo;I will tell you such a thing as you have
					never yet&rdquo; heard of, so strange and wonderful. This is what Prodicus
					used to do; whenever his hearers began to nod, he would throw in a dash of his

					</quote> the orator should aim at exciting these two feelings.</p>
				<p>In epideictic exordia, one must make the hearer believe that he shares the
					praise, either himself, or his family, or his pursuits, or at any rate in some
					way or other. For <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> says truly in his Funeral Oration that &ldquo;it
					is easy to praise Athenians in the presence of Athenians, but not in the
					presence of Lacedaemonians.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">See
						1.9.30.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Deliberative oratory borrows its exordia from
					forensic, but naturally they are very uncommon in it. For in fact the hearers
					are acquainted with the subject, so that the case needs no exordium, except for
					the orator's own sake, or on account of his adversaries, or if the hearers
					attach too much or too little importance to the question according to his idea.
					Wherefore he must either excite or remove prejudice, and magnify or minimize the
					importance of the subject. Such are the reasons for exordia; or else they merely
					serve the purpose of ornament, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1416a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>since their absence makes the speech appear offhand. For such is the encomium
					on the Eleans, in which Gorgias, without any preliminary sparring or movements,
					starts off at once, &ldquo;<placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>,
					happy city.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>One way of
					removing prejudice is to make use of the arguments by which one may clear
					oneself from disagreeable suspicion; for it makes no difference whether this
					suspicion has been openly expressed or not; and so this may be taken as a
					general rule. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Another way<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Another reading is <foreign lang="greek">to/pos</foreign>
						&lpar;topic&rpar; and so throughout.</note> consists in contesting
					the disputed points, either by denying the fact or its harmfulness, at least to
					the plaintiff; or by asserting that its importance is exaggerated; or that it is
					not unjust at all, or only slightly so; or neither disgraceful nor important.
					These are the possible points of dispute: as Iphicrates, in answer to
					Nausicrates, admitted that he had done what the prosecutor alleged and inflicted
					damage, but denied that he had been guilty of wrongdoing. Again, one may strike
					the balance, when guilty of wrongdoing, by maintaining that although the action
					was injurious it was honorable, painful but useful, or anything else of the
					kind.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Another method consists in saying that it was a
					case of error, misfortune, or necessity; as, for example, Sophocles said that he
					trembled, not, as the accuser said, in order to appear old, but from necessity,
					for it was against his wish that he was eighty years of age.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Sophocles had two sons, Iophon and Ariston, by different
						wives; the latter had a son named Sophocles. Iophon, jealous of the
						affection shown by Sophocles to this grandson, summoned him before the
						<emph>phratores</emph> &lpar;a body which had some jurisdiction in
						family affairs&rpar; on the ground that his age rendered him incapable
						of managing his affairs. In reply to the charge, Sophocles read the famous
						choric ode on <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> from the
						<title>Oedipus Coloneus</title>, beginning <foreign lang="greek">*eu)i/ppou, ce/ne, ta=sde xw/ras</foreign> &lpar;<bibl n="Soph. OC 668">Soph. OC 668 ff.</bibl>&rpar;, and was
						acquitted. The story in this form is probably derived from some comedy,
						which introduced the case on the stage &lpar;see Jebb's Introd. to the
						tragedy&rpar;.</note> One may also substitute one motive for another,
					and say that one did not mean to injure but to do something else, not that of
					which one was accused, and that the wrongdoing was accidental: &ldquo;I
					should deserve<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>your hatred, had I acted so as to bring
					this about.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Another method may be employed if the accuser,
					either himself or one closely related to him, has been involved in a similar
					charge, either now or formerly; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>or, if others
					are involved who are admittedly not exposed to the charge; for instance, if it
					is argued that so-and-so is an adulterer, because he is a dandy, then so-and-so
					must be.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Again, if the accuser has already similarly
					accused others, or himself been accused by others;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In the reading in the text, <foreign lang="greek">au)tou/s</foreign> must apparently refer to the defendant, and one would
						rather expect <foreign lang="greek">au)to/n</foreign>. Spengel suggested
						<foreign lang="greek">h)\ a)/llos h)\ au)to/s</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">h)\ a)/llos au)tou/s</foreign>: if he &lpar;i.e. the
						adversary&rpar; or another has similarly accused others.</note> or if
					others, without being formally accused, have been suspected as you are now, and
					their innocence has been proved.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Another method consists in counter-attacking the
					accuser; for it would be absurd to believe the words of one who is himself
					unworthy of belief.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Another method is to appeal to a verdict already
					given, as Euripides did in the case about the exchange of property;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">When a citizen was called upon to perform a
						&ldquo;liturgy&rdquo; or public service &lpar;e.g. the equipment
						of a chorus&rpar;, if he thought that one richer than himself had been
						passed over he could summon him and compel him to exchange
						properties.</note> when Hygiaenon accused him of impiety as having advised
					perjury in the verse, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>My tongue hath sworn, but my mind is unsworn,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 612">Eur. Hipp. 612</bibl>.
								This well-known verse is three times parodied in Aristophanes
								&lpar;<bibl n="Aristoph. Thes. 275">Aristoph. Thes.

								reversed: Euripides has dressed up a certain Mnesilochus as a
								woman in order that he may attend the Thesmophorian assembly.
								Mnesilochus first requires Euripides to take an oath that he
								will help him out of any trouble that may arise. Euripides takes
								an oath by all the gods, whereupon Mnesilochus says to
								Euripides: &ldquo;Remember that it was your mind that swore,
								but not your tongue.&rdquo; When Euripides was engaged in a
								lawsuit, his adversary quoted the line, implying that even on
								oath Euripides could not be believed; Euripides replied that his
								adversary had no right to bring before the law courts a matter
								which had already been settled by the theatrical
								judges.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> Euripides replied that his accuser did wrong in transferring the
					decisions of the court of Dionysus to the law courts; for he had already
					rendered an account of what he had said there,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In the great Dionysiac theater.</note> or was still ready to do so, if his
					adversary desired to accuse him.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Another method consists in attacking slander,
					showing how great an evil it is, and this because it alters the nature of
					judgements,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;makes
						extraneous points the subject of decision&rdquo;
						&lpar;Cope&rpar;, &ldquo;raises false issues&rdquo;
						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> and that it does not rely on the real facts
					of the case.</p>
				<p>Common to both parties is the topic of tokens, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1416b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>as in the <title>Teucer</title>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of Sophocles.</note> Odysseus reproaches Teucer with being a
					relative of Priam, whose sister his mother Hesione was; to which Teucer replied
					that his father Telamon was the enemy of Priam, and that he himself did not
					denounce the spies.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Who had been sent to
						<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> by the Greeks to spy upon
						the Trojans. It seems that he was afterwards accused of treachery, the
						<emph>token</emph> being the fact that Teucer was a near connection of
						Priam; to which he replied with another <emph>token</emph> that his father
						was an enemy of Priam, and further, when the Greek spies were in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, he never betrayed them.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Another method, suitable for the accuser, is to
					praise something unimportant at great length, and to condemn something important
					concisely; or, putting forward several things that are praiseworthy in the
					opponent, to condemn the one thing that has an important bearing upon the case.
					Such methods<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Jebb refers <foreign lang="greek">toiou=toi</foreign> to the accusers, translating <foreign lang="greek">texnikoi/</foreign> &ldquo;artistic,&rdquo; certainly the
						commoner meaning.</note> are most artful and unfair; for by their use men
					endeavor to make what is good in a man injurious to him, by mixing it up with
					what is bad.</p>
				<p>Another method is common to both accuser and defender. Since the same thing may
					have been done from several motives, the accuser must disparage it by taking it
					in the worse sense, while the defender must take it in the better sense. For
					instance, when Diomedes chose Odysseus for his companion, it may be said on the
					one hand that he did so because he considered him to be the bravest of men, on
					the other, that it was because Odysseus was the only man who was no possible
					rival for him, since he was a poltroon. Let this suffice for the question of
					prejudice.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the
					epideictic style the narrative should not be consecutive, but disjointed; for it
					is necessary to go through the actions which form the subject of the speech. For
					a speech is made up of one part that is inartificial &lpar;the speaker being
					in no way the author<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>of the actions which he
					relates&rpar;, and of another that does depend upon art. The latter consists
					in showing that the action did take place, if it be incredible, or that it is of
					a certain kind, or of a certain importance, or all three together. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>This is why it is sometimes right not to narrate all
					the facts consecutively, because a demonstration of this kind<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Involving a continuous succession of proofs.</note> is
					difficult to remember. From some facts a man may be shown to be courageous, from
					others wise or just. Besides, a speech of this kind is simpler, whereas the
					other is intricate and not plain. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It is only
					necessary to recall famous actions; wherefore most people have no need of
					narrative&mdash;for instance, if you wish to praise Achilles; for everybody
					knows what he did, and it is only necessary to make use of it. But if you wish
					to praise Critias, narrative is necessary, for not many people know what he did
					. . .<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Something has been lost here, as is
						shown by the transition from epideictic to forensic Rhetoric. All the mss.
						have a gap, which in several of them is filled by introducing the passage
						<foreign lang="greek">e)/sti d' e)/painos . . . metateqh|=</foreign>
						&lpar;1.9.33-37&rpar;.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But at the present day it is absurdly laid down
					that the narrative should be rapid. And yet, as the man said to the baker when
					he asked whether he was to knead bread hard or soft, &ldquo;What! is it
					impossible to knead it well?&rdquo; so it is in this case; for the narrative
					must not be long, nor the exordium, nor the proofs either. For in this case also
					propriety does not consist either in rapidity or conciseness, but in a due mean;
					that is, one must say all that will make the facts clear, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1417a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>or create the belief that they have
					happened or have done injury or wrong, or that they are as important as you wish
					to make them. The opposite party must do the opposite. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And you should incidentally narrate anything that tends to show your
					own virtue, for instance, &ldquo;I always recommended him to act rightly,
					not to forsake his children&rdquo;; or the wickedness of your opponent, for
					instance, &ldquo;but he answered that, wherever he might be, he would always
					find other children,&rdquo; an answer attributed by Herodotus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hdt. 2.30">Hdt. 2.30</bibl>. The story
						was that a number of Egyptian soldiers had revolted and left in a body for
						<placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName>. Their king
						Psammetichus begged them not to desert their wives and children, to which
						one of them made answer &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">tw=n de/ tina

							e)/sesqai au)toi=si e)nqau=ta kai\ te/kna kai\
							gunai=kas</foreign>&rpar;.</note> to the Egyptian rebels; or anything
					which is likely to please the dicasts.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In defence, the narrative need not be so long;
					for the points at issue are either that the fact has not happened or that it was
					neither injurious nor wrong nor so important as asserted, so that one should not
					waste time over what all are agreed upon, unless anything tends to prove that,
					admitting the act, it is not wrong. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Again, one
					should only mention such past things as are likely to excite pity or indignation
					if described as actually happening; for instance, the story of Alcinous, because
					in the presence of Penelope it is reduced to sixty lines,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 23.264-284">Hom. Od. 23.264-284</bibl>,
						<bibl n="Hom. Od. 23.310-343">Hom. Od. 23.310-343</bibl>. The title
						referred to the narrative in Books 9-12. It became proverbial for a
						long-winded story.</note> and the way in which Phayllus dealt with the epic
					cycle,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">he apparently summarized it.</note>
					and the prologue to the <title>Oeneus</title>.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Of Euripides. It was apparently very compact.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And the narrative should be of a moral
					character, and in fact it will be so, if we know what effects this. One thing is
					to make clear our moral purpose; for as is the moral purpose, so is the
					character, and as is the end, so is the moral purpose. For this reason
					mathematical treatises have no<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>moral character, because
					neither have they moral purpose; for they have no moral end. But the Socratic
					dialogues have; for they discuss such questions. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Other ethical indications are the accompanying peculiarities of each
					individual character; for instance, &ldquo;He was talking and walking on at
					the same time,&rdquo; which indicates effrontery and boorishness. Nor should
					we speak as if from the intellect, after the manner of present-day orators; but
					from moral purpose: &ldquo;But I wished it, and I preferred it; and even if
					I profited nothing, it is better.&rdquo; The first statement indicates
					prudence, the second virtue; for prudence consists in the pursuit of what is
					useful, virtue in that of what is honorable. If anything of the kind seems
					incredible, then the reason must be added; of this Sophocles gives an example,
					where his Antigone says that she cared more for her brother than for her husband
					or children; for the latter can be replaced after they are gone, <quote>
						<lg type="iamb">
							<l>but when father and mother are in the grave, no brother can ever be
								born.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Soph. Ant. 911-912">Soph. Ant. 911-912</bibl>, where the
									mss. have <foreign lang="greek">kekeuqo/toin</foreign> instead
									of Aristotle's <foreign lang="greek">bebhko/twn</foreign>.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> If you have no reason, you should at least say that you are aware that
					what you assert is incredible, but that it is your nature; for no one believes
					that a man ever does anything of his own free will except from motives of
					self-interest.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Whereas this man makes his
						temperament responsible for the strange things he does; he is built that way
						and cannot help it.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Further, the narrative should draw upon what is
					emotional by the introduction of such of its accompaniments as are well known,
					and of what is specially characteristic of either yourself or of the adversary:
					&ldquo;And he went off looking grimly at me&rdquo;; <pb ed="Bekker" n="1417b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and as Aeschines<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Supposed to be Aeschines called Socraticus from his intimate
							friendship with <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>. A philosopher and writer of speeches for the law
							courts, he had a great reputation as an orator.</note> says of Cratylus,
					that he hissed violently and violently shook his fists. Such details produce
					persuasion because, being known to the hearer, they become tokens of what he
					does not know. Numerous examples of this may be found in Homer: <quote>
						<lg type="dact">
							<l>Thus she spoke, and the aged nurse covered her face with her
								hands;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.361">Hom. Od. 19.361</bibl>.</note></l>
						</lg>
					</quote> for those who are beginning to weep lay hold on their eyes. And you
					should at once introduce yourself and your adversary as being of a certain
					character, that the hearers may regard you or him as such; but do not let it be
					seen. That this is easy is perfectly clear<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><foreign lang="greek">dei=</foreign> &lpar;omitted by
						others&rpar; = &ldquo;one cannot help seeing.&rdquo;</note> from
					the example of messengers; we do not yet know what they are going to say, but
					nevertheless we have an inkling of it.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Again, the narrative should be introduced in
					several places, sometimes not at all at the beginning. In deliberative oratory
					narrative is very rare, because no one can narrate things to come; but if there
					is narrative, it will be of things past, in order that, being reminded of them,
					the hearers may take better counsel about the future. This may be done in a
					spirit either of blame or of praise; but in that case the speaker does not
					perform the function of the deliberative orator. If there is anything
					incredible, you should immediately promise both to give a reason for it at once
					and to submit it to the judgement of any whom the hearers approve;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Omitting <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign>.
						The difficulty is <foreign lang="greek">diata/ttein</foreign>, which can
						apparently only mean &ldquo;arrange.&rdquo; Jebb retains <foreign lang="greek">te</foreign>, and reads <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign>
						for <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign>: &ldquo;the speaker must make

						approve.&rdquo;</note> as, for instance, Jocasta in the
					<title>Oedipus</title> of Carcinus<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">According
						to Jebb, Jocasta tells the inquirer incredible things about her son, and
						pledges her word for the facts. Cope says: &ldquo;promises &lpar;to
						do something or other to satisfy him&rpar;.&rdquo;</note> is always
					promising, when the man who is looking for her son makes inquiries<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>of her; and similarly Haemon in Sophocles.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Soph. Ant. 683-723">Soph. Ant.
								683-723</bibl>. On this Cope remarks: &ldquo;This last example must be
							given up as hopeless; there is nothing in the extant play which could be
							interpreted as required here.&rdquo; According to Jebb, the
							&ldquo;incredibility&rdquo; consists in the fact that Haemon,
							although in love with Antigone, and strongly opposed to the sentence
							pronounced upon her by his father Creon, still remains loyal to the latter.
							Haemon explains the reason in lines 701-3, where he says that he prizes his
							father's welfare more than anything else, for a father's good name and
							prosperity is the greatest ornament for children, as is the son's for the
							father.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Proofs should
					be demonstrative, and as the disputed points are four, the demonstration should
					bear upon the particular point disputed; for instance, if the fact is disputed,
					proof of this must be brought at the trial before anything else; or if it is
					maintained that no injury has been done; or that the act was not so important as
					asserted; or was just, then this must be proved, the three last questions being
					matters of dispute just as the question of fact. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But do not forget that it is only in the case of a dispute as to this question
					of fact that one of the two parties must necessarily<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Aristotle's argument is as follows. But it must not be
						forgotten that it is only in a dispute as to this question of fact that one
						of the two parties must necessarily be a rogue. For ignorance is not the
						cause &lpar;of there being a dispute about the fact, e.g. &ldquo;you
						hit me,&rdquo; &ldquo;no, I didn't,&rdquo; where both know the
						truth&rpar;, as it might be in a dispute on what was right or wrong, so
						that this is the topic on which you should spend some time &lpar;i.e.
						because here you can prove or disprove that A is <foreign lang="greek">ponhro/s</foreign>&rpar;. The passage is generally taken to mean
						that when it is a question of fact it is universally true that one of the
						disputants must be a rogue. Cope alone among editors makes any comment. In
						his note he says: &ldquo;all that is meant is that there is a certain
						class of cases which fall under this issue, in which this topic may be
						safely used.&rdquo; For instance, A may on justifiable grounds charge B
						with theft; B denies it, and he may be innocent, although the evidence is
						strongly against him. In such a case, neither of the parties is necessarily
						<foreign lang="greek">ponhro/s</foreign>.</note> be a rogue; for
					ignorance is not the cause, as it might be if a question of right or wrong were
					the issue; so that in this case one should spend time on this topic, but not in
					the others.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In epideictic speeches, amplification is
					employed, as a rule, to prove that things are honorable or useful; for the facts
					must be taken on trust, since proofs of these are rarely given, and only if they
					are incredible or the responsibility is attributed to another.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">a)/llws</foreign>, &ldquo;if there is some other
						reason.&rdquo;</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In deliberative oratory, it may be maintained
					either that certain consequences will not happen, or that what the adversary
					recommends will happen, but that it will be unjust, inexpedient, or not so
					important as supposed. But one must also look to see whether he makes any false
					statements as to things outside the issue; for these look like evidence that he
					makes misstatements about the issue itself as well. <pb ed="Bekker" n="1418a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Examples are best suited to deliberative oratory
					and enthymemes to forensic. The first is concerned with the future, so that its
					examples must be derived from the past; the second with the question of the

					are more in place; for the past involves a kind of necessity.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">It is irrevocable, and it is possible to discuss it with some

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Moral maxims, on the other hand, should be used

				<p><milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Deliberative speaking is more difficult than
					forensic, and naturally so, because it has to do with the future; whereas

					but only things that were past but obscure.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The remark of Epimenides is by many editors interpreted as a sarcasm upon

						that Epimenides practised a different kind of divination, relating to the
						obscure phenomena of the past. The following is an instance. After the

						been put to death by the Alcmaeonid archon Megacles, in violation of the
						terms of surrender, a curse rested upon the city and it was devastated by a
						pestilence. On the advice of the oracle, Epimenides was summoned from

						sacrifices purified the city and put a stop to the pestilence.</note>
					Further, the law is the subject in forensic speaking; and when one has a
					starting-point, it is easier to find a demonstrative proof. Deliberative
					speaking does not allow many opportunities for lingering&mdash;for instance,
					attacks on the adversary, remarks about oneself, or attempts to arouse emotion.
					In this branch of Rhetoric there is less room for these than in any other,
					unless the speaker wanders from the subject. Therefore, when at a loss for
					topics, one must do as the orators at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, amongst them Isocrates, for even when deliberating, he
					brings accusations against the Lacedaemonians, for instance, in the
					<title>Panegyricus</title>,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Isoc. 4.110">Isoc. 4.110-114</bibl>.</note> and against Chares in
					the <title>Symmachikos</title> &lpar;On the Peace&rpar;.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Isoc. 8.27">Isoc. 8.27</bibl>.</note></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Epideictic speeches should be varied with
					laudatory episodes, after the manner of Isocrates, who is always bringing
					somebody in. This is what Gorgias meant when he said that he was never at a loss
					for something to say; for, if he is speaking of Peleus, he praises Achilles,
					then Aeacus, then the god; similarly courage, which does this and that,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">He enumerates all the deeds that proceed from
						courage. Another reading is <foreign lang="greek">h)\ ta\ kai\ ta/, poiei=
							o(\ toio/nde e)sti/n</foreign>, i.e. when praising courage, and this or
						that, he is employing a method of the kind mentioned.</note> or is of such a
					kind. <milestone unit="section" n="12"/>If you have proofs, then, your language
					must be both ethical and demonstrative; if you have no enthymemes, ethical only.
					In fact, it is more fitting that a virtuous man <pb ed="Bekker" n="1418b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>should show himself good than that his speech should be
					painfully exact.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="13"/>Refutative enthymemes are more popular than
					demonstrative, because, in all cases of refutation, it is clearer that a logical
					conclusion has been reached; for opposites are more noticeable when placed in
					juxtaposition.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">There is no difference in
						form between the demonstrative and refutative enthymeme, but the latter
						draws opposite conclusions; and opposites are always more striking when they
						are brought together, and a parallel drawn between them. It is then easy to
						see where the fallacy lies. Cf. 2.23.30: &ldquo;Refutative enthymemes
						are more effective &lpar;popular&rpar; than demonstrative, because
						they bring opposites together in a small compass, which are more striking
						&lpar;clearer&rpar; to the hearer from being put side by
						side.&rdquo;</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The refutation of the opponent is not a
					particular kind of proof; his arguments should be refuted partly by objection,
					partly by counter-syllogism.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">In the
						translation <foreign lang="greek">tw=n pi/stewn</foreign> is taken with
						<foreign lang="greek">e)/sti</foreign>: it is the business of, the
						proper function of, proofs. Others take it with <foreign lang="greek">ta\
							me\n . . . ta\ de/</foreign>: some . . . other &lpar;of the
						opponent's arguments&rpar;.</note> In both deliberative and forensic
					rhetoric he who speaks first should state his own proofs and afterwards meet the
					arguments of the opponent, refuting or pulling them to pieces beforehand. But if
					the opposition is varied,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">If the opponent's
						arguments are numerous and strong, by reason of the varied nature of the
						points dealt with.</note> these arguments should be dealt with first, as
					Callistratus did in the Messenian assembly; in fact, it was only after he had
					first refuted what his opponents were likely to say that he put forward his own
					proofs. <milestone unit="section" n="15"/>He who replies should first state the
					arguments against the opponent's speech, refuting and answering it by
					syllogisms, especially if his arguments have met with approval. For as the mind
					is ill-disposed towards one against whom prejudices have been raised beforehand,
					it is equally so towards a speech, if the adversary is thought to have spoken
					well. One must therefore make room in the hearer's mind for the speech one
					intends to make; and for this purpose you must destroy the impression made by
					the adversary. Wherefore it is only after having combated all the arguments, or
					the most important, or those which are plausible, or most easy to refute, that
					you should substantiate your own case:<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/><quote>

					equivalent to the enthymeme &ldquo;If men should become reconciled whenever
					it is most useful and advantageous, they should be reconciled in a time of
					prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In regard to
					interrogation, its employment is especially opportune, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1419a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>when the opponent has already stated the opposite,
					so that the addition of a question makes the result an absurdity<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The words <foreign lang="greek">o(/tan . . .

						the fact; &lpar;3&rpar; when the opponent has already conceded so

						&lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note>; as, for instance, when Pericles interrogated
					Lampon about initiation into the sacred rites of the savior goddess. On Lampon
					replying that it was not possible for one who was not initiated to be told about
					them, Pericles asked him if he himself was acquainted with the rites, and when
					he said yes, Pericles further asked, &ldquo;How can that be, seeing that you
					are uninitiated?&rdquo; <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Again,
					interrogation should be employed when one of the two propositions is evident,
					and it is obvious that the opponent will admit the other if you ask him. But the
					interrogator, having obtained the second premise by putting a question, should
					not make an additional question of what is evident, but should state the
					conclusion. For instance, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, when accused by Meletus of not believing in
					the gods, asked<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">h)/reto</foreign>.</note> whether he did not say that there was a
					divine something; and when Meletus said yes, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> went on to ask if divine
					beings were not either children of the gods or something godlike. When Meletus
					again said yes, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> rejoined, <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>&ldquo;Is there a man, then, who can admit that the children of the gods
					exist without at the same time admitting that the gods exist?&rdquo;
					Thirdly, when it is intended to show that the opponent either contradicts
					himself or puts forward a paradox. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Further,
					when the opponent can do nothing else but answer the question by a sophistical
					solution; for if he answers, &ldquo;Partly yes, and partly no,&rdquo;
					&ldquo;Some are, but some are not,&rdquo; &ldquo;In one sense it is
					so, in another not,&rdquo; the hearers cry out against him as being in a
					difficulty.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">For the first of the quibbles
						Sandys refers to <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 396">Aristoph. Ach. 396</bibl>,
						where Cephisophon, being asked if Euripides was indoors, replies,
						&ldquo;Yes and no, if you understand me&rdquo;; and he gives the

						himself is upstairs &lpar; <foreign lang="greek">a)naba/dhn</foreign>,
						unless it means &ldquo;with his legs up&rdquo;&rpar; composing a
						tragedy. The reference in the second instance is to the adversary being
						reduced to such a position that he cannot answer without having recourse to
						sophistical divisions and distinctions, which seem to imply uncertainty.
						Aristotle himself is fond of such &ldquo;cautiously limited
						judgements&rdquo; &lpar;Gomperz&rpar;. The translation is that
						of the reading <foreign lang="greek">a)porou=ntos</foreign>, a conjecture of
						Spengel's. The audience will be ready to express its disapproval of his
						shuffling answers, which are evidence of his perplexity. The ordinary
						reading <foreign lang="greek">a)porou=ntes</foreign> attributes the
						&ldquo;perplexity&rdquo; to the hearers. Or, &ldquo;the hearers,
						thinking he is puzzled, <emph>applaud us</emph> &lsqb;the
						interrogator&rsqb;&rdquo; &lpar;Jebb&rpar;.</note> In other
					cases interrogation should not be attempted; for if the adversary raises an
					objection, the interrogator seems to be defeated; for it is impossible to ask a
					number of questions, owing to the hearer's weakness. Wherefore also we should
					compress our enthymemes as much as possible. <lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/></p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Ambiguous questions should be answered by
					defining them by a regular explanation, and not too concisely; those that appear
					likely to make us contradict ourselves should be solved at once in the answer,
					before the adversary has time to ask the next question or to draw a conclusion;
					for it is not difficult to see the drift of his argument. Both this, however,
					and the means of answering will be sufficiently clear from the
					<title>Topics</title>.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Aristot. Top. 8.4">Aristot. Top. 8.4</bibl>.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>If a conclusion is put in the form of a
					question, we should state the reason for our answer. For instance,
					Sophocles<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Cp. 1.14.3.</note> being asked
					by Pisander whether he, like the rest of the Committee of Ten, had approved the
					setting up of the Four Hundred, he admitted it. &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
					asked Pisander, &ldquo;did not this appear to you to be a wicked
					thing?&rdquo; Sophocles admitted it. &ldquo;So then you did what was
					wicked?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, for there was nothing better to be
					done.&rdquo; The Lacedaemonian, who was called to account for his ephoralty,
					being asked if he did not think that the rest of his colleagues had been justly
					put to death, answered yes. &ldquo;But did not you pass the same measures as
					they did?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Would not you, then,
					also be justly put to death?&rdquo; &ldquo;No; for my colleagues did
					this for money; I did not, but acted according to my conscience.&rdquo; For
					this reason we should not ask any further questions after drawing the
					conclusion, <pb ed="Bekker" n="1419b"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>nor put the
					conclusion itself as a question, unless the balance of truth is unmistakably in
					our favor.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="7"/>As for jests, since they may sometimes be useful
					in debates, the advice of Gorgias was good&mdash;to confound the opponents'
					earnest with jest and their jest with earnest. We have stated in the
					<title>Poetics</title><note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">The chapters are
						lost &lpar;cp. 1.11.29&rpar;.</note> how many kinds of jests there
					are, some of them becoming a gentleman, others not. You should therefore choose
					the kind that suits you. Irony is more gentlemanly than buffoonery; for the
					first is employed on one's own account, the second on that of another.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/><milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The epilogue
					is composed of four parts: to dispose the hearer favorably towards oneself and
					unfavorably towards the adversary; to amplify and depreciate; to excite the
					emotions of the hearer; to recapitulate. For after you have proved that you are
					truthful and that the adversary is false, the natural order of things is to
					praise ourselves, blame him, and put the finishing touches.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Or, &ldquo;mould the hearers to one's will&rdquo;
						&lpar;L. and S.&rpar;.</note> One of two things should be aimed at,
					to show that you are either relatively or absolutely good and the adversary
					either relatively or absolutely bad. The topics which serve to represent men as
					good or bad have already been stated.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book
						1.9.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After this,<lb ed="Bekker" n="20"/>when the
					proof has once been established, the natural thing is to amplify or depreciate;
					for it is necessary that the facts should be admitted, if it is intended to deal
					with the question of degree; just as the growth of the body is due to things
					previously existing. The topics of amplification and depreciation have been
					previously set forth.<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 2.19.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Next, when the nature and importance of the
					facts are clear, one should rouse the hearer to certain emotions&mdash;pity,
					indignation, anger, hate, jealousy, emulation, and quarrelsomeness. The topics
					of these also have been previously stated,<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Book 2.1-11.</note>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>so that all that remains is to recapitulate
					what has been said. This may appropriately be done at this stage in the way
					certain rhetoricians wrongly recommend for the exordium, when they advise
					frequent repetition of the points, so that they may be easily learnt. In the
					exordium we should state the subject, in order that the question to be decided
					may not escape notice, but in the epilogue we should give a summary statement of
					the proofs.</p>
				<p><milestone unit="section" n="5"/>We should begin by saying that we have kept our
					promise, and then state what we have said and why. Our case may also be closely
					compared with our opponent's; and we may either compare what both of us have
					said on the same point, or without direct comparison: &ldquo;My opponent
					said so-and-so, and I said so-and-so on this point <pb ed="Bekker" n="1420a"/><lb ed="Bekker" n="1"/>and for these reasons.&rdquo; Or ironically, as
					for instance, &ldquo;He said this and I answered that; what would he have
					done, if he had proved this, and not simply that?&rdquo; Or by
					interrogation: &ldquo;What is there that has not been proved?&rdquo; or,
					&ldquo;What has my opponent proved?&rdquo; We may, therefore, either sum
					up by comparison, or in the natural order of the statements, just as they were
					made, our own first, and then again, separately, if we so desire, what has been
					said by our opponent. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>To the conclusion of the
					speech<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">teleuth=|</foreign>, a conjecture of Victorius. With <foreign lang="greek">teleuth/</foreign>, the sense will be: &ldquo;as a
						conclusion, the asyndectic style is appropriate.&rdquo;</note> the most
					appropriate style is that which has no connecting particles, in order that it
					may be a peroration, but not an oration: &ldquo;I have spoken; you have
					heard; you know the facts; now give your decision.&rdquo;<note resp="Freese" anchored="yes">It is generally supposed that this example of a suitable
						peroration is an echo of the conclusion of the speech of Lysias
