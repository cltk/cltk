                        <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of
                        the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the
                        moment that it broke out, and believing that it would be a great war, and
                        more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it. This belief was not without its grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every department in the
                        last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed doing so at once having it in contemplation.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
                    <seg>Indeed this was the greatest movement yet known in history, not only of the
                        Hellenes, but of a large part of the barbarian world&mdash;I had almost
                        said of mankind.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
                    <seg>For though the events of remote antiquity, and even those that more
                        immediately precede the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly
                        ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was
                        practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that there was
                        nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters. </seg>

                    <seg>
                        <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For instance, it is evident that the country
                        now called <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> had in ancient times no settled population; on the contrary, migrations were of frequent occurrence, the several tribes
                        readily abandoning their homes under the pressure of superior numbers.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
                    <seg>Without commerce, without freedom of communication either by land or sea,
                        cultivating no more of their territory than the exigencies of life required,
                        destitute of capital, never planting their land &lpar;for they could not
                        tell when an invader might not come and take it all away, and when he did
                        come they had no walls to stop him&rpar;, thinking that the necessities
                        of daily sustenance could be supplied at one place as well as another, they
                        cared little for shifting their habitation, and consequently neither built
                        large cities nor attained to any other form of greatness.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
                    <seg>The richest soils were always most subject to this change of masters; such as the district now called <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>, most of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>,
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> excepted, and the most fertile parts of the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
                    <seg>The goodness of the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular
                        individuals, and thus created faction which proved a fertile source of ruin.</seg>
                    <seg>It also invited invasion.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
                    <seg>Accordingly <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, from the poverty of its soil enjoying from a very
                        remote period freedom from faction, never changed its inhabitants.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
                    <seg>And here is no inconsiderable exemplification of my assertion, that the
                        migrations were the cause of there being no correspondent growth in other
                        parts.</seg>
                    <seg>The most powerful victims of war or faction from the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> took
                        refuge with the Athenians as a safe retreat;</seg>
		    <seg>and at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the already large
                        population of the city to such a height that <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> became at last too small
                        to hold them, and they had to send out colonies to <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>. </seg>

                        contributes not a little to my conviction of the weakness of ancient times.</seg>
                    <seg>Before the Trojan war there is no indication of any common action in
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>,</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
                    <seg>nor indeed of the universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of Hellen, son of Deucalion, no such
                        appellation existed, but the country went by the names of the different
                        tribes, in particular of the Pelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in <placeName key="tgn,7002684">Phthiotis</placeName>, and were
                        invited as allies into the other cities, that one by one they gradually
                        acquired from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
                    <seg>The best proof of this is furnished by Homer.</seg>
                    <seg>Born long after the Trojan war, he nowhere calls all of them by that name,
                        nor indeed any of them except the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis, who
                        were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called Danaans, Argives,
                        and Achaeans.</seg>
                    <seg>He does not even use the term barbarian, probably because the Hellenes had
                        not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one distinctive
                        appellation.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
                    <seg>It appears therefore that the several Hellenic communities, comprising not
                        only those who first acquired the name, city by city, as they came to
                        understand each other, but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name
                        of the whole people, were before the Trojan war prevented by their want of
                        strength and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any
                        collective action.</seg>

                        unite for this expedition till they had gained increased familiarity with

                    <seg>He made himself master of what is now called the Hellenic sea,</seg>

                        barbarians of the coast and islands, as communication by sea became more
                        common, were tempted to turn pirates, under the conduct of their most
                        powerful men; the motives being to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy.</seg>
                    <seg>They would fall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere
                        collection of villages, and would plunder it;</seg>
		    <seg>indeed, this came to be the main source of their livelihood, no disgrace
                        being yet attached to such an achievement, but even some glory.</seg>

   <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
                    <seg>An illustration of this is furnished by the honor with which some of the
                        inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder, and by the
                        question we find the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking
                        of voyagers&mdash;&lsquo;Are they pirates?&rsquo;&mdash;as
                        if those who are asked the question would have no idea of disclaiming the

                        region of the continent;</seg>

                        wealth, acquired such power that, stranger though he was, the country was

                        descendants. Eurystheus had been killed in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> by the Heraclids. Atreus was his mother's brother; and to the hands of his relation, who had left his father on account of the
                        death of Chrysippus, Eurystheus, when he set out on his expedition, had
                        committed <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> and the government. As time went on and Eurystheus did not return, Atreus complied with the
                        wishes of the Mycenaeans, who were influenced by fear of the
                        Heraclids,&mdash;besides, his power seemed considerable, and he had not
                        neglected to court the favour of the populace,&mdash;and assumed the
                        sceptre of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> and the rest of the dominions of Eurystheus. And so the power of the descendants of Pelops came to be greater than that

                        if independent we found them when we made the treaty, and when the
                        Lacedaemonians grant to their cities an independence not involving
                        subservience to Lacedaemonian interest, but such as each severally may
                        desire: that we are willing to give the legal satisfaction which our

                    <seg>Besides, the numerical superiority that we have to meet is not that of an

                        should start; and night coming on, the Macedonians and the barbarian crowd took fright in

                        in the direction of home, and thus compelled Perdiccas, who at first did not
                        perceive what had occurred, to depart without seeing Brasidas, the two
                        armies being encamped at a considerable distance from each other.</seg>

                        usual without further explanation.</seg>
                    <seg>As it is, in the face of the desertion of our friends and the numbers of
                        the enemy, I have some advice and information to offer, which, brief as they
                        must be, will, I hope, suffice for the more important points.</seg>


   <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
                    <seg>The bravery that you habitually display in war does not depend on your
                        having allies at your side in this or that encounter, but on your native
                        courage; nor have numbers any terrors for citizens of states like yours, in which
                        the many do not rule the few, but rather the few the many, owing their
                        position to nothing else than to superiority in the field.</seg>


   <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
                    <seg>Inexperience now makes you afraid of barbarians; and yet the trial of strength which you had with the Macedonians among
                        them, and my own judgment, confirmed by what I hear from others, should be
                        enough to satisfy you that they will not prove formidable.</seg>


   <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
                    <seg>Where an enemy seems strong but is really weak, a true knowledge of the
                        facts makes his adversary the bolder, just as a serious antagonist is
                        encountered most confidently by those who do not know him.</seg>
                    <seg>Thus the present enemy might terrify an inexperienced imagination, they are
                        formidable in outward bulk, their loud yelling is unbearable, and the
                        brandishing of their weapons in the air has a threatening appearance.</seg>


   <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
                    <seg>But when it comes to real fighting with an opponent who stands his ground,
                        they are not what they seemed; they have no regular order that they should be ashamed of deserting their
                        positions when hard pressed; flight and attack are with them equally honourable, and afford no test of
                        courage; their independent mode of fighting never leaving any one who wants to run
                        away without a fair excuse for so doing.</seg>
                    <seg>In short, they think frightening you at a secure distance a surer game than
                        meeting you hand to hand; otherwise they would have done the one and not the other.</seg>


   <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
                    <seg>You can thus plainly see that the terrors with which they were at first
                        invested are in fact trifling enough, though to the eye and ear very
                        prominent.</seg>
                    <seg>Stand your ground therefore when they advance, and again wait your
                        opportunity to retire in good order, and you will reach a place of safety
                        all the sooner, and will know for ever afterwards that rabble such as these,
                        to those who sustain their first attack, do but show off their courage by
                        threats of the terrible things that they are going to do, at a distance, but
                        with those who give way to them are quick enough to display their heroism in

                        is certain; but why they did not come on has been variously accounted for.</seg>
                    <seg>Some think that he went away in pursuance of his plan of wasting the

                        brought the Phoenicians to <placeName key="perseus,Aspendos">Aspendus</placeName> to exact money from them for their
                        discharge, having never intended to employ them: others again that it was in
                        view of the outcry against him at <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, in order that it might be said
                        that he was not in fault, but that the ships were really manned and that he
                        had certainly gone to fetch them.</seg>

                    <seg>To myself it seems only too evident that he did not bring up the fleet

                        waste their strength by the time lost during his journey to <placeName key="perseus,Aspendos">Aspendus</placeName>, and to
                        keep them evenly balanced by not throwing his weight into either scale.</seg>
                    <seg>Had he wished to finish the war, he could have done so, assuming of course
                        that he made his appearance in a way which left no room for doubt; as by bringing up the fleet he would in all probability have given the
                        victory to the Lacedaemonians, whose navy, even as it was, faced the
                        Athenian more as an equal than as an inferior.</seg>


   <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
                    <seg>But what convicts him most clearly, is the excuse which he put forward for
                        not bringing the ships.</seg>
                    <seg>He said that the number assembled was less than the king had ordered; but surely it would only have enhanced his credit if he spent little of the
