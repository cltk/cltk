				<head>Note on the geography of Thucydides</head>
				<p>VARIOUS difficulties have been found in the geography of Thucydides: his accounts of places
				are at variance sometimes (1) with facts, sometimes (2) with the statements of later
				writers. It may be said of his descriptions generally, as of most early descriptions, that
				they are graphic rather than accurate. When we try to reproduce them in the mind something
				is wanting. For example, we do not gather from his narrative where the Euryelus was situated
				by which the Athenians, and also Gylippus, ascended the heights of Epipolae (<bibl
				n="Thuc. 6.97">6.97</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.2">7.2</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 7.43"
				>43</bibl>), or how the Syracusan defences lay after the completion of the third
				counter-wall (<bibl n="Thuc. 7.7">7.7</bibl>), or, without some consideration, how the
				dolphins were placed for the protection of the Athenian ships in the great Syracusan harbour
				(<bibl n="Thuc. 7.38">7.38</bibl>). The topography of battles is often imperfect, and
				sometimes leads to a difficulty in the explanation of them. The narrative of the battle of
				Amphipolis leads to the inference (see Arnold's Appendix) that the city was not at the top
				but on the slope of the hill which Cleon ascended with his army, but this can only be
				inferred with some uncertainty and is not definitely expressed. Perhaps without maps and
				plans a better delineation was impossible. The narrative of the second sea-fight in the
				Crisaean gulf (ii. go f.) is incoherent: for we are not told what happened to that portion
				of the Peloponnesian fleet which was originally victorious. The manner of the attack which
				ended in the<pb n="xii"/> capture of the first Syracusan counter-wall (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.100"
				>6.100</bibl>) is not fully described and can only be inferred; the 'Argive hoplites'
				who were killed in the Syracusan out-works after the capture of the stockade must have
				joined the attacking party from one of the two other divisions of the army. Once more, in
				the calculation of distances the eye or the information of the writer was frequently at
				fault. For examples see below.</p>
				<p>There has been a good deal of controversy on this subject. Even into geography the spirit of
				party may find a way. Some commentators have been desirous of maintaining the credit of
				their author, like Dr. Arnold, who was of opinion that 'when Geographers who are also
				Scholars visit the places of which Thucydides speaks personally, most of the difficulties in
				his descriptions will vanish.' That remark of course supposes that Thucydides, rightly
				understood, is generally or always in the right. We may imagine the writer of it to feel
				what he does not say: 'The most accurate and trustworthy of historians can hardly be
				imagined to be ignorant as a schoolboy of geography.' And certainly, in his account of Pylos
				and Sphacteria, Dr. Arnold is ready, in a figure, to work a miracle in order to save the
				reputation of Thucydides. Changes in the formation of the coast are the 'Deus ex machina' to
				which he has recourse.</p>
				<p>Yet it may very likely be true that Thucydides is far behind Strabo or Pausanias or Stephanus
				Byzantinus in geography, though his conception of history may be quite unattainable by them.
				Still greater would be the disparity of his knowledge when compared with that of a modern
				traveller, or resident in Greece, who has perhaps surveyed and explored places which the
				historian himself may not have visited. For the knowledge of geography is always growing
				with time, while history fades into the distance. The materials of the one are increasing,
				while those of the other are diminishing. The credibility of an author's geography is not
				therefore to be judged of<pb n="xiii"/> by the credibility of his history, because in the
				one far more than in the other he is dependent on the conditions of his age.</p>
				<p>In this short note it is not intended to enter into the discussion of particular passages,
				but rather to urge two general principles: (i) that geographical accuracy is not to be
				expected from a writer of the age of Thucydides: (2) that the number of his inaccuracies
				show them to be attributable rather to his ignorance, than to the ignorance of later
				writers, or of ourselves.</p>
				<p>To attempt to reconcile the geography of Thucydides with facts may be the same error in kind,
				though not in degree, as to try and adapt the drive of Telemachus between Pylos and Sparta
				to the present condition of the country, or to seek on the sea-shore of Ithaca for the cave
				by which Odysseus was deposited. As the more familiar features of a scene are likely to be
				reproduced in the creations of the poet, so the ancient historian will roughly guess
				distances. But he may often make mistakes about a region with which he was unacquainted, and
				he will not always be able to judge what amount of description is required in order to place
				before his readers a just conception of a place or of a battle. There were no surveys of
				countries or measurements of distances in the age of Herodotus and Thucydides (except along
				the course of great roads such as the Persian highways), but only the proverbially uncertain
				measure of a day's journey or of a day's sail (see Thuc. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.97">2.97</bibl>,
				and Arnold's note). There were no correct maps, but only rude delineations such as made
				Herodotus laugh (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.36">4.36</bibl>). The eye was the judge of the distance
				across a strait or across the entrance of a harbour. Daily experience tells us how seldom
				the power of judging distances is found in any one who has not been trained by long habit.</p>
				<p>Some of the errors or misleading expressions in Thucydides which have suggested the above
				remarks are the following:&mdash;<pb n="xiv"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 2.86">2.86 med.</bibl> The distance of Rhium in Achaia from Rhium on the
				opposite coast is said by Thucydides to be less than a mile (7 stadia). According to Col.
				Leake (Morea, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.148">2.148</bibl>) 'the distance is little, if at all, short
				of a mile and a half,' and would have been considerably greater in ancient times if we
				assume, as in this particular instance there is reason for thinking, that the sea, owing to
				the deposits of rivers, has retreated about 250 yards on the south, and somewhat less on the
				north coast.</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 4.8">4.8 med.</bibl> The southern entrance of the harbour formed by the bay
				of Navarino is more than three-quarters of a mile in width, and the northern is 132 yards.
				But according to Thucydides the northern entrance admitted the passage of only two ships,
				the southern of not more than eight or nine, and the Lacedaemonians had intended to block up
				both passages by ships placed lengthways<note anchored="yes">[It has been suggested that
				Thucydides fell into the error by combining the accounts of two informants, one of whom
				meant by 'the harbour' the lagoon of Osmyn Aga, behind Pylos, and the other the bay of
				Navarino: and mistook an intended blocking of the N. entrance to the bay of Navarino at
				both ends (by which a passage from the bay into the lagoon, which may have existed at
				the time, would also have been closed to the Athenians) for a blocking of the N. and S.
				entrances. See Mr. G. B. Grundy's admirable monograph on Pylos and Sphacteria. If this
				be so, the criticism, in the Essay, on Thucydides as a geographer would only be
				confirmed. It is clear from <bibl n="Thuc. 4.8">4.8</bibl> (<foreign lang="greek">th\n
				de\ nh=son tau/thn fobou/menoi mh\ e)c au)th=s to\n po/lemon sfi/si poiw=ntai,

				au(tw=n</foreign>) that Thucydides believed the Lacedaemonians to have intended to block
				both entrances of the bay of Navarino. &mdash;And it is after all hard to believe
				that as a fact they did not intend to keep out the Athenian ships by occupying (if not
				blocking) the S. entrance.]</note>.</p>
				<p>Thucydides also underrates considerably the length of the island, which he describes (<bibl
				n="Thuc. 4.8">4.8</bibl>) as 15 stadia (about 3000 yards), whereas it is really 2 3/4
				miles (4800 yards). [Mr. Grundy (see note) points out that the distance from the place where
				the Athenians must have landed on the bay side of the island to its N. point is about 15
				stadia.]<pb n="xv"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 4.57">4.57 init.</bibl> According to Thucydides, Thyrea was situated about 10
				stadia from the sea, or about 1 1/8 of a mile. According to Col. Leake (Morea, <bibl
				n="Thuc. 2.492">2.492</bibl>) 'it is at least three times that distance.' Other writers
				suggest other sites. But there are no remains which agree with the distance mentioned in
				Thucydides (Bursian, Geographie von Griechenland, ii. p. 70).</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 6.104">6.104 med.</bibl> Gylippus sailing from Tarentum to Sicily was caught
				by a storm in the Terinaean gulf. But the Terinaean gulf, called also the Sinus Hipponiates,
				is on the west coast of Italy (Pliny, iii. 72. 5, 10). <foreign lang="greek">Kata\ to\n
				Terinai=on ko/lpon</foreign> cannot mean 'opposite the Terinaean gulf.'</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 8.88">8.88 init.</bibl> Alcibiades is described as sailing straight from
				Samos to Phaselis and Caunus on his way to Aspendus, and as returning to Samos from Caunus
				and Phaselis (108 init.). The inverse order in both cases is the true one. Dr. Arnold
				supposes the words to mean 'straight to Phaselis, having first touched at Caunus'; 'from
				Caunus, and before that from-Phaselis.' But this explanation is forced in itself, and is
				rendered impossible by the repetition of the wrong order in the description of the return
				voyage.</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 8.101">8.101 fin.</bibl> Similarly, Larissa and Hamaxitus are mentioned in a
				wrong order (see Strabo, xiii. I. 47, 48, pp. 604, 605).</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 6.72">6.72 init.</bibl> So Naxos and Catana.</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 3.29">3.29 med.</bibl> So Icarus and Myconus.</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 7.19">7.19 init.</bibl> Decelea is said to be distant about 120 stadia (i. e.
				about fourteen miles) from Athens, and about the same or a little more from Boeotia. In
				reality it was much nearer Boeotia. It has been suggested that Thucydides is here thinking
				of the far-off corner of Boeotia at Oropus, from which an important road ran through Decelea
				(<bibl n="Thuc. 7.28">7.28 init.</bibl>) to Athens. Still this would only show how
				different his mode of expression is from that of a modern writer.</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 8.26">8.26 med.</bibl>
				<foreign lang="greek">Le/ron th\n pro\ Milh/tou nh=son.</foreign> But Leros<pb n="xvi"/> is
				forty miles from Miletus. All the MSS. except the Vatican read <foreign lang="greek"
				>)/Eleon,</foreign> a place which is otherwise unknown. <foreign lang="greek"
				>Le/ron</foreign> is probably correct, and is confirmed by the close connexion which we find
				existing between Leros and Miletus in the tribute lists (C. I. A. 37, 226, 251, 262, 264).
				The expression is natural enough for a writer who had in his mind not maps of the Aegean,
				but the actual voyage past Leros to Miletus.<bibl n="Thuc. 3.4">3.4 fin.</bibl>
				<foreign lang="greek">w(/rmoun e)n th|= Male/a|, pro\s bore/an th=s po/lews</foreign>
				(compare c. 6, <foreign lang="greek">periopmisa/menoi to\ pro\s no/ton</foreign>). But,
				according to Strabo, Malea was at the southern extremity of the island. It is possible
				however to take <foreign lang="greek">pro\s bore/an th=s po/lews</foreign> not with <foreign
				lang="greek">w(/rmoun</foreign> but with <foreign lang="greek">a)poste/llousi pre/sbeis
				trih/rei,</foreign> referring to the Mytilenaeans, above.</p>
				<p>
				<bibl n="Thuc. 1.61">1.61 med.</bibl>
				<foreign lang="greek">a)fiko/menoi e)s Be/roian ka)kei=qen e)pistre/yantes.</foreign> But
				Beroea was several days' march out of the road from Pydna to Potidaea; nor could the
				Athenians possibly have reached Gigonus by slow marches three days after their departure
				from Beroea (<foreign lang="greek">kat) o'li/gon de\ proi+o/ntes tritai=oi a)fi/konto e)s
				Gi/gwnon</foreign>). The generally received correction <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\
				Stre/yan</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek">e)istre/yantes</foreign> cannot be
				considered certain, and does not remove the difficulty about Beroea.</p>
				<p>We may also notice that where Thucydides evidently wants to express geographical ideas with
				precision, as in<bibl n="Thuc. 2.9">2.9 fin.</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">nh=soi o(/sai
				e)nto\s Peloponnh/sou kai\ Krh/ths pro\s h(/lion a)ni/sxonta, pa=sai ai( a)/llai
				Kukla/des plh\n Mh/lou kai\ Fh/ras</foreign> or in the description of the island of
				Cythera, <bibl n="Thuc. 4.53">4.53 fin.</bibl>, <foreign lang="greek">pa=sa</foreign> (i. e.
				either <foreign lang="greek">h( nh=sos</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">h(
				Lakwnikh\</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">ga\p a)ne/xi pro\s to\ Sikeliko\n kai\ Krhtiko\n
				pe/lagos,</foreign> he has caused a great deal of trouble to his interpreters<note
				anchored="yes">[In <bibl n="Thuc. 2.9">2.9</bibl> the variations in the text give good
				ground for suspecting a gloss.]</note>. There is a lesser degree of obscurity in the
				description of the country about Chimerium (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.46">1.46 fin.</bibl>),
				especially the words <foreign lang="greek">r(ei= de\ kai\ Qu/amis potamo/s, o(ri/zwn th\n
				Qesprwti/da kai\ Kestri/nhn, w(=n e)nto\s, h( a)/kpa a)ne/xei to\ Xeime/roin,</foreign>
				where <foreign lang="greek">w(=n</foreign> refers not to <foreign lang="greek">th\n
				Qesprwti/da kai\ Kestri/nhn,</foreign> but to<pb n="xvii"/>
				<foreign lang="greek">potamw=n,</foreign> gathered from the previous sentence (scil. the
				Acheron and the Thyamis).</p>
				<p>It is worth while also to compare the description of the kingdom of the Odrysae in <bibl
				n="Thuc. 2.97">2.97</bibl>, which, though not obscure, is cumbrous and very unlike the
				manner of a modern geographer.</p>
				<p>Considering the number of these errors and vague expressions, and the probability that
				Thucydides from his imperfect means of knowledge would have fallen into them, is it worth
				while, for the sake of vindicating his credit, either to alter the text, or to assume
				changes in the face of nature unless there is actual proof of them in each particular case?
				All that we can reasonably expect of him is that he should be a little in advance of his
				predecessors, not that he should vie with modern accuracy, or equally with a modern
				historian be alive to the value of topography, or realize the fulness and minuteness of
				detail which are required in a describer of places or of military movements.</p>

					<seg>THUCYDIDES, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war in which the Peloponnesians and

						that still greater fortune attended his descendants after the death of Eurystheus, king
						of Mycenae, who was slain in Attica by the Heraclidae. For Atreus the son of Pelops was
						the maternal uncle of Eurystheus, who, when he went on the expedition, naturally
						committed to his charge the kingdom of Mycenae. Now Atreus had been banished by his
						father on account of the murder of Chrysippus. But Eurystheus never returned; and the
						Mycenaeans, dreading the Heraclidae, were ready to welcome Atreus, who was considered a

						prevailed over that of Perseus.</seg>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					<seg>And it was, as I believe, because Agamemnon inherited this power and also because he

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<seg>Of the chiefs who came to Troy, he, if the witness of Homer be accepted, brought the

				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					<seg>When it is said that Mycenae was but a small place, or that any other city which

					<seg>Suppose the city<pb n="8"/> of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples

					<seg>And yet they own two-fifths of the Peloponnesus, and are acknowledged leaders of the

					<seg>But their city is not built continuously, and has no splendid temples or other
						edifices; it rather resembles a group of villages like the ancient towns of Hellas, and
						would therefore make a poor show.</seg>
					<seg>Whereas, if the same fate befell the Athenians, the ruins of Athens would strike the
						eye, and we should infer their power to have been twice as great as it really is.</seg>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					<seg>We ought not then to be unduly sceptical. The greatness of cities should be estimated by their real power and not by appearances.
						And we may fairly suppose the Trojan expedition<note type="margin" anchored="yes">
							<hi>Homer's account of the number of the forces.</hi>
						</note> to have been greater than any which preceded it, although according to Homer, if
						we may once more appeal to his testimony, not equal to those of our own day. He was a
						poet, and may therefore be expected to exaggerate;</seg>
					<seg>yet, even upon his showing, the
						expedition was comparatively small.</seg>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<seg>For it numbered, as he tells us, twelve hundred ships, those of the Boeotians<note

					<seg>else why in the catalogue is nothing said about the size of any others?</seg>
					<seg>That the crews were all fighting men as well as rowers he clearly implies when speaking

					<seg>for he tells us that all the oarsmen were likewise archers.</seg>
					<seg>And it is not to be supposed that many who were not sailors would accompany the

						built after the old piratical fashion.</seg>

					<seg>The cause of the inferiority was not so much the want of men as the want of money;</seg>
					<seg>the invading army was limited, by the difficulty<note type="margin" anchored="yes">
						<hi>Considerations respecting the Trojan War.</hi>
					</note> of obtaining supplies, to such a number as might be expected to live on the
						country in which they were to fight. After their arrival at Troy, when they had won a
						battle</seg>
					<seg>(as they clearly did, for otherwise they could not have fortified their camp),</seg>
					<seg>even then they appear not to have used the whole of their force, but to have been
						driven by want of provisions to the cultivation of the Chersonese and to pillage.</seg>
					<seg>And in consequence of this dispersion of their forces, the Trojans were enabled to hold
						out against them during the whole ten years, being always a match for those who remained
						on the spot.</seg>
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					<seg>Whereas if the besieging army had brought abundant supplies, and, instead of betaking
						themselves to agriculture or pillage, had carried on the war persistently with all their
						forces, they would easily have been masters of the field and have taken the city; since,
						even divided as they were, and with only a part of their army available at any one time,
						they held their ground.</seg>
					<seg>Or, again, they might have regularly invested Troy, and the place would have been
						captured in less time and with less trouble.</seg>
					<seg>Poverty was the real reason why the achievements of former ages were insignificant, and
						why the Trojan War, the most celebrated of them all, when brought to the test of facts,
						falls short of its fame and of the prevailing traditions to which the poets have given

					<seg>For example, most<pb n="15"/> Athenians think that Hipparchus was actually tyrant

					<seg>they are not aware that Hippias was the eldest of the sons of Peisistratus, and

						</note>. At the last moment, Harmodius and Aristogeiton suddenly suspected that Hippias
						had been forewarned by some of their accomplices. They therefore abstained from
						attacking him, but, wishing to do something before they were seized, and not to risk
						their lives in vain, they slew Hipparchus, with whom they fell in near the temple called
						Leocorium as he was marshalling the Panathenaic procession.</seg>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					<seg>There are many other matters, not obscured by time, but contemporary, about which the

					<seg>The place was colonised by the Corcyraeans,</seg>

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					<seg>At last, shortly before the Peloponnesian War, the notables were overthrown and driven

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					<seg>These, finding themselves hard pressed, sent<note type="margin" anchored="yes">

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="25"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					<seg>The Epidamnians, finding that they had no hope of assistance from Corcyra, knew not

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					<seg>So the Epidamnians went to Corinth, and informing the Corinthians of the answer which

					<seg>and implored the Corinthians to come and help them, and not leave them to their fate.</seg>
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					<seg>The Corinthians took up their cause, partly in vindication of their own rights (for

						partly too because they hated the Corcyraeans, who were their own colony but slighted
						them.</seg>
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					<seg>In their common festivals they would not allow them the customary privileges of

						to a representative of the mother-country.</seg>
					<seg>In fact they despised the Corinthians,<pb n="19"/> for they were more than a match for

					<seg>They would often boast that on the sea they were very far superior to them, and would
						appropriate to themselves the naval renown of the Phaeacians, who were the ancient

					<seg>Such feelings led them more and more to strengthen their navy, which was by no means

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					<seg>When the Corinthians had chased the Corcyraeans to the shore, they turned their

					<seg>The Corinthians, putting out into deep water, drew up their ships in line and so

						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
						
						<seg>We tell you that we, first and alone, dared to engage with the Barbarian at Marathon,

						<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>

						<seg>The event proved undeniably that the fate of Hellas depended on her navy. And the three chief elements of success were contributed by us; namely, the greatest

						<seg>The ships in all numbered four hundred<note anchored="yes">A Reading with the great
							majority of MSS. <foreign lang="greek">tetrakosi/as.</foreign>
						</note>, and of these, our own contingent amounted to nearly two-thirds. To the influence of Themistocles our general it was chiefly due that we fought in the
							strait, which was confessedly our salvation; and for this service you yourselves
							honoured him above any stranger who ever visited you.</seg>
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
						
						<seg>Thirdly, we displayed the most extraordinary courage and devotion; there was no one to help us by land; for up to our frontier those who lay in the
							enemy's path were already slaves; so we determined to leave our city and sacrifice our
							homes. Even in that extremity we did not choose to desert the cause of the allies who still
							resisted, or by dispersing ourselves to become useless to them; but we embarked and
							fought, taking no offence at your failure to assist us sooner.</seg>
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
						
						<seg>We maintain then that we rendered you a service at least as great as you rendered us.</seg>
						<seg>The cities from which you came to help us were still inhabited and you might hope to
							return to them; your concern was for yourselves and not for us;</seg>
						<seg>at any rate you remained
							at a distance while we had anything to lose.</seg>
						<seg>But we went forth from a city which was no more, and fought for one of which there was
							small hope; and yet we saved ourselves, and bore our part in saving you.</seg>
						
						<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
						
						<seg>If, in order to preserve our land, like other states, we had gone over to the Persians
							at first, or afterwards had not ventured<pb n="52"/> to embark because our ruin was

					<seg>When the Persians, defeated by the Hellenes on sea and land,<note type="margin"
						anchored="yes">
						<hi>The Athenians after the retreat of the Persians continue the war.</hi>
					</note> had retreated from Europe, and the remnant of the fleet, which had taken refuge
						at Mycale, had there perished, Leotychides, the Lacedaemonian king, who had commanded
						the Hellenes in the battle, returned home with the allies from Peloponnesus. But the Athenians and their allies from Ionia and the Hellespont, who had now revolted
						from the king, persevered and besieged Sestos, at that time still in the hands of the
						Persians. Remaining there through the winter they took the place, which the Barbarians deserted.</seg>
					<seg>The allies then sailed back from the Hellespont to their respective homes.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>Meanwhile the Athenian people, now quit of the Barbarians, fetched their wives, their
						children, and the remains of their property from the places in which they had been
						deposited, and set to work, rebuilding the city and the walls.</seg>
					<seg>Of the old line of wall but<pb n="61"/> a small part was left standing. Most of the houses were in ruins</seg>
					<seg>a few only remaining in which the chief men of the
						Persians had lodged. </seg>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="90"/>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					
					<seg>The Lacedaemonians knew what would happen and sent an embassy to Athens. They would<note type="margin" anchored="yes">
						<hi>The Lacedaemonians at the instigation other allies try to prevent the Athenians
							from rebuilding their walls.</hi>
					</note> rather themselves have seen neither the Athenians nor any one else protected by
						a wall; but their main motive was the importunity of their allies, who dreaded not only
						the Athenian navy, which had until lately been quite small, but also the spirit which
						had animated them in the Persian War.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>So the Lacedaemonians requested them not to restore their walls<note anchored="yes">Cp.
						<bibl n="Thuc. 1.69">1.69 init.</bibl>
					</note>, but on the contrary to join with them in razing the fortifications of other
						towns outside the Peloponnesus which had them standing. They did not reveal their real wishes or the suspicion which they entertained of the
						Athenians, but argued that the Barbarian, if he again attacked them, would then have no
						strong place<note type="margin" anchored="yes">B.C. 479&ndash;478</note> which he
						could make his head-quarters as he had lately made Thebes.</seg>
					<seg>Peloponnesus would be a sufficient retreat for all Hellas and a good base of
						operations.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>To this the Athenians, by the advice of Themistocles, replied, that they
						would send an embassy of their own to discuss the matter, and so got rid of the Spartan
						envoys.</seg>
					<seg>He then proposed that he should himself start at once for Sparta, and that they should
						give him colleagues who were not to go immediately, but were to wait until the wall
						reached the lowest height which could possibly be defended.</seg>
					<seg>The whole people, who were in the city, men, women, and children, should join in the
						work, and they must spare no building, private or public, which could be of use, but
						demolish them all.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>Having given these instructions and intimated that he would manage affairs at Sparta,
						he departed.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>On his arrival he did not at once present himself officially to the magistrates, but
						delayed and made<pb n="62"/> excuses;</seg>
					<seg>and when any of them asked him <q>why he did not
						appear before the assembly,</q> he said <q>that he was waiting for his colleagues, who had

					<seg>The friendship of the Lacedaemonian magistrates for Themistocles induced them to

							<hi>The Lacedaemonians are out witted by Themistocles.</hi>
						</note> him; but when everybody who came from Athens declared positively that the wall
						was building and had already reached a considerable height, they knew not what to think.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>He, aware of their suspicions, desired them not to be misled by reports, but to send to
						Athens men whom they could trust out of their own number who would see for themselves
						and bring back word.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>They agreed; and he at the same time privately instructed the Athenians to detain the
						envoys as quietly as they could, and not let them go until he and his colleagues had got
						safely home.</seg>
					<seg>For by this time Habronichus the son of Lysicles, and Aristides the son of Lysimachus,
						who were joined with him in the embassy, had arrived, bringing the news that the wall
						was of sufficient height;</seg>
					<seg>and he was afraid that the Lacedaemonians, when they heard the truth, might not allow
						them to return.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>So the Athenians detained the envoys,</seg>
					<seg>and Themistocles, coming before the
						Lacedaemonians, at length declared in so many words that Athens was now provided with
						walls and could protect her citizens; henceforward, if the Lacedaemonians or their
						allies wished at any time to negotiate, they must deal with the Athenians as with men
						who knew quite well what was for their own and the common good.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>When they boldly resolved to leave their city and go on board ship, they did not first
						ask the advice of the Lacedaemonians, and, when the two states met in council, their own
						judgment had been as good as that of any one.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					
					<seg>And now they had arrived at an independent opinion that it was better far, and would be
						more advantageous both for themselves and for the whole body of the allies, that their

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					
					<seg>when any member of a confederacy had not equal military advantages, his counsel could

					<seg>Either all the allies should pull down their walls, or they should acknowledge that the
						Athenians were in the right. </seg>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="92"/>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					
					<seg>On hearing these words the Lacedaemonians did not openly quarrel with the Athenians;
						for<note type="margin" anchored="yes">
							<hi>But appearances are maintained, and there is no open quarrel.</hi>
						</note></seg>
					<seg>they professed that the embassy had been designed, not to interfere with them,

					<seg>besides at that time the patriotism which
						the Athenians had displayed in the Persian War had created a warm feeling of

					<seg>They were annoyed at the failure of their purpose, but they did not show it.</seg>
					<seg>And the envoys on either side returned home without any formal complaint. </seg>
				</p>
				<p>

					<seg>In such hurried fashion did the Athenians build the walls of their city.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>To this day the structure shows evidence of haste.</seg>
					<seg>The foundations are made up of all sorts of stones, in some places unwrought, and laid
						just as each worker brought them; there were many columns too, taken from sepulchres,
						and many old stones already cut, inserted in the work.</seg>
					<seg>The circuit of the city was extended in<note type="margin" anchored="yes">B.C.

				</p>
				<p>

					<seg>The<note type="margin" anchored="yes">

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>For he first dared to say that <q>they must make the sea their domain,</q></seg>
					<seg>and he lost no

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>By his advice, they built the wall of such a width that <seg>two waggons carrying the stones
						could meet and pass on the top;</seg> this width may still be traced at the<pb n="64"/>
						Piraeus;</seg>
					<seg>inside there was no rubble or mortar, but the whole wall was made up of large
						stones hewn square, which were clamped on the outer face with iron and lead.</seg>
					<seg>The height was not more than half what he had originally intended;</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					
					<seg>he had hoped by the very dimensions of the wall to paralyse the designs of an enemy,</seg>
					<seg>and he thought that a handful of the least efficient citizens would suffice for its
						defence, while the rest might man the fleet.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					
					<seg>His mind was turned in this direction, as I conceive, from observing that the King's
						armament had met with fewer obstacles by sea than by land.</seg>
					<seg>The Piraeus appeared to him to be of more real consequence than the upper city.</seg>
					<seg>He was fond of telling the Athenians that if ever they were hard pressed on land they
						should go down to the Piraeus and fight the world at sea.</seg>

						appeared to exercise his command more after the fashion of a tyrant than of a general.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>His recall occurred at the very time when the hatred which he inspired had induced the

					<seg>Fifty years elapsed between the retreat of Xerxes and the beginning of the war; during

					<seg>The Athenians acquired a firmer hold over their empire</seg>
					<seg>and the city itself became a

					<seg>The Lacedaemonians saw what was going on,</seg>
					<seg>but during most of the time they remained
						inactive and hardly attempted to interfere. They had never been of a temper prompt to take the field unless they were compelled;
						and they were in some degree embarrassed by wars near home. But the Athenians were growing too great to be ignored and were laying hands on their
						allies.</seg>
					<seg>They could now bear it no longer: they made up their minds that they must put out all
						their strength and overthrow the Athenian power by force of arms. And therefore they commenced the Peloponnesian War.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>They had already voted in their own assembly that the treaty had been broken and that

				</p>
				<sp who="corinthians"><p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="120"/>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					
					<seg>Fellow allies, we can no longer find fault with the Lacedaemonians; they have
						themselves<note type="margin" anchored="yes">
							<hi>No more fault to be found with the Lacedaemonians. The Athenians are dangerous

					<seg>And they have done well; for the leaders of a confederacy, while they do not neglect
						the interests of their own state, should look to the general weal: as they are first in
						honour, they should be first in the fulfilment of their duties.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>Now those among us who have ever had dealings with the Athenians, do not require to be
						warned against them;</seg>
					<seg>but such as live inland and not on any maritime highway should
						clearly understand that, if they do not protect the sea-board, they will find it more
						difficult to carry their produce to the sea, or to receive in return the goods which the
						sea gives to the land. They should not lend a careless ear to our words, for they nearly concern them; they
						should remember that, if they desert the cities on the sea-shore, the danger may some
						day reach them, and that they are consulting for their own interests quite as much as
						for ours.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>And therefore let no one hesitate to accept war in exchange for peace.</seg>
					<seg>Wise men refuse to move until they are wronged, but brave men as soon as they are
						wronged go to war, and when there is a good opportunity make peace again. They are not intoxicated by military success; but neither will they tolerate injustice
						from a love of peace and ease.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>For he whom pleasure makes a coward will quickly lose, if he continues inactive, the

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>Many schemes which were ill-advised have succeeded through the still greater folly

					<seg>The execution of an enterprise is never equal<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign

						servant of Pausanias, turned informer. He had been commissioned by him to carry to Artabazus the last letters for the King,
						but the thought struck him that no previous messenger had ever returned; he took alarm,
						and so, having counterfeited the seal of Pausanias in order to avoid discovery if he
						were mistaken, or if Pausanias, wanting to make some alteration, should ask him for the

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>

					<seg>They determined to make the attempt, for the commons at Plataea were strongly attached

					<seg>They began to collect inside the houses, breaking through the party-walls that they

				</p>

					<seg>'Men of Peloponnesus, and you, allies, many are the expeditions which our fathers

							<hi>We have had great experience in war, and our army was never finer. But we must

						</note> both within and without the Peloponnese, and the veterans among ourselves are

					<seg>But then we should remember that, whatever may be our numbers or our valour, we are

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>And we are bound to show ourselves worthy of our fathers, and not wanting to our own

					<seg>For all Hellas is stirred by our enterprise, and her eyes are fixed upon us: she is
						friendly and would have us succeed because she hates the Athenians.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>Now although some among you, surveying this great host, may think that there is very
						little risk of the enemy meeting us in the field, we ought not on that account to

						expecting that his own division of the army will be the one first in danger.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>War is carried on in the dark; attacks are generally sudden and furious, and often the

						which, disdaining their opponent, were taken unprepared by him.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>When invading an enemy's country, men should always be confident in spirit, but they

					<seg>Remembering how great this city is which you are attacking, and what a fame you will

					<seg>So Melesippus was sent away without a hearing and told that he must cross the frontier

						divided into communes, having their own town halls and magistrates.</seg>
					<seg>Except in case of alarm the whole people did not assemble in council under the king,

					<seg>Some of them at times even<pb n="114"/> went to war with him, as the Eleusinians under

						and separate governments, and united all the inhabitants of Attica in the present city,
						establishing one council and town hall.</seg>
					<seg>They continued to live on their own lands, but he compelled them to resort to Athens as
						their metropolis, and henceforward they<note anchored="yes">Or, 'all paid taxes to
							Athens.'</note> were all inscribed in the roll of her citizens,.</seg>
					<seg>A great city thus arose which was handed down by Theseus to his descendants, and from
						his day to this the Athenians have regularly celebrated the national festival of the

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>Many reasons may be urged in proof of this statement:&mdash;The temples of

						those which are not lie chiefly thereabouts; the temples of Olympian Zeus, for example,
						and of the Pythian Apollo, and the temple of Earth and of Dionysus in the Marshes, in

						Anthesterion<note anchored="yes">February-March.</note>, a festival which also
						continues to be observed by the Ionian descendants of the Athenians.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>In the same quarter are other ancient temples, and not far off is the fountain now
						called Enneacrounos, or the Nine Conduits, from the form given to it by the tyrants, but
						originally, before the springs were covered in, Callirrhoe, or the Fair Stream.</seg>
					<seg>The water of this fountain was used by the ancient Athenians on great occasions, it

					<seg>Thus for a long time the ancient Athenians enjoyed a country life in self-governing

						descendants, down to the time of this war, from old habit generally resided with their
						households in the country where they had been born.</seg>
					<seg>For this reason, and also because they had recently restored their country-houses and
						estates after the Persian War, they had a disinclination to move.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>They were depressed at the thought of forsaking their homes and the temples which had

					<seg>But I should have preferred that, when men's deeds have been brave, they should be

					<seg>The friend of the dead who knows the facts is likely to think that the words of the

					<seg>'Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the institutions of others.

					<seg>It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of
						the many and not of the few.</seg>
					<seg>But while the law secures equal justice to all alike in their private disputes,</seg>
					<seg>the claim of excellence is also recognized; and when a<pb n="128"/> citizen is in any
						way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, not as a matter of privilege,
						but as the reward of merit.</seg>
					<seg>Neither is poverty a bar, but a man may benefit his country whatever be the obscurity
						of his condition.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>There is no exclusiveness in our public life,</seg>
					<seg>and in our private intercourse we are not suspicious of one another, nor angry with our
						neighbour if he does what he likes; we do not put on sour looks at him which, though
						harmless, are not pleasant.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>While we are thus unconstrained in our private intercourse, a spirit of reverence
						pervades our public acts; we are prevented from doing wrong by respect for the
						authorities and for the laws, having an especial regard to those which are ordained for
						the protection of the injured as well as to those unwritten laws which bring upon the
						transgressor of them the reprobation of the general sentiment. </seg>

							<hi>In war we singly are a match for the Peloponnesian united; through we have no

						</note>
					</seg>
					<seg>Our city is thrown open to the world, and we never expel a foreigner or prevent him
						from seeing or learning anything of which the secret if revealed to an enemy might
						profit him. We rely not upon management or trickery, but upon our own hearts and hands.</seg>
					<seg>And in the matter of education, whereas they from early youth are always undergoing

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>And here is the proof.</seg>
					<seg>The Lacedaemonians come into Attica not by themselves, but with their whole confederacy
						following; we go alone into a neighbour's country; and although our opponents are
						fighting for their homes and we on a foreign soil, we have seldom any difficulty in
						overcoming them.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>Our enemies have never yet felt our united strength; the care of a navy divides our
						attention, and on land we are obliged to send our own citizens everywhere.</seg>

						routed us all, and when defeated they pretend to have been vanquished by us all.</seg>

						</note> a courage which is gained by habit and not enforced by law, are we not greatly

					<seg>To avow poverty with us is no disgrace; the true disgrace is in doing nothing to avoid

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>An Athenian citizen does not neglect the state because he takes care of his own

						politics.</seg>
					<seg>We alone regard a man who takes no interest in public affairs, not as a harmless, but
						as a useless character; and if few of us are originators, we are all sound judges of a
						policy. The great impediment to action<pb n="130"/> is, in our opinion, not discussion,
						but the want of that knowledge which is gained by discussion preparatory to action.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>For we have a peculiar power of thinking before we act and of acting too,</seg>
					<seg>whereas other men are courageous from ignorance but hesitate upon reflection.</seg>
					<seg>And they are surely to be esteemed the bravest spirits who, having the clearest sense
						both of the pains and pleasures of life, do not on that account shrink from danger.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>In doing good, again, we are unlike others; we make our friends by conferring, not by
						receiving favours.</seg>
					<seg>Now he who confers a favour is the firmer friend, because he would fain by kindness
						keep alive the memory of an obligation; but the recipient is colder in his feelings,
						because he knows that in requiting another's generosity he will not be winning gratitude
						but only paying a debt.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>

					<seg>To sum up: I say that Athens is the school of Hellas,<note type="margin" anchored="yes">

						adapting himself to the most varied forms of action with the utmost versatility and

					<seg>This is no passing and idle word, but truth and fact; and the assertion is verified by

					<seg>For in the hour of trial Athens alone among her contemporaries is superior to the

						of him.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>And we shall assuredly not be without witnesses; there are mighty monuments of our

					<seg>or if they ventured they perished, especially those who aspired to heroism.</seg>

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					
					<seg>But whatever instances there may have been of such devotion, more often the sick and

					<seg>For no one was ever attacked a second time, or not with a fatal result.</seg>

					<seg>Yet in private they felt their sufferings keenly; the common people had been deprived

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>Their private sorrows were Beginning to be less acutely felt, and for a time of public

					<seg>under his guidance Athens was safe, and reached the height of her greatness in his

					<seg>When the war began he showed that here too he had formed a true estimate of the

					<seg>He survived the commencement of hostilities two years and six months;</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					
					<seg>and, after his death, his foresight was even better appreciated than during his life.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					
					<seg>For he had told the Athenians that if they would be patient and would attend to their
						navy, and not seek to enlarge their dominion while the war was going on, nor imperil the
						existence of the city, they would be victorious; but they did all that he told them not
						to do, and in matters which seemingly had nothing to do with the war, from motives of

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					
					<seg>The reason of the difference was that he, deriving authority from his capacity and
						acknowledged worth, being also a man of transparent integrity, was able to control the
						multitude in a free spirit; he led them rather than was led by them; for, not seeking
						power by dishonest arts, he had no need to say pleasant things, but, on the strength of
						his own high character, could venture to oppose and even to anger them.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
					
					<seg>When he saw them unseasonably elated and arrogant, his words humbled and awed them;
						and, when they were depressed by groundless fears, he sought to reanimate their

					<seg>Thus Athens, though still in name a democracy, was in fact ruled by her greatest
						citizen.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
					
					<seg>But his successors were more on an equality with one another, and, each one struggling
						to be first himself, they were ready to sacrifice the whole conduct of affairs to the
						whims of the people.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
					
					<seg>Such weakness in a great and imperial city led to many errors, of which the greatest
						was the Sicilian expedition; not that the Athenians miscalculated their enemy's power,
						but they themselves, instead of consulting for the interests of the expedition which
						they had sent out, were occupied in intriguing against one another for the leadership of
						the democracy<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.28">6.28</bibl>.</note>, and not
						only hampered the operations of the army, but became embroiled, for the first time, at

					<seg>Even when Cyrus the son of the King joined<pb n="150"/> in the war and supplied the

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>They then began to raise a mound against it, thinking that with so large an army at
						work this would be the speediest way of taking the place.</seg>
					<seg>So they cut timber from Cithaeron and built on either side of the intended mound a
						frame of logs placed cross-wise in order that the material might not scatter.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>Thither they carried wood, stones, earth, and anything which would fill up the vacant
						space.</seg>
					<seg>They continued raising the mound seventy days and seventy nights without intermission;
						the army was divided into relays, and one party worked while the other slept and ate.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>The Lacedaemonian officers who commanded the contingents of the allies stood over them
						and kept them at work.</seg>
					<seg>The Plataeans, seeing the mound rising, constructed a wooden frame, which they set upon
						the top of their own wall opposite the mound;</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>in this they inserted bricks, which they took from the neighboring houses; the wood
						served to strengthen and bind the structure together as it increased in height; they
						also hung curtains of skins and hides in front; these were designed to protect the
						wood-work and the workers, and shield them against blazing arrows.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					
					<seg>The wooden wall rose high, but the mound rose quickly too.</seg>
					<seg>Then the Plataeans had a new device;&mdash;they made a hole in that part of the

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="76"/>

					<seg>The Peloponnesians discovered what they were doing, and threw into the gap clay packed

						</note> wattles of reed, which could not scatter and like the loose earth be carried

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>Whereupon the Plataeans, baffled in one plan, resorted to another.</seg>
					<seg>Calculating<pb n="158"/> the direction, they dug a mine from the city to the mound and
						again drew the earth inward.</seg>
					<seg>For a long time their assailants did not find them out, and so what the Peloponnesians
						threw on was of little use, since the mound was always being drawn off below and
						settling into the vacant space.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>But in spite of all their efforts, the Plataeans were afraid that their numbers would
						never hold out against so great an army; and they devised yet another expedient.</seg>
					<seg>They left off working at the great building opposite the mound, and beginning at both
						ends, where the city wall returned to its original lower height, they built an inner
						wall projecting inwards in the shape of a crescent, that if the first wall were taken
						the other might still be defensible.</seg>
					<seg>The enemy would be obliged to begin again and carry the mound right up to it, and as
						they advanced inwards would have their trouble all over again, and be exposed to
						missiles on both flanks.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>While the mound was rising the Peloponnesians brought battering engines up to the wall;
						one which was moved forward on the mound itself shook a great part of the raised
						building, to the terror of the Plataeans.</seg>
					<seg>They brought up others too at other points of the wall.</seg>
					<seg>But<note type="margin" anchored="yes">
						<hi>By ingenious devices they disable the battering-rams of the enemy.</hi>
					</note> the Plataeans dropped nooses over the ends of these engines and drew them up;
						they also let down huge beams suspended at each end by long iron chains from two poles
						leaning on the wall and projecting over it.</seg>
					<seg>These beams they drew up at right angles to the advancing battering-ram, and whenever
						at any point it was about to attack them they slackened their hold of the chains and let
						go the beam, which fell with great force and snapped off the head of the ram. </seg>
				</p>

					<milestone unit="chapter" n="77"/>

					<seg>At length the Peloponnesians, finding that their engines were useless, and that the new

						</note> was rising opposite to the mound, and perceiving that they could not without

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>But first of all they<pb n="159"/> resolved to try whether, the wind favouring, the

						expense of a regular siege, and devised all sorts of plans in order to avoid it.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>So they brought faggots and threw them down from the mound along the space between it
						and the wall, which was soon filled up when so many hands were at work; then they threw
						more faggots one upon another into the city as far as they could reach from the top of
						the mound, and casting in lighted brands with brimstone and pitch, set them all on fire.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>A flame arose of which the like had never before been made by the hand of man; I am not

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>There was a great conflagration, and the Plataeans, who had thus far escaped, were all

					<seg>At length Cnemus, Brasidas, and the other Peloponnesian generals determined to bring on

					<seg>So they assembled their soldiers and, seeing that they were generally dispirited at

				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone unit="chapter" n="87"/>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
					
					<seg>'The late sea-fight, Peloponnesians, may have made some of you anxious about the

							<hi>You a, terrified by our late mishap. But you were then unprepared. Your superior
								courage outweighs their superior skill, for without courage sill is useless. We

						</note> which is impending, but it really affords no just ground for alarm.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>In that battle we were, as you know, ill-prepared, and our whole expedition had a
						military and not a naval object.</seg>
					<seg>Fortune was in many ways unpropitious to us, and this being our first sea-fight we may
						possibly have suffered a little from inexperience.</seg>
					<seg>The defeat which ensued was not the result of cowardice;</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>nor should the unconquerable quality which is inherent in our minds, and refuses to
						acknowledge the victory of mere force, be depressed by the accident of the event.</seg>
					<seg>For though fortune may sometimes bring disaster, yet the spirit of a brave man is
						always the same, and while he retains his courage he will never allow inexperience to be
						an excuse for misbehaviour.</seg>
					<seg>And whatever be your own inexperience, it is more than compensated by your superiority
						in valour.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>The skill of your enemies which you so greatly dread, if united with courage, may be
						able in the moment of danger to remember and execute the lesson which it has learned,
						but without courage no skill can do anything at such a time.</seg>
					<seg>For fear makes men forget, and skill which cannot fight is useless.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>And therefore against their greater skill set your own greater valour, and against the
						defeat which so alarms you set the fact that you were unprepared.</seg>
					<seg>But now you have a larger fleet;</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					
					<seg>this turns the balance in your favour; and you will fight close to a friendly shore
						under the protection of heavy-armed troops.</seg>
					<seg>Victory is generally on the side of those who are more numerous and better equipped.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					
					<seg>So that we have absolutely no reason for anticipating failure.</seg>
					<seg>Even our mistakes will be an additional advantage, because they will be a lesson to us.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					
					<seg>Be of good courage, then, and<pb n="169"/> let every one of you, pilot or sailor, do
						his own duty and maintain the post assigned to him.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
					
					<seg>We will order the attack rather better than your old commanders, and so give nobody an
						excuse for cowardice.</seg>
					<seg>But, if any one should be inclined to waver, he shall be punished as he deserves, while
						the brave shall be honoured with the due rewards of their valour.' </seg>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>He had always been in the habit of telling them and training their minds to believe

					<seg>if they were not compelled they would never have ventured after so great a defeat to

					<seg>So that you need not fear their valour; they are far more afraid of you and with better

					<seg>When the Peloponnesians saw the fleet coming they sailed quickly back to Nisaea, but

					<seg>The Lacedaemonians heard their appeal, and, being desirous of assisting both the

					<seg>The leaders of the colony were three Lacedaemonians, Leon, Alcidas, and Damagon.</seg>

					<seg>The reasons were these:&mdash;In the first place the Thessalians are strong in<pb

						war against the young colony until they completely wore the settlers out, although

					<seg>For every one joined without hesitation, encouraged by the promise of security which a

					<seg>But another great cause of the ruin and depopulation of the place was the conduct of

					<seg>Demosthenes led his own right wing, on which were the Messenians and a few Athenians,

					<seg>The Peloponnesians and Ambraciots were intermingled, with the exception of the

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>The right wing of the enemy, however, and the Ambraciots, who are the most warlike

					<seg>They would not openly agree to the proposal for a general retreat, but Demosthenes and

					<seg>He wanted partly to isolate the Ambraciots and their foreign mercenary troops, but much

					<seg>There was great dispute and uncertainty as to who was an Ambraciot and who a

					<seg>Of the former they killed about two hundred; the Peloponnesians escaped into the

					<seg>As soon as it was dark, after supper, Demosthenes advanced with the rest of his army,

					<seg>At the first dawn of day he fell upon the Ambraciots, who were still half-asleep, and

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>For Demosthenes had taken care to place the Messenians in the first rank and desired

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
					
					<seg>So they fell upon the Ambraciots and routed them.</seg>
					<seg>Most of them were slain on the spot; the remainder fled over the mountains.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
					
					<seg>But the paths were beset; the Amphilochians were lightly-armed, and in their own

					<seg>And so, not knowing which way to turn, they fell into ravines and into ambuscades which

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
					
					<seg>Every means of escape was tried.</seg>
					<seg>Some even fled to the sea which was not far distant, and seeing the Athenian ships

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
					
					<seg>So the Ambraciots were cut to pieces, and but few out of many returned home to their

					<seg>He came to recover the bodies of the dead who had been slain subsequently to the first

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
					
					<seg>The herald saw the arms of the Ambraciot troops from the city and wondered at the
						number of them; he knew nothing of the<pb n="265"/> later disaster, and he imagined that
						they belonged to his own division of the army.</seg>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>Some one present thought that the herald had come from the army defeated at
						Idomen&egrave;, and asked why he looked so astonished, and how many of their men had
						fallen; he replied, 'about two hundred<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.111"

						</note> '; whereupon the other rejoined, 'These which you see are not the arms of two

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
					
					<seg>The herald replied, 'Then they cannot be the arms of our men.'</seg>
					<seg>The other answered, 'They must be, if you were fighting yesterday at

					<seg>When the herald heard these words, and knew that the army coming from the city had

						went away at once without doing his errand, no longer caring to demand the dead.</seg>

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
					
					<seg>The Acarnanians and Amphilochians now made a treaty of alliance for one hundred years

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A message was sent round the Peloponnesus bidding the allies come without a moment's delay and meet at Pylos; another message summoned the sixty Peloponnesian ships from Corcyra. These were carried over the <pb n="6"/> Leucadian isthmus<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.81">3.81 init.</bibl></note>, and, undiscovered by the Athenian ships, which were by this time at Zacynthus, reached Pylos, where their land forces had already assembled.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>While the Peloponnesian fleet was still on its way, Demosthenes succeeded in despatching unobserved two vessels to let Eurymedon and the Athenian fleet know of his danger, and to bid them come at once.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>While the Athenian ships were hastening to the assistance of Demosthenes in accordance<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians prepare to attack the fort.</hi></note> with his request, the Lacedaemonians prepared to attack the fort both by sea and by land; they thought that there would be little difficulty in taking a work hastily constructed and defended by a handful of men.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But as they expected the speedy arrival of the Athenian fleet they meant to close the entrances to the harbour, and prevent the Athenians from anchoring there should they fail in taking the fort before their arrival.
				</p>
				<p>The island which is called Sphacteria stretches along the land and is quite close to it, making<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The harbour of Pylos is formed by the island Sphacteria, which the Lacedaemonians occupy with four hundred and twenty men.</hi></note> the harbour safe and the entrances narrow;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>there is only a passage for two ships at the one end, which was opposite Pylos and the Athenian fort, while at the other the strait between the island and the mainland<note anchored="yes">It is really very much wider.</note> is wide enough to admit eight or nine. The length of the island is about a mile and threequarters; it was wooded, and being uninhabited had no roads. The Lacedaemonians were intending to block up the mouths of the harbour by ships placed close together with their prows outwards;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>meanwhile, fearing lest the Athenians should use the island for military operations, they conveyed thither some hoplites, and posted others along the shore of the mainland. Thus both the island and the mainland would be hostile to the Athenians;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>and nowhere on the mainland would there <pb n="7"/> be a possibility of landing. For on the shore of Pylos itself, outside the entrance of the strait, and where the land faced the open sea, there were no harbours, and the Athenians would find no position from which they could assist their countrymen. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians, avoiding the risk of an engagement at sea, might take the fort, which had been occupied in a hurry and was not provisioned.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Acting on this impression they conveyed their hoplites over to the island, selecting them by lot out of each division of the army. One detachment relieved another; those who went over last and were taken in the island were four hundred and twenty men, besides the Helots who attended them; they were under the command of Epitadas the son of Molobrus.

					<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Demosthenes, seeing that the Lacedaemonians were about to attack him both by sea and by<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Skilful use made by Demosthenes of the small means at his disposal</hi></note> land, made his own preparations. He drew up on shore under the fort the three triremes remaining<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">ai= perih=san au)tw=|.</foreign></note> to him out of the five which had not gone on to Corcyra, and protected them by a stockade; their crews he armed with shields, but of a poor sort, most of them made of wickerwork. In an uninhabited country there was no possibility of procuring arms, and these were only obtained from a thirty-oared privateer and a light boat belonging to some Messenians who had just arrived. Of these Messenians about forty were hoplites, whom Demosthenes used with the others.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He placed the greater part of his forces, armed and unarmed, upon the side of the place which looks towards the mainland and was stronger and better fortified; these he ordered, if they should be attacked, to repel the land forces, while he himself selected out of the whole body of his troops sixty hoplites and a few archers, and marched out of the fort to the sea-shore at the point where the Lacedaemonians seemed most likely to attempt a landing. The spot which he chose lay towards the <pb n="8"/> open sea, and was rocky and dangerous; but he thought that the enemy would be attracted thither and would be sure to make a dash at that point because the fortifications were weaker.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Athenians, not expecting to be defeated at sea, had left the wall just there less strong, while if the enemy could once force a landing, the place would easily be taken.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Accordingly, marching down to the very edge of the sea, he there posted his hoplites; he was determined to keep the enemy off if he could, and in this spirit he addressed his men:&mdash;

In cases like these, when there is no choice, reflection is useless, and the sooner danger comes the better.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I am sure that our chances are more than equal if we will only stand firm, and, having so many advantages, do not take fright at the numbers of the enemy and throw them all away. The inaccessibility of the place is one of them;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>this, however, will only aid us if we maintain our position; when we have once retreated, the ground, though difficult in itself, will be easy enough to the enemy, for there will be no one to oppose him. And if we turn and press upon him he will be more obstinate than ever; for his retreat will be next to impossible. On ship-board the Peloponnesians are easily repelled, but once landed they are as good as we are. Of their numbers again we need not be so much afraid;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for, numerous as they are, few only can fight at a time, owing to the difficulty of bringing their ships to shore. We are contending against an army superior indeed in numbers, but they are not our equals in other respects; <pb n="9"/> for they are not on land but on water, and ships require many favourable accidents before they can act with advantage. So that I consider their embarrassments to counterbalance our want of numbers.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>You are Athenians, who know by experience the difficulty of disembarking in the presence of an enemy, and that if a man is not frightened out of his wits at the splashing of oars and the threatening look of a ship bearing down upon him, but is determined to hold his ground, no force can move him. It is now your turn to be attacked, and I call on you to stand fast and not to let the enemy touch the beach at all. Thus you will save yourselves and the place.'

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians, inspirited by the words of Demosthenes, went down to the shore and formed<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Difficulty of effect a landing. Brasidas greatly distinguishes himself</hi></note> a line along the water's edge.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians now began to move, and assaulted the fort with their army by land, and with their fleet, consisting of forty-three ships, by sea. The admiral in command was Thrasymelidas, son of Cratesicles, a Spartan; he made his attack just where Demosthenes expected.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians defended themselves both by sea and land. The Peloponnesians had divided their fleet into relays of a few ships&mdash;the space would not allow of more&mdash;and so resting and fighting by turns they made their attack with great spirit, loudly exhorting one another to force back the enemy and take the fort. Brasidas distinguished himself above all other men in the engagement;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>he was captain of a ship, and seeing his fellow-captains and the pilots, even if they could touch anywhere, hesitating and afraid of running their ships on the rocks, he called out to them: ' Not to be sparing of timber when the enemy had built a fort in their country; let them wreck their ships to force a landing': this he said to his own countrymen, and to the allies that 'they should not hesitate at such a moment to make a present of their ships to the Lacedaemonians, who had done so much for <pb n="10"/> them; they must run aground, and somehow or other get to land and take the fort and the men in it.'

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Peloponnesians in the other ships made great efforts to disembark, but were unable on account of the roughness of the ground and the tenacity with which the Athenians held their position.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It was a singular turn of fortune which drove the Athenians to repel the Lacedaemonians, who were attacking them by sea, from the Lacedaemonian coast, and the Lacedaemonians to fight for a landing on their own soil, now hostile to them, in the face of the Athenians. For in those days it was the great glory of the Lacedaemonians to be a land power distinguished for their military prowess, and of the Athenians to be a nation of sailors and the first sea power in Hellas.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Meanwhile the Athenian ships arrived from Zacynthus; they had been increased in number to fifty by the arrival of some guardships from Naupactus and of four Chian vessels.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Their commanders saw that both the mainland and the island were full of hoplites, and that the ships were in the harbour <pb n="11"/> and were not coming out: so, not knowing where to find anchorage, they sailed away for the present to the island of Prot&egrave;, which is close at hand and uninhabited, and there passed the night. Next day, having made ready for action, they put off to sea, intending, if, as they hoped, the Peloponnesians were willing to come out against them, to give battle in the open;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>if not, to sail into the harbour. The Peloponnesians did not come out, and had somehow neglected to close the mouths as they had intended.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>If they conquered at sea they hoped to blockade Rhegium both by sea and land; they would <pb n="19"/> easily master the place, and their affairs would then be really gaining strength. Rhegium, the extreme point of Italy, and Messen&egrave;, of Sicily, are close to one another; and if Rhegium were taken the Athenians would not be able to lie there and command the strait.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now the strait is that portion of sea between Rhegium and Messen&egrave; where Sicily is nearest to the continent; it is the so-called Charybdis by which Odysseus is said to have passed. The channel was naturally considered dangerous; for the strait is narrow, and the sea flowing into it from two great oceans, the Tyrrhenian and Sicilian, is full of currents.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In this strait the Syracusans and their allies, who had somewhat more than thirty ships, were<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Partial defeat of the Syracusan fleet by the Athenians and Rhegians in the straits of Messen&egrave;.</hi></note> compelled to fight late in the day for a vessel which was sailing through. They put out against sixteen Athenian and eight Rhegian ships;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>but, being defeated by the Athenians, they made a hasty retreat, each ship as it best could, to their stations at Messen&egrave; and near Rhegium; one ship was lost. Night closed the engagement.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After this the Locrians quitted the Rhegian territory, and the Syracusans and their<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Partial success of the Syracusans, who take two Athenian ships.</hi></note> confederates united their fleet and anchored at the promontory of Pelorus near Messen&egrave;, where their land-forces were also stationed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians and Rhegians, sailing up to them, and seeing that the crews were not there, fell upon the empty vessels, but an iron grapnel was thrown out at them, and they in their turn lost a ship, from which the crew escaped by swimming.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then the Syracusans embarked, and, as they were being towed along the shore towards Messen&egrave;, the Athenians again attacked them. Making a sudden twist outwards they struck the first blow at the Athenians, who lost another ship.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Thus both in the movement along the coast and in the naval engagement which ensued, the Syracusans proved themselves quite a match for the <pb n="20"/> Athenians, and at length made their way into the harbour at Messen&egrave;.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Athenians, hearing that Camarina was to be betrayed to the Syracusans by a certain Archias<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Unsuccessful attempts of the Messenians upon Naxos, and of the Leontines and Athenians upon Messen&egrave;. The Athenians for a time withdraw from the contest.</hi></note> and his confederates, sailed thither. Meanwhile the Messenians, with their whole power by land and with the allied fleet, made war upon Naxos, a Chalcidian city which was their neighbour.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>On the first day they forced the Naxians to retire within their walls and ravaged the country;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>on the morrow they sailed round to the mouth of the river Acesines, again ravaged the country, and with their land-forces made incursions right up to the city. But in the meantime a large body of Sicels came down over the heights to assist the Naxians against the Messenians. Perceiving this the besieged took heart, and shouting to one another that the Leontines and their other Hellenic allies were coming to succour them, they sallied out of the city, charged the Messenians, and put them to flight with a loss of more than a thousand men;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>the rest with difficulty escaped, for the barbarians fell upon them in the roads and destroyed most of them. The allied fleet, putting into Messen&egrave;, broke up and returned home. Whereupon the Leontines and their allies, in concert with the Athenians, marched against the now enfeebled Messen&egrave;. The Athenian fleet attempted an assault of the harbour while the army attacked the city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>But the Messenians and a Locrian garrison under Demoteles, which after their disaster at Naxos had been left to protect the place, suddenly falling upon them put to flight the main body of the Leontines with great loss; whereupon the Athenians disembarked, came to their aid, and, falling on the Messenians while they were still in confusion, chased them back to the city. They then erected a trophy and retired to Rhegium.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>After this the Hellenes in Sicily went on fighting against one another by land; but the Athenians took no part in their operations. <pb n="21"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The watch was harassing to the Athenians, for they were in want both of food and water; there was only one small well, which was in the acropolis, and the soldiers were commonly in the habit of scraping away the shingle on the sea-shore, and drinking such water as they could get. The Athenian garrison was crowded into a narrow space, and, their ships having no regular anchorage, the crews took their meals on land by turns;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>one half of the army eating while the other lay at anchor in the open sea. The unexpected length of the siege was a great discouragement to them;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>they had hoped to starve their enemies out in a few days, for they were on a desert island, and had only brackish water to drink.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The secret of this protracted resistance was a proclamation issued by the Lacedaemonians offering large fixed prices, and freedom if he were a Helot, to any one who would convey into the island meal, wine, cheese or any other provision suitable for a besieged place. Many braved the danger, especially the Helots;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>they started from all points of Peloponnesus, and before daybreak bore down upon the shore of the island looking towards the open sea. They took especial care to have a strong wind in their favour, since they were less likely to be discovered by the triremes when it blew hard from the sea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The blockade was then impracticable, and the crews of the boats were perfectly reckless in running them aground; for a value had been set upon them, and Lacedaemonian hoplites were waiting to receive them about the landing-places of the island. All however who ventured when the sea was calm were captured.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Some too dived and swam by way of the harbour, drawing after them by a cord skins containing pounded linseed and <pb n="22"/> poppy-seeds mixed with honey. At first they were not found out, but afterwards watches were posted.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The two parties had all sorts of devices, the one determined to send in food, the other to detect them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="27" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the Athenians heard that their own army was suffering and that supplies were introduced<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The situation is reported to be critical. Cleon denies the reports. The Athenians want to send commissioners to Pylos. Cleon blames the generals, and proposes to send, not commissioners, but a fleet. He would soon take the men if he were general.</hi></note> into the island, they began to be anxious and were apprehensive that the blockade might extend into the winter. They reflected that the conveyance of necessaries round the Peloponnese would then be impracticable. Their troops were in a desert place, to which, even in summer, they were not able to send a sufficient supply. The coast was without harbours; and therefore it would be impossible to maintain the blockade. Either the watch would be relaxed and the men would escape; or, taking advantage of a storm, they might sail away in the ships which brought them food.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Above all they feared that the Lacedaemonians, who no longer made overtures to them, must now be reassured of the strength of their own position, and they regretted having rejected their advances.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Cleon, knowing that he was an object of general mistrust because he had stood in the way of peace, challenged the reports of the messengers from Pylos; who rejoined that, if their words were not believed, the Athenians should send commissioners of their own. And so Theogenes and Cleon himself were chosen commissioners.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As he knew that he could only confirm the report of the messengers whom he was calumniating, or would be convicted of falsehood if he contradicted them, observing too that the Athenians were now more disposed to take active measures, he advised them not to send commissioners, which would only be a loss of valuable time, but, if they were themselves satisfied with the report, to send a fleet against the island.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Pointedly alluding to Nicias the son of Niceratus, who was one of the generals and an enemy of <pb n="23"/> his, he declared sarcastically that, if the generals were men, they might easily sail with an expedition to the island and take the garrison, and that this was what he would certainly have done, had he been general.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="28" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nicias perceived that the multitude were murmuring at Cleon, and asking 'why<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">o(/ ti.</foreign></note> he did not<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The people murmur at him. Nicias resigns in his favour. He at first holds back, but is afterwards compelled to sail. He then declares that he will return victorious within twenty days.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Cleon at first imagined that the offer of Nicias was only a pretence, and was willing to go; but finding that he was in earnest, he tried to back out, and said that not he but Nicias was general. He was now alarmed, for he never imagined that Nicias would go so far as to give up his place to him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Again Nicias bade him take the command of the expedition against Pylos, which he formally gave up to him in the presence of the assembly. And the more Cleon declined the proffered command and tried to retract what he had said, so much the more the multitude, as their manner is, urged Nicias to resign and shouted to Cleon that he should sail.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At length, not knowing how to escape from his own words, he undertook the expedition, and, coming forward, said that he was not afraid of the Lacedaemonians, and that he would sail without taking a single man from the city if he were allowed to have the Lemnian and Imbrian forces now at Athens, the auxiliaries from Aenus, who were targeteers, and four hundred archers from other places. With these and with the troops already at Pylos he gave his word that within twenty days he would either bring the Lacedaemonians alive or kill them on the spot.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>His vain words moved the Athenians to laughter; nevertheless the wiser <pb n="24"/> sort of men were pleased when they reflected that of two good things they could not fail to obtain one&mdash;either there would be no more trouble with Cleon, which they would have greatly preferred, or, if they were disappointed, he would put the Lacedaemonians into their hands.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When he had concluded the affair in the assembly, and the Athenians had passed the necessary<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>He selects Demosthenes to be his colleague, hearing that he is already meditating an attack upon the island. The design is encouraged by an accidental fire.</hi></note> vote for his expedition, he made choice of Demosthenes, one of the generals at Pylos, to be his colleague, and proceeded to sail with all speed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He selected Demosthenes because he heard that he was already intending to make an attack upon the island; for the soldiers, who were suffering much from the discomfort of the place, in which they were rather besieged than besiegers<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.11">7.11 fin.</bibl></note>, were eager to strike a decisive blow, He had been much encouraged by a fire which had taken place in the island.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It had previously been nearly covered with wood and was pathless, having never been inhabited; and he had feared that the nature of the country would give the enemy an advantage. For, however large the force with which he landed, the Lacedaemonians might attack him from some place of ambush and do him much injury. Their mistakes and the character of their forces would be concealed by the wood; whereas all the errors made by his own army would be palpable, and so the enemy, with whom the power of attack would rest, might come upon them suddenly wherever they liked.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And if they were compelled to go into the wood and there engage, a smaller force which knew the ground would be more than a match for the larger number who were unacquainted with it. Their own army, however numerous, would be destroyed without knowing it, for they would not be able to see where they needed one another's assistance. <pb n="25"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Demosthenes was led to make these reflections from his experience in Aetolia<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.98">3.98</bibl>.</note>, where his defeat<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The burning of the wood discovers the number and position of the enemy.</hi></note> had been in a great measure owing to the forest.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>However, while the Athenian soldiers were taking their midday meal, with a guard posted in advance, at the extremity of the island, compelled as they were by want of room to land on the edge of the shore at meal-times, some one unintentionally set fire to a portion of the wood; a wind came on;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and from this accident, before they knew what was happening, the greater part of it was burnt. Demosthenes, who had previously suspected that the Lacedaemonians when they sent in provisions to the besieged had exaggerated their number, saw that the men were more numerous than he had imagined. He saw too<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">to/ te.</foreign></note> the increased zeal of the Athenians, who were now convinced that the attempt was worth making; and the island seemed to him more accessible.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So he prepared for the descent, despatching messengers to the allies in the neighbourhood for additional forces and putting all in readiness. Cleon sent and announced to Demosthenes his approach, and soon afterwards, bringing with him the army which he had requested, himself arrived at Pylos. On the meeting of the two generals they first of all sent a herald to the Lacedaemonian force on the mainland, proposing that they should avoid any further risk by ordering the men in the island to surrender with their arms; they were to be placed under surveillance but well treated until a general peace was concluded.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Finding that their proposal was rejected, the Athenians waited for a day, and on the night of<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Disposition of the Lacedaemonian forces in three stations, the main body occupying the centre of the island</hi></note> the day following put off, taking with them all their heavy-armed troops, whom they had embarked in a few ships. A little before dawn they landed on both sides of the island, towards the sea and <pb n="26"/> towards the harbour, a force amounting in all to about eight hundred men.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They then ran as fast as they could to the first station on the island. Now the disposition of the enemy was as follows: This first station was garrisoned by about thirty hoplites, while the main body under the command of Epitadas was posted near the spring in the centre of the island, where the ground was most level. A small force guarded<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">au)to\ to\ e)\sxaton,</foreign> or, <foreign lang="greek">au)to\ tou)/sxaton.</foreign></note> the furthest extremity of the island opposite Pylos, which was precipitous towards the sea, and on the land side the strongest point of all, being protected to some extent by an ancient wall made of rough stones, which the Spartans thought would be of use to them if they were overpowered and compelled to retreat. Such was the disposition of the Lacedaemonian troops.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians rushed upon the first garrison and cut them down, half asleep as they were<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenian hoplites land. The first of the three garrisons is cut down. The rest of the Athenian forces which land later are distributed in small parties and occupy the higher points of the island.</hi></note> and just snatching up their arms. Their landing had been unobserved, the enemy supposing that the ships were only gone to keep the customary watch for the night. When the dawn appeared, the rest of the army began to disembark.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They were the crews of rather more than seventy ships, including all but the lowest rank of rowers, variously equipped. There were also archers to the number of eight hundred, and as many targeteers, besides the Messenian auxiliaries and all who were on duty about Pylos, except the guards who could not be spared from the walls of the fortress.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Demosthenes divided them into parties of two hundred more or less, who seized the highest points of the island in order that the enemy, being completely surrounded and distracted by the number of their opponents, might not know whom they should face first, but might be exposed to missiles on every side. For if they attacked those who were in front, they <pb n="27"/> would be assailed by those behind; and if those on one flank, by those posted on the other;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and whichever way they moved, the light-armed troops of the enemy were sure to be in their rear. These were their most embarrassing opponents, because they were armed with bows and javelins and slings and stones, which could be used with effect at a distance. Even to approach them was impossible, for they conquered in their very flight, and when an enemy retreated, pressed close at his heels. Such was the plan of the descent which Demosthenes had in his mind, and which he now carried into execution.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The main body of the Lacedaemonians on the island under Epitadas, when they saw the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonian hoplites are unable to cope with the light-armed Athenian troops.</hi></note> first garrison cut to pieces and an army approaching them, drew up in battle array. The Athenian hoplites were right in front, and the Lacedaemonians advanced against them, wanting to come to close quarters; but having lightarmed adversaries both on their flank and rear, they could not get at them or profit by their own military skill, for they were impeded by a shower of missiles from both sides.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Meanwhile the Athenians instead of going to meet them remained in position, while the light-armed again and again ran up and attacked the Lacedaemonians, who drove them back where they pressed closest. But though compelled to retreat they still continued fighting, being lightly equipped and easily getting the start of their enemies. The ground was difficult and rough, the island having been uninhabited; and the Lacedaemonians, who were incumbered by their arms, could not pursue them in such a place.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="34" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For some little time these skirmishes continued. But soon the Lacedaemonians became too<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>They are sorely distressed.</hi></note> weary to rush out upon their assailants, who began to be sensible that their resistance grew feebler. The sight of their own number, which was many times that of the enemy, encouraged them more than anything; they soon found that their losses were trifling <pb n="28"/> compared with what they had expected; and familiarity made them think their opponents much less formidable than when they first landed cowed by the fear of facing Lacedaemonians. They now despised them and with a loud cry rushed upon them in a body, hurling at them stones, arrows, javelins, whichever came first to hand.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The shout with which they accompanied the attack dismayed the Lacedaemonians, who were unaccustomed to this kind of warfare. Clouds of dust arose from the newlyburnt wood, and there was no possibility of a man's seeing what was before him, owing to the showers of arrows and stones hurled by their assailants which were flying amid the dust.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And now the Lacedaemonians began to be sorely distressed, for their felt cuirasses did not protect them against the arrows, and the points of the javelins broke off where they struck them. They were at their wits' end, not being able to see out of their eyes or to hear the word of command, which was drowned by the cries of the enemy. Destruction was staring them in the face, and they had no means or hope of deliverance.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At length, finding that so long as they fought in the same narrow spot more and more of<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>They retreat to the fortification at the extremity of the island, and defend themselves with greater success because they are now less exposed.</hi></note> their men were wounded, they closed their ranks and fell back on the last fortification of the island, which was not far off, and where their other garrison was stationed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Instantly the light-armed troops of the Athenians pressed upon them with fresh confidence, redoubling their cries. Those of the Lacedaemonians who were caught by them on the way were killed, but the greater number escaped to the fort and ranged themselves with the garrison, resolved to defend the heights wherever they were assailable.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians followed, but the strength of the position made it impossible to surround and cut them off, and so they attacked them in face and tried to force them back.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For a long time, and indeed during the greater part of the day, both armies, <pb n="29"/> although suffering from the battle and thirst and the heat of the sun, held their own; the one endeavouring to thrust their opponents from the high ground, the other determined not to give way. But the Lacedaemonians now defended themselves with greater ease, because they were not liable to be taken in flank.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>There was no sign of the end. At length the general of the Messenian contingent came to Cleon<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Messen&iuml;an general finds a way round by the rocks and reappear suddenly their rear.</hi></note> and Demosthenes and told them that the army was throwing away its pains, but if they would give him some archers and light-armed troops and let him find a path by which he might get round in the rear of the Lacedaemonians, he thought that he could force the approach.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Having obtained his request he started from a point out of sight of the enemy, and making his way wherever the broken ground afforded a footing and where the cliff was so steep that no guards had been set, he and his men with great difficulty got round unseen and suddenly appeared on the summit in their rear, striking panic into the astonished enemy and redoubling the courage of his own friends who were watching for his reappearance.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Lacedaemonians were now assailed on both sides, and to compare a smaller thing to a greater, were in the same case with their own countrymen at Thermopylae. For as they perished when the Persians found a way round by the path, so now the besieged garrison were attacked on both sides, and no longer resisted. The disparity of numbers, and the failure of bodily strength arising from want of food, compelled them to fall back, and the Athenians were at length masters of the approaches.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Cleon and Demosthenes saw that if the Lacedaemonians gave way one step more they would be<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Cleon and Demosthenes invite the Lacedaemonians to surrender.</hi></note> destroyed by the Athenians; so they stopped the engagement and held back their own army, for they wanted, if possible, to bring them alive to Athens. They were in <pb n="30"/> hopes that when they heard the offer of terms their courage might be broken, and that they might be induced by their desperate situation to yield up their arms.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Accordingly they proclaimed to them that they might, if they would, surrender at discretion to the Athenians themselves and their arms.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Upon hearing the proclamation most of them lowered their shields and waved their hands in<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians on the mainland give their consent, and the offer is accepted. The prisoners brought to Athens number two hundred and ninety-two, of whom a hundred and twenty are Spartans</hi></note> token of their willingness to yield. A truce was made, and then Cleon and Demosthenes on the part of the Athenians, and Styphon the son of Pharax on the part of the Lacedaemonians, held a parley. Epitadas, who was the first in command, had been already slain; Hippagretas, who was next in succession, lay among the slain for dead;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and Styphon had taken the place of the two others, having been appointed, as the law prescribed, in case anything should happen to them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He and his companions expressed their wish to communicate with the Lacedaemonians on the mainland as to the course which they should pursue. The Athenians allowed none of them to stir, but themselves invited heralds from the shore; and after two or three communications, the herald who came over last from the body of the army brought back word, 'The Lacedaemonians bid you act as you think best, but you are not to dishonour yourselves.'
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Whereupon they consulted together, and then gave up themselves and their arms. During that day and the following night the Athenians kept guard over them; on the next day they set up a trophy on the island and made preparations to sail, distributing the prisoners among the trierarchs. The Lacedaemonians sent a herald and conveyed away their own dead.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The number of the dead and the prisoners was as follows:&mdash;Four hundred and twenty hoplites in all passed over into the island; of these, two hundred and ninety-two were brought to Athens <pb n="31"/> alive, the remainder had perished. Of the survivors the Spartans numbered about a hundred and twenty. But few Athenians fell, for there was no regular engagement.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For about three weeks the Lacedaemonians were supplied with food while the Spartan ambassadors were gone to solicit peace, but during the rest of this time they lived on what was brought in by stealth. A store of corn and other provisions was found in the island at the time of the capture;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for the commander Epitadas had not served out full rations. The Athenians and Peloponnesians now withdrew their armies from Pylos and returned home. And the mad promise of Cleon was fulfilled; for he did bring back the prisoners within twenty days, as he had said.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>No one would believe that those who surrendered were men of the same quality with those who perished. There is a story of a reply made by a captive taken in the island to one of the Athenian allies who had sneeringly asked 'Where were their brave men-all killed?'<note anchored="yes">Literally, 'Were their dead brave?' implying that the living were not.</note> He answered that 'The spindle' (meaning the arrow) 'would be indeed a valuable weapon if it picked out the brave.' He meant to say that the destruction caused by the arrows and stones was indiscriminate.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They placed a garrison in Pylos; and the Messenians of Naupactus, regarding the place as their native land (for Pylos is situated in the territory which was once Messenia), sent thither some of themselves, being such troops as were best suited for the service, who ravaged Laconia and did great harm, because they spoke the same language with the inhabitants.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Lacedaemonians had never before experienced this irregular and predatory warfare; and finding the Helots desert, and dreading some serious domestic calamity, they were in great trouble. Although reluctant to expose their condition before the Athenians, they sent envoys to them and endeavoured to recover Pylos and the prisoners.

They were accompanied by allies from Miletus, Andros, and Carystus. Nicias the son of Niceratus, and two others, were in command.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Very early in the morning they put in between the promontory Chersonesus and the stream Rhetus, to that part of the coast which is overhung by the Solygean ridge; there in ancient times Dorian invaders had taken up their position and fought against their Aeolian enemies in Corinth, and to this day there is a village, called Solygea, on the hill which they occupied. From the beach where the crews landed this village is distant nearly a mile <pb n="33"/> and a-half, the city of Corinth about seven miles, and the isthmus about two miles and a quarter.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Corinthians, having had early intimation from Argos of the intended invasion, came in good time to the isthmus. The whole population, with the exception of those who dwelt to the north of the isthmus and five hundred troops who were employed in protecting Ambracia and Leucadia<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.114">3.114 fin.</bibl></note>, was on the watch to see where the Athenians would land.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But, having sailed in before daylight, they were not discovered; the Corinthians however were soon informed by signals of their landing; and so, leaving half their troops at Cenchreae in case the Athenians should attack Crommyon, they came to the rescue with all speed.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Corinthians first of all assailed the right wing of the Athenians, which had only just landed in front of the Chersonesus, and then engaged with the rest. The conflict was stubborn, and all hand to hand.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians, who were on the right wing, and the Carystians, who were on the extreme right, received the Corinthians, and with some difficulty drove them back. They retired behind a loose stone wall, and the whole place being a steep hill-side, threw the stones down from above; but soon they raised the paean and again came on.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Again the Athenians received them, and another hand-to-hand fight ensued, when a division of the Corinthians coming to the aid of their left wing, forced back the right wing of the Athenians and pursued them to the sea; but the Athenians and Carystians in their turn again drove them back from. <pb n="34"/> the ships.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Meanwhile the rest of the two armies had been fighting steadily. On the right wing of the Corinthians, where Lycophron was opposed to the Athenian left, the defence was most energetic; for he and his troops were apprehensive that the Athenians would move on the village of Solygea.

					<milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For a long time neither would give way, but at length the Athenians, having an<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians gain a partial victory, but, alarmed at the approach of a reinforcement, they retreat to their ships.</hi></note> advantage in cavalry, with which the Corinthians were unprovided, drove them back, and they retired to the summit of the ridge; where they grounded their arms and remained inactive, refusing to come down.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In this defeat of their right wing the Corinthians incurred the heaviest loss, and Lycophron their general was slain. The whole army was now forced back upon the high ground, where they remained in position; they were not pursued far, and made a leisurely retreat.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians seeing that they did not return to the attack, at once erected a trophy and began to spoil the enemies' dead and take up their own.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The other half of the Corinthians who were keeping guard at Cenchreae, lest the Athenians should sail against Crommyon, 'had their view of the battle intercepted by Mount Oneum. But when they saw the dust and knew what was going on, they instantly came to the rescue. The elder men of Corinth hearing of the defeat likewise hastened to the spot.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The united army then advanced against the Athenians, who fancying that a reinforcement had come from the neighbouring states of Peloponnesus, quickly retreated to their ships, taking their spoils and their own dead, with the exception of two whom they could not find;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>they then embarked and sailed to the neighboring islands. Thence they sent a herald asking for a truce, and recovered the two dead bodies which were missing. The Corinthians lost two hundred and twelve men; the Athenians hardly so many as fifty.

They built a wall across the isthmus, and so cut off the peninsula on which Methon&egrave; stands. There they established a garrison, which continued for some time to ravage the country of Troezen, Halieis, and Epidaurus. The fleet, when the fortification was completed, returned home.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now the leaders of the Corcyraean democracy feared that when the captives arrived at Athens they would not be put to death;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>so they devised the following trick:&mdash;They sent to the <pb n="36"/> island friends of the captives, whom with seeming goodwill they instructed to tell them that they had better escape as fast as they could, for the fact was that the Athenian generals were about to hand them over to the Corcyraean democracy; they would themselves provide a vessel.

The<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The captive oligarchs are induced by a trick to break their parole and are delivered up to the vengeance of the Corcyraeans.</hi></note> prisoners were taken sailing out; the truce was at an end, and they were all instantly delivered up to the Corcyraeans.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The feeling which the Athenian generals displayed greatly contributed to the result; for, being compelled to proceed to Sicily themselves, they were well known to wish that no one else should gain the credit of bringing the prisoners to Athens;<note anchored="yes">or, ' and so the pretext turned out to be the exact truth; ' or, and so the pretext seemed to correspond to the facts.'</note> and therefore the agreement was interpreted to the letter,<note anchored="yes">or, ' and so the pretext turned out to be the exact truth; ' or, and so the pretext seemed to correspond to the facts.'</note> and the contrivers of the trick thought that they could execute it with impunity.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Corcyraeans took the prisoners and shut them up in a large building; then, leading them out in bands of twenty at a time, they made them pass between two files of armed men; they were bound to one another and struck and pierced by the men on each side, whenever any one saw among them an enemy of his own; and there were men with whips, who accompanied them to the place of execution and quickened the steps of those who lingered.

But soon they found out what was happening, for some one told them, and then they called upon the Athenians, if they wanted them to die, to take their lives <pb n="37"/> themselves.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Out of the building they refused to stir, and threatened that into it, if they could help, no one should enter. The Corcyraean populace had not the least intention of forcing a way in by the door, but they got upon the roof and, making an opening, threw tiles and shot arrows down from above.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The prisoners sought to shelter themselves as they best could. Most of them at the same time put an end to their own lives; some thrust into their throats arrows which were shot at them, others strangled themselves with cords taken from beds which they found in the place, or with strips which they tore from their own garments.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This went on during the greater part of the night, which had closed upon their sufferings, until in one way or another, either by their own hand or by missiles hurled from above, they all perished. At daybreak the Corcyraeans flung the dead bodies cross-wise on waggons and carried them out of the city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The women who were taken in the fortress on Mount Iston&egrave; were reduced to slavery. Thus the Corcyraeans in the mountain were destroyed by the people, and, at least while the Peloponnesian war lasted, there was an end of the great sedition;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>for there was nothing left of the other party worth mentioning.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same summer the citizens of Megara were hard pressed by the Athenians, who<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The citizens of Megara, thinking it better to have one enemy than two, propose to restore the exiles.

So they conferred together upon the advisability of recalling the exiles, lest they should expose the city to destruction from the attacks of two enemies at once.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The friends of the exiles became aware of the agitation and ventured to urge the measure more openly than hitherto.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the popular leaders, knowing that their partisans were in great extremity and could not be trusted to hold out in support of them much longer, took alarm and entered into negotiation with the Athenian generals, Hippocrates the son of Ariphron, and Demosthenes the son of Alcisthenes. They thought that they would incur less danger by surrendering the city to them than by the restoration of the exiles whom they had themselves expelled. So they agreed that the Athenians should in the first place seize their Long Walls<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.103">1.103 fin.</bibl></note>, which were <pb n="49"/> a little less than a mile in length and extended from the city to their harbour Nisaea. They wanted to prevent the Peloponnesians interfering from Nisaea, of which they formed the sole garrison, being stationed there to secure Megara. The conspirators were then to try and place in the hands of the Athenians the upper city, which would be more ready to come over when they once had possession of the Long Walls.
				</p>

					<milestone n="67" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Both parties had now made all necessary preparations, both in word and act. The Athenians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Disposition of the Athenian troops before Megara. The gates are opened to them by their Megarian confederates, and they mount the Long Walls.</hi></note> sailed at nightfall to Minoa, the island in front of Megara, with six hundred hoplites under the command of Hippocrates. They then took up their position not far from the Long Walls, in a pit out of which the bricks for the walls had been dug.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A second division of the Athenian army, consisting of lightarmed Plataeans and of a part of the force employed in guarding the frontier, under the command of Demosthenes the other general, lay in ambush at the temple of Ares, which is nearer still.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>During the night no one knew what they were about, except the men who were immediately concerned. Just before daybreak the conspirators executed their plan. They had long ago provided that the gates should be open when required; for by the permission of the commander, who supposed them to be privateering, they had been in the habit of conveying a sculling-boat out of the town by night. This they placed upon a waggon, and carried it down to the sea through the trench; they then sailed out, and just before day broke the boat was brought back by them on the waggon and taken in at the gates;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>their object being, as they pretended, to baffle the Athenian watch at Minoa, as no vessel would be seen in the harbour at all. The waggon had just arrived at the gates, which were opened for the boat to enter, when the Athenians, with whom the whole affair had been preconcerted, seeing this movement, rushed <pb n="50"/> out of the ambuscade, wanting to get in before the gates were shut again and while the waggon was still in them, and prevented them from being closed. At the same instant their Megarian confederates cut down the guards stationed at the gates.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>First of all the Plataeans and the frontier guard under Demosthenes rushed in where the trophy now stands. No sooner were they within the gates than the Peloponnesians who were nearest and saw what was going on hastened to the rescue; but they were overpowered by the Plataeans, who secured the gates for the entrance of the Athenian hoplites as they came running up.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Then the Athenians entered, and one after another proceeded to mount the wall. A few<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Peloponnesians supposing the Megarians to have gone over to the enemy, fly to Nisaea.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>but the greater part took to flight; they were terrified at the night attack of the enemy, and fancied, when they saw the Megarians who were in the conspiracy fighting against them, that all the Megarians had betrayed them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It had occurred at the same time to the Athenian herald, without orders, to make proclamation that any Megarian who pleased might join the ranks of the Athenians. When the Lacedaemonians heard the proclamation none of them remained any longer, but thinking that the Megarians were really fighting on the Athenian side they fled into Nisaea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the morning dawned and the Long Walls were already captured, Megara was in a tumult, and those who had negotiated with the Athenians and a large number of others who were in the plot insisted upon opening the gates and going out to battle. Now they had agreed that the Athenians should immediately rush in;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and they were themselves to be anointed with oil; this was the mark by which they were to be distinguished, that they might be spared in the attack. There was the less danger in opening the gates, since there had now arrived four <pb n="51"/> thousand Athenian hoplites and six hundred horse, who by a previous arrangement had come from Eleusis during the night.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When they were anointed and had collected about the gates some one in the secret acquainted the other party, who instantly came upon them in a compact body and declared that there should be no going out; even when they were stronger than at present they had not ventured to take the field; the danger to the city was too palpable; if any one opposed them the battle would have to be fought first within the walls. They did not betray their knowledge of the plot, but assumed the confident tone of men who were recommending the best course. At the same time they kept watch about the gates; and thus the conspiracy was foiled.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="69" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenian generals became aware that some difficulty had arisen, and that they could<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians cut off Nisaea by a cross wall.</hi></note> not carry the city by storm. So they<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The town, which is in danger of starvation, capitulates.</hi></note> immediately set about the circumvallation of Nisaea, thinking that, if they could take it before any assistance arrived, Megara itself would be more likely to capitulate.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Iron and other things needful, as well as masons, were quickly procured from Athens. Beginning from the wall which they already held they intercepted the approach from Megara by a cross wall, and from that drew another on either side of Nisaea down to the sea. The army divided among them the execution of the trench and walls, obtaining stones and bricks from the suburbs of the town. They also cut down timber and fruit-trees and made palisades where they were needed. The houses in the suburbs were of themselves a sufficient fortification, and only required battlements.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>All that day they continued working; on the following day, towards evening, the wall was nearly finished, and the terrified inhabitants of Nisaea having no food (for they depended for their daily supplies on the upper city), and imagining that Megara had gone over to the enemy, despairing too <pb n="52"/> of any aid soon arriving from Peloponnesus, capitulated to the Athenians. The conditions were as follows:&mdash; They were to go free, every man paying a fixed ransom and giving up his arms; but the Athenians might deal as they pleased with the Lacedaemonian commander and any Lacedaemonian who was in the place.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Upon these terms they came out, and the Athenians, having broken down the Long Walls between Megara and Nisaea, took possession of Nisaea and prepared for further action.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="70" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But it so happened that Brasidas, son of Tellis, the Lacedaemonian, who was equipping an<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas collects troops and sends to the Boeotians for an army.</hi></note> expedition intended for Chalcidic&egrave;, was in the neighbourhood of Sicyon and Corinth at the time. Hearing of the capture of the Long Walls, and fearing for the safety of the Peloponnesians in Nisaea, and of Megara itself, he sent to the Boeotians, desiring them to bring an army and meet him with all speed at Tripodiscus. The place so called is a village of Megara situated under Mount Geranea. Thither he also came himself, bringing two thousand seven hundred Corinthian, four hundred Phliasian, and six hundred Sicyonian hoplites, as well as the followers whom he had previously collected<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.80">4.80 fin.</bibl></note>. He had hoped to find Nisaea still untaken; but the news of the capture reached him on his exit from the hills at Tripodiscus, where he did not arrive until night.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He immediately took with him a body of three hundred chosen men, and before his arrival in the country was reported reached Megara, undiscovered by the Athenians, who were near the sea. He professed that he wanted, and he really meant if he could, to attempt the recovery of Nisaea; but the great point was to get into Megara and make that safe. So he demanded admission, saying that he had hopes of regaining Nisaea. <pb n="53"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="71" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The two factions in Megara were both equally afraid to receive him&mdash;the one lest he should<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>He tries to enter Megara, but neither faction is as yet willing to receive him.</hi></note> introduce the exiles and drive them out, the other lest the people, fearing this very thing, should set upon them and ruin the city, which would then be distracted by civil war and at the same time beset by the Athenians. And so both parties determined to wait and see what would happen.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For they both expected a battle to ensue between the Athenians and the army which had come to the relief of the city, and when the victory was won the party whose friends had conquered could more safely join them. Brasidas, thus failing in his purpose, returned to the main body of his troops.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="72" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At dawn of day the Boeotians appeared. Even before they were summoned by Brasidas they<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Boeotians arrive. Indecisive action of Boeotian and Athenian cavalry.</hi></note> had intended to relieve Megara; for the danger came home to them; and their whole force was already collected at Plataea. When his messenger arrived they were more resolved than ever, and sent forward two thousand two hundred heavy-armed and six hundred horse, allowing the greater number to return.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The entire army of Brasidas now amounted to six thousand hoplites. The Athenian hoplites were drawn up near Nisaea and the sea, and their light-armed troops were scattered over the plain, when the Boeotian cavalry came riding up, fell upon the lightarmed, and drove them to the shore. The attack was unexpected, for in no former invasion had aid come to the Megarians from any quarter.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenian cavalry now rode forward and there was a long engagement, in which both parties claimed to have won a victory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians drove the general of the Boeotian cavalry and a few other horsemen up<note anchored="yes">Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">prosela/santas</foreign> and omitting <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">a)poktei/i antes,</foreign> 'who had ridden up to the walls.'</note>, to the walls of Nisaea, and <pb n="54"/> there slew them and took their arms. As they retained possession of the dead bodies, and only restored them under a flag of truce, they raised a trophy. Still in respect of the whole engagement neither side when they parted had a decided advantage. The Boeotians retired to their main body, and the Athenians to Nisaea.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="73" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Brasidas and his army then moved nearer to the sea and to the town of Megara, and there,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Peloponnesians, having shown that they are ready to engage, do not care to risk a battle. The Athenians are even more unwilling tonight than the Peloponnesians.

They were expecting the Athenians to attack them, and knew that the Megarians were waiting to see who would be the conquerors. They were very well satisfied, for two reasons.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In the first place they were not the assailants, and had not gone out of their way to risk a battle, although they had clearly shown that they were ready to engage; and so they might fairly claim a victory without fighting. Again, the result in regard to Megara was good: for if they had not put in an appearance they would have had no chance at all, but would have been as good as beaten, and beyond a doubt would immediately have lost the city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Whereas now the Athenians themselves might be unwilling to fight; and, if so, they would gain their object without striking a blow. And this turned out to be the fact; for the Megarians did in the end receive Brasidas.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At first the Athenians came out and drew up near the Long Walls, but not being attacked they likewise remained inactive. The generals on their side were restrained by similar reflections. They had gained the greater part of what they wanted; they would be offering battle against a superior force; and their own danger would be out of proportion to that of the enemy. They might be victorious and take Megara, but if they failed the loss would fall on the flower of their infantry. Whereas the Peloponnesians were naturally <pb n="55"/> more willing to encounter a risk which would be divided among the several contingents making up the army now in the field; and each of these was but a part of their whole force, present and absent. Both armies waited for a time, and, when neither saw the other moving, the Athenians first of the two retired into Nisaea and the Peloponnesians returned to their previous position. Whereupon the party in Megara friendly to the exiles took courage, opened the gates, and received Brasidas and the generals of the other cities, considering that the Athenians had finally made up their minds not to fight, and that he was the conqueror. They then entered into negotiations with him; for the other faction which had conspired with the Athenians was now paralysed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="74" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After this the allies dispersed to their several cities and Brasidas returned to Corinth, where<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Megara now passes into the hands of the oligarchs, who cruelly and treacherously put to death their opponents.</hi></note> he made preparations for his expedition into Chalcidic&egrave;, his original destination.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When the Athenians had also gone home, such of the Megarians as had been chiefly concerned with them, knowing that they were discovered, at once slipped away. The rest of the citizens, after conferring with the friends of the exiles, recalled them from Pegae<note anchored="yes">Cp <bibl n="Thuc. 4.66">4.66 init.</bibl></note>, first binding them by the most solemn oaths to consider the interests of the state and to forget old quarrels.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But no sooner had they come into office than, taking the opportunity of a review and drawing up the divisions apart from one another, they selected about a hundred of their enemies, and of those who seemed to have been most deeply implicated with the Athenians, and compelled the people to give sentence upon them by an open vote; having obtained their condemnation, they put them to death. They then established in the city an extreme oligarchy.

So the Athenian generals collected troops from their allies, sailed to Antandrus, and, defeating a force which came out against them, recovered the place.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Not long afterwards Lamachus, who had sailed into the Pontus and had anchored in the territory of Heraclea at the mouth of the river Calex, lost his ships by a sudden flood which a fall of rain in the upper country had brought down.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A party in the cities of Boeotia, who wanted to overthrow their constitution and set up a democracy like that of Athens, had entered into communications with him and with Hippocrates, and a plan of operations had been concerted, chiefly under the direction of Ptoeodorus, <pb n="57"/> a Theban exile.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Some of the democratical party undertook to betray Siphae, which is a seaport on the Crisaean Gulf in the Thespian territory, and certain Orchomenians were to deliver up to the Athenians Chaeronea, which is a dependency of the Boeotian, or as it was formerly called the Minyan, Orchomenus. A body of Orchomenian exiles had a principal hand in this design and were seeking to hire a Peloponnesian force. The town of Chaeronea is at the extremity of Boeotia near the territory of Phanoteus in Phocis, and some Phocians took part in the plot.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians meanwhile were to seize Delium, a temple of Apollo which is in the district of Tanagra and looks towards Euboea. In order to keep the Boeotians occupied with disturbances at home, and prevent them from marching in a body to Delium, the whole movement was to be made on a single day, which was fixed beforehand.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>If the attempt succeeded and Delium was fortified, even though no revolution should at once break out in the states of Boeotia, they might hold the places which they had taken and plunder the country. The partisans of democracy in the several cities would have a refuge near at hand to which in case of failure they might retreat. Matters could not long remain as they were; and in time, the Athenians acting with the rebels, and the Boeotian forces being divided, they would easily settle Boeotia in their interest. Such was the nature of the proposed attempt.

Other Thessalians also conducted him;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>in particular, Niconidas a friend of Perdiccas from Larissa. Under any circumstances it would not have been easy to cross Thessaly without an escort, and certainly for an armed force to go through a neighbour's country without his consent was a proceeding which excited jealousy among all Hellenes. Besides, the common people of Thessaly were always well disposed towards the Athenians. And if the traditions of the country had not been in favour of a close oligarchy, Brasidas could never have gone on;

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus Brasidas succeeded in running through Thessaly before any measures were taken to<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas reaches Perdiccas.</hi></note> stop him, and reached Perdiccas and Chalcidic&egrave;.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He and the revolted tributaries of the Athenians, alarmed at their recent successes, had invited the Peloponnesians. The Chalcidians were expecting that the first efforts of the Athenians would be directed against them: their cities in the neighbourhood also which had not revolted secretly joined in the invitation.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Perdiccas was not a declared enemy of Athens, but was afraid that the old differences between himself and the Athenians might revive, and he was especially anxious to subdue Arrhibaeus, king of the Lyncestians.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="80" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Lacedaemonians were the more willing to let the Chalcidians have an army from Peloponnesus owing to the unfortunate state of their affairs. For now that the Athenians were infesting Peloponnesus, and especially <pb n="60"/>
				</p>
				<p>Laconia, they thought that a diversion would be best effected if they could retaliate on them<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians encourage the expedition of Brasidas in the hope of making a diversion, and getting rid of the Helots.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They were also glad of a pretext for sending out of the way some of the Helots, fearing that they would take the opportunity of rising afforded by the occupation of Pylos.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Most of the Lacedaemonian institutions were specially intended to secure them against this source of danger. Once, when they were afraid of the number and vigour<note anchored="yes">Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">skaio/thta,</foreign> 'obstinacy.'</note> of the Helot youth, this was what they did:&mdash;They proclaimed that a selection would be made of those Helots who claimed to have rendered the best service to the Lacedaemonians in war, and promised them liberty. The announcement was intended to test them; it was thought that those among them who were foremost in asserting their freedom would be most high-spirited, and most likely to rise against their masters.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So they selected about two thousand, who were crowned with garlands and went in procession round the temples; they were supposed to have received their liberty; but not long afterwards the Spartans put them all out of the way, and no man knew how any one of them came by his end.&mdash;And so they were only too glad to send with Brasidas seven hundred Helots as hoplites.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The rest of his army he hired from Peloponnesus<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.70">4.70 med.</bibl></note>. He himself was even more willing to go than they were to send him.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="81" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Chalcidians too desired to have him, for at Sparta he had<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Justice and moderation of Brasidas remembered afterwards in Hellas.</hi></note> always been considered a man of energy. And on this expedition he proved invaluable to the Lacedaemonians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At the time he gave an impression of justice <pb n="61"/> and moderation in his behaviour to the cities, which induced most of them to revolt, while others were betrayed into his hands. Thus the Lacedaemonians were able to lighten the pressure of war upon Peloponnesus; and when shortly afterwards they desired to negotiate, they had places to give in return for what they sought to recover. And at a later period of the war, after the Sicilian expedition, the honesty and ability of Brasidas which some had experienced, and of which others had heard the fame, mainly attracted the Athenian allies to the Lacedaemonians.<note anchored="yes">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">prw=tos</foreign> closely with <foreign lang="greek">do/cas:</foreign> 'For of all the Spartans who had been sent out, he was the first who proved himself,' &amp;c.</note> For he was the first Spartan who had gone out to them, and he proved himself<note anchored="yes">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">prw=tos</foreign> closely with <foreign lang="greek">do/cas:</foreign> 'For of all the Spartans who had been sent out, he was the first who proved himself,' &amp;c.</note> to be in every way a good man.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians, hearing of the arrival of Brasidas in Chalcidic&egrave;, and believing that Perdiccas<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians declare Perdiccas an enemy</hi></note> was the instigator of the expedition, declared war against the latter and kept a closer watch over their allies in that region.

				<p>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Perdiccas, at once uniting the soldiers of Brasidas with his own forces, made war upon Arrhibaeus<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The alliance between Perdiccas and Brasidas soon begins to cool.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But when he and Brasidas and the army arrived at the pass leading into Lyncus, Brasidas said that before appealing to arms he should like to try in person the effect of negotiations, and see if he could not make Arrhibaeus an ally of the Lacedaemonians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He was partly influenced by messages which came from Arrhibaeus expressing his willingness to submit any matter in dispute to the arbitration of Brasidas: and the Chalcidian ambassadors who accompanied the expedition recommended him not to remove from Perdiccas' path all <pb n="62"/> his difficulties, lest, when they were wanting him for their own affairs, his ardour should cool.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Besides, the envoys of Perdiccas when at Sparta had said something to the Lacedaemonians about his making many of the neighbouring tribes their allies, and on this ground Brasidas claimed to act jointly with Perdiccas in the matter of Arrhibaeus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But Perdiccas answered that he had not brought Brasidas there to arbitrate in the quarrels of Macedonia; he had meant him to destroy his enemies when he pointed them out. While he, Perdiccas, was maintaining half the Lacedaemonian army, Brasidas had no business to be holding parley with Arrhibaeus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But in spite of the opposition and resentment of Perdiccas, Brasidas communicated with Arrhibaeus, and was induced by his words to withdraw his army without invading the country. From that time Perdiccas thought himself ill-used, and paid only a third instead of half the expenses of the army.

					<milestone n="84" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same summer, immediately on his return from Lyncus, and a little before the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas is admitted into Acanthus and addresses the citizens.</hi></note> vintage, Brasidas, reinforced by Chalcidian troops, marched against Acanthus, a colony of Andros.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The inhabitants of the city were not agreed about admitting him; those who in concert with the Chalcidians had invited him being opposed to the mass of the people. So he asked them to receive him alone, and hear what he had to say before they decided; and to this request the multitude, partly out of fear for their still ungathered vintage, were induced to consent. Whereupon, coming forward to the people (and for a Lacedaemonian he was not a bad speaker), he addressed them as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="85" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Men of Acanthus, the Lacedaemonians have sent me out at the head of this army to justify the declaration which we made at the beginning of the war&mdash;that we were going to fight against the Athenians for the liberties of Hellas.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>If we have been long in coming, the reason is that we were disappointed in the result of the war nearer <pb n="63"/> home; for we had hoped that, without involving you in danger, we might ourselves have made<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>We come to you as the liberators of Hellas: why do you close your gates against us? Your refusal to admit us will have a bad effect on other ties. We are able and willing to help you. We were too strong for the Athenians at Nisaea.</hi></note> a speedy end of the Athenians. And therefore let no one blame us;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>we have come as soon as we could, and with your help will do our best to overthrow them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But how is it that you close your gates against me, and do not greet my arrival? We Lacedaemonians thought that we were coming to those who even before we came in act were our allies in spirit, and would joyfully receive us; having this hope we have braved the greatest dangers, marching for many days through a foreign country, and have shown the utmost zeal in your cause.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And now, for you to be of another mind and to set yourselves against the liberties of your own city and of all Hellas would be monstrous!
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The evil is not only that you resist me yourselves, but wherever I go people will be less likely to join me; they will take it amiss when they hear that you to whom I first came, representing a powerful city and reputed to be men of sense, did not receive me, and I shall not be able to give a satisfactory explanation,<note anchored="yes">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">e)pife/rein</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ai)ti/an e(/cw:</foreign> 'but shall be deemed either to offer a spurious liberty, or to be weak.'</note> but shall have to confess either that I offer a spurious liberty, or that I am weak<note anchored="yes">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">e)pife/rein</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">ai)ti/an e(/cw:</foreign> 'but shall be deemed either to offer a spurious liberty, or to be weak.'</note> and incapable of protecting you against the threatened attack of the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And yet when I brought assistance to Nisaea in command of the army which I have led hither, the Athenians, though more numerous, refused to engage with me; and they are not likely now, when their forces must be conveyed by sea, to send an army against you equal to that which they had at Nisaea<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.108">4.108 fin.</bibl></note>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="86" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>And I myself, why am I here? I come, not to injure, but to emancipate the Hellenes. And I have bound the government of Lacedaemon by the most solemn oaths to respect the independence <pb n="64"/> of any states which I may bring over to their side. I do not want to gain your alliance by<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>I am not the representative of a faction; and shall not enslave either the few or the many. The Lacedaemonians, unlike the Athenians, have a character, to lose.</hi></note> force or fraud, but to give you ours, that we may free you from the Athenian yoke.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I think that you ought not to doubt my word when I offer you the most solemn pledges, nor should I be regarded as an inefficient champion; but you should confidently join me.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>'If any one among you hangs back because he has a personal fear of anybody else, and is under the impression that I shall hand over the city to a party, him above all I would reassure.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For I am not come hither to be the tool of a faction; nor do I conceive that the liberty which I bring you is of an ambiguous character; I should forget the spirit of my country were I to enslave the many to the few, or the minority to the whole people.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Such a tyranny would be worse than the dominion of the foreigner, and we Lacedaemonians should receive no thanks in return for our trouble, but, instead of honour and reputation, only reproach. We should lay ourselves open to the charges which are our best weapons against the Athenians, and in a far more detestable form, for they have never been great examples of virtue.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For to men of character there is more disgrace in seeking aggrandisement by specious deceit than by open violence<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.77">1.77 med.</bibl></note>; the violent have the justification of strength which fortune gives them, but a policy of intrigue is insidious and wicked.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'So careful are we where our highest interests are at stake. And not to speak of our oaths,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>If you will not be our friends, we must be your enemies. Having a duty to perform, we cannot tolerate your opposition.</hi></note> you cannot have better assurance that they give whose actions, when compared with their professions, afford a convincing proof that it is their interest to keep their word. <pb n="65"/>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>'But if you plead that you cannot accept the proposals which I offer, and insist that you ought not to suffer for the rejection of them because you are our friends; if you are of opinion that liberty is perilous and should not in justice be forced upon any one, but gently brought to those who are able to receive it,&mdash;I shall first call the Gods and heroes of the country to witness that I have come hither for your good, and that you would not be persuaded by me: I shall then use force and ravage your country without any more scruple.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>I shall deem myself justified by two overpowering arguments. In the first place, I must not permit the Lacedaemonians to suffer by your friendship, and suffer they will through the revenues which the Athenians will continue to derive from you if you do not join me; and in the second place, the Hellenes must not lose their hope of liberation by your fault.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>On any other ground we should certainly be wrong in taking such a step; it is only for the sake of the general weal that we Lacedaemonians have any right to be forcing liberty upon those who would rather not have it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For ourselves, we are far from desiring empire, but we want to overthrow the empire of others.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And having this end in view, we should do injustice to the majority if, while bringing independence to all, we tolerated opposition in you. Wherefore be well advised. Strive to take the lead in liberating Hellas, and lay up a treasure of undying fame. You will save your own property, and you will crown your city with glory.'

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus spoke Brasidas.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They then admitted his army; <pb n="66"/> and shortly afterwards Stagirus, a colony of the Andrians, revolted also. Such were the events of the summer.

					<milestone n="89" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the betrayal of Boeotia into the hands of Hippocrates and Demosthenes, the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The plot for the betrayal of Boeotia is discovered.</hi></note> Athenian generals, was on the eve of accomplishment. At the beginning of the ensuing winter Demosthenes and his fleet were to appear at Siphae, and Hippocrates simultaneously to march upon Delium. But there was a mistake about the day, and Demosthenes, with his Acarnanian and numerous other allies drawn from that neighbourhood, sailed to Siphae too soon. His attempt failed; for the plot was betrayed by Nicomachus a Phocian, of the town of Phanoteus, who told the Lacedaemonians, and they the Boeotians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Whereupon there was a general levy of the Boeotians, for Hippocrates, who was to have been in the country and to have distracted their attention, had not yet arrived; and so they forestalled the Athenians by the occupation of Siphae and Chaeronea. When the conspirators in the Boeotian cities saw that there had been a mistake they made no movement from within.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="90" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Hippocrates had called out the whole force of Athens, metics as well as citizens, and all the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians under Hippocrates fortify Delium. The main body of the army then leaves of the army then leaves the Boeotian territory.</hi></note> strangers who were then in the city. But he did not arrive at Delium until after the Boeotians had quitted Siphae. He encamped and fortified Delium, which is a temple of Apollo.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>His army dug a trench around the temple and the sacred precinct, the earth which they threw up out of the trench forming a rampart; along this rampart they drove in a double palisade, and cutting down the vines in the neighbourhood of the temple threw them in between. They made a like use of the stones and bricks of the houses near, which they pulled down, and by every means in their power strove to increase the height of the rampart. Where the temple buildings did not extend they erected wooden towers at convenient places; the cloister which <pb n="67"/> had once existed had fallen down.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They began their work on the third day after their departure from Athens, and continued all this day and the next and the following day until the midday meal.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When it was nearly finished the army retired from Delium to a distance of a little more than a mile, intending to go home. The greater part of the light-armed troops proceeded on their march, but the hoplites piled their arms and rested. Hippocrates, who had remained behind, was occupied in placing the guards at their posts, and in superintending the completion of that part of the outworks which was still unfinished.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="91" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the Boeotians were gathering at Tanagra. All the forces from the different cities<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Boeotians at the instigation of Pagondas determine to pursue the Athenians across the border.</hi></note> had now arrived. They saw that the Athenians were already marching homewards, and most of the Boeotarchs (who are in number eleven) disapproved of giving battle, because the enemy had left the Boeotian territory. For when the Athenians rested in their march they were just on the borders of Oropia. But Pagondas the son of Aeoladas, one of the two Boeotarchs from Thebes, who was in command at the time (the other being Arianthidas the son of Lysimachidas),<note anchored="yes">Or, omitting the words ' who was in command at the time': 'wanted to fight while he held the command.'</note> wanted to fight<note anchored="yes">Or, omitting the words ' who was in command at the time': 'wanted to fight while he held the command.'</note>, believing that the risk was worth encountering. So calling the soldiers to him in successive divisions, that they might not all leave their arms at once, he exhorted the Boeotians to march against the Athenians and to hazard battle, in the following words:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="92" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Men of Boeotia, no one among us generals should ever have allowed the thought to enter his mind that we ought not to fight with the Athenians, even although we may not overtake them on Boeotian soil. They have crossed our frontier; it is Boeotia in which they have built a fort, and Boeotia which they intend to lay waste. Our enemies <pb n="68"/> they clearly are wherever we find them, and therefore in that country out of which they came<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians are our inveterate enemies, wherever we find them. They are the aggressors, and we must defend ourselves against them without stopping to think. Neighbors are always dangerous, and they are the most dangerous of all. Once we were at their mercy; but we recovered our liberty at Coronea, and must again show them that we cannot be attacked with impunity.</hi></note> and did us mischief.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But perhaps not to fight may appear to some one to be the safer course. Well then, let him who thinks so think again. When a man being in full possession of his own goes out of his way to attack others because he covets more, he cannot reflect too much;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>but when a man is attacked by another and has to fight for his own, prudence does not allow of reflection. In you the temper has been hereditary which would repel the foreign invader, whether he be in another's country or in your own;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>the Athenian invader above all others should be thus repelled, because he is your next neighbour. For among neighbours antagonism is ever a condition of independence, and against men like these, who are seeking to enslave not only near but distant countries, shall we not fight to the last? Look at their treatment of Euboea just over the strait, and of the greater part of Hellas. I would have you know, that whereas other men fight with their neighbours about the lines of a frontier, for us, if we are conquered, there will be no more disputing about frontiers, but one fixed boundary, including our whole country, for the Athenians will come in and take by force all that we have.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>So much more dangerous are they than ordinary neighbours. And men who, like them, wantonly assail others, will not hesitate to attack him who remains quietly at home and only defends himself; but they are not so ready to overbear the adversary who goes out of his own country to meet them, and when there is an opportunity strikes first.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>We have proved this in our own dealings with the Athenians. Once, owing to our internal dissensions, they took possession of our land, but we overcame them at Coronea, <pb n="69"/> and gave Boeotia that complete security which has lasted to this day<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.62">3.62 fin.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Remember the past: let the elder men among us emulate their own earlier deeds, and the younger who are the sons of those valiant fathers do their best not to tarnish the virtues of their race. Confident that the God whose temple they have impiously fortified and now occupy will be our champion, and relying on the sacrifices, which are favourable to us, let us advance to meet them. They may satisfy their greed by attacking those who do not defend themselves; but we will show them that from men whose generous spirit ever impels them to fight for the liberties of their country, and who will not see that of others unjustly enslaved,&mdash;from such men they will not part without a battle.'
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="93" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>With this exhortation Pagondas persuaded the Boeotians to march against the Athenians,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Boeotian army, numbering not less than eighteen thousand five hundred in all, the Theban division arranged twenty-five deep, appears over the crest of a hill.</hi></note> and quickly moved his army forward (for the day was far advanced). As soon as he approached the enemy he took up a position where a hill intercepted the view, and there drew up his army and prepared for action.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Hippocrates, who was still at Delium, heard that the Boeotians were advancing, and sent a message to the army bidding them get into position. He himself came up shortly afterwards, having left three hundred cavalry at Delium, in order that they might protect the place if assailed, and also might watch their opportunity and attack the Boeotians while the battle was going on. To these the Boeotians opposed a separate force.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When everything was ready they appeared over the crest of the hill, and halted in the order which they proposed to maintain in the engagement; they numbered about seven thousand hoplites, more than ten thousand light-armed troops, a thousand cavalry, and five hundred targeteers. <pb n="70"/> The Thebans and the Boeotians who served in their ranks occupied the right wing.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In the centre were the men of Haliartus, Coronea, and Copae, and the other dwellers about the Lake Copais. On the left wing were the Thespians, Tanagraeans, and Orchomenians; the cavalry and light-armed troops were placed on both wings. The Thebans were formed in ranks of five and twenty deep; the formation of the others varied.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Such was the character and array of the Boeotian forces.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="94" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>All the hoplites of the Athenian army were arranged in ranks eight deep; in numbers they<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Numbers of the Athenian hoplites about the same as of the Boeotian: they are drawn up eight deep.</hi></note> equalled the hoplites of the enemy; the cavalry were stationed on either wing. No regular light-armed troops accompanied them, for Athens had no organised force of this kind. Those who originally joined the expedition were many times over the number of their opponents; but they were to a great extent without proper arms, for the whole force, strangers as well as citizens, had been called out. Having once started homewards, there were but few of them forthcoming in the engagement.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When the Athenians were ranged in order of battle and on the point of advancing, Hippocrates the general, proceeding along the lines, exhorted them as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="95" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Men of Athens, there is not much time for exhortation, but to the brave a few words are as<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>We are fighting not only to gain Boeotia, but for the safety and liberties of Athens We ought to have a spirit worthy of her, worthy of the victors at Oenophyta.</hi></note> good as many; I am only going to remind, not to admonish you<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.17">4.17 med.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.126">4.126 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.69">5.69 fin.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Let no man think that because we are on foreign soil we are running into great danger without cause. Although in Boeotian territory we shall be fighting for our own. If we are victors, the Peloponnesians, deprived of the Boeotian cavalry, will never invade our <pb n="71"/> land again, so that in one battle you win Boeotia and win at the same time for Attica a more complete freedom.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Meet them in a spirit worthy of the first city in Hellas&mdash;of that Athens which we are all proud to call our country; in a spirit too worthy of our fathers, who in times past under Myronides at Oenophyta overcame these very Boeotians and conquered their land.'
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="96" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus spoke Hippocrates, and had gone over half the army, not having had time for more,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The right wing of the Athenians overcomes the Boeotians and the right wing of the Boeotians overcomes the Athenians. On the sudden appearance of some Boeotian cavalry the Athenians are finally defeated.</hi></note> when the Boeotians (to whom Pagondas just before engaging had been making a second short exhortation) raised the paean, and came down upon them from the hill. The Athenians hastened forward, and the two armies met at a run.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The extreme right and left of either army never engaged, for the same reason; they were both prevented by water-courses. But the rest closed, and there was a fierce struggle and pushing of shield against shield.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The left wing of the Boeotians as far as their centre was worsted by the Athenians, who pressed hard upon this part of the army, especially upon the Thespians. For the troops ranged at their side having given way they were surrounded and hemmed in; and so the Thespians who perished were cut down fighting hand to hand.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Some of the Athenians themselves in surrounding the enemy were thrown into confusion and unwittingly slew one another. On this side then the Boeotians were overcome, and fled to that part of the army which was still fighting;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>but the right wing, where the Thebans were stationed, overcame the Athenians, and forcing them back, at first step by step, were following hard upon them, when Pagondas, seeing that his left wing was in distress, sent two squadrons of horse unperceived round the hill.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>They suddenly appeared over the ridge; the victorious wing of the Athenians, fancying that another army was attacking them, was struck with panic;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>and so at both points, partly <pb n="72"/> owing to this diversion, and partly to the pressure of the advancing Thebans who broke their line, the rout of the Athenian army became general.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Some fled to the sea at Delium, others towards Oropus, others to Mount Parnes, or in any direction which gave hope of safety. The Boeotians, especially their cavalry and that of the Locrians which arrived when the rout had begun, pursued and slaughtered them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Night closed upon the pursuit, and aided the mass of the fugitives in their escape. On the next day those of them who had reached Oropus and Delium, which, though defeated, they still held, were conveyed home by sea.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="97" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>A garrison was left in the place.
				</p>

They then left them under the care of a guard, and retiring to Tanagra concerted an attack upon Delium.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The herald of the Athenians, as he was on his way to ask for their dead, met a Boeotian herald, who turned him back, declaring that he would get no answer until he had returned himself. He then came before the Athenians and delivered to them the message of the Boeotians, by whom they were accused of transgressing the universally recognized customs of Hellas.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Those who invaded the territory of others ever abstained from touching the temples, whereas the Athenians had fortified Delium and were now dwelling there, and doing all that men usually do in an unconsecrated place. They were even drawing, for common use, the water which the Boeotians themselves were forbidden to use except as holy water for the sacrifices.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They therefore on behalf both of the God and of themselves, invoking Apollo and all the divinities who had a share in the temple, bade the Athenians depart and carry off what belonged to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="98" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Upon the delivery of this message the Athenians sent to the Boeotians a herald of their own, who on their behalf <pb n="73"/> declared 'that they had done no wilful injury to the temple, and would not damage it if they could help it; they had not originally entered it with any injurious intent, but in order that from it they<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians defend themselves against the charge of sacrilege, which they retort upon their opponents.</hi></note> might defend themselves against those who were really injuring them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>According to Hellenic practice, they who were masters of the land, whether much or little, invariably had possession of the temples, to which they were bound to<note anchored="yes">Or, 'were bound to show reverence in such ways as they could in addition to the customary observances.'</note> show the customary reverence, but in such ways only as were possible<note anchored="yes">Or, 'were bound to show reverence in such ways as they could in addition to the customary observances.'</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There was a time when the Boeotians themselves and most other nations, including all who had driven out the earlier inhabitants of the land which they now occupied, attacked the temples of others, and these had in time become their own.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So the Boeotian temples would have become theirs if they had succeeded in conquering more of Boeotia. So much of the country as they did occupy was their own, and they did not mean to leave it until compelled. As to meddling with the water, they could not help themselves;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>the use of it was a necessity which they had not incurred wantonly; they were resisting the Boeotians who had begun by attacking their territory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When men were constrained by war, or by some other great calamity, there was every reason to think that their offence was forgiven by the God himself. He who has committed an involuntary misdeed finds a refuge at the altar, and men are said to transgress, not when they presume a little in their distress, but when they do evil of their own free will.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Boeotians, who demanded a sacred place as a ransom for the bodies of the dead, were guilty of a far greater impiety than the Athenians who refused to make such an unseemly exchange.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>They desired the Boeotians to let them take away their dead, not adding the condition <q direct="unspecified">if they would quit Boeotia,</q> for in fact they were in a spot <pb n="74"/> which they had fairly won by arms and not in Boeotia, but simply saying, <q direct="unspecified">if they would make a truce according to ancestral custom.</q> '
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="99" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Boeotians replied that if they were in Boeotia they might take what belonged to them, but<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Boeotians quibble about the spot in which the dead bodies lie.</hi></note> must depart out of it; if they were in their own land they could do as they pleased. They knew that the territory of Oropus, in which the dead lay (for the battle took place on the border), was actually in the possession of Athens, but that the Athenians could not take them away without their leave,<note anchored="yes">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">dh=qen</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">u(pe\r th=s e)kei/nwn:</foreign> 'and they were unwilling to make a truce respecting a piece of ground which was claimed by the Athenians.'</note> and they were unwilling as they pretended to make a truce respecting a piece of ground which did not belong to them<note anchored="yes">Or, taking <foreign lang="greek">dh=qen</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">u(pe\r th=s e)kei/nwn:</foreign> 'and they were unwilling to make a truce respecting a piece of ground which was claimed by the Athenians.'</note>.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They sawed in two and hollowed out a great beam, which they joined together again very exactly, like a flute, and suspended a vessel by chains at the end of the beam; the iron mouth of a bellows directed downwards into the vessel was attached to the beam, of which a great part was itself overlaid with iron.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This machine they brought <pb n="75"/> up from a distance on carts to various points of the rampart where vine stems and wood had been most extensively used, and when it was quite near the wall they applied a large bellows to their own end of the beam, and blew through it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The blast, prevented from escaping, passed into the vessel which contained burning coals and sulphur and pitch; these made a huge flame, and set fire to the rampart, so that no one could remain upon it.

Their base of operations was Eion, a market and seaport which they already possessed, at the mouth of the river, about three miles from the site of the present town. Wanting to enclose the newly-founded city, which on two sides is surrounded by the river Strymon, Hagnon cut it off by a long wall reaching from the upper part of the river to the lower, and called the place Amphipolis, because it strikes the eye both by sea and land.

The weather was wintry and somewhat snowy;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and so he pushed on all the quicker; he was hoping that his approach might be known at Amphipolis only to those who were in the secret.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There dwelt in the place settlers from Argilus, a town which was originally colonised from Andros; these and others aided in the attempt, instigated some by Perdiccas, others by the Chalcidians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The town of Argilus is not far off, and the inhabitants were always suspected by the Athenians, and were always conspiring against Amphipolis. For some time past, ever since the arrival of Brasidas had given them an opportunity, they had been concerting measures with their countrymen inside the walls for the surrender of the city. They now revolted from the Athenians on that very night, and received him into their town, and before dawn<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">pro\ e(/w.</foreign></note> they conducted the army to the bridge over the river, which is at some distance from the town.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At that time no walls had been built down to the river, as they have since been; a small guard was posted there. Brasidas easily overcame the guard, owing partly to the plot within the walls, partly to the severity of the weather and the suddenness of his attack; he then crossed the bridge, and at once was master of all the possessions of the Amphipolitans outside the walls. For they lived scattered about in the country.

					<milestone n="104" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The passage of the river was a complete surprise to the citizens within the walls.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But he merely occupied a position, and overran the country outside the walls; <pb n="78"/> and then, finding that his confederates within failed in accomplishing their part, he took no further step.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Meanwhile the opponents of the conspirators, being superior in number, prevented the immediate opening of the gates, and acting with Eucles, the general to whose care the place had been committed by the Athenians, sent for help to the other general in Chalcidic&egrave;, Thucydides the son of Olorus, who wrote this history; he was then at Thasos, an island colonised from Paros, and distant from Amphipolis about half a day's sail.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As soon as he heard the tidings he sailed quickly to Amphipolis with seven ships which happened to be on the spot; he wanted to get into Amphipolis if possible before it could capitulate, or at any rate to occupy Eion.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="105" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile Brasidas, fearing the arrival of the ships from Thasos, and hearing that Thucydides had the right of working gold<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>and therefore offers moderate terms,</hi></note> mines in the neighboring district of Thrace, and was consequently one of the leading men of the country, did his utmost to get possession of the city before his arrival. He was afraid that, if Thucydides once came, the people of Amphipolis would no longer be disposed to surrender. For their hope would be that he would bring in allies from the islands or maritime towns or from the interior of Thrace, and relieve them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He therefore offered moderate terms, proclaiming that any Amphipolitan or Athenian might either remain in the city and have the enjoyment of his property on terms of equality; or, if he preferred, might depart, taking his goods with him, within five days.

					<milestone n="106" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the people heard the proclamation they began to waver; for very few of the citizens were Athenians, the greater number<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>inhabitants.

In their alarm they thought the terms reasonable; the Athenian <pb n="79"/> population because they were too glad to withdraw, reflecting how much greater their share of the danger was, and not expecting speedy relief; the rest of the people because they retained all their existing rights, and were delivered from a fate which seemed inevitable.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The partisans of Brasidas now proceeded to justify his proposals without disguise, for they saw that the mind of the whole people had changed, and that they no longer paid any regard to the Athenian general who was on the spot.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So his terms were accepted, and the city was surrendered and delivered up to him. On the evening of the same day Thucydides and his ships sailed into Eion, but not until Brasidas had taken possession of Amphipolis, missing Eion only by a night.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For if the ships had not come to the rescue with all speed, the place would have been in his hands on the next morning.

					<milestone n="107" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thucydides now put Eion in a state of defence, desiring to provide not only against any immediate<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas sails down the river to Eion, but fails in taking the place.</hi></note> attempt of Brasidas, but also against future danger. He received the fugitives who had chosen to quit Amphipolis according to the agreement and wished to come into Eion.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Brasidas suddenly sailed with a number of small craft down the river to Eion, hoping that he might take the point which runs out from the wall, and thereby command the entrance to the harbour; at the same time he made an attack by land. But in both these attempts he was foiled.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Whereupon he returned, and took measures for the settlement of Amphipolis. Myrcinus a city in the Edonian country joined him, Pittacus the king of the Edonians having been assassinated by the children of Goaxis and Brauro his wife. Soon afterwards Galepsus and Oesym&egrave; (both colonies from Thasos) came over to him.

As far as the Strymon the Lacedaemonians could always have found a way to the allies of Athens, if the Thessalians allowed them to pass; but until they gained possession of the bridge they could proceed no further, because, for a long way above, the river forms a large lake, and below, towards Eion, there were triremes on guard. All difficulty seemed now to be removed, and the Athenians feared that more of their allies would revolt.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For Brasidas in all his actions showed himself reasonable, and whenever he made a speech lost no opportunity of declaring that he was sent to emancipate Hellas.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The cities which were subject to Athens, when they heard of the taking of Amphipolis and of his promises and of his gentleness, were more impatient than ever to rise, and privately sent embassies to him, asking him to come and help them, every one of them wanting to be first.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They thought that there was no danger, for they had under-estimated the Athenian power, which afterwards proved its greatness and the magnitude of their mistake; they judged rather by their own illusive wishes than by the safe rule of prudence. For such is the manner of men; what they like is always seen by them in the light of unreflecting hope, what they dislike they peremptorily set aside by an arbitrary conclusion.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Moreover, the Athenians had lately received a blow in Boeotia, and Brasidas told the allies what was likely to attract them, but untrue, that at Nisaea the Athenians had refused to fight with his unassisted forces<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.73">4.73</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 4.85">85 fin.</bibl></note>. And so they grew bold, and were quite confident that no army would ever reach them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Above all, they were influenced by the <pb n="81"/> pleasurable excitement of the moment; they were now for the first time going to find out of what the Lacedaemonians were capable when in real earnest, and therefore they were willing to risk anything. The Athenians were aware of their disaffection, and as far as they could, at short notice and in winter time, sent garrisons to the different cities. Brasidas also despatched a message to the Lacedaemonians requesting them to let him have additional forces, and he himself began to build triremes on the Strymon.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>But they would not second his efforts because their leading men were jealous of him, and also because they preferred to recover the prisoners taken in the island and bring the war to an end.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The great body of the inhabitants and the Athenian garrison never discovered him; but those Toronaeans who were in his interest, and knew that he was coming, were awaiting his approach; some few of them had privately gone to meet him. When his confederates found that he had arrived, they introduced into the city, under the command of Lysistratus an Olynthian, seven light-armed soldiers carrying daggers (for of twenty who had been originally appointed to that service, only seven had the courage to enter). These men slipped in undiscovered by way of the wall where it looks towards the sea. They ascended the side of the hill on the slope of which the city is built, and slew the sentinels posted on the summit; they then began to break down the postern-gate towards the promontory of Canastraeum.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>There was a delay, and they, wondering what had happened, drew by degrees nearer and nearer to the city.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Of the Athenian hoplites, who to the number of fifty chanced to be sleeping in the Agora, a few were cut down at once, but the greater number, when they saw what had happened, fled, some by land, others to the Athenian guard-ships, of which two were on the spot, and reached safely the fort of Lecythus, a high point of the city which the Athenians had occupied and retained in their own hands; it runs out into the sea, and is only joined to the mainland by a narrow isthmus;

				<p>
					<milestone n="114" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was now daylight, and the city being completely in his power, Brasidas made proclamation to the Toronaeans who had taken refuge with the Athenians, that if they liked they might come out and return to their homes; they would suffer no harm in the city. He also sent a herald to the Athenians, bidding them take what was their own and <pb n="84"/> depart under a flag of truce out of Lecythus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They refused to go, but asked him to make a truce with them for a day, that they might take up their dead, and he granted them two days.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He then called a meeting of the Toronaeans, and addressed them much in the same terms which he had used at Acanthus<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.85">4.85</bibl>&ndash;87.</note>. He told them that they ought not to think badly of those citizens who had aided him, much less to deem them traitors; for they were not bribed and had not acted with any view of enslaving the city, but in the interest of her freedom and welfare. Those of the inhabitants who had not joined in the plot were not to suppose that they would fare worse than the rest; for he had not come thither to destroy either the city or any of her citizens.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In this spirit he had made the proclamation to those who had taken refuge with the Athenians, and he thought none the worse of them for being their friends; when they had a similar experience of the Lacedaemonians their attachment to them would be still greater, for they would recognize their superior honesty; they were only afraid of them now because they did not know them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They must all make up their minds to be faithful allies, and expect henceforward to be held responsible if they offended; but in the past the Lacedaemonians had not been wronged by them; on the contrary, it was they who had been wronged by a power too great for them, and were to be excused if they had opposed him.

Just as the army was drawing near the wall, the Athenians raised a wooden tower upon the top of a building at a point where the approach was easiest and where they thought that the enemy would be most likely to apply the engine. To this tower they carried up numerous jars and casks of water and great stones; and many men mounted upon it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Suddenly the building, being too heavily weighted, fell in with a loud crash. This only annoyed and did not much alarm the Athenians who were near and saw what had happened, but the rest were terrified, and their fright was the greater in proportion as they were further off. They thought that the place had been taken at that spot, and fled as fast as they could to the sea where their ships lay.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Brasidas witnessed the accident and observed that they were abandoning the battlements.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Thus the Athenians were driven out; and in their ships of war and other vessels crossed over to Pallen&egrave;. There happened to be in Lecythus a temple of Athen&egrave;; and when Brasidas was about to storm the place he had made a proclamation that he who first mounted the wall should receive thirty minae<note anchored="yes">About &pound;100.</note>; but now, believing that the capture had been effected by some more than human power, he gave the thirty minae to the Goddess for the service of the temple, and then pulling down Lecythus and clearing the ground, he consecrated the whole place.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The rest of this winter he <pb n="86"/> spent in settling the administration of the towns which he already held, and in concerting measures against the rest. At the end of the winter ended the eighth year of the war.

					<milestone n="117" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Early in the following spring the Lacedaemonians and Athenians made a truce for a year.<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians because they are apprehensive of the growing success of Brasidas, the Lacedaemonians because they want to recover the captives, make peace for a year.</hi></note> The Athenians hoped to prevent Brasidas from gaining over any more of their allies for the present; the interval would give them leisure for preparation; and hereafter, if it was for their interest, they might come to a general understanding. The Lacedaemonians had truly divined the fears of the Athenians, and thought that, having enjoyed an intermission of trouble and hardship, they would be more anxious to make terms, restore the captives taken in the island, and conclude a durable peace. Their main object was to recover their men while the good fortune of Brasidas lasted;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>when, owing to his successful career and the balance which he had established between the contending powers, they did not feel the loss of them, and yet by retaliating on equal terms with the remainder of their forces might have a fair prospect of victory<note anchored="yes">See the note on this passage in Barton and Chavasse's edition of Thucydides, Book IV.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So they made a truce for themselves and their allies in the following terms:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="118" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'I. Concerning the temple and oracle of the Pythian Apollo, it seems good to us that any<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Terms of peace.</hi></note> one who will shall ask counsel threat without fraud and without fear, according to his ancestral customs.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>To this we, the Lacedaemonians and their allies here present, agree, and we will send heralds to the Boeotians and Phocians, and do our best to gain their assent likewise.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>'II. Concerning the treasures of the God, we will take <pb n="87"/> measures for the detection of evil-doers, both you and we, according to our ancestral customs, and any one else who will, according to his ancestral customs, proceeding always with right and equity.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Thus it seems good to the Lacedaemonians and their allies in respect of these matters.
				</p>
				<p>'III. It further seems good to the Lacedaemonians and their allies that, if the Athenians consent to a truce, either party shall remain within his own territory, retaining what he has. The Athenians at Coryphasium shall keep between Buphras and Tomeus. They shall remain at Cythera<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.53">4.53</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 4.54">54</bibl>.</note>, but shall not communicate with the Lacedaemonian confederacy, neither we with them nor they with us.

They shall also hold what they now hold near Troezen<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.45">4.45</bibl>.</note>, according to the agreement concluded between the Athenians and Troezenians.
				</p>
				<p>'IV.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At sea the Lacedaemonians and their allies may sail along their own coasts and the coasts of the confederacy, not in ships of war, but in any other rowing vessel whose burden does not exceed five hundred talents<note anchored="yes">About 12 tons.</note>.
				</p>
				<p>'V.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>There shall be a safe-conduct both by sea and land for a herald, with envoys and any number of attendants which may be agreed upon, passing to and fro between Peloponnesus and Athens, to make arrangements about the termination of the war and about the arbitration of disputed points.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And we will give satisfaction to you and you shall give satisfaction to us according to our ancestral customs, and determine disputed points by arbitration and not by arms.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>'These things seem good to us, the Lacedaemonians, and to our allies. But if you deem any other condition more just or honourable, go to Lacedaemon and explain your views; neither the Lacedaemonians nor their allies will reject any just claim which you may prefer.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>'And we desire you, as you desire us, to send envoys invested with full powers.
				</p>
				<p>'This truce shall be for a year.'
				</p>
				<p>'The Athenian people passed the following decree.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The prytanes were of the tribe Acamantis,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>During the armistice heralds and envoys are to pass to and fro and discuss the terms of a permanent peace.</hi></note> Phaenippus was the registrar, Niciades was the president.

					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>Accordingly the assembly agreed that the truce shall last for a year, beginning from this day, being the fourteenth day of the month Elaphebolion<note anchored="yes">March&mdash;April.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>During the year of truce ambassadors and heralds are to go from one state to another and discuss proposals for the termination of the war.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>The generals and prytanes shall proceed to hold another assembly, at which the people shall discuss, first of all, the question of peace, whatever proposal the Lacedaemonian embassy may offer about the termination of the war.

				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="119" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>To these terms the Lacedaemonians assented, and they and their allies took oath to the Athenians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Formal ratification of the truce.</hi></note> and their allies on the twelfth day of the Spartan month Gerastius.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Those who formally <pb n="89"/> ratified the truce were, on behalf of Lacedaemon, Taurus the son of Echetimidas, Athenaeus the son of Periclidas, Philocharidas the son of Eryxidaidas; of Corinth, Aeneas the son of Ocytus, Euphamidas the son of Aristonymus; of Sicyon, Damotimus the son of Naucrates, Onasimus the son of Megacles; of Megara, Nicasus the son of Cecalus, Menecrates the son of Amphidorus; of Epidaurus, Amphias the son of Eupa&iuml;das; and on behalf of Athens, Nicostratus the son of Diitrephes, Nicias the son of Niceratus, Autocles the son of Tolmaeus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Such were the terms of the armistice; during its continuance fresh negotiations for a final peace were constantly carried on.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="120" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the time when the envoys engaged in the negotiations were passing to and fro, Scion&egrave;,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Meanwhile Scion&egrave; revolts. Brasidas sails thither by night in a small boat, and having summoned the citizens, warmly praises their conduct.</hi></note> a town of Pallen&egrave;, revolted from the Athenians and joined Brasidas. The Scionaeans, according to their own account, sprang originally from Pellen&egrave; in Peloponnesus, but their ancestors returning from Troy were carried by the storm which the Achaean fleet encountered to Scion&egrave;, where they took up their abode.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Brasidas, when he heard of the revolt, sailed thither by night, sending before him a friendly trireme, while he himself followed at some distance in a small boat, thinking that if he met any vessel, not a trireme, larger than the boat, the trireme would protect him<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">au)tw=|;</foreign> or, reading <foreign lang="greek">au)th/,</foreign> 'the mere presence of the trireme would protect him.'</note>, while if another trireme of equal strength came up, it would fall, not upon the boat, but upon the larger vessel, and in the meantime he would be able to save himself.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He succeeded in crossing, and having summoned a meeting of the Scionaeans, he repeated what he had said at Acanthus and Toron&egrave;, adding that their conduct was deserving of the highest praise; for at a time when the Athenians were holding Potidaea and the isthmus of Pallen&egrave;, and they, being cut off from the mainland, were <pb n="90"/> as defenceless as if they had been islanders, they had taken the side of liberty unbidden. They were not such cowards as to wait until they were compelled to do what was obviously for their own interest; and this was a sufficient proof that they would endure like men any hardships, however great, if only their aspirations could be realized. He should reckon them the truest and most loyal friends of the Lacedaemonians, and pay them the highest honour.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="121" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Scionaeans were inspirited by his words; and one and all, even those who had previously<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Honours showered on Brasidas. He enters into communication with Mend and Potidaea.</hi></note> been against the movement, took courage and determined to bear cheerfully the burdens of the war. They received Brasidas with honour, and in the name of the city crowned him with a golden crown as the liberator of Hellas; many too, in token of their personal admiration, placed garlands on his head, and congratulated him, as if he had been a victor in the games.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the present he left a small garrison with them and returned, but soon afterwards again crossed the sea with a larger army, being desirous, now that he had the help of the Scionaeans, to attempt Mend&egrave; and Potidaea; he made sure that the Athenians would follow him with their ships to Pallen&egrave;, which they would consider an island; and he wished to anticipate them. Moreover he had entered into negotiations with these cities, and had some hope of their being betrayed to him.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="122" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But before he had executed his intentions, a trireme arrived conveying the ambassadors<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Meanwhile he is stopped in his career by the announcement of the truce, which had really been made before the revolt of Scion&egrave;. Brasidas refuses to give the place up. Fury of the Athenians.</hi></note> who went round to proclaim the truce, Aristonymus from Athens, and Athenaeus from Lacedaemon.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>His army then returned to Toron&egrave;, and the truce was formally announced to him. All the allies of the Lacedaemonians in Chalcidic&egrave; agreed to the terms.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Aristonymus the Athenian assented generally, but finding on <pb n="91"/> a calculation of the days that the Scionaeans had revolted after the conclusion of the truce, refused to admit them. Brasidas insisted that they were in time, and would not surrender the city. Whereupon Aristonymus despatched a message to Athens.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians were ready at once to make an expedition against Scion&egrave;. The Lacedaemonians, however, sent an embassy to them and protested that such a step would be a breach of the truce. They laid claim to the place, relying on the testimony of Brasidas, and proposed to have the matter decided by arbitration.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But the Athenians, instead of risking an arbitration, wanted to send an expedition instantly; for they were exasperated at discovering that even the islanders were now daring to revolt from them, in a futile reliance on the Lacedaemonian power by land.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The greater right was on their side; for the truth was that the Scionaeans had revolted two days after the truce was made. They instantly carried a resolution, moved by Cleon, to destroy Scion&egrave; and put the citizens to the sword; and, while abstaining from hostilities elsewhere, they prepared to carry out their intentions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="123" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the meantime Mend&egrave;, a city of Pallen&egrave; and an Eretrian colony, revolted from them.<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas receives the Mendaeans after the declaration of the truce.</hi></note> Brasidas felt justified in receiving the Mendaeans, although, when they came to him, the peace had unmistakably been declared, because there were certain points in which he too charged the Athenians with violating the treaty.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>His attitude encouraged them to take this bold step; they saw his zeal in the cause, which they likewise inferred from his unwillingness to hand over Scion&egrave; to the Athenians. Moreover the persons who negotiated with him were few in number, and having once begun, would not give up their purpose. For they feared the consequences of detection, and therefore compelled the multitude to act contrary to their own wishes.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the Athenians heard of the revolt they were more angry than ever, and made preparations against both cities.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Brasidas, <pb n="92"/> in expectation of their attack, conveyed away the wives and children of the Scionaeans<note anchored="yes">But cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.32">5.32 init.</bibl></note> and Mendaeans to Olynthus in Chalcidic&egrave;, and sent over five hundred Peloponnesian hoplites and three hundred Chalcidian targeteers, under the sole command of Polydamidas, to their aid. The two cities concerted measures for their defence against the Athenians, who were expected shortly to arrive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="124" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Brasidas and Perdiccas now joined their forces, and made a second expedition to Lyncus<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas and Perdiccas again invade the country of Arrhibaeus and defeat his army.</hi></note> against Arrhibaeus. Perdiccas led his own Macedonian army and a force of hoplites supplied by the Hellenic inhabitants of the country. Brasidas, beside the Peloponnesians who remained with him, had under his command a body of Chalcidians from Acanthus and other cities which supplied as many troops as they severally could. The entire heavy-armed Hellenic forces numbered about three thousand; the Chalcidian and Macedonian cavalry nearly a thousand, and there was also a great multitude of barbarians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They entered the territory of Arrhibaeus, and there finding the Lyncestians ready for battle, they took up a position in face of them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The infantry of the two armies was stationed upon two opposite hills, and between them was a plain, into which the cavalry of both first descended and fought. Then the Lyncestian heavy-armed troops began to advance from the hill, and forming a junction with their cavalry, offered battle. Brasidas and Perdiccas now drew out their army and charged; the Lyncestians were put to flight and many slain; the rest escaped to the high ground, and there remained inactive.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The conquerors raised a trophy, and waited for two or three days expecting the arrival of some Illyrians whom Perdiccas had hired. Then Perdiccas wanted, instead of sitting idle, to push on against the villages of Arrhibaeus, but Brasidas was anxious about Mend&egrave;, and apprehensive that the <pb n="93"/> Athenians might sail thither and do some mischief before he returned. The Illyrians had not appeared; and for both reasons he was more disposed to retreat than to advance.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="125" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But while they were disputing, the news arrived that the Illyrians had just betrayed Perdiccas<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Mean while some Illyrians who had been hired by Perdiccas join Arrhibaeus. This treachery causes panic and flight in the army of Perdiccas. The Illyrians pursue.</hi></note> and joined Arrhibaeus, whereupon they both resolved to retreat; for they were afraid of the Illyrians, who are a nation of warriors. Owing to the dispute nothing had been determined respecting the time of their departure. Night came on, and the Macedonians and the mass of the barbarians were instantly seized with one of those unaccountable panics to which great armies are liable<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.80">7.80 med.</bibl></note>. They fancied that the Illyrians were many times their real number, and that they were close at their heels; so, suddenly betaking themselves to flight, they hastened homewards. And they compelled Perdiccas, when he understood the state of affairs, which at first he did not, to go away without seeing Brasidas, for the two armies were encamped at a considerable distance from one another.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At dawn Brasidas, finding that Arrhibaeus and the Illyrians were coming on and that the Macedonians had already decamped, resolved to follow them. So he formed his hoplites into a compact square, and placed his light-armed troops in the centre. He selected the youngest of his soldiers to run out upon the enemy at whatever point the attack might be made.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He himself proposed during the retreat to take his post in the rear with three hundred chosen men, meaning to stop the foremost of his assailants and beat them off.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Before the Illyrians came up he exhorted his soldiers, as far as the shortness of the time permitted, in the following words:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="126" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>' Did I not suspect, men of Peloponnesus, that you may be terrified because you have been deserted by your <pb n="94"/> companions and are assailed by a host of barbarians, I should think only of encouraging and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas encourages his troops: You are few against many, but so you are at home; and you are fighting against barbarians. Do not be frightened by their outlandish cries and gestures. They make a vain flourish but have no discipline, and, if withstood quietly, retreat</hi></note> not of instructing you<note anchored="yes">Cp <bibl n="Thuc. 4.17">4.17 med.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 4.95">4.95 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.69">5.69 fin.</bibl></note> But now that we are left alone in the face of numerous enemies, I shall endeavour in a few words to impress upon you the main points which it concerns you to be informed of and to remember.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For you ought to fight like men not merely when you happen to have allies present, but because courage is native to you; nor should you fear any number of foreign troops. Remember that in the cities from which you come, not the many govern the few, but the few govern the many, and have acquired their supremacy simply by successful fighting. Your enemies are barbarians, and you in your inexperience fear them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But you ought to know, from your late conflicts with the Macedonian portion of them<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.124">4.124 med.</bibl></note>&mdash;and any estimate which I can form, or account of them which I receive from others, would lead me to infer&mdash;that they will not prove so very formidable.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>An enemy often has weak points which wear the appearance of strength; and these, when their nature is explained, encourage rather than frighten their opponents. As, on the other hand, where an army has a real advantage, the adversary who is the most ignorant is also the most foolhardy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Illyrians, to those who have no experience of them, do indeed at first sight present a threatening aspect. The spectacle of their numbers is terrible, their cries are intolerable, and the brandishing of their spears in the air has a menacing effect. But in action they are not the men they look, if their opponents will only stand their ground; for they have no regular order, and therefore are not ashamed of leaving any post in which they are hard pressed; to fly and to advance being alike <pb n="95"/> honourable, no imputation can be thrown on their courage. When every man is his own master in battle he will readily find a decent excuse for saving himself. They clearly think that to frighten us at a safe distance is a better plan than to meet us hand to hand; else why do they shout instead of fighting?
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>You may easily see that all the terrors with which you have invested them are in reality nothing; they do but startle the sense of sight and hearing. If you repel their tumultuous onset, and, when opportunity offers, withdraw again in good order, keeping your ranks, you will sooner arrive at a place of safety, and will also learn the lesson that mobs like these, if an adversary withstand their first attack, do but threaten at a distance and make a flourish of valour, although if he yields to them they are quick enough to show their courage in following at his heels when there is no danger.'
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="127" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Brasidas, having addressed his army, began to retreat. Whereupon the barbarians with loud<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Illyrians' finding that they make no impression, seize a pass on the border.</hi></note> noise and in great disorder pressed hard upon him, supposing that he was flying, and that they could overtake and destroy his troops.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But, wherever they attacked, the soldiers appointed for the purpose ran out and met them, and Brasidas himself with his chosen men received their charge. Thus the first onset of the barbarians met with a resistance which surprised them, and whenever they renewed the attack the Lacedaemonians received and repelled them again, and when they ceased, proceeded with their march. Thereupon the greater part of the barbarians abstained from attacking Brasidas and his Hellenes in the open country; but leaving a certain number to follow and harass them, they ran on after the fugitive Macedonians and killed any with whom they fell in. They then secured beforehand the narrow pass between two hills which led into the country of Arrhibaeus, knowing that this was the only path by which Brasidas could retreat. And as he was approaching the most <pb n="96"/> dangerous point of the defile they began to surround him in the hope of cutting him off.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="128" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Perceiving their intention, he told his three hundred to leave their ranks and run every man as<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Brasidas dislodges them, and they follow no further. Ill-feeling increases between Brasidas and Perdiccas.</hi></note> fast as he could to the top of one of the hills, being the one which he thought the barbarians would be most likely to occupy; and before a larger number of them could come up and surround them, to dislodge those who were already there<note anchored="yes">Adopting with Poppo the correction <foreign lang="greek">e)po/ntas.</foreign></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They accordingly attacked and defeated them; and so the main body of his army more easily reached the summit; for the barbarians, seeing their comrades defeated and driven from the high ground, took alarm; they considered too that the enemy were already on the borders of the country, and had got away from them, and therefore followed no further.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Brasidas had now gained the high ground and could march unmolested; on the same day he arrived at Arnissa, which is in the dominion of Perdiccas.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The soldiers were enraged at the hasty retreat of the Macedonians, and when they came upon carts of theirs drawn by oxen, or any baggage which had been dropped in the flight, as was natural in a retreat made in a panic and by night, they of themselves loosed the oxen and slaughtered them, and appropriated the baggage.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>From that time forward Perdiccas regarded Brasidas in the light of a foe, and conceived a new hatred of the Peloponnesians, which was not a natural feeling in an enemy of the Athenians. Nevertheless, disregarding his own nearest interests, he took steps to make terms with the one and get rid of the other.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="129" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Brasidas returned from Macedonia to Toron&egrave;, and when he arrived there found the Athenians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Nicias attempts to take Mend&egrave; but fails.</hi></note> already in possession of Mend&egrave;. Thinking it now too late to cross over to Pallen&egrave; and assist Mend&egrave; and Scion&egrave;, he remained quiet and guarded <pb n="97"/> Toron&egrave;.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>While he was engaged with the Lyncestians, the Athenians, having completed their preparations, had sailed against Mend&egrave; and Scion&egrave; with fifty ships, of which ten were Chian, conveying a thousand hoplites of their own, six hundred archers, a thousand Thracian mercenaries, and targeteers furnished by their allies in the neighbourhood. They were under the command of Nicias the son of Niceratus, and Nicostratus the son of Diitrephes.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Sailing from Potidaea and putting in near the temple of Poseidon they marched against the Mendaeans. Now they and three hundred Scionaeans who had come to their aid, and their Peloponnesian auxiliaries, seven hundred hoplites in all, with Polydamidas their commander, had just encamped outside the city on a steep hill.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Nicias, taking with him for the assault a hundred and twenty Methonaean light-armed troops, sixty select Athenian hoplites and all the archers, made an attempt to ascend the hill by a certain pathway, but he was wounded and failed to carry the position. Nicostratus with the remainder of his troops approaching the hill, which was hard of access, by another and more circuitous route was thrown into utter confusion, and the whole army of the Athenians were nearly defeated.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>So on this day the Athenians, finding that the Mendaeans and their allies refused to give way, retreated and encamped; and when night came on, the Mendaeans likewise returned to the city.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="130" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day the Athenians sailed round to the side of Mend&egrave; looking towards Scion&egrave;;<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Soon, in consequence of internal divisions, the place falls to the hands of the Athenians. The Peloponnesians are shut up in the citadel.</hi></note> they took the suburb, and during the whole of that day devastated the country. No one came out to meet them; for a division had arisen in the city, and on the following night the three hundred Scionaeans returned home.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>On the next day Nicias with half his army went as far as the Scionaean frontier and devastated the country on his march, while Nicostratus with the other half sat down before the upper gates of <pb n="98"/> Mend&egrave;, out of which the road leads to Potidaea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In this part of the city within the walls the Mendaeans and their allies chanced to have their arms deposited, and Polydamidas, arraying his forces in order of battle, was just exhorting the Mendaeans to go forth.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Some one of the popular faction answered in the heat of party that he would not go out, and that he did not care to fight, but no sooner had he uttered the words than he was seized by the Peloponnesian commander and roughly handled. Whereupon the people lost patience, caught up their arms, and made a furious rush upon the Peloponnesians and the opposite party who were in league with them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They soon put them to flight, partly because the onslaught was sudden, and also because the gates were thrown open to the Athenians, which greatly terrified them.

All the Peloponnesians who were not killed on the spot fled to the citadel, which they had previously kept in their own hands. Nicias had now returned and was close to the city, and the Athenians rushed into Mend&egrave; with their whole force. As the gates had been opened without any previous capitulation they plundered the town as if it had been stormed; and even the lives of the citizens were with difficulty saved by the efforts of the generals.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Mendaeans were then told that they were to retain their former constitution, and bring to trial among themselves any whom they thought guilty of the revolt. At the same time the Athenians blockaded the garrison in the Acropolis by a wall extending to the sea on either side and established a guard. Having thus secured Mend&egrave;, they proceeded against Scion&egrave;.

He himself too no longer wished the Peloponnesians to find their way into his country.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The oligarchy, perceiving their intention, called in the Syracusans and drove out the people, who separated and wandered up and down the island. The oligarchy then made an agreement with the Syracusans; and, leaving their own city deserted, settled in Syracuse, and received the privileges of citizenship.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Not long afterwards some of them grew discontented, and, quitting Syracuse, seized a place called Phocaeae, which was a part of the town of Leontini, and Bricinniae, a fortress in the Leontine territory. Here they were joined by most of the common people who had been previously driven out, and from their strongholds they carried on a continual warfare against Syracuse.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>It was the report of these events which induced the Athenians to send Phaeax to Sicily.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He sent an embassy to Perdiccas, desiring him to come with an army, according to the terms of the alliance<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.132">4.132 init.</bibl></note>, and another to Polles, the king of the Odomantian Thracians, who was to bring as many Thracian mercenaries as he could; he then remained quietly at Eion waiting for these reinforcements.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Brasidas, hearing of his movements, took up a counter-position on Cerdylium. This is a high ground on the right bank of the river, not far from Amphipolis, belonging to the Argilians. From this spot he commanded a view of the country round, so that Cleon was sure to be seen by him if,&mdash;as Brasidas fully expected,&mdash;despising the <pb n="106"/> numbers of his opponents, he should go up against Amphipolis without waiting for his reinforcements.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At the same time he prepared for a battle, summoning to his side fifteen hundred Thracian mercenaries and the entire forces of the Edonians, who were targeteers and horsemen; he had already one thousand Myrcinian and Chalcidian targeteers, in addition to the troops in Amphipolis.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>His heavy-armed, when all mustered, amounted to nearly two thousand, and he had three hundred Hellenic cavalry.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the soldiers were disgusted at their inaction, and drew comparisons between the generals; what skill and enterprise might be expected on the one side, and what ignorance and cowardice on the other. And they remembered how unwilling they had been to follow Cleon when they left Athens. He, observing their murmurs, and not wanting them to be depressed by too long a stay in one place, led his army forward.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He went to work in the same confident spirit which had already been successful at Pylos, and of which the success had given him a high opinion of his own wisdom. That any one would come out to fight with him he never even imagined; he said that he was only going to look at the place. If he waited for a larger force, this was not because he thought that there was any risk of his being defeated should he be compelled to fight, but that he might completely surround and storm the city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So he stationed his army upon a steep hill above Amphipolis, whence he surveyed with his own eyes the lake formed by the river Strymon, and the lie of the country on the side towards <pb n="107"/> Thrace.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He thought that he could go away without fighting whenever he pleased. For indeed there was no one to be seen on the walls, nor passing through the gates, which were all closed. He even imagined that he had made a mistake in coming up against the city without siege-engines; had he brought them he would have taken Amphipolis, for there was no one to prevent him.

He did not go out and draw up his forces in order of battle;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>he feared too much the inferiority of his own troops, not in their numbers (which were about equal to those of the enemy) but in quality; for the Athenian forces were the flower of their army, and they were supported by the best of the Lemnians and Imbrians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So he determined to employ a man&oelig;uvre, thinking that, if he showed them the real number and meagre equipment of his soldiers, he would be less likely to succeed than if he came upon them before there had been time to observe him, and when as yet they had no real grounds for their contempt of him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Selecting a hundred and fifty hoplites, and handing over the rest to Clearidas, he resolved to make a sudden attack before the Athenians retired, considering that, if their reinforcements should arrive, he might never again have an opportunity of fighting them by themselves. So he called together all his troops, and wishing to encourage them, and explain his plan, spoke as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Men of Peloponnesus, I need not waste words in telling you that we come from a land which has always been brave, and therefore free<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.28">4.28 med.</bibl></note>, and that you are Dorians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.124">1.124 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.77">6.77 med.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.5">7.5 fin.</bibl>: <bibl n="Thuc. 8.25">8.25 med.</bibl> and fin.</note>, and are about to fight with Ionians whom you have beaten again and again.

But you must understand my plan. The enemy are off their guard and ready to retreat. First, I will sally forth out of one gate and surprise them, then Clearidas from another, to complete their discomfiture.</hi></note> go into battle not with our whole force but with a handful of men.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Our enemies, if I am not mistaken, despise us; they believe that no one will come out against them, and so they have ascended the hill, where they are busy looking about them in disorder, and making but small account of us. 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now, he is the most successful general<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.29">3.29 fin.</bibl></note> who discerns most clearly such mistakes when made by his enemies, and adapts his attack to the character of his own forces, not always assailing them openly and in regular array, but acting according to the circumstances of the case.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And the greatest reputation is gained by those stratagems in which a man deceives his enemies most completely, and does his friends most service.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Therefore while they are still confident and unprepared, and, if I read their intentions aright, are thinking of withdrawing rather than of maintaining their ground, while they are off their guard and before they have recovered their presence of mind, I and my men will do our best to anticipate their retreat, and will make a rush at the centre of the army.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Then, Clearidas, when you see me engaged, and I hope striking panic into them, bring up your troops, the Amphipolitans and the other allies, open the gates suddenly, run out, and lose no time in closing with them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>This is the way to terrify them; for reinforcements are always more formidable to an enemy than the troops with which he is already engaged. 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Show yourself a brave man and a true Spartan, and do you, allies, follow manfully, remembering that readiness, obedience, and a sense of honour are the virtues of a soldier. To-day you have to choose between freedom and slavery; between the <pb n="109"/> name of Lacedaemonian allies, which you will deserve if you are brave, and of servants of Athens. For even if you should be so fortunate as to escape bonds or death, servitude will be your lot, a servitude more cruel than hitherto;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>and what is more, you will be an impediment to the liberation of the other Hellenes. Do not lose heart; think of all that is at stake; and I will show you that I can not only advise others, but fight myself.'

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He went to the spot and saw for himself; but, not wishing to hazard a regular engagement until his allies arrived, and thinking he could get away soon enough, he gave a general signal for retreat, at the same time ordering his forces to retire slowly on the left wing, which was the only direction possible, towards Eion.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They appeared to linger;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>whereupon he caused his own right wing to face round, and so with his unshielded side exposed to the enemy began to lead off his army. Meanwhile Brasidas, <pb n="110"/> seeing that the Athenians were on the move and that his opportunity was come, said to his companions and to the troops: 'These men do not mean to face us; see how their spears and their heads are shaking; such behaviour always shows that an army is going to run away.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Open me the gates there as I ordered, and let us boldly attack them at once.' Thereupon he went out himself by the gate leading to the palisade and by the first gate of the long wall which was then standing, and ran at full speed straight up the road, where, on the steepest part of the hill, a trophy now stands:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>he then attacked the centre of the Athenians, who were terrified at his audacity and their own disorder, and put them to flight. Then Clearidas, as he was bidden, sallied forth by the Thracian gate with his division, and charged the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The sudden attack at both points created a panic among them. Their left wing, which had proceeded some little way along the road towards Eion, broke off and instantly fled. They were already in full retreat, and Brasidas was going on to the right wing when he was wounded;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>the Athenians did not observe his fall, and those about him carried him off the field. The right wing of the Athenians was more disposed to stand. Cleon indeed, who had never intended to remain, fled at once, and was overtaken and slain by a Myrcinian targeteer. But his soldiers rallied where they were on the top of the hill, and repulsed Clearidas two or three times.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>They did not yield until the Chalcidian and Myrcinian cavalry and the targeteers hemmed them in and put them to flight with a shower of darts. And so the rout became general, and those of the Athenians who were not slain at once in close combat or destroyed by the Chalcidian horse and the targeteers, hard-pressed and wandering by many paths over the hills, made their way back to Eion.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Brasidas was carried safely by his followers out of the battle into the city. He was still alive, and knew that his army had conquered, but soon afterwards he died.

Both alike were inclined to peace. The Athenians had been beaten at Delium, and shortly afterwards at Amphipolis; and so they had lost that confidence in their own strength which had indisposed them to treat at a time when temporary success seemed to make their final triumph certain. They were afraid too that their allies would be elated at their disasters, and that more of them would revolt;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>they repented that after the affair at Pylos, when they might honourably have done so, they had not come to terms. The Lacedaemonians on the other hand inclined to peace because the course of the war had disappointed their expectations.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There was a time when they fancied that, if they only devastated Attica, they would crush the power of Athens within a few years<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.81">1.81 fin.</bibl></note>; and yet they had received a blow at Sphacteria such as Sparta had never experienced until then; their country was continually ravaged from Pylos and Cythera; the Helots were deserting, and they were always fearing lest those who had not deserted, <pb n="113"/> relying on the help of those who had, should seize their opportunity and revolt, as they had done once before.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Moreover, the truce for thirty years which they had made with Argos was on the point of expiring; the Argives were unwilling to renew it unless Cynuria were restored to them, and the Lacedaemonians deemed it impossible to fight against the Argives and Athenians combined. They suspected also that some of the Peloponnesian cities would secede and join the Argives, which proved to be the case.

				<p>
					<milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Upon these grounds both governments thought it desirable to make peace. The Lacedaemonians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The desire of the Lacedaemonians is the stronger because they want to recover the prisoners.</hi></note> were the more eager of the two, because they wanted to recover the prisoners taken at Sphacteria; for the Spartans among them were of high rank, and all alike related to themselves.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They had negotiated for their recovery immediately after they were taken, but the Athenians, in the hour of their prosperity, would not as yet agree to fair terms<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.41">4.41 fin.</bibl></note>.

Nicias desired, whilst he was still successful and held in repute, to preserve his good fortune; he would have liked to rest from toil, and to give the people rest; and he hoped to leave behind him to other ages the name of a man who in all his life had never brought disaster on the city. He thought that the way to gain his wish was to trust as little as possible to fortune, and to keep out of danger; and that danger would be best avoided by peace. Pleistoanax wanted peace, because his enemies were always stirring up the scruples of the Lacedaemonians against him, and insisting whenever misfortunes came that they were to be attributed to his illegal return from exile.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For they accused him and Aristocles his brother of having induced the priestess at Delphi, whenever Lacedaemonian envoys came to enquire of the oracle, constantly to repeat the same answer: 'Bring back the seed of the hero son of Zeus from a strange country to your own; else you will plough with a silver ploughshare':
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>until, after a banishment of nineteen years, he persuaded the Lacedaemonians to bring him home again with dances and sacrifices and such ceremonies as they observed when they first enthroned their kings at the foundation of Lacedaemon.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Negotiations were commenced during the winter. Towards spring the Lacedaemonians sounded a note of preparation by announcing to the allies that their services would be required in the erection of a fort; they thought that the Athenians would thereby be induced to listen to them. At the same time, after many conferences and many demands urged on both sides, an understanding was at last arrived at that both parties should give up what they had gained by arms. The Athenians, however, were to retain Nisaea, for when they demanded the restoration of Plataea the Thebans protested that they had obtained possession of the place not by force or treachery, but by agreement<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.52">3.52 init.</bibl></note>; to which the Athenians rejoined that they had obtained Nisaea in the same manner<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.69">4.69 fin.</bibl></note>.

They ought to pass a vote that any independent Hellenic city which would allow a settlement of disputes on equal terms might enter into a defensive alliance with them. The negotiation should not be carried on with the assembly, but the Argives should appoint a few commissioners having full powers, lest, if any states appealed to the people and were rejected, their failure should become public.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Argive magistrates, after hearing these proposals, referred them to their colleagues and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives, seeing that war with Lacedaemon was imminent and hoping to lead Pelo ponnesus, enter warmly into the idea.</hi></note> the people. The Argives passed a vote accordingly, and elected twelve commissioners; through these any of the Hellenes who pleased might make an alliance with them, except the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, who could only be admitted to the league with the sanction of the Argive people.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Argives were the more inclined to take this course because, their truce with the Lacedaemonians being about to expire, they saw that war was imminent. Moreover they were encourage <pb n="124"/> by the hope of becoming the leaders of Peloponnesus. For at this time the reputation of Lacedaemon had fallen very low; her misfortunes had brought her into contempt, while the resources of Argos were unimpaired.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Argives had not taken part in the war with Athens, and, being at peace with both parties, had reaped a harvest from them.

				<p>
					<milestone n="29" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The first to enter the alliance offered by the Argives to any Hellenes who were willing to<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Mantineans join&gt;the Argives. Great uncasiness is caused by the powers which the treaty gave to the Athenians and Lacedaemonians.</hi></note> accept it were the Mantineans and their allies, who joined through fear of the Lacedaemonians. For, during the war with Athens, they had subjected a part of Arcadia, which they thought that the Lacedaemonians, now that their hands were free, would no longer allow them to retain. So they gladly joined Argos, reflecting that it was a great city, the constant enemy of Sparta, and, like their own, governed by a democracy.
					
					
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When Mantinea seceded, a murmur ran through the other states of Peloponnesus that they must secede too; they imagined that the Mantineans had gone over to the Argives because they had better information than themselves, and also they were angry with the Lacedaemonians, chiefly on account of that clause in the treaty with Athens which provided that the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, if agreed, might add to or take away from it whatever they pleased<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18">5.18</bibl>. &sect; 12.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This clause aroused great uneasiness among the Peloponnesians, and made them suspect that the Lacedaemonians meant to unite with the Athenians in order to enslave them<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.20">4.20</bibl> fin,</note>; they argued that the power of altering the treaty ought to have been given only to the whole confederacy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Entertaining these fears they generally inclined towards Argos, and every state was eager to follow the example of Mantinea and form an alliance with her. <pb n="125"/>

					<milestone n="30" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Lacedaemonians perceived that great excitement prevailed in Peloponnesus, and that<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians accuse the Corinthians of deserting their alliance; to which the Corinthians reply that they cannot betray the Chalcidian cities.</hi></note> the Corinthians had inspired it and were themselves on the point of making a treaty with Argos. So they sent envoys to Corinth, desiring to anticipate what might happen. They laid the blame of having instigated the whole movement on the Corinthians, and protested that, if they deserted them and joined the Argives, they would be forsworn; indeed they were already much to blame for not accepting the peace made with Athens, although there was an article in their league which said that what the majority of the allies voted should be binding unless there was some impediment on the part of Gods or heroes.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the Corinthians had previously summoned those of the allies who, like themselves, had rejected the treaty: and, replying in their presence, they were unwilling to speak out and state their grievances, of which the chief was that the Lacedaemonians had not recovered for them Sollium<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.30">2.30 init.</bibl></note> or Anactorium<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.49">4.49</bibl>.</note>. But they pretended that they could not betray their allies in Thrace, to whom, when they originally joined in the revolt of Potidaea, they had sworn a separate oath<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.58">1.58</bibl>.</note>, and had afterwards renewed it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They denied therefore that they were violating the terms of the league by refusing to join in the peace with the Athenians; for, having sworn in the name of the Gods to their allies, they would be violating their oaths if they betrayed them:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>the treaty said 'unless there was some impediment on the part of Gods or heroes,' and this did appear to them to be an impediment of that nature. Thus far they pleaded their former oaths;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>as to the Argive alliance they would take counsel with their friends, and do whatever was right. So the Lacedaemonians returned home. Now there happened to be at that time Argive envoys present at Corinth who urged <pb n="126"/> the Corinthians to join the alliance without more delay, and the Corinthians told them to come to their next assembly.

Now the Eleans had a quarrel with the Lacedaemonians about the town of Lepreum.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A war had arisen between the Lepreans and certain Arcadian tribes, and the Eleans having been called in by the Lepreans came to assist them, on condition of receiving half their territory. When they had brought the war to a successful end the Eleans allowed the inhabitants of Lepreum to cultivate the land themselves, paying a rent of a talent to Olympian Zeus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Until the Peloponnesian war they had paid the talent, but taking advantage of the war they ceased to pay, and the Eleans tried to compel them. The Lepreans then had recourse to the Lacedaemonians, who undertook to arbitrate. The Eleans suspected that they would not have fair play at their hands; they therefore disregarded the arbitration and ravaged the Leprean territory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Nevertheless the Lacedaemonians went on with the case and decided that Lepreum was an independent state, and that the Eleans were in the wrong. As their award was rejected by the Eleans, they sent a garrison of hoplites to Lepreum.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Eleans, considering that the Lacedaemonians had taken into alliance a city which had seceded from them, appealed to the clause of the agreement which provided that whatever places any of the confederates had held previous to the war with Athens should be retained by them at its conclusion, and acting under a sense of injustice they now seceded to the Argives and, like the rest, entered into the alliance with them in the manner prescribed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Immediately afterwards the Corinthians and <pb n="127"/> the Chalcidians of Thrace joined; but the Boeotians and the Megarians agreed to refuse<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.38">5.38 init.</bibl></note>, and, jealously watched by the Lacedaemonians, stood aloof; for they were well aware that the Lacedaemonian constitution was far more congenial to their own oligarchical form of government than the Argive democracy.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>About this time too the Phocians and Locrians went to war.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Corinthians and Argives (who were now allies) came to Tegea, which they hoped to withdraw from the Lacedaemonian alliance, thinking that if they could secure so important a part of Peloponnesus they would soon have the whole of it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Tegeans however said that they could have no quarrel with the Lacedaemonians; and the Corinthians, who had hitherto been zealous in the cause, now began to cool, and were seriously afraid that no other Peloponnesian state would join them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Nevertheless they applied to the Boeotians and begged them to become allies of themselves and of the Argives, and generally to act with them; they further requested that they would accompany them to Athens and procure an armistice terminable at ten days' notice, similar to that which the Athenians and Boeotians had made with one another shortly after the conclusion of the fifty years' peace. If the Athenians did not agree, then the Corinthians demanded of the Boeotians that they should renounce the armistice and for the future make no truce <pb n="128"/> without them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Boeotians on receiving this request desired the Corinthians to say no more about alliance with the Argives. But they went together to Athens, where the Boeotians failed to obtain the armistice for the Corinthians, the Athenians replying that the original truce<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18">5.18</bibl>.</note> extended to them, if they were allies of the Lacedaemonians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Boeotians however did not renounce their own armistice, although the Corinthians expostulated, and argued that such had been the agreement. Thus the Corinthians had only a suspension of hostilities with Athens, but no regular truce.

They had been invited by a faction among the Parrhasians; and moreover they wanted to demolish a fortress in the Parrhasian town of Cypsela, threatening the Laconian district of Sciritis, which the Mantineans had built and garrisoned.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians devastated the country of the Parrhasians; and the Mantineans, leaving the custody of their own city to a force of Argives, themselves garrisoned the territory of their allies. But being unable to save either the fort of Cypsela or the cities of Parrhasia, they went home again;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>whereupon the Lacedaemonians, having demolished the fort and restored the independence of the Parrhasians, returned home likewise.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Fearing lest their own citizens who had been taken in the island and had delivered up their arms might expect to be slighted in consequence of their misfortune, and, if they retained the privileges of citizens, would attempt revolution, they took away the right of citizenship from them, although some of them were holding office at the time. By this disqualification they were deprived of their eligibility to offices, and of the legal right to buy and sell. In time, however, their privileges were restored to them.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>During the whole summer intercourse continued between the Athenians and Peloponnesians. But almost as soon as the peace was concluded both Athenians and Lacedaemonians began to mistrust one another, because the places mentioned in the treaty were not given up.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Lacedaemonians, who were to make restitution first, according to the lot, had not surrendered Amphipolis and the other less important places which they held, and had not made their allies in Chalcidic&egrave;, nor the Boeotians, nor the Corinthians accept the treaty, but only kept declaring that they would join the Athenians in coercing them if they continued to refuse. They even fixed a time, though they did not commit themselves in writing, within which those who would not come into the treaty were to be declared the enemies of both parties.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians, seeing that nothing was being really done, suspected the Lacedaemonians of dishonesty, and therefore they would not give up Pylos when the Lacedaemonians required it;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>they even repented that they had restored the prisoners taken at Sphacteria, and resolved to keep the other places <pb n="130"/> until the Lacedaemonians had fulfilled their part of the contract. The Lacedaemonians replied that they had done what they could. They had delivered up the Athenian prisoners who were in their hands, and had withdrawn their soldiers from Chalcidic&egrave;; they had neglected nothing which lay within their power. But they could not give up Amphipolis, of which they were not entirely masters;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>they would however try to bring the Boeotians and Corinthians into the treaty, to get back Panactum, and recover all the Athenian captives who were in the hands of the Boeotians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They still continued to insist on the restoration of Pylos, or at any rate on the withdrawal of the Messenians and Helots, now that the Lacedaemonians had withdrawn their troops from Chalcidic&egrave;; the Athenians might, if they liked, garrison the place themselves. After many long conferences held during the summer, they persuaded the Athenians to withdraw the Messenians, Helots, and Lacedaemonian deserters: these the Athenians settled at Cranii in Cephallenia.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>So during this summer there was peace and intercourse between Athens and Sparta.

					<milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the following winter the Ephors under whom the peace was concluded were succeeded<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>New Ephors come into office, who are in the interest of the war party. They suggest that the Boeotians shall first join the Argive and Corinthian alliance and then reconcile the Argives with the Lacedaemonians.</hi></note> by others, of whom some were actually opposed to it. During the winter, embassies from the allied states arrived at Sparta, including representatives of Athens, Boeotia, and Corinth. Much was said with no result. As the ambassadors were departing, Cleobulus and Xenares, the Ephors who were most desirous of renewing the war, entered into a private negotiation with the Boeotians and Corinthians, recommending them to unite as closely as possible, and suggesting that the Boeotians should first enter the Argive alliance and then try and make the Argives, as well as themselves, allies of the Lacedaemonians. The <pb n="131"/> Boeotians would thus escape the necessity of accepting the peace with Athens; for the Lacedaemonians would prefer the friendship and alliance of Argos to anything which they might lose by the enmity of Athens and the dissolution of the treaty. The two Ephors knew that a satisfactory alliance with Argos was an object which the Lacedaemonians always had at heart, perceiving as they did that it would enable them to carry on the war beyond the Peloponnesus with greater freedom.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At the same time they entreated the Boeotians to give up Panactum to the Lacedaemonians, in order that they might exchange it for Pylos, and so be in a better position for renewing the war with Athens.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Boeotians and Corinthians, having received from Xenares and Cleobulus and their<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Boeotians agree. Two Argives make a similar proposal to them.</hi></note> other Lacedaemonian friends the instructions which they were to convey to their own governments, returned to their respective cities.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>On their way home two Argives high in office, who had been waiting for them on the road, entered into communications with them, in the hope that the Boeotians, like the Corinthians, Eleans, and Mantineans, might join their alliance; if this could only be accomplished, and they could act together, they might easily, they said, go to war or make peace, either with Lacedaemon or with any other power.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Boeotian envoys were pleased at the proposal, for it so happened that the request of the Argives coincided with the instructions of their Lacedaemonian friends. Whereupon the Argives, finding that their proposals were acceptable to the Boeotians, promised to send an embassy to them, and so departed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the Boeotians returned home they told the Boeotarchs what they had heard, both at Lacedaemon and from the Argives who had met them on their way. The Boeotarchs were glad, and their zeal was quickened when they discovered that the request made to them by their friends in Lacedaemon fell in with the <pb n="132"/> projects of the Argives.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Soon afterwards the envoys from Argos appeared, inviting the Boeotians to fulfil their engagement. The Boeotarchs encouraged their proposals, and dismissed them; promising that they would send envoys of their own to negotiate the intended alliance.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="38" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the meantime the Boeotarchs and the envoys from Corinth, Megara, and Chalcidic&egrave; determined<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>But the negotiation afterwards fails through mismanagement.</hi></note> that they would take an oath to one another, pledging themselves to assist whichever of them was at any time in need, and not go to war or make peace without the consent of all. When they had got thus far, the Megarians and Boeotians, who acted together in the matter<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.31">5.31 fin.</bibl></note>, were to enter into an agreement with the Argives.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But before the oath was sworn, the Boeotarchs communicated their intentions to the Four Councils of the Boeotians, whose sanction is always necessary, and urged that oaths of alliance should be offered to any cities which were willing to join with them for mutual protection.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the Boeotian Councils, fearing that they might offend the Lacedaemonians if they swore alliance to the Corinthians who had seceded from them, rejected their proposals. For the Boeotarchs did not tell them what had passed at Lacedaemon, and how two of the Ephors, Cleobulus and Xenares, and their friends had advised them first to become allies of Argos and Corinth, and then to make a further alliance with the Lacedaemonians. They thought that the Councils, whether informed of this or not, would be sure to ratify their foregone decision when it was communicated to them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So the plan broke down, and the Corinthian and the Chalcidian envoys went away without effecting their purpose. The Boeotarchs, who had originally intended, if they succeeded, to do their best to effect an alliance with the Argives, gave up the idea of bringing this latter measure before the Councils, and did not fulfil their <pb n="133"/> promise of sending envoys to Argos; but the whole business was neglected and deferred.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="39" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same winter the Olynthians made a sudden attack upon Mecyberna<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18">5.18</bibl>. &sect; 7.</note> which was<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians, wanting to recover Pylos, persuade the Boeotians, with whom they make a separate alliance, to give up Panactum.</hi></note> held by an Athenian garrison, and took it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians and Lacedaemonians still continued to negotiate about the places which had not been restored, the Lacedaemonians hoping that, if the Athenians got back Panactum from the Boeotians, they might themselves recover Pylos. So they sent an embassy to the Boeotians, and begged of them to give up Panactum and the Athenian prisoners to themselves, that they might obtain Pylos in return for them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the Boeotians refused to give them up unless the Lacedaemonians made a separate alliance with them as they had done with the Athenians. Now the Lacedaemonians knew that, if they acceded to this request, they would be dealing unfairly with Athens, because there was a stipulation which forbade either state to make war or peace without the consent of the other; but they were eager to obtain Panactum and thereby, as they hoped, recover Pylos. At the same time the party who wished to break the peace with Athens were zealous on behalf of the Boeotians. So they made the alliance about the end of winter and the<note type="margin" anchored="yes">B.C. 420.</note> beginning of spring. The Boeotians at once commenced the demolition of Panactum; and the eleventh year of the war ended.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Immediately on the commencement of spring, the Argives, observing that the envoys<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives are alarmed at the seeming agreement of the Boeotians and Lacedaemonians, in which they suppose the Athenians to be included</hi></note> whom the Boeotians promised to send had not arrived, that Panactum was being demolished, and that a private alliance had been made between the Lacedaemonians and the Boeotians, began to fear that they would be isolated, and that the <pb n="134"/> whole confederacy would go over to the Lacedaemonians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For they thought that the Boeotians were demolishing Panactum by the desire of the Lacedaemonians, and had likewise been induced by them to come into the Athenian treaty; and that the Athenians were cognisant of the whole affair. But, if so, they could no longer form an alliance even with Athens, although they had hitherto imagined that the enmity of the two powers would secure them an alliance with one or the other, and that if they lost the peace with Lacedaemon, they might at any rate become allies of the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So in their perplexity, fearing that they might have to fight Lacedaemon, Tegea, Boeotia, and Athens, all at once, the Argives, who at the time when they were proudly hoping to be the leaders of Peloponnesus had refused to make a treaty with Lacedaemon, now sent thither two envoys, Eustrophus and Aeson, who were likely to be well regarded by the Spartans. For under present circumstances it seemed to them that nothing better could be done than to make a treaty with the Lacedaemonians on any terms whatever, and keep out of war.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="41" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The envoys arrived, and began to confer with the Lacedaemonians respecting the conditions<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>They send envoys to Lacedaemon, who, after making foolish stipulation about Cynuria, prepare to conclude a peace with the Lacedaemonians for fifty years.</hi></note> on which the peace should be made.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Argives at first demanded that the old quarrel about the border-land of Cynuria, a district which contains the cities of Thyrea and Anthen&egrave; and is occupied by the Lacedaemonians, should be referred to the arbitration of some state or person. Of this the Lacedaemonians would not allow a word to be said, but they professed their readiness to renew the treaty on the old terms. The Argives at length induced them to make a fifty years' peace, on the understanding however that either Lacedaemon or Argos, provided that neither city were suffering at the time from war or plague, might challenge the other to fight for the disputed territory, as <pb n="135"/> they had done once before when both sides claimed the victory; but the conquered party was not to be pursued over their own border.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Lacedaemonians at first thought that this proposal was nonsense; however, as they were desirous of having the friendship of Argos on any terms, they assented, and drew up a written treaty. But they desired the envoys, before any of the provisions took effect, to return and lay the matter before the people of Argos; if they agreed, they were to come again at the Hyacinthia and take the oaths. So they departed.

				<p>
					<milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Argives were thus engaged, the envoys of the Lacedaemonians&mdash;Andromedes, Phaedimus,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Indignation of the Athenians at the separate alliance and at the demolition of Panactum, which should have been restored intact.</hi></note> and Antimenidas&mdash;who were appointed to receive Panactum and the prisoners from the Boeotians, and give them up to the Athenians, found Panactum already demolished by the Boeotians. They alleged that the Athenians and Boeotians in days of old had quarrelled about the place, and had sworn that neither of them should inhabit it, but both enjoy the use of it. However, Andromedes and his colleagues conveyed the Athenian prisoners who were in the hands of the Boeotians to Athens, and restored them; they further announced the destruction of Panactum,<note anchored="yes">Or, 'maintaining that this,' i.e. its destruction, 'was equivalent to its restoration' (<foreign lang="greek">kai\ tou=to, th\n kaqai/resin, a)po/dosin ei(/nai</foreign>).</note> maintaining that they were restoring that too<note anchored="yes">Or, 'maintaining that this,' i.e. its destruction, 'was equivalent to its restoration' (<foreign lang="greek">kai\ tou=to, th\n kaqai/resin, a)po/dosin ei(/nai</foreign>).</note>, inasmuch as no enemy of the Athenians could any longer dwell there. Their words raised a violent outcry among the Athenians; they felt that the Lacedaemonians were dealing unfairly with them in two respects:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>first, there was the demolition of Panactum, which should have been delivered standing; secondly, they were informed of the separate alliance which the Lacedaemonians had made with the Boeotians, notwithstanding their promise that they would join in coercing those who did not accept the peace. They called to mind all their other <pb n="136"/> shortcomings in the fulfilment of the treaty, and conscious that they had been deceived, they answered the envoys roughly, and sent them away.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Foremost among them was Alcibiades the son of Cleinias, a man who would have been thought young in any other city, but was influential by reason of his high descent: he sincerely preferred the Argive alliance, but at the same time he took part against the Lacedaemonians from temper, and because his pride was touched. For they had not consulted him, but had negotiated the peace through Nicias and Laches, despising his youth, and disregarding an ancient connexion with his family, who had been their proxeni; a connexion which his grandfather had renounced, and he, by the attention which he had paid to the captives from Sphacteria, had hoped to have renewed. Piqued at the small respect which was shown to all his claims, he had originally opposed the negotiations;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>declaring that the Lacedaemonians were not to be trusted, and that their only object in making terms was that they might by Athenian help crush the Argives, and afterwards attack the Athenians themselves when they had no friends. As soon as the rupture occurred he promptly despatched a private message to the Argives, bidding them send an embassy as quickly as they could, together with representatives of Mantinea and Elis, and invite the Athenians to enter the alliance; now was the time, and he would do his utmost to assist them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Argives received his message, and thus became aware that the alliance with the Boeotians had been made without the consent of the Athenians, and that a violent quarrel had broken out between Athens and Lacedaemon.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They at once sent envoys to negotiate an alliance with the Athenians; the Eleans and Mantineans joined in the embassy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thither also came in haste three envoys from Lacedaemon, who were thought likely to be acceptable at Athens&mdash;Philocharidas, Leon, and Endius<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.6">8.6 med.</bibl></note>. They were sent because the Lacedaemonians were afraid that the Athenians in their anger would join the Argive alliance. The envoys while they demanded the restoration of Pylos in return for Panactum, were to apologise for the alliance with the Boeotians, and to explain that it was not made with any view to the injury of Athens.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="45" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They delivered their message to the council, adding that they came with full power to 'treat<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Alcibiades by a trick deceives the Lacedaemonian envoys. They are persuaded to deny in the assembly the powers which they have acknowledged in the council.</hi></note> about all differences. Alcibiades took alarm; he feared that if the envoys made a similar statement to the people they would win them over to their side, and that the Argive alliance would be rejected. Whereupon he devised the following trick:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>he solemnly assured the Lacedaemonians that if they would not communicate to the people the extent of their powers, he would restore Pylos to them, for he would use his influence in their favour instead of against them, and would arrange their other differences.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But his real aim all the time was to alienate them from Nicias, and to bring about an alliance with Argos, Elis, <pb n="138"/> and Mantinea, which he hoped to effect, if he could only discredit them in the assembly, and create the impression that their intentions were not honest, and that they never told the same tale twice. And he succeeded;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for when the envoys appeared before the assembly, and in answer to the question whether they had full powers replied 'No,' in direct contradiction to what they had said in the council, the patience of the Athenians was exhausted, and Alcibiades declaimed against the Lacedaemonians more violently than ever. The people were carried away and were ready to have in the Argives, and make an alliance with them and their confederates on the spot. But an earthquake occurred before the final vote was taken, and the assembly was adjourned.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The trick which had deceived the Lacedaemonians themselves completely deceived Nicias,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The trick deceives Nicias, who nevertheless continues to support the Lacedaemonians; he is himself sent to demand satisfaction at Sparta. The' negotiation fails.</hi></note> who could not understand the disavowal of their powers. Nevertheless in the assembly which met on the following day he still continued to maintain that the Athenians ought to prefer the friendship of Sparta, and not to conclude the Argive alliance until they had sent to the Lacedaemonians and ascertained their intentions. He urged them not to renew the war now, when it could be put off with honour to themselves and discredit to the Lacedaemonians; they were successful and should seek to preserve their good fortune as long as they could, but the Lacedaemonians were in a bad way, and would be only too glad to fight as soon as possible at all hazards.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And he prevailed on them to send envoys, of whom he was himself one, requiring the Lacedaemonians, if they were sincere in their intentions, to rebuild and restore Panactum, to restore Amphipolis, and to renounce their alliance with the Boeotians unless they came into the treaty, according to the stipulation which forbade the contracting parties to make a new alliance except by <pb n="139"/> mutual consent.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>If we, they added, had wanted to deal unfairly, we should already have accepted an alliance with the Argives, whose ambassadors have come hither to offer it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They entrusted the representation of these and their other grievances to Nicias and his colleagues, and sent them away to Sparta. These, on their arrival, delivered their message, which they concluded by declaring that, unless the Lacedaemonians renounced their alliance with the Boeotians in case the latter still refused to accept the peace, the Athenians on their part would enter into an alliance with the Argives and their confederates. The Lacedaemonians refused to give up their Boeotian alliance, Xenares the Ephor, with his friends and partisans, carrying this point. However they consented to ratify their former oaths at the request of Nicias, who was afraid that he would return without having settled anything, and would incur the blame of failure, as indeed he did, because he was held to be responsible for the original treaty with the Lacedaemonians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the Athenians learned on his return that the negotiations with Sparta had miscarried, they were furious; and acting under a sense of injustice, entered into an alliance with the Argives and their allies, whose ambassadors were present at the time, for Alcibiades had introduced them on purpose. The terms were as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="47" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'I.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Argives, Eleans, Mantineans, and their allies shall not make war against the Athenians and the allies over whom they rule, and the Athenians and their allies shall not make war against the Argives, Eleans, Mantineans, and their allies, in any sort or manner.
				</p>
				<p>'II.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Athens, Argos, Elis, and Mantinea shall be allied for a hundred years on the following conditions:&mdash;If <pb n="140"/> enemies invade the territory of the Athenians, the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall go to Athens and render the Athenians any assistance which they may demand of them, in the most effectual manner, and to the utmost of their power.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And if enemies shall invade the territory of the Eleans or Argives or Mantineans, the Athenians shall go to Argos, Mantinea, or Elis, and render these cities any assistance which they may demand of them, in the most effectual manner, and to the utmost of their power. If an enemy spoil their territory and depart, the offending city shall be an enemy to Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and Elis, and shall suffer at the hands of all these cities; and it shall not be lawful for any of them to make peace with the offending city, unless they have the consent of all the rest.
				</p>
				<p>' III.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The confederates shall not allow armed men to pass through their own territory, or that of the allies over whom they severally rule or may rule, or to pass by sea, with hostile intent, unless all the cities have formally consented to their passage&mdash;that is to say, Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and Elis.
				</p>
				<p>'IV.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The city which sends troops to help another shall supply them with provisions for thirty days, counting from the time of their arrival at the city which summons them; it shall also provide for them at their departure. But if the city which summons the troops wishes to employ them for a longer time, it shall give them provisions at the rate of three Aeginetan obols<note anchored="yes">About 6<hi>d.</hi></note> a day for heavy-armed and light-armed troops and for archers, and an Aeginetan drachma<note anchored="yes">About 1<hi>s.</hi></note> for cavalry. <pb n="141"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The city which sent for the troops shall have the command when the war is carried on in her territory. Or, if the allied cities agree to send out a joint expedition, then the command shall be equally shared among all the cities.

				<p>'VI.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The Athenians shall swear to the peace on their own behalf and on that of their allies; the Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, and their allies shall swear city by city. The oath shall be taken over full-grown victims, and shall be that oath which in the countries of the several contracting parties is deemed the most binding. The form of oath shall be as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p><q direct="unspecified"> I will be true to the alliance, and will observe the agreement in all honesty and without fraud or hurt;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>I will not transgress it in any way or manner.</q>'
				</p>
				<p>At Athens the senate and the home magistrates shall swear, and the prytanes shall administer<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Provisions for the ratification of the treaty and for changes.</hi></note> the oath; at Argos the senate and the council of eighty and the artynae shall swear, and the eighty shall administer the oath; at Mantinea the demiurgi and the senate and the other magistrates shall swear, and the theori and the polemarchs shall administer the oath. At Elis the demiurgi and the supreme magistrates and the six hundred shall swear, and the demiurgi and the guardians of the law shall administer the oath.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Thirty days before the Olympian games the Athenians shall go to Elis, to Mantinea, and to Argos, and renew the oath. Ten days before the Great Panathenaea the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall go to Athens and renew the oath.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>The agreement concerning the treaty and the oaths and the alliance shall be inscribed on a stone column in the Acropolis by the Athenians, by the Argives on a similar column in the temple of Apollo in the Agora, and by the Mantineans in the temple of Zeus in the Agora. They shall together erect at Olympia a brazen column at the coming Olympic games.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>And if these cities think it desirable to make any improvement in the treaty, they <pb n="142"/> shall add it to the provisions of it. Whatever the cities agree upon in common shall hold good.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="48" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus the peace and the alliance were concluded. Nevertheless the previous treaty between<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Corinthians refuse to join the Argives in the Athenian alliance.</hi></note> the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians was not on that account renounced by either party.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Corinthians, although allies of the Argives, took no part in the new alliance; they had already refused to swear to an offensive and defensive alliance which the Eleans, Argives, and Mantineans had previously made with one another. They said that they were satisfied with the original defensive alliance which bound them only to assist one another when attacked, but not to join in offensive movements.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thus the Corinthians severed themselves from the allies, and were again beginning to turn their thoughts to the Lacedaemonians.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="49" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the summer the Olympic games were celebrated, the Olympiad being that in which Androsthenes,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians are excluded from the Olympic games on the ground that they had attacked Phyrcus and entered Lepreum during the Olympic truce, and had refused to pay the fine imposed upon them.</hi></note> an Arcadian, won his first victory in the pancratium. The Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the Eleans, and so could neither sacrifice nor contend in the games. For they had refused to pay the fine which, according to Olympic law, the Eleans had imposed upon them, alleging that they had brought an armed force against the fortress of Phyrcus, and had introduced some hoplites of their own into Lepreum during the Olympic truce. The fine amounted to two thousand minae<note anchored="yes">About &pound;6,660.</note>, being two minae<note anchored="yes">About &pound;6 12s.</note> for each hoplite, which is the penalty imposed by the law.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians sent envoys who argued that the sentence was unjust, for at the time when their troops entered Lepreum the truce had not been announced at Lacedaemon.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The <pb n="143"/> Eleans replied that the truce (which they always proclaim first to themselves) had already begun with them, and that while they were quietly observing the truce, and expecting nothing less, the Lacedaemonians had treacherously attacked them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Lacedaemonians rejoined by asking why the Eleans proclaimed the truce at all at Lacedaemon if they considered them to have broken it already-they could not really have thought so when they made the proclamation; and from the moment when the announcement reached Lacedaemon all hostilities had ceased.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Eleans were still positive that the Lacedaemonians were in the wrong, and said that they would never be persuaded of the contrary. But if the Lacedaemonians were willing to restore Lepreum to them, they offered to remit their own share of the penalty, and pay on their behalf that part which was due to the God.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As this proposal was rejected, the Eleans made another: the Lacedaemonians need not give up<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Fear of a disturbance at the games, which turns out to be unfounded</hi></note> Lepreum if they did not like, but since they wanted to have access to the temple of Olympian Zeus, they might go up to his altar and swear before all the Hellenes that they would hereafter pay the fine.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But neither to this offer would the Lacedaemonians agree; they were therefore excluded from the temple and from the sacrifices and games, and sacrificed at home. The other Hellenes, with the exception of the people of Lepreum, sent representatives to Olympia.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Eleans however, fearing that the Lacedaemonians would force their way into the temple and offer sacrifice, had a guard of young men under arms; there came to their aid likewise a thousand Argives, and a thousand Mantineans, and certain Athenian horsemen, who had been awaiting the celebration of the festival at Argos.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The whole assembly were in terror lest the Lacedaemonians should come upon them in arms, and their fears were redoubled when Lichas, the son of Arcesilaus, was struck by the officers. As a Lacedaemonian he had been excluded <pb n="144"/> from the lists, but his chariot had been entered in the name of the Boeotian state, and was declared victorious. He had then come forward into the arena and placed a garland on the head of his charioteer, wishing to show that the chariot was his own. When the blows were given the anxiety became intense, and every one thought that something serious would happen.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But the Lacedaemonians did not stir, and the festival passed off quietly.
				</p>
				<p>The Olympic games being over, the Argives and their allies went to Corinth, and requested the Corinthians to join them. An embassy from Lacedaemon was also present. After much discussion nothing was concluded, for an earthquake broke up the assembly, and the envoys from the several states returned home. So the summer ended.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the following winter there was a battle between the Heracleans of Trachis and the Oenianians,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Heracleans defeated by the neighbouring tribes.</hi></note> Dolopes, Malians, and certain Thessalians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>These were neighboring tribes hostile to the place, for it was in order to control them that it was originally fortified; they had been enemies to it from the first, and had done it all the damage in their power. In this battle they gained a victory over the Heracleans. Xenares, son of Cnidis, the Lacedaemonian governor, and many of the Heracleans were killed. Thus ended the winter, and with it the twelfth year of the war.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="52" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the following summer the Boeotians took possession of Heraclea, which after<note type="margin" anchored="yes">B.C. 419.</note> the battle was in a miserable plight. They dismissed Hegesippidas, the Lacedaemonian<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Boeotians take possession of Heraclea.</hi></note> governor, for his misconduct<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.93">3.93 fin.</bibl></note>, and occupied the place themselves. They were afraid that now, when the Lacedaemonians were embroiled in Peloponnesus, the Athenians <pb n="145"/> would take it if they did not. But, for all that, the Lacedaemonians were offended.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>During the same summer, Alcibiades, the son of Cleinias, now one of the Athenian generals,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Activity of Alcibiades in Achaia and other parts of Peloponnesus.</hi></note> acting in concert with the Argives and their allies, led into Peloponnesus a small Athenian force of hoplites and archers. He collected other troops from the Athenian allies in the Peloponnese, and, marching with his army through the country, organised the affairs of the confederacy. Coming to Patrae, he persuaded the citizens to build walls reaching down to the sea. He was intending also to erect a fort himself on the promontory of Rhium in Achaia. But the Corinthians, Sicyonians, and others to whose interests the fort would have been injurious, came and prevented him.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="53" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same summer there broke out a war between the Epidaurians and the Argives. The<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives on a flimsy pretext make war against the Epidaurians</hi></note> occasion of the war was as follows:&mdash; The Epidaurians were bound to send a victim as a tribute for<note anchored="yes">Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">parapotami/wn,</foreign> 'the water meadows.'</note> the meadows<note anchored="yes">Or, reading <foreign lang="greek">parapotami/wn,</foreign> 'the water meadows.'</note> to the temple of Apollo Pythaeus over which the Argives had chief authority, and they had not done so. But this charge was a mere pretext; for in any case Alcibiades and the Argives had determined, if possible, to attach Epidaurus to their league, that they might keep the Corinthians quiet, and enable the Athenians to bring forces to Argos direct from Aegina instead of sailing round the promontory of Scyllaeum. So the Argives prepared to invade Epidauria, as if they wished on their own account to exact payment of the sacrifice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="54" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time the Lacedaemonians with their whole force, under the command of king Agis the son of Archidamus, likewise made an expedition. They marched as far as Leuctra, a place on their own frontier in the direction of Mount Lycaeum. No one, not even the cities <pb n="146"/> whence the troops came, knew whither the expedition was going.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But at the frontier the sacrifices<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians intending to make war upon Argos are deterred by the sacrifices and the sacred month. The latter obligation is evaded by the Argives, who go on with the expedition against Epidaurus</hi></note> proved unfavourable; so they returned, and sent word to their allies that, when the coming month was over, which was Carneus, a month held sacred by the Dorians, they should prepare for an expedition.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When they had retreated, the Argives, setting out on the twentyseventh day of the month before Carneus, and continuing the observance of this day during the whole time of the expedition, invaded and devastated the territory of Epidaurus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Epidaurians summoned their allies, but some of them refused to come, pleading the sanctity of the month; others came as far as the frontier of Epidauria and there stopped.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="55" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>While the Argives were in Epidauria, envoys from the different cities met at Mantinea, on the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Conference held at Mantinea. War between Epidaurus and Argos intermitted and then renewed.</hi></note> invitation of the Athenians conference was held, at which Euphamidas the Corinthian remarked that their words and their actions were at variance; for they were conferring about peace while the Argives and the Epidaurians with their allies were in the field against each other; first let envoys from both parties go and induce the armies to disband, and then they might come back and discuss the peace. His advice was approved;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>so they went straight to the Argives and compelled them to withdraw from Epidauria. But, when they re-assembled, they were still unable to agree, and the Argives again invaded and began to ravage the Epidaurian territory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Whereupon the Lacedaemonians likewise made an expedition as far as Caryae; but again the sacrifices at the frontier proved unfavourable, and they returned home.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Argives, after devastating about one-third of Epidauria, also returned home. One thousand Athenian hoplites, under the command of Alcibiades, had come to their aid. But hearing <pb n="147"/> that the Lacedaemonian expedition was over, and seeing that there was no longer any need of them, they departed. And so passed the summer.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="56" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the following winter the Lacedaemonians, unknown to the Athenians, sent by sea to Epidaurus<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians send a garrison by sea to Epidaurus. The Argives remonstrate with the Athenians for allowing the Lacedae monians to pass.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Argives came to the Athenians and complained that, notwithstanding the clause in the treaty which forbade the passage of enemies through the territory of any of the contracting parties<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.47">5.47</bibl>. &sect; 3.</note>, they had allowed the Lacedaemonians to pass by sea along the Argive coast. If they did not retaliate by replacing the Messenians and Helots in Pylos, and letting them ravage Laconia, they, the Argives, would consider themselves wronged.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians, by the advice of Alcibiades, inscribed at the foot of the column on which the treaty was recorded<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.8">5.8</bibl>. &sect; 4; 23. &sect; 5.</note> words to the effect that the Lacedaemonians had not abided by their oaths, and thereupon conveyed the Helots recently settled at Cranii<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.35">5.35 fin.</bibl></note> to Pylos that they might plunder the country, but they took no further steps.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>During the winter the war between the Argives and Epidaurians continued; there was no regular engagement, but there were ambuscades and incursions in which losses were inflicted, now on one side, now on the other.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At the end of winter, when the spring was approaching, the Argives came with scaling-ladders against Epidaurus, expecting to find that the place was stripped of its defenders by the war, and could be taken by storm. But the attempt failed, and they returned. So the winter came to an end, and with it the thirteenth year of the war.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="57" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In-the middle of the following summer, the Lacedaemonians, seeing that their Epidaurian allies were in great<note type="margin" anchored="yes">B.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Tegeans and the other Arcadian allies of the Lacedaemonians took part in the expedition. The rest of their allies, both from within and without the Peloponnesus, mustered at Phlius. Among the other contingents there came from Boeotia five thousand heavy-armed, and as many light-armed, five hundred cavalry, and attached to each horseman a foot-soldier; and from Corinth two thousand heavy-armed, while the Phliasians joined with their whole force, because the army was to assemble in their country.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Argives, having had previous notice of the Lacedaemonian preparations, and seeing that<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives and their allies march into Arcadia; there they find the Lacedaemonians isolated.

The Mantineans and their allies and three thousand Elean hoplites came to their aid.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They advanced to the territory of Methydrium in Arcadia, where they fell in with the Lacedaemonians. The two armies each occupied a hill, and the Argives, thinking that they now had the Lacedaemonians alone, prepared for action. But in the night Agis removed his forces unknown to them and went to join the allies at Phlius.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At dawn the Argives became aware of his departure, and moved first towards Argos, then to the Nemean road, by which they expected the Lacedaemonians and their allies to descend into the plain.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But Agis, instead of taking the road by which he was expected, led the Lacedaemonians, Arcadians, and Epidaurians by a more difficult path, and so made his way down; the Corinthians, Pellenians, and Phliasians went by another <pb n="149"/> steep pass; the Boeotians, Megarians, and Sicyonians he commanded to descend by the Nemean road, where the Argives had taken up their position, in order that, if the Argives should return and attack his own division of the army in the plain, they might be pursued and harassed by their cavalry.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Having made these dispositions, and having come down into the plain, he began to devastate Saminthus and the neighbourhood.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="59" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>It was now daylight, and the Argives, who had become aware of his movements, quitted Nemea<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives are surrounded by the enemy, who enter the Argive territory in three divisions; they are in the utmost danger, of which they are wholly unconscious, when two of their leading men propose a truce.</hi></note> and went in search of the enemy. Encountering the Phliasian and Corinthian forces, they killed a few of the Phliasians, and had rather more of their own troops killed by the Corinthians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Boeotians, Megarians, and Sicyonians marched as they were ordered towards Nemea, but found the Argives no longer there, for by this time they had descended from the high ground, and seeing their lands ravaged were drawing up their troops in order of battle.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Lacedaemonians prepared to meet them. The Argives were now surrounded by their enemies; for on the side of the plain the Lacedaemonians and their division of the army cut them off from the city; from the hills above they were hemmed in by the Corinthians, Phliasians and Pellenians, towards Nemea by the Boeotians, Sicyonians, and Megarians, and in the absence of the Athenians, who alone of their allies had not arrived, they had no cavalry.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The main body of the Argives and their allies had no conception of their danger. They thought that their position was a favourable one, and that they had cut off the Lacedaemonians in their own country and close to the city of Argos.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But two of the Argives, Thrasyllus one of the five generals, and Alciphron the proxenus of the Lacedaemonians, came to Agis when the armies were on the point of engaging, and urged him privately not to fight; the Argives were ready to <pb n="150"/> offer and accept a fair arbitration, if the Lacedaemonians had any complaint to make of them; they would gladly conclude a treaty, and be at peace for the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="60" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>These Argives spoke of their own motion; they had no authority from the people; and Agis,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The truce is accepted by Agis.

He made a treaty with the Argives for four months, within which they were to execute their agreement, and then, without saying a word to any of the allies, he at once withdrew his army.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians and their allies followed Agis out of respect for the law, but they blamed him severely among themselves. For they believed that they had lost a glorious opportunity; their enemies had been surrounded on every side both by horse and foot;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and yet they were returning home having done nothing worthy of their great effort.&mdash;No finer Hellenic army had ever up to that day been collected; its appearance was most striking at Nemea while the host was still one; the Lacedaemonians were there in their full strength; arrayed by their side were Arcadians, Boeotians, Corinthians, Sicyonians, Pellenians, Phliasians, and Megarians, from each state chosen men&mdash;they might have been thought a match not only for the Argive confederacy, but for another as large.&mdash;So the army returned and dispersed to their homes, much out of humour with Agis.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Argives on their part found still greater fault with those who had made the peace,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>and the Argives still greater.</hi></note> unauthorised by the people;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>they too thought that such an opportunity would never recur, and that it was the Lacedaemonians who had escaped, for the combat would have taken place close to their own city, and they had numerous and brave allies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And so, as they were retreating and had reached the bed of the Charadrus, <pb n="151"/> where they hold military trials before they enter the city, they began to stone Thrasyllus. He saved his life by flying to the altar, but they confiscated his property.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Soon afterwards there arrived an Athenian reinforcement of a thousand hoplites and three<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Alcibiades and the allies refuse to acknowledge the truce.

The Argives, although dissatisfied with the truce, were reluctant to break it, so they bade them depart; and, when they desired to treat, they would not present them to the assembly until they were compelled by the importunity of their Mantinean and Elean allies, who had not yet left Argos.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians then, speaking by the mouth of their ambassador Alcibiades, told the Argives in the presence of the rest that they had no right to make the truce at all independently of their allies, and that, the Athenians having arrived at the opportune moment, they should fight at once.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The allies were convinced, and they all, with the exception of the Argives, immediately marched against Orchomenus in Arcadia; the Argives, though consenting, did not join them at first, but they came afterwards.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The united forces then sat down before Orchomenus, which they assailed repeatedly; they were especially anxious to get the place into their hands, because certain Arcadian hostages had been deposited there by the Lacedaemonians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Orchomenians, considering the weakness of their fortifications and the numbers of the enemy, and beginning to fear that they might perish before any one came to their assistance, agreed to join the alliance: they were to give hostages of their own to the Mantineans, and to deliver up those whom the Lacedaemonians had deposited with them.

				<p>
					<milestone n="62" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The allied force, now in possession of Orchomenus, considered against what town they should next proceed; the Eleans wanted them to attack Lepreum, the Mantineans Tegea. The Argives and Athenians sided with <pb n="152"/> the Mantineans;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>whereupon the Eleans, indignant that they had not voted for the expedition<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives and their allies now quarrel among themselves. The Eleans return home; the rest of the allies prepare to attack Tegea.</hi></note> against Lepreum, returned home, but the remainder of the allies made preparations at Mantinea to attack Tegea.

For it was no easy matter to bring together a body of allies so numerous and brave.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But when the news came that Orchomenus had fallen they were furious, and in a fit of passion, which was unlike their usual character, they had almost made up their minds to raze his house and fine him in the sum of a hundred thousand drachmae<note anchored="yes">About &pound;4,600, supposing the sum to be given in Aeginetan drachmae.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But he besought them not to punish him, promising that he would atone for his error by some brave action in the field; if he did not keep his word they might do as they pleased with him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So they did not inflict the fine or demolish his house, but on this occasion they passed a law which had no precedent in their history, providing that ten Spartans should be appointed his counsellors<note anchored="yes">Cp. the cases of Cnemus, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.85">2.85 init.</bibl>; Alcidas, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.69">3.69</bibl> med.; Astyochus, <bibl n="Thuc. 8.39">8.39 med.</bibl>, for a somewhat similar proceeding.</note>, who were to give their consent before he could lead the army out of the city.

				<p>
					<milestone n="64" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile word was brought from their friends in Tegea that they must come at once, since Tegea was about to secede and had almost seceded already to the Argives and their allies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Whereupon the Lacedaemonians <pb n="153"/> led out their whole force, including the Helots, with an alacrity which they had never before<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians again lead forth their whole force to the support of Tegea.</hi></note> displayed, and marched to Orestheum in Maenalia.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They told their Arcadian allies to assemble and follow them at once to Tegea. When the army had proceeded as far as Orestheum they dismissed the sixth part, including the elder and the younger men, who were to keep guard at home, and arrived at Tegea with the rest of their troops. Not long afterwards the Arcadian allies appeared. They had also sent to the Corinthians, and to the Boeotians, Phocians, and Locrians, whom they summoned to meet them with all speed at Mantinea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But the notice given to the allies was short, and their passage was barred by the enemies' country, which they could not easily traverse unless they waited for one another and came all together. However, they did their best.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Lacedaemonians, accompanied by their Arcadian allies, invaded the territory of Mantinea, and pitching their camp near the temple of Heracles, wasted the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the Argives and their allies saw the enemy they took up a steep and hardly assailable<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives occupy a hill. The Lacedaemonians charge them. Agis nearly commits a second fatal error, but is induced to withdraw his troops.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians instantly charged them, and had proneeded within a javelin or stone's throw when one of the elder Spartans, seeing the strength of the ground which they were attacking, called out to Agis that he was trying to mend one error by another; he meant to say that his present mistaken forwardness was intended to repair the discredit of his former retreat.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And, either in consequence of this exclamation or because<note anchored="yes">Or, 'some new thought, or the same thought (which had occurred to the Spartan elder), suddenly struck him.'</note> some new thought suddenly struck him<note anchored="yes">Or, 'some new thought, or the same thought (which had occurred to the Spartan elder), suddenly struck him.'</note>, he <pb n="154"/> withdrew his army in haste without actually engaging. He marched back into the district of Tegea, and proceeded to turn the water into the Mantinean territory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This water is a constant source of war between the Mantineans and Tegeans, on account of<note anchored="yes">Or, 'the harm which is commonly done.'</note> the great harm which is done<note anchored="yes">Or, 'the harm which is commonly done.'</note> to one or other of them according to the direction which the stream takes. Agis hoped that the Argives and their allies when they heard of this movement would come down from the hill and try to prevent it; he could then fight them on level ground.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Accordingly he stayed about the water during the whole day, diverting the stream. Now the Argives and their confederates were at first amazed at the sudden retreat of their enemies when they were so near, and did not know what to think. But when the Lacedaemonians had retired and disappeared from view, and they found themselves standing still and not pursuing, they once more began to blame their own generals. Their cry was that they had already let the Lacedaemonians slip when they had them at a disadvantage close to Argos; and now they were running away and no one pursued them;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>the enemy were just allowed to escape, while their own army was quietly betrayed. The commanders were at first bewildered by the outcry; but soon they quitted the hill, and advancing into the plain took up a position with the intention of attacking.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="66" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day the Argives and their allies drew themselves up in the order in which they<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians are surprised. Organistation of their army.</hi></note> intended to fight should they meet with the enemy. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians returned from the water to their old encampment near the temple of Heracles. There they saw quite close to them the Argive army, which had moved on from the hill, and was already in order of battle.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Never within their recorded history were the Lacedaemonians more dismayed than at that instant; not a moment was to be <pb n="155"/> lost: immediately they hurried every man to his own place, the king Agis, according to the law, directing their several movements.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For when the king is in the field nothing is done without him; he in person gives general orders to the polemarchs, which they convey to the commanders of divisions; these again to the commanders of fifties, the commanders of fifties to the commanders of enomoties, and these to the enomoty.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In like manner any more precise instructions are passed down through the army, and quickly reach their destination. For almost the whole Lacedaemonian army are officers who have officers under them, and the responsibility of executing an order devolves upon many.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="67" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On this occasion the Sciritae formed the left wing, a position to which in the Lacedaemonian army they have a peculiar and exclusive right. Next to the Sciritae were placed the troops who had served in Chalcidice under Brasidas, and with them the Neodamodes. Next in order were ranged the several divisions of the Lacedaemonian army, and near them the Heraeans of Arcadia; next the Maenalians, and on the right wing the Tegeans, and a few Lacedaemonians at the extreme point of the line;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>the cavalry were placed on both wings. This was the order of the Lacedaemonians. On the right wing of the enemy were placed the Mantineans, because the action was to be fought in their country, and next to them such of the Arcadians as were their allies. Then came the select force of a thousand Argives, whom the city had long trained at the public expense in military exercises; next the other Argives, and after them their allies, the Cleonaeans and Orneatae. Last of all the Athenians occupied the left wing, supported by their own cavalry.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the order and composition of the two armies:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>that of the Lacedaemonians appeared to be the larger, but what the number was, either of the several contingents, or of the total on either side, I cannot pretend exactly to <pb n="156"/> say, for the secrecy of the government did not allow the strength of the Lacedaemonian army<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Numbers of neither army could be accurately ascertained.</hi></note> to be known, and the numbers on the other side were thought to be exaggerated by the vanity natural to men when speaking of their own forces.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>However, the following calculation may give some idea of the Lacedaemonian numbers. There were seven divisions in the field, besides the Sciritae who numbered six hundred; in each division there were four pentecosties, in every pentecosty four enomoties, and of each enomoty there fought in the front rank four. The depth of the line was not everywhere equal, but was left to the discretion of the generals commanding divisions; on an average it was eight deep. The front line consisted of four hundred and forty-eight men, exclusive of the Sciritae<note anchored="yes">The whole number of the Lacedaemonians is 3584 without the Sciritae, or with them 4184.</note>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="69" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The two armies were now on the point of engaging, but first the several commanders addressed<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Mantineans, Argives, and Athenians received eloquent exhortations from their leaders. But the Lacedaemonians had no need of them.</hi></note> exhortations to their own contingents. The Mantineans were told that they were not only about to fight for their country, but would have to choose between dominion<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.29">5.29 init.</bibl></note> or slavery; having tried both, did they want to be deprived of the one, or to have any more acquaintance with the other? The Argives were reminded that in old times they had been sovereign, and more recently the equals of Sparta, in Peloponnesus; would they acquiesce for ever in the loss of their supremacy, and lose at the same time the chance of revenging themselves upon their hateful neighbours, who had wronged them again and again? The Athenians were told that it was glorious to be fighting side by side with a host of brave allies and to be found equal to the bravest. If they could conquer a Lacedaemonian army in <pb n="157"/> Peloponnesus, they would both extend and secure their dominion, and need never fear an invader again.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Such were the exhortations addressed to the Argives and to their allies. But the Lacedaemonians, both in their warsongs and in the words which a man spoke to his comrade, did but remind one another of what their brave spirits knew already<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.17">4.17</bibl> med, 95 init., 126 init.</note>. For they had learned that true safety was to be found in long previous training, and not in eloquent exhortations uttered when they were going into action.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="70" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At length the two armies went forward. The Argives and their allies advanced to the charge<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Argives march into battle with great fury; the Lacedae monians quietly to the sound of music.</hi></note> with great fury and determination. The Lacedaemonians moved slowly and to the music of many flute-players, who were stationed in their ranks, and played, not as an act of religion, but in order that the army might march evenly and in true measure, and that the line might not break, as often happens in great armies when they go into battle.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="71" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before they had actually closed a thought occurred to Agis. All armies, when engaging, are<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Agis tries to extend his left wing by moving the Sciritae further off, thus leaving a gap which he endeavours to fill by a detachment from his right.</hi></note> apt to thrust outwards their right wing; and either of the opposing forces tends to outflank his enemy's left with his to outflank his enemy's left with his own right, because every soldier individually fears for his exposed side, which he tries to cover with the shield of his comrade on the right, conceiving that the closer he draws in the better he will be protected. The first man in the front rank of the right wing is originally responsible for the deflection, for he always wants to withdraw from the enemy his own exposed side, and the rest of the army, from a like fear, follow his example. In this battle the line of the Mantineans, who were on the Argive right wing, extended far <pb n="158"/> beyond the Sciritae:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and still further, in proportion as the army to which they belonged was the larger, did the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans on the Lacedaemonian right wing extend beyond the Athenian left.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Agis was afraid that the Lacedaemonian left wing would be surrounded, and, thinking that the Mantineans outflanked them too far, he signalled to the Sciritae and the old soldiers of Brasidas to make a lateral movement away from his own division of the army, and so cover the line of the Mantineans: to fill up the space thus left vacant he ordered Hipponoidas and Aristocles, two of the polemarchs, to bring up their two divisions from the right wing, thinking that he would still have more troops than he wanted there, and that he would thus strengthen that part of his line which was opposed to the Mantineans.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="72" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>He had given the order at the last moment, when the charge had already begun, and Aristocles<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>But the detachment refusing to stir, the Mantineans and Argives rush through the gap and defeat the left wing of the Lacedaemonians.</hi></note> and Hipponoidas refused to make the movement. (For the cowardice which they were supposed to have shown on this occasion they were afterwards banished from Sparta.) The enemy were upon him before he was ready, and as the two divisions would not advance into the place left by the Sciritae, Agis ordered the Sciritae themselves to close up, but he found that it was too late, and that they also were now unable to fill the vacant space.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Then the Lacedaemonians showed in a remarkable manner that, although utterly failing in their tactics, they could win by their courage alone.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When they were at close quarters with the enemy, the Mantinean right put to flight the Sciritae and the soldiers of Brasidas. The Mantineans and their allies and the thousand chosen Argives dashed in through the gap in the Lacedaemonian ranks and completed their defeat; they surrounded and routed them, and so drove them to their waggons, where they killed some of the elder men who were appointed to guard them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In this part of <pb n="159"/> the field the Lacedaemonians were beaten, but elsewhere, and especially in the centre of the army, where the king Agis and the three hundred Knights, as they are called, who attend him, were posted, they charged the elder Argives, the Five Divisions as they are termed, the Cleonaeans, Orneatae, and those of the Athenians who were ranged with them, and put them to flight. Most of them never even struck a blow, but gave way at once on the approach of the Lacedaemonians; some were actually trodden under foot, being overtaken by the advancing host.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="73" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the allies and the Argives had yielded in this quarter, they became severed from their<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Danger of the Athenians, which is only averted by the retirement of the Lacedaemonians on the right wing who go to the assistance of their own defeated troops on the left. The Lacedaemonians win the battle, but do not pursue far.</hi></note> comrades to the left as well as to the right of the line; meanwhile the extended right wing of the Lacedaemonians and the Tegeans threatened to surround the Athenians. They were in great danger; their men were being hemmed in at one point and were already defeated at another;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and but for their cavalry, which did them good service, they would have suffered more than any other part of the army.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Just then Agis, observing the distress of the Lacedaemonian left wing, which was opposed to the Mantineans and the thousand select Argives, commanded his whole forces to go and assist their own defeated troops. Whereupon the Athenians, when their opponents turned aside and began to move away from them, quietly made their escape, and along with them the defeated Argives. The Mantineans and their allies and the chosen force of Argives, seeing their army conquered and the Lacedaemonians bearing down upon them, gave up all thoughts of following up their advantage and fled.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The loss incurred by the chosen Argives was small, that of the Mantineans more serious. The pursuit was not fierce nor the flight protracted, for the Lacedaemonians fight long and refuse to move until they <pb n="160"/> have put an enemy to flight, but, having once defeated him, they do not follow him far or long.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="74" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus, or nearly thus, went the battle, by far the greatest of Hellenic battles which had taken<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Numbers of the slain.</hi></note> place for a long time, and fought by the most famous cities.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians exposed the arms of the enemies' dead, and made a trophy of them; they then plundered the bodies, and taking up their own dead carried them away to Tegea, where they were buried; the enemies' dead they gave back under a flag of truce.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Of the Argives, Orneatae, and Cleonaeans there fell seven hundred, of the Mantineans two hundred, and of the Athenians, including their settlers in Aegina<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.27">2.27 med.</bibl></note>, two hundred, and both their generals. As to the Lacedaemonians, their allies were not hard pressed and did not incur any considerable loss; how many of themselves fell it was hard to ascertain precisely, but their dead are reported to have numbered about three hundred.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="75" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Just before the battle, Pleistoanax, the other king, led out of Sparta a reinforcement composed<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians go home and celebrate the Carnea.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians sent and countermanded the reinforcements from Corinth and beyond the Isthmus; they then went home themselves and, dismissing the allies, celebrated the festival of the Carnea, for which this happened to be the season.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thus, by a single action, they wiped out the charge of cowardice, which was due to their misfortune at Sphacteria, and of general stupidity and sluggishness, then current against them in Hellas. They were now thought<note anchored="yes">Or, 'to have incurred disgrace through a mishap.'</note> to have been hardly used by fortune<note anchored="yes">Or, 'to have incurred disgrace through a mishap.'</note>, but in character to be the same as ever.

				<p>The very day before the battle, the Epidaurians with <pb n="161"/> their whole force invaded the territory of Argos, expecting to find it deserted;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>they killed many of the men who had been left to protect the country when the main army took the field<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">e)celqo/ntwn au)tw=n.</foreign></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After the battle three thousand Elean hoplites came to the aid of the Mantineans, and a second detachment of a thousand from Athens. While the Lacedaemonians were still celebrating the Carnea they marched all together against Epidaurus, and began to surround the city with a wall, dividing the task among them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The other allies did not persevere, but the Athenians soon completed their own portion, the fortification of the promontory on which the temple of Here stood. In this part of the works a garrison was left, to which all furnished a contingent; they then returned to their several cities. So the summer ended.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>There had always been some partisans of Lacedaemon in the city, who had wanted to put down the democracy. After the battle it was far easier for this party to draw the people into an alliance with Sparta. Their intention was to make first of all a peace, and then an alliance, with the Lacedaemonians, and, having done so, to set upon the people.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And now there arrived in Argos, Lichas the son of Arcesilaus, the proxenus of the Argives, offering them one of two alternatives: There were terms of peace, but they might also have war if they pleased. A warm discussion ensued, for Alcibiades happened to be in the place. The party which had been intriguing for the Lacedaemonians, and had at last ventured to come forward openly, persuaded the Argives to accept the terms of peace, which were as follows:&mdash; <pb n="162"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>they agreed also that they would not enter into alliance or make war except in concert. They were very energetic in all their doings, and jointly sent ambassadors to the Chalcidian cities in Thrace, and to Perdiccas whom they persuaded to join their confederacy. He did not, however, immediately desert the Athenians, but he was thinking of deserting, being influenced by the example of the Argives; for he was himself of Argive descent<note anchored="yes">See note.</note>.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Next the Lacedaemonians and the Argives, each providing a thousand men, made a joint expedition: first the Lacedaemonians went alone and set up a more oligarchical government at Sicyon; then they and the Argives uniting their forces put down the democracy at Argos, and established an oligarchy which was in the interest of the Lacedaemonians.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The popular party at Argos, reconstituting themselves by degrees, plucked up courage, and, taking advantage of the festival of the Gymnopaediae at Lacedaemon, attacked the oligarchy. A battle took place in the city: the popular party won, and either killed or expelled their enemies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The oligarchy had sought help from their friends the Lacedaemonians, but they did not come for some time; at last they put off the festival and went to their aid. When they arrived at Tegea they heard that the oligarchs had been <pb n="166"/> defeated.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They would proceed no further, but in spite of the entreaties of the fugitives returned home and resumed the celebration of the festival.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>they then resolved to send an expedition to Argos, but delays occurred and time was lost. Meanwhile the democracy at Argos, fearing the Lacedaemonians, and again courting the Athenian alliance in which their hopes were centred, began building Long Walls to the sea, in order that if they were blockaded by land they might have the advantage, with Athenian help, of introducing provisions by water.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Certain other states in Peloponnesus were privy to this project. The whole Argive people, the citizens themselves, their wives, and their slaves, set to work upon the wall, and the Athenians sent them carpenters and masons from Athens. So the summer ended.

Agis the son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, led the army.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The support which they expected to find at Argos was not forthcoming; the walls however, which were not yet finished, were captured by them and razed to the ground; they also seized Hysiae, a place in the Argive territory, and put to death all the free men whom they caught; they then withdrew, and returned to their several cities.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Next the Argives in their turn made an expedition into the territory of Phlius, which they ravaged because the Phliasians had received the Argive refugees, most of whom had settled there;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>they then returned home. <pb n="167"/>

				<p>During the same winter the Athenians blockaded Perdiccas in Macedonia, complaining<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians blockade Perdiccas.</hi></note> of the league which he had made with the Argives and Lacedaemonians; and also that he had been false to their alliance when they had prepared to send an army against the Chalcidians and against Amphipolis under the command of Nicias the son of Niceratus.

Oldest of all were (1) the Cyclopes and Laestrygones, who are said to have dwelt in a district of the island; but who they were, whence they came, or whither they went, I cannot tell. We must be content with the legends of the poets, and every one must be left to form his own opinion. (2)
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Sicanians appear to have succeeded these early races, although according to their own account they were still older; for they profess to have been children of the soil. <pb n="179"/> But the fact proves to be that they were Iberians, and were driven from the river Sicanus in Iberia by the Ligurians. Sicily, which was originally called Trinacria, received from them the name Sicania.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>To this day the Sicanians inhabit the western parts of the island. (3) After the capture of Troy, some Trojans who had escaped from the Achaeans came in ships to Sicily; they settled near the Sicanians, and took the common name of Elymi but had two separate cities, Eryx and Egesta. (4) These were joined by certain Phocians, who had also fought at Troy, and were driven by a storm first to Libya and thence to Sicily. (5)
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Sicels were originally inhabitants of Italy, whence they were driven by the Opici, and passed over into Sicily;&mdash;according to a probable tradition they crossed upon rafts, taking advantage of the wind blowing from the land, but they may have found other ways of effecting a passage; there are Sicels still in Italy, and the country itself was so called from Italus a Sicel king.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They entered Sicily with a large army, and defeating the Sicanians in battle, drove them back to the southern and western parts of the country; from them the island, formerly Sicania, took the name of Sicily. For nearly three hundred years after their arrival until the time when the Hellenes came to Sicily they occupied the most fertile districts, and they still inhabit the central and northern regions. (6) The Phoenicians at one time had settlements all round the island.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>They fortified headlands on the sea-coast, and settled in the small islands adjacent, for the sake of trading with the Sicels; but when the Hellenes began to find their way by sea to Sicily in greater numbers they withdrew from the larger part of the island, and forming a union established themselves in Moty&egrave;, Soloeis, and Panormus, in the neighbourhood of the Elymi, partly trusting to their alliance with them, and partly because this is the point at which the passage from Carthage to Sicily is shortest. Such were the Barbarian nations who inhabited Sicily, and these were their settlements. <pb n="180"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>There they remained two hundred and forty-five years, and were then driven out of their town and land by Gelo the tyrant of Syracuse; but before they were driven out, and a hundred years after <pb n="181"/> their own foundation, they sent out Pamillus and founded Selinus;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>he had come from Megara, their own mother state, to take part in the new colony. (11) In the forty-fifth year after the foundation of Syracuse, Antiphemus of Rhodes and Entimus of Crete came with their followers and together built Gela. The city was named from the river Gela, but the spot which is now the Acropolis and was first fortified is called Lindii. The institutions of the new settlement were Dorian.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They were principally instigated by an embassy which had come from Egesta and was urgent in requesting aid. The Egestaeans had gone to war with the neighboring city of Selinus about certain questions of marriage and about a disputed piece of land. The Selinuntians summoned the Syracusans to their assistance, and their united forces reduced the Egestaeans to great straits both by sea and land. The Egestaean envoys reminded the Athenians of the alliance which they had made<note anchored="yes">Or, 'with Egesta under Laches in the former war on behalf of the Leontines.' See note.

Their chief argument was that, if the Syracusans were not punished for the expulsion of the Leontines, but were allowed to destroy the remaining allies of the Athenians, and to get the whole of Sicily into their own hands, they would one day come with a great army, Dorians assisting Dorians, who were their kinsmen, and colonists assisting their Peloponnesian founders, and would unite in over. throwing Athens herself. Such being the danger, the Athenians would be wise in combining with the allies who were still left to them in Sicily against the Syracusans, especially since the Egestaeans would themselves provide money sufficient for the war.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>These arguments were constantly repeated in the ears of the Athenian assembly by the Egestaeans and their partisans; at length the people passed a vote that they would at all events send envoys to ascertain on the spot whether the Egestaeans really had the money which they professed to have in their treasury and in their temples, and to report on the state of the war with Selinus. So the Athenian envoys were despatched to Sicily.

They were to assist Egesta against Selinus; if this did not demand all their military strength they were empowered to restore the Leontines, and generally to further in such manner as they deemed best the Athenian interests in Sicily.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Nicias, who had been appointed general against his will, thought that the people had come to a wrong conclusion, and that upon slight if specious grounds they were aspiring to the conquest of Sicily, which was no easy task.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Yet to me personally war brings honour; and I am as careless as any man about my own life: not that I think the worse of a citizen who takes a little thought about his life or his property, for I believe that the sense of a man's own interest will quicken his interest in the prosperity of the state. But I have never in my life been induced by the love of reputation to say a single word contrary to what I thought; neither will I now: I will say simply what I believe to be best.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>If I told you to take care of what you have and not to throw away present advantages in order to gain an uncertain and distant good, my words would be powerless against a temper like yours.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And in all probability, if they find our power divided (and such a division is precisely what we are striving to create), they will eagerly join the Sicilians, whose alliance in the war they would long ago have given anything to obtain.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>These considerations should weigh with us. The state is far from the desired haven, and we should not run into danger and seek to gain a new empire before we have fully secured the old.

We all know that men have the greatest respect for that which is farthest off, and for that of which the reputation has been least tested;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and this, Athenians, you may verify by your own experience. There was a time when you feared the Lacedaemonians and their allies, but now you have got the better of them, and because your first fears have not been realized you despise them, and even hope to conquer Sicily.

Remember that the Lacedaemonians are sensitive to their disgrace, and that their sole thought is how they may even yet find a way of inflicting a blow upon us which will retrieve their own character; the rather because they have laboured so <pb n="188"/> earnestly and so long to win a name for valour.

It is our duty to expend our new resources upon ourselves at home, and not upon begging exiles who have an interest in successful lies; who find it expedient only to contribute words, and let others fight their battles; and who, if saved, prove ungrateful; if they fail, as they very likely may, only involve their friends in a common ruin.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and that success would repair his private fortunes, and gain him money as well as glory. He had a great position among the citizens and was devoted to horse-racing and other pleasures which outran his means. And in the end his wild courses went far to ruin the Athenian state.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For the people feared the extremes to which he carried the lawlessness of his personal habits, and the far-reaching purposes which invariably animated him in all his actions. They thought that he was aiming at a tyranny and set themselves against him. And therefore, although his talents as a military commander were unrivalled, they entrusted the administration of the war to others, because they personally objected to his private habits;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and so they speedily shipwrecked the state. He now came forward and spoke as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'I have a better right to command, men of Athens, than another; for as Nicias has attacked<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>My private extravagance is a public benefit. And why should men complain of being looked down upon by the fortunate? For they look down upon the unfortunate themselves. Great men have great ambitions, but their merits are not acknowledged during their life time. This foolish youth gained for you the Argive alliance</hi></note> me, I must begin by praising myself; and I consider that I am worthy. Those doings of mine for which I am SO much cried out against are an honour to myself and to my ancestors, and a solid advantage to my country.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In consequence of the distinguished manner in which I represented the state at Olympia, the other Hellenes formed an idea of our power which even exceeded the reality, although <pb n="191"/> they had previously imagined that we were exhausted by war. I sent into the lists seven chariots,&mdash;no other private man ever did the like; I was victor, and also won the second and fourth prize; and I ordered everything in a style worthy of my victory. Apart from the conventional honour paid to such successes, the energy which is shown by them creates an impression of power.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At home, again, whenever I gain distinction by providing choruses or by the performance of some other public duty, although the citizens are naturally jealous of me, to strangers these acts of munificence are a new argument of our strength. There is some use in the folly of a man who at his own cost benefits not only himself, but the state. And where is the injustice, if I or any one who feels his own superiority to another refuses to be on a level with him?
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The unfortunate keep their misfortunes to themselves. We do not expect to be recognized by our acquaintance when we are down in the world; and on the same principle why should any one complain when treated with disdain by the more fortunate? He who would have proper respect shown to him should himself show it towards others.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>I know that men of this lofty spirit, and all who have been in any way illustrious, are hated while they are alive, by their equals especially, and in a lesser degree by others who have to do with them; but that they leave behind them to after-ages a reputation which leads even those who are not of their family to claim kindred with them, and that they are the glory of their country, which regards them, not as aliens or as evil-doers, but as her own children, of whose character she is proud. These are my own aspirations, and this is the reason why my private life is assailed;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>but let me ask you, whether in the management of public affairs any man surpasses me. Did I not, without involving you in any great danger or expense, combine the most powerful states of Peloponnesus against the Lacedaemonians, whom I compelled to stake at Mantinea all that they had upon the fortune of <pb n="192"/> one day? And even to this hour, although they were victorious in the battle, they have hardly recovered courage.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Having determined to sail, do not change your minds under the impression that Sicily is a great power. For although the Sicilian cities are populous, their inhabitants are a mixed multitude, and they readily give up old forms of government and receive new ones from without.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>No one really feels that he has a city of his own; and so the individual is ill provided with arms, and the country has no regular means of defence. A man looks only to what he can win from the common stock by arts of speech or by party violence; hoping, if he is overthrown, at any rate to carry off his prize and enjoy it elsewhere.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They are a motley crew, who are never of one mind in counsel, and are incapable of any concert in action. Every man is for himself, and will readily come over to anyone who makes an attractive offer; the more readily if, as report says, they are in a state of internal discord.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They boast of their hoplites, but, as has proved to be the case in all Hellenic states, the number of them is grossly exaggerated. Hellas has been singularly mistaken about her heavy infantry; and even in this war it was as much as she could do to collect enough of them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The obstacles then which will meet us in Sicily, judging of them from the information which I have received, are not great; indeed, I have overrated <pb n="193"/> them, for there will be many barbarians who, through fear of the Syracusans, will join us in attacking them<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.88">6.88 init.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 6.98">98 init.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 6.103">103 med.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And at home there is nothing which, viewed rightly, need interfere with the expedition. Our forefathers had the same enemies whom we are now told that we are leaving behind us, and the Persian besides; but their strength lay in the greatness of their navy, and by that and that alone they gained their empire.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Never were the Peloponnesians more hopeless of success than at the present moment; and let them be ever so confident, they will only invade us by land, which they can equally do whether we go to Sicily or not. But on the sea they cannot hurt us, for we shall leave behind us a navy equal to theirs.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Like all other imperial powers, we have acquired our dominion by our readiness to assist any one, whether Barbarian or Hellene, who may have invoked our aid. If we are all to sit and do nothing, or to draw distinctions of race when our help is requested, we shall add little to our empire, and run a great risk of losing it altogether.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For mankind do not await the attack of a superior power, they anticipate it. We cannot cut down an empire as we might a household; but having once gained our present position, we must, while keeping a firm hold upon some, contrive occasion against others; for if we are not rulers we shall be subjects. You cannot afford to regard inaction in the same light as others might, unless <pb n="194"/> you impose a corresponding restriction on your practice.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Convinced then that we shall be most likely to increase our power here if we attack our enemies there, let us sail. We shall humble the pride of the Peloponnesians when they see that, scorning the delights of repose, we have attacked Sicily. By the help of our acquisitions there, we shall probably become masters of all Hellas; at any rate we shall injure the Syracusans, and at the same time benefit ourselves and our allies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Whether we succeed and remain, or depart, in either case our navy will ensure our safety;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>for at sea we shall be more than a match for all Sicily. Nicias must not divert you from your purpose by preaching indolence, and by trying to set the young against the old; rather in your accustomed order, old and young taking counsel together, after the manner of your fathers who raised Athens to this height of greatness, strive to rise yet higher. Consider that youth and age have no power unless united; but that the shallower and the more exact and the middle sort of judgment, when duly attempered, are likely to be most efficient. The state, if at rest, like everything else will wear herself out by internal friction. Every pursuit which requires skill will tend to decay, whereas by conflict the city will always be gaining fresh experience and learning to defend herself, not in theory, but in practice.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>My opinion in short is, that a state used to activity will quickly be ruined by the change to inaction; and that they of all men enjoy the greatest security who are truest to themselves and their institutions even when they are not the best.'

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the words of Alcibiades.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nicias, seeing that his old argument would no longer deter them, but that he might possibly change their minds if he insisted on the magnitude of the force which would be required, came forward again and spoke as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="20" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Men of Athens, as I see that you are thoroughly determined to go to war, I accept the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Hellenic cities in Sicily are free and powerful; they have numerous hoplites and cavalry.</hi></note> decision, and will advise you accordingly, trusting that the event will be such as we all wish.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The cities which we are about to attack are, I am informed, powerful, and independent of one another; they are not inhabited by slaves, who would gladly pass out of a harder into an easier condition of life; and they are very unlikely to accept our rule in exchange for their present liberty<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.55">7.55 fin.</bibl></note>. As regards numbers, although Sicily is but one island, it contains a great many Hellenic states.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Not including Naxos and Catana (of which the inhabitants, as I hope, will be our allies because they are the kinsmen of the Leontines), there are seven other cities fully provided with means of warfare similar to our own, above all Selinus and Syracuse, the cities against which our expedition is particularly directed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For they have numerous hoplites, archers, and javelin-men, and they have many triremes which their large population will enable them to man; besides their private wealth, they have the treasures of the Selinuntian temples; and the Syracusans receive a tribute which has been paid them from time immemorial by certain barbarian tribes. Moreover, they have a numerous cavalry, and grow their own corn instead of importing it: in the two last respects they have a great advantage over us.

We must make our preparations as complete as possible, and not be at the mercy of others; above all, we must take out with us as much money as we can; for as to the supplies of the Egestaeans which are said to be awaiting us, we had better assume that they are imaginary.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The enthusiasm of the majority was so overwhelming that, although some disapproved, they were afraid of being thought unpatriotic if they voted on the other side, and therefore held their peace.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At last an Athenian came forward and, calling upon Nicias, said that they would have no<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Nicias gives a provisional estimate of the force required.</hi></note> more excuses and delays; he must speak out and say what forces the people were to vote him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He replied, with some unwillingness, that he would prefer to consider the matter at leisure with his colleagues, but that, as far as he could see at present, they ought to have at least a hundred triremes of their own; of these a certain number might be used as transports<note anchored="yes">Cp. ch. 31 init., 43 init.</note>, and they must order more triremes from their allies. Of heavy-armed troops they would require in all, including Athenians and allies, not less than five thousand, and more if they could possibly have them; the rest of the armament must be in proportion, and should comprise archers to be procured both at home and from Crete, and slingers.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and he protested that they would be wiser in not sending a man who had so serious an imputation hanging over him on a command so important. But his enemies feared that if the trial took place at once he would have the support of the army;

They therefore exerted themselves to postpone the trial. To this end they suborned fresh speakers, who proposed that he should sail now and not delay the expedition, but should return and stand his trial within a certain number of days. Their intention was that he should be recalled and tried when they had stirred up a stronger feeling against him, which they could better do in his absence. So it was decided that Alcibiades should sail.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the middle of summer the expedition started for Sicily. Orders had been previously<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Conflict of emotions among the Athenians at the moment of parting.</hi></note> given to most of the allies, to the cornships, the smaller craft, and generally to the vessels in attendance on the <pb n="201"/> armament, that they should muster at Corcyra, whence the whole fleet was to strike across the Ionian gulf to the promontory of Iapygia. Early in the morning of the day appointed for their departure, the Athenian forces and such of their allies as had already joined them went down to the Piraeus and began to man the ships. Almost the entire population of Athens accompanied them, citizens and strangers alike. The citizens came to take farewell, one of an acquaintance, another of a kinsman, another of a son, and as they passed along were full of hope and full of tears;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>hope of conquering Sicily, tears because they doubted whether they would ever see their friends again, when they thought of the long voyage on which they were going away. At the last moment of parting the danger was nearer; and terrors which had never occurred to them when they were voting the expedition now entered into their souls. Nevertheless their spirits revived at the sight of the armament in all its strength and of the abundant provision which they had made. The strangers and the rest of the multitude came out of curiosity, desiring to witness an enterprise of which the greatness exceeded belief.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="31" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>No armament so magnificent or costly had ever been sent out by any single Hellenic power,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Beauty and precision of the armament. Vast expenses connected with it.</hi></note> though in mere number of ships and hoplites that which sailed to Epidaurus under Pericles and afterwards under Hagnon to Potidaea<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.56">2.56</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.58">58</bibl>.</note> was not inferior. For that expedition consisted of a hundred Athenian and fifty Chian and Lesbian triremes, conveying four thousand hoplites all Athenian citizens, three hundred cavalry, and a multitude of allied troops.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Still the voyage was short and the equipments were poor, whereas this expedition was intended to be long absent, and was thoroughly provided both for sea and land service, wherever its presence might <pb n="202"/> be required. On the fleet the greatest pains and expense had been lavished by the trierarchs and the state. The public treasury gave a drachma<note anchored="yes">8<hi>d.</hi></note> a day to each sailor, and furnished empty hulls for sixty swiftsailing vessels, and for forty transports carrying hoplites.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>All these were manned with the best crews which could be obtained. The trierarchs, besides the pay given by the state, added somewhat more out of their own means to the wages of the upper ranks of rowers and of<note anchored="yes">Others translate ' the crews generally,' or ' the soldiers' servants.'</note> the petty officers . The figure-heads and other fittings provided by them were of the most costly description. Every one strove to the utmost that his own ship might excel both in beauty and swiftness. The infantry had been well selected and the lists carefully made up. 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/> There was the keenest rivalry among the soldiers in the matter of arms and personal equipment. And while at home the Athenians were thus competing with one another in the performance of their several duties, to the rest of Hellas the expedition seemed to be a grand display of their power and greatness, rather than a preparation for war.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>If any one had reckoned up the whole expenditure, both of the state and of individual soldiers and others, including in the first not only what the city had already laid out, but what was entrusted to the general, and in the second what either at the time or afterwards private persons spent upon their outfit, or the trierarchs upon their ships, the provision for the long voyage which every one may be supposed to have carried with him over and above his public pay, and what soldiers or traders may have taken for purposes of exchange, he would have found that altogether an immense sum amounting to many talents was withdrawn from the city. 
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Men were quite amazed at the boldness of the scheme and the magnificence of the spectacle, which were everywhere <pb n="203"/> spoken of, no less than at the great disproportion of the force when compared with that of the enemy against whom it was intended. Never had a greater expedition been sent to a foreign land; never was there an enterprise in which the hope of future success seemed to be better justified by actual power.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="32" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the ships were manned and everything required for the voyage had been placed on<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Prayers offered by the whole fleet and by the spectators. The sailors make libations and raise the paean. The ships race as far as Aegina.</hi></note> board, silence was proclaimed by the sound of the trumpet, and all with one voice before setting sail offered up the customary prayers; these were recited, not in each ship separately, but by a single herald, the whole fleet accompanying him. On every deck both the officers and the marines, mingling wine in bowls, made libations from vessels of gold and silver.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The multitude of citizens and other well-wishers who were looking on from the land joined in the prayer. The crews raised the paean and, when the libations were completed, put to sea. After sailing out for some distance in single file, the ships raced with one another as far as Aegina; thence they hastened onwards to Corcyra, where the allies who formed the rest of the army were assembling.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Meanwhile reports of the expedition were coming in to Syracuse from many quarters, but for<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Rumours of the expedition reach Syracuse.</hi></note> a long time nobody gave credit to them. At length an assembly was held. Even then different opinions were expressed, some affirming and others denying that the expedition was coming. At last Hermocrates the son of Hermon, believing that he had certain information, came forward, and warned the Syracusans in the following words:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'I dare say that, like others, I shall not be believed when I tell you that the expedition is really coming; and I am well aware that those who are either the authors or reporters of tidings which seem incredible not only fail to convince others, but are thought fools for their <pb n="204"/> pains. Yet, when the city is in danger, fear shall not stop my mouth; for I am convinced in my own mind that I have better information<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Speech of Hermocrates. They are coming and you must prepare for them. If you are prepared there is nothing to fear; Sicily will unite against them; and great expeditions never come to good.</hi></note> than anybody.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians, wonder as you may, are coming against us with a great fleet and army; they profess to be assisting their Egestaean allies and to be restoring the Leontines. But the truth is that they covet Sicily, and especially our city. They think that, if they can conquer us, they will easily conquer the rest.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They will soon be here, and you must consider how with your present resources you can make the most successful defence. You should not let them take you by surprise because you despise them, or neglect the whole matter because you will not believe that they are coming at all.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But to him who is not of this unbelieving temper I say:&mdash; And do not you be dismayed at their audacity and power. They cannot do more harm to us than we can do to them; the very greatness of their armament may be an advantage to us; it will have a good effect on the other Sicilian cities, who will be alarmed, and in their terror will be the more ready to assist us. Then, again, if in the end we overpower them, or at any rate drive them away baffled, for I have not the slightest fear of their accomplishing their purpose, we shall have achieved a noble triumph.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And of this I have a good hope. Rarely have great expeditions, whether Hellenic or Barbarian, when sent far from home, met with success. They are not more numerous than the inhabitants and their neighbours, who all combine through fear; and if owing to scarcity of supplies in a foreign land they miscarry, although their ruin may be chiefly due to themselves, they confer glory on those whom they meant to overthrow.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The greatness of these very Athenians was based on the utter and unexpected ruin of the Persians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.69">1.69 fin.</bibl></note>, who were always supposed to have directed <pb n="205"/> their expedition against Athens. And I think that such a destiny may very likely be reserved for us.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="34" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Let us take courage then, and put ourselves into a state of defence; let us also send envoys<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Let us summon our old Sicelallies and make new ones. Let us obtain help from the rest of Sicily, Italy, Carthage, Lacedaemon, and Corinth. If you would take my advice you would go and meet the Athenians half way. We should very likely defeat them, and even defeat them, and even if we did not fight should still embarrass them. They might be so dismayed by our boldness as to give up the expedition.</hi></note> to the Sicels, and, while we make sure of our old allies, endeavour to gain new ones. We will despatch envoys to the rest of Sicily, and point out that the danger is common to all; we will also send to the Italian cities in the hope that they may either join us, or at any rate refuse to receive the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And I think that we should send to the Carthaginians; the idea of an Athenian attack is no novelty to them; they are always living in apprehension of it. They will probably feel that if they leave us to our fate, the trouble may reach themselves, and therefore they may be inclined in some way or other, secretly, if not openly, to assist us. If willing to help, of all existing states they are the best able; for they have abundance of gold and silver, and these make war, like other things, go smoothly. Let us also send to the Lacedaemonians and Corinthians and entreat them to come to our aid speedily, and at the same time to revive the war in Hellas.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>I have a plan which in my judgment is the best suited to the present emergency, although it is the last which you in your habitual indolence will readily embrace<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.143">1.143 fin.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Let me tell you what it is. If all the Sicilian Greeks, or at least if we and as many as will join us, taking two months' provisions, would put out to sea with all our available ships and prepare to meet the Athenians at Tarentum and the promontory of Iapygia, thereby proving to them that before they fight for Sicily they must fight for the passage of the Ionian Sea, we <pb n="206"/> should strike a panic into them. They would then reflect that at Tarentum (which receives us), we, the advanced guard of Sicily, are among friends, and go forth from a friendly country, and that the sea is a large place not easy to traverse with so great an armament as theirs. They would know that after a long voyage their ships will be unable to keep in line, and coming up slowly and few at a time will be at our mercy. On the other hand, if they lighten their vessels and meet us in a compact body with the swifter part of their fleet, they may have to use oars, and then we shall attack them when they are exhausted.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Or if we prefer not to fight, we can retire again to Tarentum. Having come over with slender supplies and prepared for a naval engagement, they will not know what to do on these desolate coasts. If they remain they will find themselves blockaded; if they attempt to sail onwards they will cut themselves off from the rest of their armament, and will be discouraged; for they will be far from certain whether the cities of Italy and Sicily will receive them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In my opinion the anticipation of these difficulties will hamper them to such a degree, that they will never leave Corcyra. While they are holding consultations, and sending out spies to discover our number and exact position, they will find themselves driven into winter; or in dismay at the unexpected opposition, they may very likely break up the expedition; especially if, as I am informed, the most experienced of their generals has taken the command against his will, and would gladly make any considerable demonstration on our part an excuse for retreating. I am quite sure that rumour will exaggerate our strength.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The minds of men are apt to be swayed by what they hear; and they are most afraid of those who commence an attack, or who at any rate show to the aggressor betimes that he will meet with resistance; for then they reflect that the risk is equally divided. And so it will be with the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>They are now attacking us because they do not believe that we shall defend ourselves, <pb n="207"/> and in this opinion they are justified by our neglect to join with the Lacedaemonians in putting them down. But, if they see that they were mistaken, and that we boldly venture<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.89">2.89 med.</bibl></note>, they will be more dismayed at our unexpected resistance than at our real power.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Take my advice; if possible, resolve on this bold step, but if not, adopt other measures of defence as quickly as possible. Remember each and all of you that the true contempt of an invader is shown by deeds of valour in the field, and that meanwhile the greatest service which you can render to the state is to act as if you were in the presence of danger, considering that safety depends on anxious preparation<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.11">2.11 med.</bibl></note>. The Athenians are coming; I am certain that they are already on the sea and will soon be here.'
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="35" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus spoke Hermocrates. Great was the contention which his words aroused among the Syracusan people, some asserting that<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>People said, They What harm will they do? A few saw the danger.</hi></note> the Athenians would never come, and that he was not speaking truth, others asking, 'And if they should come, what harm could they do to us nearly so great as we could do to them?' while others were quite contemptuous, and made a jest of the whole matter. A few only believed Hermocrates and realized the danger.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At last Athenagoras, the popular leader, who had at that time the greatest influence with the multitude, came forward and spoke as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'He is either a coward or a traitor who would not rejoice to hear that the Athenians are so mad as to come hither and deliver themselves into our hands. The audacity of the people who are spreading these alarms does not surprise me, but I do wonder at their folly if they cannot see that their motives are transparent.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Having <pb n="208"/> private reasons for being afraid, they want to strike terror into the whole city<note anchored="yes">Or, ' that they may hide their own consciousness of guilt.'</note> that they may hide<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Speech of Athenagoras.

And now, what is the meaning of these rumours? They do not grow of themselves; they have been got up by persons who are the troublers of our state.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And you, if you are wise, will not measure probabilities by their reports, but by what we may assume to be the intentions of shrewd and experienced men such as I conceive the Athenians to be. They are not likely to leave behind them a power such as Peloponnesus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The war which they have already on their hands is far from settled, and will they go out of their way to bring upon themselves another as great? In my opinion they are only too glad that we are not attacking them, considering the number and power of our states.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Even if the rumour of their coming should turn out to be true, I am sure that Sicily is more<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Sicily is more than a match for the Athenians; and another Syracuse, if they had possession of it, could not conquer Syracuse.</hi></note> fit than Peloponnesus to maintain a great war. The whole island is better supplied in every way, and our own city is herself far more than a match for the army which is said to be threatening us; aye, and for another as great. I know that they will not bring cavalry with them, and will find none here, except the few horsemen which they may procure from Egesta. They cannot provide a force of hoplites equal to ours<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.23">6.23 init.</bibl></note>, for they have to cross the sea; and to come all this distance, if only with ships and with no troops or lading, would be work enough<note anchored="yes">Placing a colon after <foreign lang="greek">e)lqo/ntas</foreign> and taking <foreign lang="greek">me/ga</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">ga/p . . . komisqh=nai</foreign> as a parenthesis.</note> I know too that an armament which is directed against so great a city as ours will require <pb n="209"/> immense supplies<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.21">6.21 med.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nay, I venture to assert that if they came hither, having at their command another city close upon our border as large as Syracuse, and could there settle and carry on war against us from thence, they would still be destroyed to a man; how much more when the whole country will be their enemy (for Sicily will unite), and when they must pitch their camp the moment they are out of their ships, and will have nothing but their wretched huts and meagre supplies, being prevented by our cavalry from advancing far beyond their lines? Indeed I hardly think that they will effect a landing at all. So far superior, in my judgment, are our forces to theirs.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'The Athenians, I repeat, know all that I am telling you, and do not mean to throw away<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians are what they have got: I am pretty sure a shrewd people and not likely to ruin themselves.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I know, and have always known, that by words like these, and yet more mischievous, if not by acts, they want to intimidate you, the Syracusan people and make themselves chiefs of the state. And I am afraid that if they persevere they will succeed at last, and that we shall be delivered into their hands before we have had the sense to take precautions or to detect and punish them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This is the reason why our city is always in a state of unrest and disorganisation, fighting against herself quite as much as against foreign enemies, and from time to time subjected to tyrants and to narrow and wicked oligarchies.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>With you I shall use persuasion, but to these conspirators I shall apply force; and I shall not wait until they are detected in the act (for who can catch them?), but I shall punish their intentions <pb n="210"/> and the mischief which they would do if they could.

But if, as I believe, none of your tales are true, the state is not going to be deceived, and will not in a moment of panic admit you to power, or impose upon her own neck the yoke of slavery. She will take the matter into her own hands, and when she gives judgment will reckon words to be equally criminal with actions.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They then sent before them to Italy and Sicily three ships, which had orders to find out what cities in those regions would receive them, and to meet them again on their way, that they might know before they put in.

The remainder of the hoplites were furnished by the allies, mostly by the subject states; <pb n="213"/> but five hundred came from Argos, besides two hundred and fifty Mantinean and other mercenaries.

Other merchant-vessels and lesser craft in great numbers followed of their own accord for purposes of trade. The whole fleet now struck across the Ionian sea from Corcyra.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They arrived at the promontory of Iapygia and at Tarentum, each ship taking its own course, and passed along the coast of Italy. The Italian cities did not admit them within their walls, or open a market to them, but allowed them water and anchorage; Tarentum and Locri refused even these. At length they reached Rhegium, the extreme point of Italy, where the fleet reunited.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As they were not received within the walls they encamped outside the city at the temple of Artemis; there they were provided by the inhabitants with a market, and drawing up their ships on shore they took a rest.

They now no longer doubted, but fell to work heart and soul.

In short, they made every preparation, as for a war which was rapidly approaching, and almost at their gates.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The spirits of the generals fell at once on receiving this their first discouragement. They were also disappointed at the unfavourable answer of the Rhegians, whom they had asked first, and who might naturally have been expected to join them because they were kinsmen of the Leontines, and had always hitherto been in the Athenian interest. Nicias had expected that the Egestaeans would fail them<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.22">6.22 fin.</bibl></note>;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>to the two others their behaviour appeared even more incomprehensible than the defection of the Rhegians. The fact was that when the original envoys came from Athens to inspect the treasure, the Egestaeans had practised a trick upon them. They <pb n="215"/> brought them to the temple of Aphrodite at Eryx, and showed them the offerings deposited there, consisting of bowls, flagons, censers, and a good deal of other plate. Most of the vessels were only of silver, and therefore they made a show quite out of proportion to their value, They also gave private entertainments to the crews of the trirenes:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>on each of these occasions they produced, as their own, drinking-vessels of gold and silver not only collected in Egesta itself, but borrowed from the neighbouring towns, Phoenician as well as Hellenic. All of them exhibiting much the same vessels and making everywhere a great display, the sailors were amazed, and on their arrival at Athens told every one what heaps of wealth they had seen.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the news spread that the Egestaeans had not got the money, great was the unpopularity incurred throughout the army by these men, who having been first imposed upon themselves had been instrumental in imposing upon others.

They would then pass along the coast before the eyes of the other cities and display the visible power of Athens, while they proved at the same time her zeal in the cause of her friends and allies; after this they would return home, unless a speedy way of relieving the Leontines or obtaining support from some of the other cities should unexpectedly present <pb n="216"/> itself.

They should send envoys to every city of Sicily, with the exception of Selinus and Syracuse; they should also negotiate with the Sicels, making friends of the independent tribes, and persuading the rest to revolt from the Syracusans. They would thus obtain supplies and reinforcements. They should first appeal to the Messenians, whose city being on the highway of traffic was the key of Sicily, and possessed a harbour from which the Athenian forces could most conveniently watch the enemy. Finally, when they had brought the cities over to them and knew who would be on their side in the war, they should attack Selinus and Syracuse, unless the Selinuntians would come to terms with the Egestaeans, and the Syracusans would permit the restoration of the Leontines.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The generals at once manned sixty ships, selecting the crews indifferently out of the entire fleet, and taking the necessary provisions coasted along to Naxos; they left the rest of the armament and one of themselves at Rhegium.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Naxians received them into their city, and they sailed on to Catana; but the Catanaeans, having a Syracusan party within their walls, denied admission to them;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>so they moved to the river Terias and there encamped. On the following day they went on to Syracuse in long file with all their ships, except ten, which they had sent forward to sail into the Great Harbour and <pb n="218"/> see whether there was any fleet launched. On their approaching the city a herald was to proclaim from the decks that the Athenians had come to restore their allies and kinsmen the Leontines to their homes, and that therefore any Leontines who were in Syracuse should regard the Athenians as their friends and benefactors, and join them without fear.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the proclamation had been made, and the fleet had taken a survey of the city, and harbours, and of the ground which was to be the scene of operations, they sailed back to Catana.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Those of the Catanaeans who were in the Syracusan interest, when they saw that the enemy had entered, took alarm and stole away. They were not numerous, and the other Catanaeans voted the alliance with the Athenians, and told them to bring up the rest of their armament from Rhegium.

They also heard that the Syracusans were manning a navy. So they sailed with their whole force first to Syracuse, but they found that there was no fleet in preparation; they then passed on to Camarina, and putting in to the open beach they sent a herald to the city.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So they sailed away without effecting their purpose. They then disembarked on a part of the Syracusan territory, which they ravaged. But a few Syracusan horse coming up killed some of their light-armed troops who were straggling. They then returned to Catana.

With him were summoned certain of the soldiers, who were accused at the same time, some of profaning the mysteries, others of mutilation of the Hermae.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For after the departure of the expedition the Athenians prosecuted both enquiries as keenly as ever. They did not investigate the character of the informers, but in their suspicious mood listened to all manner of statements, and seized and imprisoned some of the most respectable citizens on the evidence of wretches; they thought it better to sift the matter and discover the truth; and they would not allow even a man of good character, against whom an accusation was brought, to escape without a thorough investigation, merely because the informer was a rogue.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the people who had heard by tradition that the tyranny of Pisistratus and his sons ended in great oppression, and knew moreover that their power was overthrown, not by Harmodius or any efforts of their own, but by the Lacedaemonians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Hdt. 5.65">Herod. 5.65</bibl>.</note> were in a state of incessant fear and suspicion.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Hipparchus made an attempt to gain the affections of Harmodius, but he would not listen to him, and told Aristogiton. The latter was naturally tormented at the idea, and fearing that Hipparchus who was powerful would resort to violence, at once formed such a plot as a man in his station might for the overthrow of the tyranny.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Meanwhile Hipparchus made another attempt; he had no better success, and thereupon he determined, not indeed to take any violent step, but to insult Harmodius bin some secret place<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">to/pw|</foreign> with all the MSS.; or, reading <foreign lang="greek">tro/pw|:</foreign> 'in some underhand manner.'</note>, so that his motive could not be suspected.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To use violence would have been at variance with the general character of his rule, which was not unpopular or oppressive to the many; in fact no tyrants ever displayed greater merit or capacity than these. Although the tax on the produce of the soil which they exacted amounted only to five per cent., they improved and adorned the city, and carried on successful wars; they were also in the habit of sacrificing in the temples.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The city meanwhile was permitted to retain her ancient laws; but the family of Pisistratus took care that one of their own number should always be in office. Among others who thus held the annual archonship at Athens was Pisistratus, a son of the tyrant Hippias. He was named after his grandfather Pisistratus, and <pb n="221"/> during his term of office he dedicated the altar of the Twelve Gods in the Agora, and another altar in the temple of the Pythian Apollo.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Athenian people afterwards added to one side of the altar in the Agora and so concealed the inscription upon it; but the other inscription on the altar of the Pythian Apollo may still be seen, although the letters are nearly effaced. It runs as follows:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">Pisistratus the son of Hippias dedicated this memorial of his archonship in the sacred precinct of the Pythian Apollo.</quote>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="55" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>That Hippias was the eldest son of Pisistratus and succeeded to his power I can positively<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Various proofs of the fact that Hippias was the elder son.</hi></note> affirm from special information which has been transmitted to me. But there is other evidence. Of the legitimate sons of Pisistratus he alone had children; this is indicated by the altar just mentioned, and by the column which the Athenians set up in the Acropolis to commemorate the oppression of the tyrants. For on that column no son of Thessalus or of Hipparchus is named, but five of Hippias who were born to him of Myrrhine the daughter of Callias the son of Hyperechides; now there is a presumption that the son who married first would be the eldest.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Moreover, his name is inscribed a on the same column<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">e)n th=| au)th=| sth/lh|.</foreign> Or, reading with the MSS. <foreign lang="greek">e)n th=| prw/th|</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">sth/lh|:</foreign> 'on the front part of the column.' But the words can hardly bear this meaning. The word <foreign lang="greek">prw/th|</foreign> is probably derived from <foreign lang="greek">prw=tos</foreign> which follows.</note> immediately after his father's; this again is a presumption that he was his eldest son and succeeded him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>I think too that Hippias would have found a difficulty in seizing the tyranny if Hipparchus had been tyrant at the time of his death and he had tried to step into his place. As it was, owing to the habitual dread which he had inspired in the citizens, and the strict discipline which he maintained among his body-guard, he held the government with the <pb n="222"/> most perfect security and without the least difficulty. Nor did he behave at all like a younger brother, who would not have known what to do<note anchored="yes">Or, giving a more precise sense to <foreign lang="greek">cunexw=s:</foreign> ' because he had succeeded to the command and not been used to it.'</note> because he had not been regularly used to command<note anchored="yes">Or, giving a more precise sense to <foreign lang="greek">cunexw=s:</foreign> ' because he had succeeded to the command and not been used to it.'</note>.

There was a young sister of his whom Hipparchus and his friends first invited to come and carry a sacred basket in a procession, and then rejected her, declaring that she had never been invited by them at all because she was unworthy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At this Harmodius was very angry, and Aristogiton, for his sake, more angry still. They and the other conspirators had already laid their preparations, but were waiting for the festival of the great Panathenaea, when the citizens who took part in the procession assembled in arms; for to do so on any other day would have aroused suspicion. Harmodius and Aristogiton were to begin the attack, and the rest were immediately to join in, and engage with the guards.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The plot had been communicated to a few only, the better to avoid detection; but they hoped that, however few struck the blow, the crowd who would be armed, although not in the secret, would at once rise and assist in the recovery of their own liberties,

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But seeing one of the conspirators in familiar conversation <pb n="223"/> with Hippias, who was readily accessible to all, they took alarm, and imagined that they had been betrayed and were on the point of being seized.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Whereupon they determined to take their revenge first on the man who had outraged them and was the cause of their desperate attempt. So they rushed, just as they were, within the gates. They found Hipparchus near the Leocorium, as it was called, and then and there falling upon him with all the blind fury, one of an injured lover, the other of a man smarting under an insult, they smote and slew him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The crowd ran together, and so Aristogiton for the present escaped the guards; but he was afterwards taken and not very gently handled. Harmodius perished on the spot.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They, supposing that he had something to say to them, obeyed, and then bidding his guards seize the arms, he at once selected those whom he thought guilty, and all who were found carrying daggers; for the custom was to march in the procession with spear and shield only.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>To the people at large the tyranny simply became more oppressive, and Hippias, after his brother's death living in great fear, slew many of the citizens; he also began to look abroad in hope of securing an asylum should a revolution occur.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Himself an Athenian, he married his daughter Archedic&egrave; to a Lampsacene, Aeantides, son of Hippoclus <pb n="224"/> the tyrant of Lampsacus; for he observed that the family of Hippoclus had great influence with King Darius.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Inflamed by these suspicions they had already imprisoned many men of high character. There was no sign of returning quiet, but day by day the movement became more furious and the number of arrests increased. At-last one of the prisoners, who was believed to be deeply implicated, was induced by a fellow-prisoner to make a confession&mdash;whether true or false I cannot say; opinions are divided, and no one knew at the time, or to this day knows, who the offenders were. His companion argued that even if he were not guilty he ought to confess and claim a pardon<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.27">6.27</bibl>.</note>;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>he would thus save his own life, and at the same time deliver Athens from the prevailing state <pb n="225"/> of suspicion. His chance of escaping would be better if he confessed his guilt in the hope of a pardon, than if he denied it and stood his trial.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So he gave evidence both against himself and others in the matter of the Hermae. The Athenians were delighted at finding out what they supposed to be the truth; they had been in despair at the thought that the conspirators against the democracy would never be known, and they immediately liberated the informer and all whom he had not denounced. The accused they brought to trial, and executed such of them as could be found. Those who had fled they condemned to death, and promised a reward to any one who would kill them.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>It so happened that while the city was in this state of excitement a small Lacedaemonian force proceeded as far as the Isthmus, having something to do in Boeotia. They were supposed to have come, not in the interest of the Boeotians, but by a secret understanding with Alcibiades; and the Athenians really believed that but for their own alacrity in arresting the accused persons the city would have been betrayed. For one whole night the people lay in arms in the temple of Theseus which is within the walls.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>About this time too the friends of Alcibiades at Argos were suspected of conspiring against the Argive democracy, and accordingly the <pb n="226"/> Argive hostages who had been deposited in the islands<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.84">5.84 init.</bibl></note> were at once given up by the Athenians to the vengeance of the Argive people.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They reduced the inhabitants to slavery, and handed the place over to the Egestaeans, whose cavalry had now joined them. The Athenian troops then marched back through the country of the Sicels until they arrived at Catana; the ships which conveyed the prisoners going round the coast to meet them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Nicias had sailed straight from Hyccara to Egesta, where he did his business, and having obtained thirty talents<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.46">6.46 init.</bibl></note> of silver, rejoined the army at Catana.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They next sailed round to their Sicel allies and bade them send reinforcements. Then with half of their army they marched against Hybla Geleatis, a hostile town, which they failed to take. And so ended the summer.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Early in the ensuing winter the Athenians made preparations for an attack upon Syracuse;<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans begin to despise the Athenians.</hi></note> the Syracusans likewise prepared to take the offensive.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For when they found that their enemies did not assail them at once, as in their first panic they had expected, day by day their spirits rose. And now the Athenians, after cruising about at the other end of Sicily, where they seemed to be a long way off, had gone to Hybla, and their attack upon it had failed. So the Syracusans despised them more than ever. After the manner of the populace when elated, they insisted that since the Athenians would not come to them, their generals should lead them against Catana.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Syracusan horsemen, who were always riding up to the Athenian army and watching their movements, would ask insultingly whether, instead of resettling the Leontines in their old home, they <pb n="228"/> were not themselves going to settle down with their good friends the Syracusans in a new one.

					<milestone n="64" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The generals were aware of the state of affairs. They determined to draw the whole Syracusan<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians deceive the Syracusans by a fictitious message and draw them off to Catana,</hi></note> army as far as possible out of the city, and then in their absence sail thither by night and take up a convenient position unmolested.

Whereas if they sailed thither by night they would be enabled to take up a position in which the cavalry could do them no serious mischief.&mdash;The exact spot near the temple of Olympian Zeus which they afterwards occupied was indicated by Syracusan exiles who accompanied them.&mdash; Accordingly the generals devised the following plan;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>they sent to Syracuse a man of whose fidelity they were assured, but whom the Syracusan leaders believed to be a friend of theirs. He was a Catanaean, and professed to come from adherents of their party whose names were familiar to them, and whom they knew to be still remaining in Catana<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.51">6.51</bibl>.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He told them that the Athenians lay within the city every night away from the camp in which their arms were deposited, and if at dawn on a set day the Syracusans with their whole force would come and attack the troops left in the camp, their partisans in Catana would themselves<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">au)tou\s</foreign> after <foreign lang="greek">a)poklh|/sein:</foreign> or, reading <foreign lang="greek">tou\s</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">au)tou\s:</foreign> 'shut up those of the Athenians who were in the town.'</note> shut the Athenians up in the town c and fire their ships; meanwhile the Syracusans might assault the palisade, and easily take the camp-preparations had been made<note anchored="yes">Placing a comma after <foreign lang="greek">h)\dh</foreign>.</note>, and <pb n="229"/> many of the Catanaeans were in the plot; from them he came.

					<milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusan generals were already in high spirits, and before this proposal reached them had<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>while they quietly sail away by night and disembark at Syracuse.</hi></note> made up their minds to have all things in readiness for a march to Catana. So they trusted the man the more recklessly, and at once fixed the day on which 'they would arrive. They then sent him back, and issued orders for an expedition to their whole army, including the Selinuntians and the rest of the allies; who had now joined them. When they were ready and the appointed day drew near they marched towards Catana, and encamped by the river Symaethus in the Leontine territory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians, aware of the approach of the Syracusans, took all their own army-and Sicel or other allies on board their ships and smaller craft, and sailed away at nightfall to Syracuse.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At dawn they disembarked opposite the temple of Olympian Zeus, intending to seize a place for their camp; almost at the same moment the Syracusan horse who had advanced before the rest to Catana discovered that the whole Athenian army had put out to sea, whereupon they returned and told the infantry: and then all together hurried back to protect the city.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="66" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The march from Catana to Syracuse was long, and in the meantime the Athenians had quietly established themselves in an<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>They occupy a strong position. The Syracusans return from Catana.</hi></note> advantageous position, where they could give battle whenever they pleased, and the Syracusan horse were least likely to harass them either before or during the engagement. On one side they were protected by walls, and houses, and trees, and a marsh; on another by a line of cliffs.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They felled the trees near, and bringing them down to the sea made a palisade to protect their ships; on the shore of Dascon too they hurriedly raised a fortification of rough stones and logs at a point where the ground was most accessible to <pb n="230"/> the enemy, and broke down the bridge over the river Anapus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>No one came out from the walls to hinder them in their work. The first to appear at all were the returning cavalry; after a while the whole body of infantry came up and re-formed. They at once marched right up to the Athenian position, but the Athenians did not come out to meet them; so they retired and encamped on the other side of the Helorine road.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="67" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the next day the Athenians and their allies prepared to give battle. Their order was as<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians prepare for battle; they are drawn up eight deep and the Syracusans sixteen deep.</hi></note> follows:&mdash;The Argives and Mantineans formed the right wing, the Athenians held the centre; on the left wing were the remaining allies. Half of their army which formed the van was ranged eight deep. The other half was drawn up likewise eight deep close to their sleeping-places, in a hollow oblong. The latter were told to watch the engagement, and to move up to the support of any part of the line which might be distressed. In the midst of the reserve thus disposed were placed the baggage-bearers.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Syracusans drew up their heavy-armed sixteen deep; the army consisted of the whole Syracusan people and their allies, chiefly the Selinuntians, who were in the city; they had also two hundred horsemen from Gela, and twenty, with about fifty archers, from Camarina. The cavalry, numbering in all twelve hundred, were placed upon the right wing, and beside them the javelin-men. The Athenians determined to begin the attack.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Just before the battle Nicias went up and down, and addressed the following words to all and each of the various peoples who composed the army:&mdash;

They are Sicilians too, who, although they may despise us, will not stand their ground against us;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for their skill is not equal to their courage. Consider again that we are far from home, and that there is no friendly land near but what you can win with your swords<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.77">7.77 fin.</bibl></note>. The generals of the enemy, as I know well, are appealing to very different motives. They say to them, <q direct="unspecified">you are fighting for your own country,</q> but I say to you that you are fighting in a country which is not your own, and from which, if you do not conquer, retreat will be impossible, for swarms of cavalry will follow at your heels.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Remember your own reputation, and charge valiantly, deeming the difficulties and necessities of your position to be more formidable than the enemy.'
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="69" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nicias having thus exhorted his men led them at once to the charge. The Syracusans did<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans are unprepared for the attack; they of courage, but are deficient in skill. Motives of the two armies.</hi></note> not expect that they would have to fight just at that moment, and some of them had even gone away into the city, which was close at hand; others came running up as fast as they could, and, although late, joined the main body one by one at the nearest point. For they showed no want of spirit or daring in this or any other engagement; in courage they were not a whit inferior to their enemies, had their skill only been adequate, but when it failed, they could no longer do justice to their good intentions. On this occasion they were compelled <pb n="232"/> to make a hasty defence, for they felt sure that the Athenians would not begin the attack.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nevertheless they took up their arms and immediately went forward to meet them. For a while the throwers of stones, and slingers, and archers skirmished in front of the two armies, driving one another before them after the manner of light-armed troops.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then the soothsayers brought out the customary victims, and the trumpets sounded and called the infantry to the charge. The two armies advanced; the Syracusans to fight for their country, and every man for life now, and liberty hereafter; on the opposite side the Athenians to gain a new country, and to save the old from the disaster of defeat; the Argives and the independent allies eager to share the good things of Sicily, and, if they returned victorious, to see their own homes once more. The courage of the subject allies was chiefly inspired by a lively consciousness that their only chance of life was in victory; they had also a distant hope that, if they assisted the Athenians in overthrowing others, their own yoke might be lightened.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="70" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The armies met, and for a long time the issue was doubtful. During the battle there came<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans are defeated, but they are saved in their retreat by their cavalry.</hi></note> on thunder and lightning, and a deluge of rain; these added to the terror of the inexperienced who were fighting for the first time, but experienced soldiers ascribed the storm to the time of year, and were much more alarmed<note anchored="yes">Or, giving a slightly different meaning to the present: 'at the prospect of the enemy's success.'</note> at the stubborn resistance of the enemy<note anchored="yes">Or, giving a slightly different meaning to the present: 'at the prospect of the enemy's success.'</note>. First the Argives drove back the left wing of the Syracusans;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>next the Athenians the right wing which was opposed to them. Whereupon the rest of the army began to give way and were soon put to flight.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Their opponents did not pursue them far, for the Syracusan horsemen, who were numerous and had not shared in the defeat, interposed, and wherever <pb n="233"/> they saw hoplites advancing from the ranks attacked and drove them back. The Athenians pursued in a body as far as they safely could, and then returned and raised a trophy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Syracusans rallied on the Helorine road, and did their best to reform after their defeat. They did not neglect to send some of their forces as a guard to the Olympieum, fearing lest the Athenians should plunder the treasures of the temple. The rest of the army returned to the city.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="71" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians, however, did not go to the temple at all, but collecting their dead, and laying<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians, sensible of their deficiency in cavalry, return to Catana and Naxos, where they intend to winter while they obtain reinforcements from Athens and Sicily.</hi></note> them on a pyre, they passed the night where they were. On the following day they gave back the Syracusan dead under a flag of truce, and gathered from the pyre the bones of their own dead. There had fallen of the Syracusans and of their allies about two hundred and sixty; of the Athenians and their allies not more than fifty. The Athenians then taking with them the spoils of their enemies, sailed back to Catana.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Winter had now set in, and they thought that before they could do anything more at Syracuse they must send for horsemen from Athens, and collect others from their Sicilian allies; without them they would be at the mercy of the Syracusan cavalry. They also wanted to obtain both in Sicily and from Athens a supply of money, and to gain over some of the Sicilian cities. These would be more willing to listen to them after their victory. They had likewise to provide supplies, and to make the other requisite preparations for attacking Syracuse in the spring.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="72" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Accordingly they sailed away to Naxos and Catana, intending to winter.
				</p>
				<p>The Syracusans, after burying their dead, called an assembly.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Hermocrates the son of Hermon, a man of first-rate ability, of distinguished bravery, and also of great military experience, came forward and encouraged them. He told them not to be disheartened at the result of the <pb n="234"/> battle; for their resolution had not been defeated<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.87">2.87 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.11">6.11 fin.</bibl></note>; but they had suffered from want of discipline.<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Hermocrates points out to the Syracusans the causes of their defeat. They should have fewer generals with more power, better discipline, and greater secrecy.</hi></note>
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Yet they had proved less unequal than might have been expected; and they should remember that they had been contending against the most experienced soldiers of Hellas;<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">xeirote/xnais.</foreign> Or reading <foreign lang="greek">xeirote/xnas</foreign> with Bekker and the MSS.; 'themselves were untrained handicraftsmen.</note> they were unskilled workmen, and the Athenians masters in their craft<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">xeirote/xnais.</foreign> Or reading <foreign lang="greek">xeirote/xnas</foreign> with Bekker and the MSS.; 'themselves were untrained handicraftsmen.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Another great source of weakness had been the number of generals (there were fifteen of them); the division of authority had produced disorganisation and disorder among the troops. If they had a few experienced generals, and during the winter got their hoplites into order, providing arms for those who had none, and so raising the number of their forces to the utmost, while at the same time they insisted on strict drill and discipline, they would have a good chance of victory; for they had courage already, and only wanted steadiness in action.
				</p>
				<p>Both qualities would improve together; they would learn steadiness in the school of danger, and their natural courage would be reinforced by the confidence which skill inspires.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The generals whom they elected should be few in number and should be entrusted with full power, the people taking a solemn oath to them that they would be allowed to command according to their own judgment. The secrets of the army would then be better kept, and everything would be done in a more orderly and straightforward manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="73" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans listened to him, and voted all that he desired. They chose three generals and no more; Hermocrates himself,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans follow his advice, and send envoys to Corinth and Lacedaemon.</hi></note> Heraclides the son of Lysimachus, and Sicanus the son of Execestus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They also sent ambassadors to Corinth and to Lacedaemon <pb n="235"/> requesting aid as allies, and urged the Lacedaemonians to make war openly and decidedly against the Athenians on their behalf; thus they would either draw them off from Sicily, or at any rate prevent them from sending reinforcements to the army which was there already.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="74" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>No sooner had the Athenians returned in the fleet to Catana than they sailed to Messen&egrave;,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Alcibiades having contrived that Messen&egrave; should be betrayed, now betrays the betrayers.

For Alcibiades, when he was recalled and gave up his command, foreseeing that he would be an exile, communicated to the Syracusan party at Messen&egrave; the plot of which he was cognisant<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.50">6.50 init.</bibl></note>. They at once put to death the persons whom he indicated; and on the appearance of the Athenians the same party, rising and arming, prevented their admission.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians remained there about thirteen days, but the weather was bad, their provisions failed, and they had no success. So they went to Naxos, and having surrounded their camp with a palisade, proposed to pass the winter there. They also despatched a trireme to Athens for money and cavalry, which were to arrive at the beginning of spring.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="75" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans employed the winter in various defensive works. Close to the city they built<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans extend the line of their walls, burn the Athenian camp at Catana, and send an embassy to Camarina.</hi></note> a wall, which took in the shrine of Apollo Temenites and extended all along that side of Syracuse which looks towards Epipolae; they thus enlarged the area of the city, and increased the difficulty of investing it in case of defeat. They fortified and garrisoned Megara, and also raised a fort at the Olympieum<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.4">7.4 fin.</bibl></note>, besides fixing stockades at all the landing-places along the shore.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They knew that the Athenians were wintering at Naxos, and so, marching out with their whole army to Catana, they <pb n="236"/> ravaged the country and burnt the huts and the camp of the Athenians;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>they then returned home. They heard that the Athenians were sending an embassy to gain over the Camarinaeans on the strength of their former alliance, which had been made under Laches<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.86">3.86</bibl>.</note>, and they despatched a counter embassy of their own. They suspected that the Camarinaeans had not been over-zealous in sending their contingent to the first battle, and would not be willing to assist them any longer now that the Athenians had gained a victory; old feelings of friendship would revive, and they would be induced to join them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Accordingly Hermocrates came with an embassy to Camarina, and Euphemus with another embassy from the Athenians. An assembly of the Camarinaeans was held, at which Hermocrates, hoping to raise a prejudice against the Athenians, spoke as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="76" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'We are not here, Camarinaeans, because we suppose that the presence of the Athenian army<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>We fear not the swords but the words of he Athenians. They pretend to be liberators, but they are really enslavers of Hellas, abroad as well as at home, the new masters whom Hellas has taken in exchange for the Persians.</hi></note> will dismay you; we are more afraid of their as yet unuttered words, to which you may too readily lend an ear if you hear them without first hearing us.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>You know the pretext on which they have come to Sicily, but we can all guess their real intentions. If I am not mistaken they want, not to restore the Leontines to their city, but to drive us out of ours. Who can believe that they who desolate the cities of Hellas mean to restore those of Sicily, or that the enslavers and oppressors of the Chalcidians in Euboea have any feeling of kindred towards the colonists of these Chalcidians in Leontini? In their conquests at home, and in their attempt to conquer Sicily, is not the principle upon which they act one and the same?
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Ionians and other colonists of theirs who were their allies, wanting to be revenged on <pb n="237"/> the Persian, freely invited them to be their leaders; and they accepted the invitation. But soon they charged them, some with desertion, and some with making war upon each other<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.99">1.99</bibl>.</note>; any plausible accusation which they could bring against any of them became an excuse for their overthrow.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>It was not for the liberties of Hellas that Athens, or for her own liberty that Hellas, fought against the Persian; they fought, the Athenians that they might enslave Hellas to themselves instead of him, the rest of the Hellenes that they might get a new master, who may be cleverer, but certainly makes a more dishonest use of his wits.

And so they are. We Ionians dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Peloponnesians (who are Dorians and more numerous than ourselves) have had to consider the best way of securing ourindependence.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After the Persian War we were delivered by the help of our newly-acquired navy from the rule and supremacy of Lacedaemon; they had no more right to domineer over us than we over them, except the right of the stronger, which at the time they possessed. We then assumed the leadership of the King's former subjects, which we still retain; if we were not to be the slaves of the Peloponnesians we thought that we must have the means of self-defence. And what if we did subjugate those kinsmen of ours whom the Syracusans say that we have enslaved, the Ionians and the islanders? On the strictest principles, where was the injustice?
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For we were their mother-city, and they joined in the Persian invasion. They had not the courage to revolt from him and to destroy their homes, as we did when we left our city. But they chose slavery for their own portion, and would have imposed it upon us.

And secondly, we were anxious to gain additional strength against the Peloponnesians. We use no fine words:

The same care of our safety has brought us hither, and we can see that our presence here is for your benefit as well as for ours.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This we will prove to you; and our proofs shall be drawn from the calumnies of our enemies, and from the suspicions and fears which most sway your minds.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Let no one imagine that your welfare is no business of ours, for if you are preserved, and are strong enough to hold out against the Syracusans, they will be less likely to aid the Peloponnesians, and so to injure us. Thus you become at once our first concern.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And we are quite consistent in restoring the Leontines, not to be subjects, like their kinsmen in Euboea, but to be as strong as ever we can make them, that from their position on the border they may harass the Syracusans and do our work. In Hellas we are a match for our enemies single-handed;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and as to our subjection of the Chalcidians at home, which Hermocrates finds so inconsistent with our emancipation of the Chalcidians here, it is for our advantage, on the one hand, that the cities of Euboea should have no armed force and contribute money only, and, on the other hand, that the <pb n="243"/> Leontines and our friends in Sicily should be as independent as possible.

Do not mistrust us.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In Hellas we act upon the same principle, managing our allies as our interest requires in their several cases. The Chians and Methymnaeans furnish us with ships, and are their own masters; the majority are less independent, and pay a tribute; others, although they are islanders and might be easily conquered, enjoy complete freedom, because they are situated conveniently for operations about Peloponnesus<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.7">2.7 fin.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.57">7.57 med.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So that in Sicily too our policy is likely to be determined by our interest, and, as I was saying, by our fear of the Syracusans.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nor should you suspect us because we bring hither a force larger than before; for we have to contend against the power of Syracuse. Much more to be mistrusted are they.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Without your aid we cannot even remain where we are, and if we were so dishonourable as to make conquests we should be unable to retain them<note anchored="yes">Cp. vi. ii init.</note>, for the voyage is long, and it would be a hopeless task to garrison great cities which, though situated on an island, have the resources of a continent. Whereas these men are your nearest neighbours. And they dwell, not in a camp, but in a city far more powerful than the forces which we have brought to Sicily;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>they are always scheming against you, and never miss a chance, as they have often shown, especially in their conduct towards the Leontines. And now they have the impudence to stir you up against those who resist them, and have thus far saved Sicily from passing under their yoke. As if you had no eyes!
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Far more real than the security offered by them is that to which we invite you, a security which we and you gain from one another, and we beseech you not to throw it away. Reflect: the Syracusans are so numerous that with or without allies they can always find their way to you, but you will not often have the chance of defending yourself with the aid of an army like ours. And if from any suspicion you allow us to depart unsuccessful, or perhaps defeated, the time may come when you will desire to see but a fraction of that army, although, if it came, it would be too late to save you.

					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Do not reject the common salvation which is offered to you at this moment, as well as to all who seek it, but following the example of your countrymen join with us and, instead of having always to watch the Syracusans, assert your equality and threaten them as they have long been threatening you.'

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Thus spoke Euphemus. Now the Camarinaeans were swayed by opposite feelings; they had<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Camarinaeans suspect the designs of the Athenians and are afraid of their Syracusan neighbours. They resolve to assist The resolve to assist, if either, the Syracusans, but topless neutrality.</hi></note> a good will to the Athenians, tempered by a suspicion that they might be intending to enslave Sicily, whereas the Syracusans, from their proximity, were always at feud with them. But they were not so much afraid of the Athenians as of their Syracusan neighbours, <pb n="246"/> who, as they thought, might win without their assistance. This was the reason why they sent them the small body of horse which took part in the first battle; and in a like spirit they now determined that for the future they would give real assistance only to the Syracusans, but to a very moderate extent.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the present however, that they might seem to deal equal justice to the Athenians, especially after their recent victory, they resolved to return the same answer to both.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Such were the considerations which led them to reply that, as two of their allies were at war with one another, they thought that under the circumstances the best way of observing their oaths would be to assist neither. So the two embassies departed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Syracusans proceeded with their own preparations for the war, and the Athenians who<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians in the Sicel country.

The dwellers in the plain who were subjects of the Syracusans mostly stood aloof, but the Sicel settlements in the interior (which had always been independent) at once, with a few exceptions, joined the Athenians, and brought down food to the army;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>in some cases money also. Against those who were recalcitrant troops were despatched by the Athenians; and some of them were forced into submission, but others were protected by the garrisons which the Syracusans sent to their aid. They then transferred their station from Naxos to Catana and, reconstructing the camp which had been burnt by the Syracusans<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.75">6.75 med.</bibl></note>, passed the winter there.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In the hope of obtaining assistance they sent a trireme to Carthage with a proposal of friendship; likewise to Tyrrhenia, since some of the cities there were offering of themselves to join them in the war: to the various Sicel tribes<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.98">6.98 init.</bibl></note> and to the Egestaeans they issued orders that they were to send <pb n="247"/> as many horse as possible.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They further prepared bricks, tools, and whatever else was requisite for siege operations, intending, when the spring arrived, to prosecute the war with vigour.

				<p>The envoys whom the Syracusans had sent to Corinth and Lacedaemon<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.73">6.73</bibl>.</note> endeavoured on the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Corinthians are the first who promise aid o the Syracusan envoys.

					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>When they arrived at Corinth they appealed to the Corinthians for aid on the ground of relationship. The Corinthians, taking the lead of all the Hellenic states, voted that they would assist Syracuse with all possible energy. They sent with the Syracusan envoys ambassadors of their own to the Lacedaemonians, bearing a joint request that they would resume open hostilities at home, and unite with them in sending help to Sicily.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>At Lacedaemon the Corinthian ambassadors met Alcibiades and his fellow exiles. He had sailed at once from Thurii in a trading vessel to Cyllene in Elis, and thence proceeded to Lacedaemon on the invitation of the Lacedaemonians themselves, first obtaining a safe-conduct; for he was afraid of them after his proceedings in the matter of the Mantinean league<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.43">5.43 ff.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 5.61">61 ff.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>And so it came to pass that the Corinthians, the Syracusans, and Alcibiades appeared simultaneously in the Lacedaemonian assembly, and concurred in urging the same request. The ephors and the magistrates were already intending to send envoys to the Syracusans bidding them make no terms with the Athenians, although they were not disposed to assist them actively. But now Alcibiades came forward and stimulated the energies of the Lacedaemonians in the following words:&mdash;

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And if I then turned to the Mantineans and Argives and opposed you in that or in any other way, you were rightly served, and any one who while the wound was recent may have been unduly exasperated against me should now take another and a truer view. Or, again, if any one thought the worse of me because I was inclined to the people, let him acknowledge that here too there is no real ground of offence.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Any power adverse to despotism is called democracy, and my family have always retained the leadership of the people in their hands because we have been the persistent enemies of tyrants. Living too under a popular government, how could we avoid in a great degree conforming to circumstances? However, we did our best to observe political moderation amid the prevailing licence.

					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>it was our view that all ought to combine in maintaining that form of government which had been inherited by us, and under which the city enjoyed the greatest freedom and glory. Of course, like all sensible men, we knew only too well what democracy <pb n="249"/> is, and I better than any one, who have so good a reason for abusing it. The follies of democracy are universally admitted, and there is nothing new to be said about them.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>We sailed to Sicily hoping in the first place to conquer the Sicilian cities; then to proceed against the Hellenes of Italy;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and lastly, to make an attempt on the Carthaginian dominions, and on Carthage itself.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>If the Greeks would all unite they might even now, notwithstanding their want of military skill, resist with success; but the Syracusans alone, whose whole forces have been already defeated, and who cannot move freely at sea, will be unable to withstand the power which the Athenians already have on the spot.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And Syracuse once taken, the whole of Sicily is in their hands; the subjugation of Italy will follow; and the danger which, as I was saying, threatens you from that quarter, will speedily overwhelm you. And therefore remember every one of you that the safety, not of Sicily alone, but of Peloponnesus, is at stake.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>No time should be lost. You must send to Sicily a force of hoplites who will themselves handle the oars and will take the field immediately on landing. A Spartan commander I conceive to be even more indispensable than an army; his duty will be to organise the troops which are already enlisted, and to press the unwilling into the service. Thus you will inspire confidence in your friends and overcome the fears of the wavering. Here too in Hellas you should make open war. The Syracusans, seeing that you have not forgotten them, will then persevere in their resistance, while the Athenians will have greater difficulty in reinforcing their army.

And the way to hurt an enemy most surely is to inform yourself exactly about the weak points of which you see that he is conscious, and strike at them. For every man is likely to know best himself the dangers which he has most to fear. I will sum up briefly the chief though by no means all the advantages which you will gain, and the disadvantages <pb n="251"/> which you will inflict, by the fortification of Decelea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The whole stock of the country will fall into your hands. The slaves will come over to you of their own accord; what there is besides will be seized by you. The Athenians will at once be deprived of the revenues which they obtain from the silver mines of Laurium, and of all the profits which they make by the land or by the law courts: above all, the customary tribute will cease to flow in; for their allies, when they see that you are now carrying on the war in earnest, will not mind them.

They encountered a few Syracusans, some of whom they killed, and setting up a trophy returned to their ships. They then sailed back to Catana, and having taken in provisions marched with their whole force against Centoripa, a Sicel town, which capitulated.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thence they returned, and on their way burned the corn of the Inessians and the Hyblaeans.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Arriving at Catana they found that the horsemen, for whom they had sent, to the number of two hundred and fifty had come from Athens, with their equipment, but without horses, which they were expected to procure on the spot.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans heard that the Athenians had received their cavalry, and that they<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syacusans determine to guard Epipolae, but are anticipated, while holding a review, by the Athenians;</hi></note> would soon be upon them. They considered that, unless the Athenians gained possession of Epipolae (which was a steep place looking down upon Syracuse), the city could not easily be invested, even if they were defeated in battle; they therefore determined to guard the paths leading to the summit that the enemy might not get up by stealth.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At all other points the place was secure, as it lies high and slopes right down to the city, from the interior of which it can all be seen; the Syracusans call it Epipolae (or the plateau!, because it is above the level of the adjacent country.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Hermocrates and his colleagues had now entered upon their command. The whole people went out at break of day to the meadow skirting the river Anapus, and proceeded to hold a review of their forces. A selection was at once made of six hundred hoplites, who were appointed to guard Epipolae, and to run in a body to any point at which they were needed. They were commanded by Diomilus, an Andrian exile.

Their ships cast anchor at Thapsus, which is a peninsula with a narrow isthmus, running out into the sea, and not far from Syracuse either by land or water.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenian sailors made a stockade across the isthmus and remained at Thapsus, while the troops ran to Epipolae, and gained the summit by the way of the Euryelus before the Syracusans saw <pb n="255"/> them or could come up to them from the meadow where the review was going on.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Nevertheless Diomilus with his six hundred hurried to the spot, accompanied by the rest of the army, each man running as fast he could; but the distance from the meadow which they had to traverse before they could engage was not less than three miles;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>consequently they were in disorder when they closed with the Athenians. They were defeated in the engagement which ensued on Epipolae, and retired into the city. Diomilus and about three hundred others were slain.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Athenians erected a trophy, and gave up to the Syracusans the bodies of the dead under a flag of truce. On the following day they went down to the city itself, but as the Syracusans did not come out against them, they retired and built a fort upon Labdalum, at the edge of the cliffs of Epipolae looking towards Megara, in order that when they advanced either to fight or to construct lines, the place might serve as a depository for their baggage and their property.

					<milestone n="98" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Not long afterwards the Athenians were joined by three hundred Egestaean horsemen, and about a hundred more furnished by the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians now muster six hundred and fifty horse. They begin to construct a wall round Syracuse. The Syracuasns go out to meet them, but retire, and some of their cavalry are defeated.</hi></note> Sicels, Naxians, and others. They had two hundred and fifty of their own, for some of whom they received horses from the Egestaeans and Catanaeans; other horses they bought. The whole number of their cavalry was now raised to six hundred and fifty.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They placed a garrison in Labdalum and went down to Syce, where they took up a position and immediately commenced building<note anchored="yes">Or 'a circular fort.' See note.</note> a wall round the city<note anchored="yes">Or 'a circular fort.' See note.</note>. The Syracusans were amazed at the celerity of the work. They saw that they must interfere, and made up their minds to go out and fight.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The two armies were already preparing to engage when the Syrawhen <pb n="256"/> the Syracusan generals, seeing that their forces were in disorder and were forming with difficulty, led them back into the city, all but a detachment of the cavalry, who, remaining on the spot, prevented their opponents from gathering stones for the wall, and compelled them to keep together.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At length, advancing with one division of their hoplites and all their cavalry, the Athenians attacked the Syracusan horse, whom they put to flight, and killed some of them; they then erected a trophy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="99" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day some of the Athenians proceeded with the construction of that part of the circle which lay towards the north;<note anchored="yes">Or 'that part of their wall which lay to the north of the circle.'</note> others began to collect wood and stones and lay them along the intended course of the wall towards Trogilus, where the distance was shortest from the Great Harbour to the outer sea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Syracusans by the advice of their commanders, chiefly of Hermocrates, determined to risk no more general engagements. They thought it better to raise a counter-wall across the line along which the Athenian wall was building. If they were first they would intercept them. They might indeed be attacked by the Athenians while thus engaged, but then they could oppose them with a part of their army; and there would be time to run a stockade across, if not a wall, before any attack took place.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians on the other hand would have to leave their work, and employ their whole army against them. So they came out and drew a cross-wall, beginning at their own city, from a point below the circle of the Athenian wall,<note anchored="yes">Or 'the Athenian circle.'</note> cutting down the olive-trees in the precinct of Apollo and erecting wooden towers.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As yet the Athenian ships had not sailed round from Thapsus into the Great Harbour; the Syracusans were still masters of their own coast, and the Athenians brought their necessaries from Thapsus by land. <pb n="257"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="100" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians did not interfere with their work, for they were afraid of dividing and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>These, when partly finished, are taken by a sudden attack of the Athenians.</hi></note> weakening their forces; and they were pressing forward that part of the line on which they were employed. So the Syracusans when they had sufficiently completed a part of their stockade and cross-wall, leaving one division to guard the work, retreated into the city with the rest of their army. The Athenians now destroyed their conduits, which were laid underground to bring drinking-water into the city. Then, choosing their time at noon when the Syracusan guard remained within their tents (some of them had even retired into the city) and when the vigilance of their sentinels at the stockade was relaxed, they took a body of three hundred chosen hoplites of their own and some light-armed troops, picked soldiers, to whom they had given heavy arms, and bade them run quickly to the cross-wall. The rest of the army proceeded in two divisions under the two generals, one towards the city in case the enemy should come to save the wall, the other to that part of the stockade which adjoined the postern-gate of the city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The three hundred attacked and captured the further end of the stockade, from which the guards retired and fled inside the new outer wall which enclosed the shrine of Apollo Temenites<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.75">6.75 init.</bibl></note>. The pursuers pressed forward and made their way in after them; but they were forced out again by the Syracusans;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and some Argives and a few of the Athenians fell there. Then the whole army, turning back, destroyed the cross-wall, tore up the stockades, carried the stakes to their camp, and raised a trophy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="101" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day the Athenians, beginning at one end of the unfinished circle, began to bring the wall<note anchored="yes">Or, ' along.'</note> down over the cliff which on this side of Epipolae looks across the marsh towards the Great Harbour, intending to carry on the line by the shortest way to the harbour right <pb n="258"/> through the level of the marsh.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Meanwhile the Syracusans also came out, and beginning<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians proceed to carry their wall southwards towards the Great Harbour. They take the stockade which is intended to intercept them. After defeating the Syracusans they fall into partial confusion themselves.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The latter, having finished their work as far as the cliff, attacked the new Syracusan stockade and ditch. They ordered the ships to sail round from Thapsus into the Great Harbour of the Syracusans; with the first break of day they descended themselves from Epipolae to the level ground; and passing through the marsh where the soil was clay and firmer than the rest, over planks and gates which they laid down, they succeeded at sunrise in taking nearly the whole of the stockade and the ditch, and the remainder not long afterwards.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A battle took place in which the Athenians were victorious, and the Syracusans on the right wing fled to the city, those on the left along the river. The three hundred chosen Athenian troops pressed on at full speed towards the bridge, intending to stop their passage, but the Syracusans, fearing that they would be cut off, and having most of their horsemen on the spot, turned upon the three hundred, and putting them to flight, charged the right wing of the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The panic now extended to the whole division<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">fulh/.</foreign></note> at the extremity of the wing.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Lamachus saw what had happened, and hastened to the rescue from his own place on the left wing, taking with him a few archers and the Argive troops; but pressing forward across a certain ditch he and a few who had followed him were cut off from the rest, and he fell with five or six others. The Syracusans hastily snatched up their bodies, and carried them across the river out of the reach of the enemy. But when they saw <pb n="259"/> the rest of the Athenian army advancing towards them they retreated.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="102" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the Syracusans who fled first into the city, observing the resistance made by the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Meanwhile the Syracusans attack the deserved walls on Epipolae, which are only saved Nicias setting fire to some timber and engines.</hi></note> left wing, took courage, and coming out drew up against that part of the Athenian line which was opposed to them. They also sent a detachment against the wall of circumvallation<note anchored="yes">Or 'the circle.'</note> on Epipolae, supposing that it was undefended, and might be taken.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They did indeed take and demolish the outwork, which was about a thousand feet in length; but Nicias, who happened to have been left there because he was ill, saved the lines<note anchored="yes">Or 'the circle.'</note> themselves. He commanded the attendants of the camp to set fire to the engines and to the timber which had been left lying in front of the wall, for being without troops he knew that there was no other way of escape.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The expedient succeeded; and in consequence of the fire the Syracusans gave up the attack. The Athenian army too was now hastening from the plain to the surrounding wall<note anchored="yes">Or 'the circle.'</note>, with the intention of beating off the enemy; while the ships, as they had been ordered, were sailing from Thapsus into the Great Harbour.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Syracusans on the heights, seeing this combined movement, quickly retreated, together with the rest of the army, into the city, thinking that with their present force they were no longer able to prevent the completion of the line of wall towards the sea.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Provisions came to their army in abundance from various parts of Italy. Many of the Sicel tribes who had hitherto been hesitating now joined the Athenians, and three penteconters came from the Tyrrhenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Everything began to answer to their hopes. The Syracusans despaired of saving the city by arms, for no help reached them even from Peloponnesus. Within the walls they were talking of peace, and they began to enter into communications with Nicias, who, now that Lamachus was dead, had the sole command.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But no definite result was attained; although, as might be expected when men began to feel the pressure of the siege and their own helplessness, many proposals were made to him, and many more were discussed in the city. Their calamities even made them suspicious of one another; accordingly they deposed their generals, attributing the misfortunes which had befallen the city since they were appointed either to their ill-luck or to their treachery. In their room they chose Heraclides, Eucles, and Tellias.

They were alarmed at the reports which were continually pouring in, all false, but all agreeing that the Athenian lines round Syracuse were now complete. Gylippus had no longer any hope of Sicily, but thought that he might save Italy; so he and Pythen the Corinthian sailed across the Ionian Gulf to Tarentum as fast as they could, taking two Laconian and two Corinthian ships. The Corinthians were to man ten ships of their own, two Leucadian, and three Ambracian, and to follow. Gylippus on his arrival at Tarentum went on a mission to Thurii, of which his father had formerly been a citizen;

He was caught in the Terinaean gulf<note anchored="yes">See note.</note> by a wind which in this region blows violently and steadily from the north, and was carried into the open sea. After experiencing a most violent storm he returned to Tarentum, where he drew up those of his ships which had suffered in the gale and refitted them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Nicias heard of his approach, but despised the small number of his ships; in this respect he was like the Thurians.

					Hitherto they had only gone out on marauding expeditions from Pylos; when they landed, it was not upon the shores of Laconia, but upon other parts of the Peloponnese; and they had merely fought as the allies of the Argives and Mantineans. The Argives had often urged them just to land soldiers on Lacedaemonian ground, and to waste some part of Laconia, however small, without remaining, and they had refused. But now, under the command of Pythodorus, Laespodias, and Demaratus, they landed at Epidaurus Limera, Prasiae, and other places, and wasted the country. Thereby the Athenians at last gave the Lacedaemonians a right to complain of them and completely justified measures of retaliation.

They now learned the truth, that Syracuse was not as yet completely invested, but that an army might still enter by way of Epipolae. So they considered whether they should steer their course to the left or to the right of Sicily. They might attempt to throw themselves into Syracuse by sea, but the risk would be great; or they might go first to Himera, and gathering a force of the Himeraeans, and of any others whom they could induce to join them, make their way by land.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They determined to sail to Himera, especially as the straits were unguarded. Nicias, when he heard that they were at Locri, although he had despised them at first, now sent out four Athenian ships to intercept them; but these had not as yet arrived at Rhegium, and came too late.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So they sailed through the strait and, touching by the way at Rhegium and Messen&egrave;, reached Himera. They persuaded the Himeraeans to make common cause with them, and not only to join in the expedition themselves, but to supply arms to all their unarmed sailors, for they had beached their ships at Himera.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They then sent to the Selinuntians and told them to come and meet them with their whole army at an appointed place. The Geloans and certain of the Sicels also promised to send them a small force; the latter with the more alacrity because Archonides, a Sicel king in these parts who was a powerful man and <pb n="263"/> friendly to the Athenians, had recently died, and because Gylippus seemed to have come from Lacedaemon with hearty good-will.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And so, taking with him about seven hundred of his own sailors and marines for whom he had obtained arms, about a thousand Himeraean infantry, heavy and light-armed included, and a hundred Himeraean horsemen, some light-armed troops and cavalry from Selinus, a few more from Gela, and of the Sicels about a thousand in all, Gylippus marched towards Syracuse.

Gongylus, one of the Corinthian commanders, who started last in a single ship, arrived at Syracuse before the rest of the fleet, and a little before Gylippus. He found the citizens on the point of holding an assembly at which the question of peace was to be discussed;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>from this intention he dissuaded them by the encouraging announcement that more ships, and Gylippus the son of Cleandridas, whom the Lacedaemonians had sent to take the command, were on their way.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Whereupon the Syracusans were reassured, and at once went forth with their whole army to meet Gylippus, who, as they were informed, was now close at hand. He had shortly before captured the Sicel fort Geta on his march, and drawing up his men in readiness to fight, came to Epipolae, which he ascended by the Euryelus;

Along the remainder of the line <pb n="264"/> of wall, which extended towards Trogilus and the northern sea, the stones were mostly lying ready; a part was halffinished, a part had been completed and left. So near was Syracuse to destruction.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians, though at first disconcerted by the sudden advance of Gylippus and the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Gylppus and the Syracusans offer battle to Nicias on Epipolae, but as Nicias remains by the Athenian lines they soon withdraw.

He halted as he approached, and sent a herald to them offering a truce if they were willing to quit Sicily within five days taking what belonged to them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But they despised his offer, and sent away the herald without an answer. Whereupon both armies set themselves in order of battle.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Gylippus, seeing that the Syracusans were in confusion, and could with difficulty form, led back his troops to the more open ground. Nicias did not follow, but lay still, close to his own wall. When Gylippus observed that the Athenians remained where they were, he led away his army to the height called Temenites; there they passed the night.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>On the following day he stationed the greater part of his troops in front of the Athenian wall that the enemy might not despatch a force to any other point, and then sent a detachment against the fort of Labdalum, which was out of sight of the Athenian lines.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Towards the sea the Athenian <pb n="265"/> wall was now completed, and their forces had come up to the high ground. Gylippus, knowing that a part of the wall was weak, instantly went by night with his army to attack it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the Athenians, who happened to be passing the night outside the walls, perceived this movement and marched to oppose him; whereupon he at once withdrew. They then raised the weak portion of their wall higher; and guarded it themselves, while they posted the allies on the other parts of the fortification in the places severally assigned to them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Nicias now determined to fortify Plemmyrium, a promontory which runs out opposite the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians by the fortification of Plemmynrum obtain greater command of the harbour; but the removal of the army exposes their foragers to the Syrcusan cavalry.</hi></note> city and narrows the entrance to the Great Harbour.

His forces would then be able to watch the harbour of the Syracusans from a nearer point, whereas they had hitherto been obliged to put out from the further corner of the Great Harbour whenever a Syracusan ship threatened to move. He was inclined to pay more attention than hitherto to naval operations; for since the arrival of Gylippus the Athenian prospects by land were not so encouraging.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Having therefore transferred his ships and a portion of his army to Plemmyrium, he built three forts in which the greater part of the Athenian stores were deposited; and the large boats as well as the ships of war were now anchored at this spot.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The removal was a first and main cause of the deterioration of the crews. For when the sailors went out to procure forage and water, of which there was little, and that only to be obtained from a distance, they were constantly cut off by the Syracusan cavalry, who were masters of the country, a third part of their force having been posted in a village at the Olympieum<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.75">6.75 init.</bibl></note> expressly in order to prevent the enemy at Plemmyrium <pb n="266"/> from coming out and doing mischief.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When he thought that the moment had arrived he offered battle; the two armies met and fought hand to hand between the walls. But there the Syracusan cavalry was useless;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>the Syracusans and their allies were defeated, and received their dead under a flag of truce, while the Athenians raised a trophy. Gylippus then assembled his army and confessed that the fault was his own and not theirs; for by confining their ranks too much between the walls he had rendered useless both their cavalry and their javelinmen. So he would lead them out again.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And he reminded them that in material force they were equal to their enemies, while as for resolution they ought to be far superior.

					<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the first opportunity he led them out again. Nicias and the Athenians had determined that, whether the Syracusans would offer battle or not, they must not allow them to carry on their counter-work. For already it had almost passed the end of the Athenian wall, and if the <pb n="267"/> work advanced any further it would make no difference to the Athenians whether they fought<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>But renewing the conflict on more open ground, were his cavalry can act, he is victorious.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Gylippus before engaging led his heavy-armed further outside the walls than on the former occasion; his cavalry and javelin-men he placed on the flanks of the Athenians in the open space between the points at which their respective lines of walls stopped.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In the course of the battle the cavalry attacked the left wing of the Athenians which was opposed to them, and put them to flight; the defeat became general, and the whole Athenian army was driven back by main force within their lines.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>On the following night the Syracusans succeeded in carrying their wall past the works of the enemy. Their operations were now no longer molested by them, and the Athenians, whatever success they might gain in the field, were utterly deprived of all hope of investing the city.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After we had engaged the Syracusans, against whom you sent us, in several battles, and conquered in most of them, and had raised the lines within which we are now stationed, Gylippus a Lacedaemonian arrived, bringing an army from Peloponnesus and from certain of the cities of Sicily. In the first engagement he was defeated by us, but on the following day we were overcome by numerous horsemen and javelin-men, and retired within our lines.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>We have therefore desisted from our siege-works and remain idle, since we are overpowered by the superior numbers of the enemy, and indeed cannot bring our whole army into the field, for the defence of our wall absorbs a large part of our heavy-armed. The enemy meanwhile have built a single wall which crosses ours, and we cannot now invest them, unless a large army comes up and takes this crosswall.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So that we, who are supposed to be the besiegers, are really the besieged<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.29">4.29 init.</bibl></note>, at least by land; and the more so because we cannot go far even into the country, for we are prevented by their horsemen.

				<p>
					<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Moreover they have sent ambassadors to Peloponnesus asking for reinforcements, and Gylippus<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans are seeking reinforcements in Peloponnesus and Sickly, and mean to attack us by ships and crews are in good order; whereas our ships are decaying.</hi></note> has gone to the cities in Sicily intending to solicit those who are at present neutral to join him, and to obtain from his allies fresh naval and land forces.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For they purpose, as I hear, to attack our walls by land, and at the same time <pb n="270"/> to make an effort at sea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And let no one be startled when I say <q direct="unspecified">at sea.</q> Our fleet was originally in first-rate condition: the ships were sound and the crews were in good order, but now, as the enemy are well aware, the timbers of the ships, having been so long exposed to the sea, are soaked, and the efficiency of the crews is destroyed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>We have no means of drawing up our vessels and airing them, because the enemy's fleet is equal or even superior in numbers to our own, and we are always expecting an attack from them. They are clearly trying their strength;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>they can attack us when they please, and they have far greater facilities for drying their ships, since they are not, like us, engaged in a blockade.

Of the foreign sailors, some who were pressed into the service run off at once to the Sicilian cities; others, having been originally attracted by high pay, and fancying that they were going to trade and not to fight, astonished at the resistance which they encounter, and especially at the naval strength of the enemy, either find an excuse for deserting to the Syracusans, or they effect their escape into the country; and Sicily is a large place. Others, again, have persuaded the trierarchs to take Hyccarian slaves in their room while they themselves <pb n="271"/> are busy trading; and thus the precision of the service is lost.

					<milestone n="16" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such was the condition of affairs described in the letter of Nicias.

They also resolved to send a second fleet and an army of Athenians taken from the muster-roll and of allies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As colleagues to Nicias they elected Demosthenes the son of Alcisthenes, and Eurymedon the son of Thucles. Eurymedon was despatched immediately to Sicily about the winter solstice; he took with him ten ships conveying a hundred and twenty.<note anchored="yes">&pound;24,000.</note> talents of silver, and was to tell the army in Sicily that they should receive assistance and should not be neglected.

				<p>
					<milestone n="17" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Demosthenes remained behind, <pb n="273"/> and busied himself in getting ready the expedition which he was to bring out in the spring. He<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians and Peloponnesians get ready their forces.</hi></note> announced to the allies that troops would be required, collected money, and mustered ships, and hoplites at Athens.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians also sent twenty ships to cruise off the Peloponnesian coast and intercept any vessels trying to pass to Sicily from the Peloponnesus or Corinth.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Sicilian envoys<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.7">7.7</bibl>.</note> had now arrived at Corinth, and the Corinthians had heard from them that affairs were looking better in Sicily. Seeing how opportune had been the arrival of the ships which they had already despatched they were more zealous than ever. They prepared to convey hoplites to Sicily in merchant-vessels; the Lacedaemonians were to do the like from Peloponnesus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Corinthians also proceeded to man twenty-five ships of war, intending to hazard a naval engagement against the Athenian squadron stationed at Naupactus. They hoped that, if the attention of the Athenians was diverted by an opposing force, they would be unable to prevent their merchant-vessels from sailing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Lacedaemonians also prepared for their already projected invasion of Attica<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.93">6.93 init.</bibl></note>. They<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians, at the instigation of Alcibiades, prepare to fortify Decelea. In the former war the Lacedaemonians were guilty of violating the treaty; in this he Athenians.</hi></note> were kept to their purpose by the Syracusans and Corinthians, who, having heard of the reinforcements which the Athenians were sending to Sicily, hoped they might be stopped by the invasion, Alcibiades was always at hand insisting upon the importance of fortifying Decelea and of carrying on the war with vigour.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Above all, the Lacedaemonians were inspirited by the thought that the Athenians would be more easily overthrown now that they had two wars on hand, one against themselves, and another against the Sicilians. They considered also that this time they had been the first offenders against the treaty, whereas in the <pb n="274"/> former war the transgression had rather been on their own side. For the Thebans had entered Plataea in time of peace<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.2">2.2 foll.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.56">3.56 init.</bibl></note>, and they themselves had refused arbitration when offered by the Athenians, although the former treaty forbade war in case an adversary was willing to submit to arbitration<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.78">1.78</bibl> fin, 85, 140 med.</note>. They felt that their ill success was deserved, and they took seriously to heart the disasters which had befallen them at Pylos and elsewhere.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But now the Athenians with a fleet of thirty ships had gone forth from Argive territory and ravaged part of the lands of Epidaurus and Prasiae, besides other places<note anchored="yes">Reinforcements leave</note>; marauding expeditions from Pylos were always going on; and whenever quarrels arose about disputed points in the treaty and the Lacedaemonians proposed arbitration, the Athenians refused it. Reflecting upon all this, the Lacedaemonians concluded that the guilt of their former transgression was now shifted to the Athenians, and they were full of warlike zeal.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>During the winter they bade their allies provide iron, and themselves got tools in readiness for the fortification of Decelea. They also prepared, and continually urged the other Peloponnesians to prepare, the succours which they intended to send in merchant-vessels to the Syracusans. And so the winter ended, and with it the eighteenth year in the Peloponnesian War of which Thucydides wrote the history.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the very beginning of the next spring, and earlier than ever before, the Lacedaemonians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians enter Attica and fortify Decelea.</hi></note> and their allies entered Attica under the command of Agis the son of Archidamus the Lacedaemonian king. They first devastated the plain and its neighbourhood.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They then began to fortify Decelea, dividing the work among the cities of the confederacy. Decelea is distant about fourteen miles from Athens, and not much further from Boeotia. The fort was <pb n="275"/> designed for the devastation of the plain and the richest parts of the country, and was erected on a spot within sight of Athens.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>While the Peloponnesians and their allies in Attica were thus engaged, the Peloponnesians at<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Reinforcements leave for Sicily, from which the attenion of the Athenians is diverted by the Corinthians at Naupactus.</hi></note> home were despatching the hoplites in the merchant-vessels to Sicily. The Lacedaemonians selected the best of the Helots and Neodamodes, numbering in all six hundred, and placed them under the command of Eccritus, a Spartan. The Boeotians furnished three hundred hoplites, who were commanded by two Thebans, Xenon and Nicon, and by Hegesander, a Thespian.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>These started first and put out into the open sea from Taenarus in Laconia. Not long afterwards the Corinthians sent five hundred heavy-armed, some of them from Corinth itself, others who were Arcadian mercenaries; they were all placed under the command of Alexarchus, a Corinthian. The Sicyonians also sent with the Corinthians two hundred hoplites under the command of Sargeus, a Sicyonian.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Meanwhile the twenty five ships which the Corinthians had manned in the winter lay opposite to the twenty Athenian ships at Naupactus until the merchant-vessels conveying the heavy-armed troops had got safely off. So the design succeeded, and the attention of the Athenians was diverted from the merchantships to the triremes.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of spring, whilst the Lacedaemonians were fortifying Decelea, the Athenians sent thirty ships under the command<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Charicies with thirty The second armament under Demosthenes masters at Aegina.</hi></note> of Charicles the son of Apollodorus to cruise about Peloponnesus. He was told to touch at Argos, and there to summon and take on board a force of heavy-armed which the Argives, being allies of the Athenians, were bound to furnish.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Meanwhile they despatched under Demosthenes their intended expedition to Sicily: it consisted of sixty <pb n="276"/> Athenian ships and five Chian, twelve hundred heavyarmed Athenians taken from the roll, and as many others as could possibly be obtained from the different islanders; they had also collected from their subject-allies supplies of all sorts for the war. Demosthenes was told first of all to co-operate with Charicles on the coast of Laconia.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So he sailed to Aegina, and there waited until the whole of his armament was assembled and until Charicles had taken on board the Argives.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the same spring and about the same time Gylippus returned to Syracuse, bringing from<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Gylippus and Hermocrates incite the Syracusans to try the sea; they should imitate the daring spirit of their foes.</hi></note> each of the cities which he had persuaded to join him as many troops as he could obtain.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He assembled the Syracusans and told them that they should man as large a fleet as possible and try their fortune at sea; he hoped to obtain a decisive result which would justify the risk.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Hermocrates took the same view, and urged them strongly not to be faint-hearted at the prospect of attacking with their ships. He said that the Athenians had not inherited their maritime skill,<note anchored="yes">Or, ' or been sailors from all time.'</note> and would not retain it for ever<note anchored="yes">Or, ' or been sailors from all time.'</note>; there was a time when they were less of a naval people than the Syracusans themselves<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.14">1.14</bibl>.</note>, but they had been made sailors from necessity by the Persian invasion. To daring men like the Athenians those who emulated their daring were the most formidable foes. The same reckless courage which had often enabled the Athenians, although inferior in power, to strike terror into their adversaries might now be turned against them by the Syracusans.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He was quite sure that if they faced the Athenian navy suddenly and unexpectedly, they would gain more than they would lose; the consternation which they would inspire would more than counterbalance their own inexperience and the superior skill of the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He told them therefore to try what they could do at sea, and <pb n="277"/> not to be timid. Thus under the influence of Gylippus, Hermocrates, and others, the Syracusans, now eager for the conflict, began to man their ships.

				<p>
					<milestone n="22" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the fleet was ready, Gylippus, under cover of night, led forth the whole land-army,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>At dawn Gylippus attacks the forts an Plemmyrium, while their fleet encounters the Athenians in the harbour.</hi></note> intending to attack in person the forts on Plemmyrium. Meanwhile the triremes of the Syracusans, at a concerted signal, sailed forth, thirty-five from the greater harbour and forty-five from the lesser, where they had their arsenal. These latter sailed round into the Great Harbour, intending to form a junction with the other ships inside and make a combined attack on Plemmyrium, that the Athenians, assailed both by sea and land, might be disconcerted.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians however quickly manned sixty ships; and with twenty-five of them engaged the thirty-five of the Syracusans which were in the Great Harbour: with the remainder they encountered those which were sailing round from the arsenal. These two squadrons met at once before the mouth of the Great Harbour: the struggle was long and obstinate, the Syracusans striving to force an entrance, the Athenians to prevent them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="23" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile Gylippus, quite early in the morning, while the Athenians in Plemmyrium who had<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>In the sea-fight the Syracusans are defeated, but the forts are taken</hi></note> gone down to the water-side had their minds occupied by the sea-fight, made a sudden attack upon their forts. He captured the largest of them first, then the two lesser, their garrisons forsaking them when they saw the largest so easily taken.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Those who escaped from the fortress first captured, getting into a merchant-vessel and some boats which were moored at Plemmyrium, found their way to the main station of the Athenians, but with difficulty; for they were chased by a swift trireme, the Syracusans at that time having the advantage in the Great Harbour. But when the two lesser fortresses were taken, the Syracusans <pb n="278"/> were already losing the day, and the fugitives got past them with greater ease.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Syracusan ships which were fighting before the mouth of the harbour, having forced their way through the enemy, entered in disorder, and falling foul of one another gave away the victory to the Athenians, who routed not only these, but also the others by whom they were at first worsted inside the harbour.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Eleven Syracusan ships were disabled; the crews in most of them were slain, in three, made prisoners. The Athenians themselves lost three ships. They now drew to land the wrecks of the Syracusan ships, and erecting a trophy on the little island in front of Plemmyrium returned to their own station.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But although the Syracusans were unsuccessful in the sea-fight, still they had taken the fortresses<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The loss of Plemmyrium disastrous to the Athenians.</hi></note> of Plemmyrium. They erected three trophies, one for each fort. Two out of the three forts they repaired and garrisoned, but one of the two which were captured last they demolished.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Many perished and many prisoners were made at the capture of the forts, and abundant spoil of different kinds was taken, for the Athenians had used them as a store, and much corn and goods of traders were deposited in them; also much property belonging to the trierarchs, including the sails and other fittings of forty triremes which fell into the enemy's hands, and three triremes which had been drawn up on the beach.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The loss of Plemmyrium was one of the greatest and severest blows which befell the Athenians. For now they could no longer even introduce provisions with safety, but the Syracusan ships lay watching to prevent them, and they had to fight for the passage<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.4">7.4 med.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 7.13">13 init.</bibl></note>. General discouragement and dismay prevailed throughout the army.

				<p>
					<milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans next sent out twelve ships under the command of Agatharchus, a Syracusan. One of these <pb n="279"/> hastened to Peloponnesus conveying envoys who were to report their improved prospects, and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans send a third embassy to Peloponnesus, and despatch a squadron which intercepts some Athenian supplies.</hi></note> to urge more strongly than ever the prosecution of the war in Hellas. The remaining eleven sailed to Italy, hearing that ships laden with supplies were on their way to the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They fell in with and destroyed most of these ships, and burnt a quantity of ship-timber which was lying ready for the Athenians in the territory of Caulonia.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then they came to Locri, and while they were at anchor there, one of the merchantvessels from Peloponnesus sailed in, bringing some Thespian hoplites<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.19">7.19 med.</bibl></note>. These the Syracusans took on board, and sailed homewards.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians watched for them near Megara with twenty ships and took one ship with the crew, but the rest made their escape to Syracuse.
				</p>
				<p>There was some skirmishing in the harbour about the palisades which the Syracusans had fixed in the sea in front of their old<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians pull up the palisade which the Syracusans had driven in to protect their ships.</hi></note> dock-houses, that their ships might ride at anchor in the enclosed space, where they could not be struck by the enemy, and would be out of harm's way.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Athenians brought up a ship of ten thousand talents<note anchored="yes">About 250 tons.</note> burden, which had wooden towers and bulwarks;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and from their boats they tied cords to the stakes and<note anchored="yes">Or, 'wrenched them up and broke them off.'</note> wrenched and tore them up<note anchored="yes">Or, 'wrenched them up and broke them off.'</note>; or dived and sawed them through underneath the water. Meanwhile the Syracusans kept up a shower of missiles from the dock-houses, which the men in the ship returned. At length the Athenians succeeded in pulling up most of the palisade.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The stakes which were out of sight were the most dangerous of all, there being some which were so fixed that they did not appear above the <pb n="280"/> water; and no vessel could safely come near. They were like a sunken reef, and a pilot, not seeing them, might easily catch his ship upon them. Even these were sawn off by men who dived for hire; but the Syracusans drove them in again.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Many were the contrivances employed on both sides, as was very natural, when two armies confronted each other at so short a distance.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>There were continual skirmishes, and they practised all kinds of stratagems.

				<p>The Syracusans also sent to the Siciliot cities Corinthan Ambraciot, and Lacedaemonian<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>A second embassy, asking for help, is sent from Syracuse to the cities of Sicily.</hi></note> ambassadors announcing the taking of Plemmyrium, and explaining that in the sea-fight they had been defeated not so much by the superior strength of the enemy as through their own disorder. They were also to report their great hopes of success, and to ask for assistance both by land and sea. They were to add that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements; if they could succeed in destroying the army then in Sicily before these arrived, there would be an end of the war. Such was the course of events in Sicily.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hitherto the invasions had been brief and did not prevent them from getting something from the soil in the interval; but now the Peloponnesians were continually on the spot; and sometimes they were reinforced by additional troops, but always the regular garrison, who were compelled to find their own supplies, overran and despoiled the country. The Lacedaemonian king, Agis, was present in person, and devoted his whole energies to the war. The sufferings of the Athenians were terrible.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For <pb n="282"/> they were dispossessed of their entire territory; more than twenty thousand slaves had deserted<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.40">8.40 med.</bibl></note>, most of them workmen; all their sheep and cattle had perished, and now that the cavalry had to go out every day and make descents upon Decelea or keep guard all over the country, their horses were either wounded by the enemy, or lamed by the roughness of the ground and the incessant fatigue.

Athens was obliged to import everything from abroad, and resembled a fort rather than a city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In the daytime the citizens guarded the battlements by relays; during the night every man was on service except the cavalry; some at their places of arms, others on the wall<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.13">2.13 fin.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 8.69">8.69 init.</bibl></note>, summer and winter alike, until they were quite worn out.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But worse than all was the cruel necessity of maintaining two wars at once; and they carried on both with a determination which no one would have believed unless he had actually seen it. That, blockaded as they were by the Peloponnesians, who had raised a fort in their country, they should refuse to let go Sicily, and, themselves besieged, persevere in the siege of Syracuse, which as a mere city might rank with Athens, and&mdash; whereas the Hellenes generally were expecting at the beginning of the war, some that they would survive a year, others two or perhaps three years, certainly not more, if the Peloponnesians invaded Attica&mdash;that in the seventeenth year from the first invasion, after so exhausting a struggle, the Athenians should have been strong enough and bold enough to go to Sicily at all, and to plunge into a fresh <pb n="283"/> war as great as that in which they were already engaged&mdash; how contrary was all this to the expectation of mankind!
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Through the vast expense thus incurred, above all through the mischief done by Decelea, they were now greatly impoverished. It was at this time that they imposed upon their allies, instead of the tribute, a<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>New financial measure.</hi></note> duty of five per cent. on all things imported and exported by sea, thinking that this would be more productive.

He passed the night unperceived at the temple of Hermes, which is distant from Mycalessus about two miles, and at the dawn of day he assaulted and captured the city, which is not large. The inhabitants were taken off their guard; for they never imagined that an enemy would come and attack them at so great a distance from the sea. The walls were weak, and in some places had fallen down;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>in others they were built low; while the citizens, in their sense of security, had left their gates open. The Thracians dashed into the town, sacked the houses and temples, and slaughtered the inhabitants.

In the retreat itself the Thracians made a very fair defence against the Theban cavalry which first attacked them, running out and closing in again, after the manner of their country; and their loss was trifling.

He requested the generals to send him reinforcements, since his own ships&mdash;eighteen in number&mdash;were not able to give battle against the twenty-five of the enemy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Demosthenes and Eurymedon sent ten ships, the swiftest which they had, to the fleet at Naupactus, while they themselves completed the muster of the expedition. Eurymedon, sailing to Corcyra, ordered the Corcyraeans to man fifteen ships, and himself levied a number of hoplites. He had turned back from his homeward voyage, and was now holding the command, to which, in conjunction with Demosthenes, he had been appointed. Demosthenes meanwhile had been collecting slingers and javelin-men in the neighbourhood of Acarnania.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So when the forces of the Sicilian towns were on their way, the Sicels, complying with the request of the Athenians, set an ambush in three divisions, and falling upon them suddenly when they were off their guard, destroyed about eight hundred of them, and all the envoys except the Corinthian; he brought the survivors, numbering fifteen hundred, to Syracuse.

				<p>After their misfortune in the Sicel country, the Syracusans deferred their intended attack<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenian fleet crosses to Iapygia. They are received at Thunii, here they hold review.</hi></note> for a time.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The forces which Demosthenes and Eurymedon had collected from Corcyra and the mainland were now ready, and they passed over the Ionian Sea to the promontory of Iapygia. Proceeding onwards, they touched <pb n="287"/> at the Iapygian islands called Choerades, and took on board a hundred and fifty Iapygian javelin-men of the Messapian tribe.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After renewing an ancient friendship with Artas, a native prince who had furnished the javelinmen, they went on to Metapontium in Italy. They persuaded the Metapontians, who were their allies, to let them have two triremes and three hundred javelin-men; these they took with them and sailed to Thurii.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At Thurii they found that the party opposed to the Athenians had just been driven out by a revolution.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Wishing to hold another muster and inspection of their whole army, and to be sure that no one was missing, they remained there for some time.

They manned some additional ships, which raised their number nearly to that of the Athenians, and anchored at Erineus off Achaia, which is in the territory of Rhypae.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The bay, off the shore of which they were stationed, has the form of a crescent, and the infantry of the Corinthians and of the allies, which had come from the country on both sides to co-operate with the fleet, was disposed on the projecting promontories. The ships, which were under the command of Polyanthes the Corinthian, formed a close line between the two points.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians sailed out against them from Naupactus with thirty-three ships, under the command of Diphilus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For a while the Corinthians remained motionless; in due time the signal was raised and they rushed upon the Athenians <pb n="288"/> and engaged with them. The battle was long and obstinate.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Three Corinthian ships were destroyed. The Athenians had no ships absolutely sunk, but about seven of them were rendered useless; for they were struck full in front by the beaks of the Corinthian vessels, which had the projecting beams of their prows designedly built thicker, and their bows were stoven in.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The engagement was undecided and both sides claimed the victory; but the Athenians gained possession of the wrecks because the wind blew them towards the open sea and the Corinthians did not put out again. So the two fleets parted. There was no pursuit, nor were any prisoners taken on either side. For the Corinthians and Peloponnesians were fighting close to the land and thus their crews escaped, while on the Athenian side no ship was sunk.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>As soon as the Athenians had returned to Naupactus the Corinthians set up a trophy, insisting that they were the victors, because they had disabled more of the enemy's ships than the enemy of theirs. They refused to acknowledge defeat on the same ground which made the Athenians unwilling to claim the victory. For the Corinthians considered themselves conquerors, if they were not severely defeated; but the Athenians thought that they were defeated because they had not gained a signal victory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>When however the Peloponnesians had sailed away and the land-army was dispersed, the Athenians raised another trophy in Achaia, at a distance of about two miles and a quarter from the Corinthian station at Erineus. Such was the result of the engagement.

So they directed their march down to the sea and passed the night at the mouth of the river, where they were met by their ships. On the following day they re-embarked the army and coasted along, touching at the cities which they passed, with the exception of Locri<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.44">6.44 med.</bibl></note>, until they came to the promontory of Petra near Rhegium.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans, hearing of their approach, desired to have another trial of the fleet, and to<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans make preparations for another sea-fight.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Profiting by the experience which they had acquired in the last sea-fight, they devised several improvements in the construction of their vessels. They cut down and strengthened the prows, and also made the beams which proejected from them thicker; these latter they supported underneath with stays of timber extending from the beams to and through the sides of the ship a length of nine feet within and nine without, after the fashion in which the Corinthians had refitted their prows before they fought with the squadron from Naupactus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Syracusans hoped thus to gain an advantage over the Athenian ships, which were not constructed to resist such improvements, but had their prows slender, because they were in the habit of rowing round an enemy and striking the side of his vessel instead of meeting him prow to prow. The plan would be the more effectual, because they were going to fight in the Great Harbour, where many ships would be crowded in a narrow space. They would charge full in <pb n="290"/> face, and presenting their own massive and solid beaks would stave in the hollow and weak forepart of their enemies' ships<note anchored="yes">Omitting the comma at <foreign lang="greek">au)toi=s.</foreign></note>;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>while the Athenians, confined as they were, would not be able to wheel round them or break their line before striking, to which man&oelig;uvres they mainly trusted&mdash;the want of room would make the one impossible, and the Syracusans themselves would do their best to prevent the other.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>What had hitherto been considered a defect of skill on the part of their pilots, the practice of striking beak to beak, would now be a great advantage, to which they would have constant recourse; for the Athenians, when forced to back water, could only retire towards the land, which was too near, and of which but a small part, that is to say, their own encampment, was open to them. The Syracusans would be masters of the rest of the harbour, and, if the Athenians were hard pressed at any point, they would all be driven together into one small spot, where they would run foul of one another and fall into confusion.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>(Which proved to be the case; for nothing was more disastrous to the Athenians in all these seafights than the impossibility of retreating, as the Syracusans could, to any part of the harbour.) Again, while they themselves had command of the outer sea and could charge from it and back water into it whenever they pleased, the Athenians would be unable to sail into the open and turn before striking<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.91">2.91 med.</bibl></note>; besides, Plemmyrium was hostile to them, and the mouth of the harbour was narrow.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A little before the fleet sailed forth, Gylippus led the land-forces out of the city against that part of the of the city against that part of the <pb n="291"/> Athenian wall which faced Syracuse, while some of the heavy-armed troops, which together with the cavalry and light infantry were stationed at the Olympieum, approached the lines of the enemy from the opposite side. Nearly at the same instant the ships of the Syracusans and their allies sailed out.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians at first thought that they were going to make an attempt by land only, but when they saw the ships suddenly bearing down upon them they were disconcerted. Some mounted the walls or prepared to meet their assailants in front of them; others went out against the numerous cavalry and javelin-men, who were hastening from the Olympieum and the outer side of the wall; others manned the ships or prepared to fight on the beach. When the crews had got on board they sailed out with seventy-five ships; the number of Syracusan ships being about eighty.

Seeing how close the conflict had been, Nicias expected another attack; he therefore compelled the trierarchs to repair their ships wherever they were injured, and anchored merchant-vessels in front of the palisades which the Athenians had driven into the sea so as to form a kind of dock for the protection of their own ships;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>these he placed at a distance of about two hundred feet from one another, in order that any ship which was hard pressed might have a safe retreat and an opportunity of going out again at leisure.

At length Ariston the son of Pyrrhichus, a Corinthian, who was the ablest pilot in the Syracusan fleet, persuaded the commanders to send A message to the proper authorities in the city desiring them to have the market transferred as quickly as possible to the shore, and to compel any one who had food for sale to bring his whole stock thither.

Suddenly the Syracusans backed water and rowed towards the city; then disembarking they at once took their meal on the spot.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians, regarding their retreat as a confession of defeat, disembarked at leisure, and among other matters set about preparing their own meal, taking for granted that there would be no more fighting that day.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Suddenly the Syracusans manned their ships and again bore down upon them; the Athenians, in great disorder and most of them fasting, hurried on board, and with considerable difficulty got under weigh.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For some time the two fleets looked at one another, and did not engage; after a while the Athenians thought they had better not delay until they had fairly tired themselves out, but attack at once.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>So, cheering on one another, they charged and fought. The Syracusans remained firm, and meeting the enemy prow to prow, as they had resolved, stove in by the strength of their beaks <pb n="293"/> a great part of the bows of the Athenian ships. Their javelin-men on the decks greatly injured the enemy. Still more mischief was done by Syracusans who rowed about in light boats and dashed in upon the blades of the enemy's oars, or ran up alongside and threw darts at the sailors.

					<milestone n="41" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>By such expedients as these the Syracusans, who made a great effort, gained the victory; and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians are defeated and return to their moorings with a loss of seven ships.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The ships of the enemy pursued them as far as the entrance, but they were prevented from following further by leaden dolphins, which were suspended aloft from beams placed in the merchantvessels.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Two Syracusan ships, in the exultation of victory, approached too near and were disabled; one of them was taken with its whole crew. The Syracusans damaged many of the Athenian ships and sank seven;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>the crews were either killed or taken prisoners. They then retired and raised trophies of the two sea-fights. They were now quite confident that they were not only equal but far superior to the Athenians at sea, and they hoped to gain the victory on land as well. So they prepared to renew the attack on both elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But in the midst of their preparations Demosthenes and Eurymedon arrived with the Athenian<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>While the Syracusans are making preparation for a fresh attack, Demosthenes arrives. Being determined to strike hard and at once, he plans an attack upon the Syracusan cross-wall by way of the Euryelus.</hi></note> reinforcements. They brought a fleet, including foreign ships, of about seventy-three sail, carrying five thousand heavy infantry of their own and of their allies, numerous javelin-men, slingers, and archers, both Hellenic and Barbarian, and abundant supplies of every kind. The Syracusans and their allies were in consternation.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>It seemed to them as if their perils would never have an end when they saw, notwithstanding the <pb n="294"/> fortification of Decelea, another army arriving nearly equal to the former, and Athens displaying such varied and exuberant strength; while the first Athenian army regained a certain degree of confidence after their disasters. Demosthenes at once saw how matters stood; he knew that there was no time to be lost, and resolved that it should not be with him as it had been with Nicias.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For Nicias was dreaded at his first arrival, but when, instead of at once laying siege to Syracuse, he passed the winter at Catana, he fell into contempt, and his delay gave Gylippus time to come with an army from Peloponnesus. Whereas if he had struck hard at first, the Syracusans would never even have thought of getting fresh troops; strong in their own self-sufficiency, they would have discovered their inferiority only when the city had been actually invested, and then, if they had been sent for reinforcements, they would have found them useless. Demosthenes, reflecting on all this, and aware that he too would never again be in a position to inspire such terror as on the day of his arrival, desired to take the speediest advantage of the panic caused by the appearance of his army.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Accordingly, seeing that the cross-wall of the Syracusans which had prevented the Athenians from investing them was but a single line, and that if he could gain the command of the way up to Epipolae and take the camp which was on the high ground the wall would be easily captured, for no one would so much as stand his ground against them, he resolved to make the attempt at once.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This would be the shortest way of putting an end to the war. If he succeeded, Syracuse would fall into his hands; if he failed, he meant to bring away the expedition;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>he would no longer wear out the Athenian army, and weaken the state to no purpose.
				</p>
				<p>The Athenians began by ravaging the fields of the Syracusans about the Anapus, and regained their former superiority both by sea and land. At sea the Syracusans no longer opposed them; and on land they merely sent <pb n="295"/> out parties of cavalry and javelin-men from the Olympieum.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="43" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before he attacked Epipolae, Demosthenes wished to try what could be done with engines<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Failure of an attempt to take the wall in front. Leaving Nicias in the camp Demosthenes with his army proceeds before midnight by way of the Euryelus to ascend Epipolae; he takes the first fort and drives back Gylippus and his troops, who are amazed at the sudden onset.

But the engines which he brought up were burnt by the enemy, who fought from the wall, and, after making assaults at several points, the Athenian forces were repulsed. He now determined to delay no longer, and persuaded Nicias and his colleagues to carry out the plan of attacking Epipolae.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>To approach during the daytime and ascend the heights undetected appeared to be impossible; so he resolved to attack by night. He ordered provisions for five days, and took with him all the masons and carpenters in the army; also a supply of arrows and of the various implements which would be required for siege-works if he were victorious. About the first watch he, Eurymedon, and Menander led out the whole army and marched towards Epipolae.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Nicias was left in the Athenian fortifications. Reaching Epipolae at the Euryelus, where their first army had originally ascended<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.97">6.97 med.</bibl></note>, and advancing undiscovered by the garrison to the fort which the Syracusans had there erected, they took it and killed some of the guards.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But the greater number made good their escape and carried the news to the three fortified camps, one of the Syracusans, one of the other Sicilian Greeks, and one of the allies, which had been formed on Epipolae; they also gave the alarm to the six hundred who were an advanced guard stationed on this part of Epipolae<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.96">6.96 fin.</bibl></note>. They hastened to meet the enemy, but Demosthenes and the Athenians came upon them and, in spite of <pb n="296"/> a vigorous resistance, drove them back.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Athenians immediately pressed forward; they were determined not to lose a moment or to slacken their onset until they had accomplished their purpose. Others captured the first part of the Syracusan counter-wall and, the guards taking to flight, began to drag off the battlements. Meanwhile the Syracusans, the allies, and Gylippus with his own troops, were hurrying from the outworks.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The boldness of this night attack quite amazed them. They had not recovered from their terror when they met the Athenians, who were at first too strong for them and drove them back. But now the conquerors, in the confidence of victory, began to fall into disorder as they advanced;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>they wanted to force their way as quickly as they could through all that part of the enemy which had not yet fought, and they were afraid that if they relaxed their efforts the Syracusans might rally. The Boeotians were the first to make a stand: they attacked the Athenians, turned, and put them to flight.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The whole army was soon in utter confusion, and the perplexity was so great that from<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>All now becomes confusion. Those behind press on those before, who are already turning back. The moonlight, the dense masses, the narrow space, the watch-word, the Paean, contribute to the rout.

But in a night engagement, like this in which two great armies fought&mdash;the only one of the kind which occurred during the war&mdash;who could be certain of anything?
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The moon was bright, and they saw before them, as men naturally would in the moonlight, the figures of one another, but were unable to distinguish with certainty who was friend or foe. Large bodies of heavy-armed troops, both Athenian and Syracusan, were moving about in a narrow space;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>of the <pb n="297"/> Athenians some were already worsted, while others, still unconquered, were carrying on the original movement. A great part of their army had not yet engaged, but either had just mounted the heights, or were making the ascent; and no one knew which way to go. For in front they were defeated already; there was nothing but confusion, and all distinction between the two armies was lost by reason of the noise.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The victorious Syracusans and their allies, who had no other means of communication in the darkness, cheered on their comrades with loud cries as they received the onset of their assailants. The Athenians were looking about for each other; and every one who met them, though he might be a friend who had turned and fled, they imagined to be an enemy. They kept constantly asking the watchword (for there was no other mode of knowing one another), and thus they not only caused great confusion among themselves by all asking at once, but revealed the word to the enemy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The watchword of the Syracusans was not so liable to be discovered, because being victorious they kept together and were more easily recognized. So that when they were encountered by a superior number of the enemy they, knowing the Athenian watchword, escaped;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>but the Athenians in a like case, failing to answer the challenge, were killed. Most disastrous of all were the mistakes caused by the sound of the Paean, which, the same being heard in both armies, was a great source of perplexity. For there were in the battle Argives, Corcyraeans, and other Dorian allies of the Athenians, and when they raised the Paean they inspired as much alarm as the enemy themselves;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>so that in many parts of the army, when the confusion had once begun, not only did friends terrify friends and citizens their fellow-citizens whom they had encountered, but they attacked one another, and were with difficulty disentangled.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The greater number of those who were pursued and killed perished by throwing themselves from the cliffs; for the descent from Epipolae is by a narrow path. The fugitives <pb n="298"/> who reached the level ground, especially those who had served in the former army and knew the neighbourhood, mostly escaped to the camp. But of the newly-arrived many missed their way, and, wandering about until daybreak, were then cut off by the Syracusan cavalry who were scouring the country.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A considerable number of them and of their allies had fallen; there were however more arms taken than there were bodies of the slain; for those who were compelled to leap from the heights, whether they perished or not, had thrown away their shields.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the Athenian generals, troubled by their recent defeat and the utter discouragement<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Athenian council of war. There is sickness in the camp and the soldiers are dispirited. Demosthenes votes for immediate departure.</hi></note> which prevailed in the army, held a council of war. They saw that their attempts all failed, and that the soldiers were weary of remaining. For they were distressed by sickness, proceeding from two causes:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>the season of the year was that in which men are most liable to disease; and the place in which they were encamped was damp and unhealthy. And they felt that the situation was in every way hopeless. Demosthenes gave his voice against remaining;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>he said that the decisive <pb n="299"/> attack upon Epipolae had failed, and, in accordance with his original intention, he should vote for immediate departure while the voyage was possible, and while, with the help of the ships which had recently joined them, they had the upper hand at any rate by sea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>It was more expedient for the city that they should make war upon the Peloponnesians, who were raising a fort in Attica, than against the Syracusans, whom they could now scarcely hope to conquer; and there was no sense in carrying on the siege at a vast expense and with no result. This was the opinion of Demosthenes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="48" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nicias in his own mind took the same gloomy view of their affairs; but he did not wish openly<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Nicias, who is partly swayed by information from Syracuse, is in his own mind undecided.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He had moreover still some reason to suppose that the Syracusans, of whose condition he was better informed than the other generals, were likely to be worse off than themselves if they would only persevere in the siege; they would be worn out by the exhaustion of their resources; and now the Athenians with their additional ships had much greater command of the sea.-There was a party in Syracuse itself which wanted to surrender the city to the Athenians, and they kept sending messages to Nicias and advising him not to depart. Having this information he was still wavering and considering, and had not made up his mind.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But in addressing the council he positively refused to withdraw the army; he knew, he said, that the Athenian people would not forgive their departure if they left without an order from home. The men upon whose votes their fate would depend would not, like themselves, have seen <pb n="300"/> with their own eyes the state of affairs; they would only have heard the criticisms of others, and would be convinced by any accusations which a clever speaker might bring forward<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.38">3.38 med.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Indeed many or most of the very soldiers who were now crying out that their case was desperate would raise the opposite cry when they reached home, and would say that the generals were traitors, and had been bribed to depart; and therefore he, knowing the tempers of the Athenians,<note anchored="yes">Or, 'would for his own part rather take his chance, and fall, if he must, by the hands of the enemy, like any private soldier, than die.'</note> would for his own part rather take his chance and fall, if he must, alone by the hands of the enemy, than die<note anchored="yes">Or, 'would for his own part rather take his chance, and fall, if he must, by the hands of the enemy, like any private soldier, than die.'</note> unjustly on a dishonourable charge at the hands of the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And, after all, the Syracusans were in a condition worse than their own; for they had to maintain mercenary troops; they were spending money on garrisons, and had now kept up a large navy for a whole year; already in great difficulties, they would soon be in greater; they had expended two thousand talents<note anchored="yes">&pound;40,000.</note>, and were heavily in arrear; and if by a failure in the pay they suffer any diminution of their present forces their affairs would be ruined. For they depended on mercenaries, who, unlike the Athenian allies, were under no compulsion to serve.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Therefore, he said, they ought to persevere in the siege, and not go away d disheartened by the greatness of the expense, for they were far richer than the enemy<note anchored="yes">Or, disheartened at the idea of the enemy's riches; for they were far richer themselves.'</note>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="49" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nicias spoke thus decidedly because he knew exactly how matters stood in Syracuse; he<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Demosthenes and Eurymedon at first insist that the expedition shall leave Syracuse and encamp elsewhere, but they afterwards hesitate, believing that Nicias has some secret reason for remaining.</hi></note> was aware of their want of money, and of the secret existence of that party within the walls which wished well to the Athenians, and was continually sending word to him not to depart;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and the confidence in his navy, if not in his army, which now possessed him <pb n="301"/> was greater than ever. But Demosthenes would not hear for an instant of persisting in the siege; if, he said, the army must remain and ought not to be removed without a vote of the assembly, then they should retire to Thapsus or Catana, whence they might overrun the whole country with their land-forces, maintaining themselves at the expense of the enemy and doing him great damage. They would thus fight their battles, not cooped up in the harbour, which gave an advantage to the enemy, but in the open sea, where their skill would be available and their charges and retreats would not be circumscribed by the narrow space which now hampered their movements whenever they had to put in or out.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In a word, he wholly disapproved of the Athenians continuing in their present position; they should with all speed break up the siege and be gone.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Eurymedon took the same side. Still Nicias resisted; there was delay and hesitation, and a suspicion that he might have some ground which they did not know for his unwillingness to yield. And so the Athenians stayed on where they were.

But Gylippus brought back a large army, together with the hoplites who had been sent in merchant-vessels from Peloponnesus in the spring<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.19">7.19</bibl>.</note>, and had come by way of Libya to Selinus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They had been driven to Libya by stress of weather, and the Cyrenaeans had given them two triremes and pilots. On their voyage they had made common cause with the Evesperitae, who were besieged by the Libyans. <pb n="302"/>
				</p>
				<p>After defeating the Libyans they sailed on to Neapolis, a Carthaginian factory which is the nearest point to Sicily, the passage taking two days and a night only; thence they crossed and came to Selinus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>On their arrival, the Syracusans immediately prepared to renew their attack upon the Athenians, both by land and sea. And the Athenian generals, seeing that their enemy had been reinforced by a new army, and that their own affairs, instead of improving, were daily growing worse in every respect, and being especially troubled by the sickness of their troops, repented that they had not gone before. Even Nicias now no longer objected, but only made the condition that there should be no open voting. So, maintaining such secrecy as they could, they gave orders for the departure of the expedition; the men were to prepare themselves against a given signal.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The preparations were made and they were on the point of sailing, when the moon, being just then at the full, was eclipsed. The mass of the army was greatly moved, and called upon the generals to remain. Nicias himself, who was too much under the influence of divination and such like, refused even to discuss the question of their removal until they had remained thrice nine days, as the soothsayers prescribed. This was the reason why the departure of the Athenians was finally delayed.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So they manned their ships and exercised for as many days as they thought <pb n="303"/> sufficient. When the time came they began by attacking the Athenian lines. A small number both of the hoplites and of the cavalry came out of some of the gates to meet them; they cut off however a portion of the hoplites, and, putting the main body to flight, drove them within their walls.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Eurymedon, who commanded the right wing of the Athenians, hoping to surround the enemy, extended his line too far towards the land, and was defeated by the Syracusans, who, after overcoming the Athenian centre, cooped him up in the inner bay of the harbour. There he was slain, and the vessels which were under his command and had followed him were destroyed. The Syracusans now pursued and began to drive ashore the rest of the Athenian fleet.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Tyrrhenians, who guarded this part of the Athenian lines, seeing Gylippus and his forces advance in disorder, rushed out, and attacking the foremost put them to flight, and drove them into the marsh called Lysimelea.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then, hoping to burn the remainder of the fleet, they procured an old merchant-vessel, which they filled with faggots and brands; these they lighted, and as the wind blew right upon the enemy they let the ship go.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>I will now enumerate the various peoples who came to Sicily as friends or enemies, to share<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Athenian allies.</hi></note> either in the conquest or in the defence of the country, and who fought before Syracuse<note anchored="yes">Adopting the conjecture <foreign lang="greek">Surakou/sais.</foreign></note>, choosing their side, not so much from a sense of right, or from obligations of kinship, as from the accident of compulsion or of their own interest.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians themselves, who were Ionians, went of their own free will against the Syracusans,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>(A) In Hellas proper.</hi></note> who were Dorians; they were followed by the Lemnians and Imbrians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.28">4.28</bibl>, n.</note> and the then inhabitants of Aegina<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.27">2.27 med.</bibl></note>, and by the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>(i) Their own settlers .</hi></note> Hestiaeans dwelling at Hestiaea in Euboea<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.115">1.115 fin.</bibl></note>: all these were their own colonists, speaking the same language with them, and retaining the same institutions.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Of the rest who joined in the expedition, some were subjects, others independent allies,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>(ii) Subjects, mostly tributaries, who were</hi> (1) <hi>Ionians.</hi></note> some again mercenaries.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Of the subjects and tributaries, the Eretrians, Chalcidians, Styreans, and Carystians came from Euboea; the Ceans, Andrians, and Tenians from the islands; the Milesians, Samians, and Chians from Ionia. Of these however the Chians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.85">6.85 med.</bibl></note> were independent, and instead of paying tribute, provided ships. All or nearly all were Ionians and descendants of the Athenians, with the exception of the Carystians, who are Dryopes. They were subjects and constrained to follow, but still they were Ionians fighting against Dorians. There were also Aeolians, namely, the Methymnaeans<note anchored="yes">Cp. iii. 50 med.; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.85">6.85 med.</bibl></note>,<note type="margin" anchored="yes">(2) <hi>Aeolians partly subjects.</hi></note> who furnished ships but were not tributaries, and the Tenedians and Aenians, who paid <pb n="307"/> tribute.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>These Aeolians were compelled to fight against their Aeolian founders, the Boeotians, who formed part of the Syracusan army. The Plataeans were the only Boeotians opposed to Boeotians, a natural result of mutual hatred. The Rhodians and Cytherians were both Dorians; the Cytherians, although<note type="margin" anchored="yes">(3) <hi>Dorians, kindred against kindred.</hi></note> Lacedaemonian colonists, bore arms in the Athenian cause against the Lacedaemonians who came with Gylippus;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and the Rhodians, though by descent Argive, were compelled to fight against the Syracusans, who were Dorians, and against the Geloans, who were actually their own colony<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.4">6.4 med.</bibl></note>, and were taking part with Syracuse. Of the islanders around Peloponnesus, the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>(iii) Allies called independent, who were really compelled: either</hi> (1) <hi>islanders, or</hi> (2) <hi>cities having special enmities.</hi></note> Cephallenians and Zacynthians were independent<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.7">2.7 fin.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.85">6.85 med.</bibl></note>; still, being islanders, they followed under a certain degree of constraint;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>for the Athenians were masters of the sea. The Corcyraeans, who were not only Dorians but actually Corinthians, were serving against Corinthians and Syracusans, although they were the colonists of the one and the kinsmen of the other; they followed under a decent appearance of compulsion, but quite readily, because they hated the Corinthians<note anchored="yes">Cp. i. 25 med.</note>. The Messenians too, as the inhabitants of Naupactus were now called, including the garrison of Pylos, which was at that time held by the Athenians, were taken by them to the war.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>A few Megarians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.74">4.74</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.43">6.43 fin.</bibl></note>, having the misfortune to be exiles, were thus induced to fight against the Selinuntians, who were Megarians like themselves<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.4">6.4 init.</bibl></note>.
				</p>
				<p>The service of the remaining allies was voluntary.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>The Argives<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.43">6.43</bibl>.</note>, not so much because they<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Voluntary allies.</hi></note> were allies of Athens, as owing to their hatred of the Lacedaemonians, and the desire of each man <pb n="308"/> among them to better himself at the time, followed the Athenians, who were Ionians, being themselves Dorians, to fight against Dorians. The Mantineans and other Arcadians were mercenaries accustomed to attack any enemy who from time to time might be pointed out to them, and were now ready, if they were paid, to regard the Arcadians, who were in the service of the Corinthians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.19">7.19 fin.</bibl></note>, as their enemies. The Cretans and Aetolians also served for hire; the Cretans, who had once joined with the Rhodians in the foundation of Gela<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.4">6.4 med.</bibl></note>; came with reluctance; nevertheless for pay they consented to fight against their own colonists.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Some of the Acarnanians came to aid their Athenian allies, partly from motives of gain, but much more out of regard for Demosthenes<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.105">3.105 foll.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.31">7.31 fin.</bibl></note> and good-will to Athens. All these dwelt on the eastern side of the Ionian Gulf.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Of the Hellenes in Italy, the Thurians and Metapontians, constrained by the necessities of a<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>(B) Allies in Italy and Sicily, including barbarians.</hi></note> revolutionary period, joined in the enterprise; of the Hellenes in Sicily, the Naxians and Catanaeans. Of Barbarians, there were the Egestaeans, who invited the expedition, and the greater part of the Sicels, and, besides native Sicilians, certain Tyrrhenians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.103">6.103 med.</bibl></note> who had a quarrel with the Syracusans; also Iapygians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.33">7.33 med.</bibl></note>, who served for hire. These were the nations who followed the Athenians.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="58" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans, on the other hand, were assisted by the Camarinaeans, who were their<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Syracusan allies (i) Inhabitants of Sicily,</hi> (1) <hi>from the southern,</hi> (2) <hi>from the northern district.</hi></note> nearest neighbours, and by the Geloans, who dwelt next beyond them;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and then (for the Agrigentines, who came next, were neutral) by the still more distant Selinuntians. All these inhabited the region of Sicily which lies towards Libya. On the side looking towards <pb n="309"/> the Tyrrhenian Gulf the Himeraeans, the only Hellenic people in those parts, were also their only allies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>These were the Hellenic peoples in Sicily who fought on the side of the Syracusans; they were Dorians and independent. As for Barbarians, they had only such of the Sicels as had not gone over to the Athenians.
				</p>
				<p>Of Hellenes who were not inhabitants of Sicily, the Lacedaemonians provided a Spartan<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>(ii) Inhabitants of Hellas Proper.</hi></note> general; the Lacedaemonian forces were all Neodamodes and Helots. (The meaning of the word Neodamode is freedman.) The Corinthians were the only power which furnished both sea and land forces. Their Leucadian and Ambraciot kinsmen accompanied them; from Arcadia came mercenaries sent by Corinth; there were also Sicyonians who served under compulsion<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.81">5.81 med.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 6.19">6.19 fin.</bibl></note>;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and of the peoples beyond the Peloponnese, some Boeotians.&mdash;This external aid however was small compared with the numerous troops of all kinds which the Sicilian Greeks themselves supplied; for they dwelt in great cities, and had mustered many ships and horses and hoplites, besides a vast multitude of other troops. And again, the proportion furnished by the Syracusans themselves was greater than that of all the rest put together; their city was the largest, and they were in the greatest danger.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="59" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Such were the allies who were assembled on both sides. At that time they were all on the spot,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>These were all.</hi></note> and nothing whatever came afterwards to either army.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Syracusans and the allies naturally thought that the struggle would be brought to a<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans begin to close the harbour.</hi></note> glorious end if, after having defeated the Athenian fleet, they took captive the whole of their great armament, and did not allow them to escape either by sea or land.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So they at once began to close the mouth of the Great Harbour, which was about a mile wide, by <pb n="310"/> means of triremes, merchant-vessels, and small boats, placed broadside, which they moored there. They also made every preparation for a naval engagement, should the Athenians be willing to hazard another; and all their thoughts were on a grand scale.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="60" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians, seeing the closing of the harbour and inferring the intentions of the enemy,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians prepare for a last struggle. They withdraw from the higher ground, and determine to fight their way out by sea, or if defeated, by land.</hi></note> proceeded to hold a council.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The generals and officers met and considered the difficulties of their position. The most pressing of all was the want of food. For they had already sent to Catana, when they intended to depart, and stopped the supplies for the present; and they could get no more in the future unless they recovered the command of the sea. They resolved therefore to quit their lines on the higher ground and to cut off by a cross-wall a space close to their ships, no greater than was absolutely required for their baggage and for their sick; after leaving a guard there they meant to put on board every other man, and to launch all their ships, whether fit for service or not; they would then fight a decisive battle, and, if they conquered, go to Catana; but if not, they would burn their ships, and retreat by land in good order, taking the nearest way to some friendly country, Barbarian or Hellenic.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This design they proceeded to execute, and withdrawing quietly from the upper walls manned their whole fleet, compelling every man of any age at all suitable for service to embark.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The entire number of the ships which they manned was about a hundred and ten. They put on board numerous archers and javelin-men, Acarnanians, and other foreigners, and made such preparations for action as their difficult situation and the nature of their plan<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Nicias, seeing the dejection of his soldiers, strives to encourage them.</hi></note> allowed.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When all was nearly ready, Nicias, perceiving that his men were depressed by their severe defeat at sea, which was so new an experience to them, while at the <pb n="311"/> same time the want of provisions made them impatient to risk a battle with the least possible delay, called the whole army together, and before they engaged exhorted them as follows:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="61" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Soldiers of Athens and of our allies, we have all the same interest in the coming struggle<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.68">6.68 init.</bibl></note>;<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>If we win we nay see our homes once more. We are not mere tyros, and ought not to be cast down by reverses.</hi></note> every one of us as well as of our enemies will now have to fight for his life and for his country, and if only we can win in the impending sea-fight, every one may see his native city and his own home once more.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But we must not be faint-hearted, nor behave as if we were mere novices in the art of war, who when defeated in their first battle are full of cowardly apprehensions and continually retain the impress of their disaster.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>You, Athenians, have had great military experience; and you, allies, are always fighting at our side. Remember the sudden turns of war; let your hope be that fortune herself may yet come over to us; and prepare to retrieve your defeat in a manner worthy of the greatness of your own army which you see before you<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.68">6.68 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.77">7.77 med.</bibl></note>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'We have consulted the pilots about any improvements which seemed likely to avail against<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>We arcing to fight a land-battle at sea; and have new devices suggested our recent experience.</hi></note> the crowding of ships in the narrow harbour, as well as against the force on the enemy's decks, which in previous engagements did us so much harm, and we have adopted them as far as we had the means.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Many archers and javelin-men will embark, and a great number of other troops, whom if we were going to fight in the open sea we should not employ because they increase the weight of the ships, and therefore impede our skill; but here, where we are obliged to fight a landbattle on ship-board<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.49">1.49 init.</bibl></note>, they will be useful.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>We have <pb n="312"/> thought of all the changes which are necessary in the construction of our ships, and in order to counteract the thickness of the beams on the enemy's prows, for this did us more mischief than anything else, we have provided iron grapnels, which will prevent any ship striking us from getting off if the marines are quick and do their duty.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For, as I tell you, we are positively driven to fight a land-battle on ship-board, and our best plan is neither to back water ourselves nor to allow the enemy to back water after we have once closed with him. Recollect that the shore, except so far as our land-forces extend, is in their hands.

					<milestone n="63" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Knowing all this, you must fight to the last with all your strength, and not be driven ashore.<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>To the soldiers I say: When once engaged you must not separate until you have swept the enemy's decks.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I am speaking to the hoplites rather than to the sailors; for this is the special duty of the men on deck. We may still reckon on the superiority of infantry.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The sailors I would exhort, nay I would implore them, not to be paralysed by their disasters; for they will find the arrangements on deck improved, and the numbers of the fleet increased. Some among you have long been deemed Athenians, though they are not; and to them I say, Consider how precious is that privilege, and how worthy to be defended. You were admired in Hellas because you spoke our language and adopted our manners, and you shared equally with ourselves in the substantial advantages of our empire, while you gained even more than we by the dread which you inspired in subject-states and in your security against wrong.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>You alone have been free partners in that empire; you ought not to betray it now. And so, despising the Corinthians whom you have beaten again and again, and the Sicilians who never dared <pb n="313"/> to withstand us when our fleet was in its prime, repel your enemies, and show that your skill even amid weakness and disaster is superior to the strength of another in the hour of his success.

In any event but victory your enemies here will instantly sail against Athens, while our countrymen at home, who are but a remnant, will be unable to defend themselves against the attacks of their former foes reinforced by the new invaders. You who are in Sicily will instantly fall into the hands of the Syracusans (and you know how you meant to deal with them), and your friends at Athens into the hands of the Lacedaemonians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In this one struggle you have to fight for yourselves and them. Stand firm therefore now, if ever, and remember one and all of you who are embarking that you are both the fleet and army of your country, and that on you hangs the whole state and the great name of Athens: for her sake if any man exceed another in skill or courage let him display them now; he will never have a better opportunity of doing good to himself and saving his country.'

					<milestone n="65" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Nicias, as soon as he had done speaking, gave orders to man the ships. Gylippus and the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Syracusans meet the Athenian improvements with counter improvements. Gylippus exhorts them.</hi></note> Syracusans could see clearly enough from the preparations which the Athenians were making that they were going to fight. But they had also previous notice, and had been told of the iron grapnels;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and they took precautions against this as against all the other devices of the Athenians. They covered the prows of their vessels with hides, extending a good way along the upper part of their sides, so that the grapnels might <pb n="314"/> slip and find no hold.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When all was ready, Gylippus and the other generals exhorted their men in the following words:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="66" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'That our actions so far have been glorious, and that in the coming conflict we shall be<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Our past victories are a pledge of our future success, as the defeats of the enemy in former engagements are ominous of a defeat in this. They came hither to enslave us with their navy, but now the power of the sea has departed from them to us.</hi></note> fighting for a glorious prize, most of you, Syracusans and allies, seem to be aware: what else would have inspired you with so much energy? But if any one has failed to understand our position, we will enlighten him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians came hither intending to enslave first of all Sicily, and then, if they succeeded, Peloponnesus and the rest of Hellas, they having already the largest dominion of any Hellenic power, past or present. But you set mankind the example of withstanding that invincible navy; which you have now defeated in several engagements at sea, and which you will probably defeat in this.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For when men are crippled in what they assume to be their strength, any vestige of self-respect is more completely lost than if they had never believed in themselves at all. When once their pride has had a fall they throw away the power of resistance which they might still exert. And this we may assume to be the condition of the Athenians.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="67" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>'Far otherwise is it with us. The natural courage, which even in the days of our inexperience<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Success infuses courage. Their new inventions are bad imitations of ours, which they cannot use. Their ships are weighed down with fighting-men. They are simply desperate.</hi></note> dared to risk all, is now better assured, and when we have the further conviction that he is the strongest who has overcome the strongest, the hopes of every one are redoubled. And in all enterprises the highest hopes infuse the greatest courage.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Their imitation of our modes of fighting will be useless to them. To us they come naturally, and we shall readily adapt ourselves to any arrangements of ours which they have borrowed. But to them the employment <pb n="315"/> of troops on deck is a novelty; they will be encumbered with crowds of hoplites and crowds of javelinmen, Acarnanians and others, who are mere awkward landsmen put into a ship, and will not even know how to discharge their darts when they are required to keep their places. Will they not make the ships unsteady? And their own movements will be so unnatural to them that they will all fall into utter confusion.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The greater number of the enemy's ships will be the reverse of an advantage to him, should any of you fear your inequality in that respect; for a large fleet confined in a small space will be hampered in action and far more likely to suffer from our devices.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And I would have you know what I believe on the best authority to be the simple truth. .Their misfortunes paralyse them, and they are driven to despair at finding themselves helpless. They have grown reckless, and have no confidence in their own plans.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>I need not tell you that they are our enemies, and our worst enemies. They came against our land that they might enslave us, and if they had succeeded they would have inflicted the greatest sufferings on our men, and the worst indignities upon our wives and children, and would have stamped a name of dishonour upon our <pb n="316"/> whole city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Wherefore let no one's heart be softened towards them. Do not congratulate yourselves at the mere prospect of getting safely rid of them. Even if they conquer they can only depart. But supposing that we obtain, as we most likely shall, the fulness of our desires, in the punishment of the Athenians and in the confirmation to Sicily of the liberties which she now enjoys, how glorious will be our prize!

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nicias, overwhelmed by the situation, and seeing how great and how near the peril was (for the ships were on the very point of rowing out), feeling too, as men do on the eve of a great struggle, that all which he had done was nothing, and that he had not said half enough, again addressed the trierarchs, and calling each of them by his father's name, and his own name, and the name of his tribe, he entreated those who had made any reputation for themselves not to be false to it, and those whose ancestors were eminent not to tarnish their hereditary fame. He reminded them that they were the inhabitants of the freest country in the world, and how in Athens there was no interference with the daily life of any man<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.37">2.37</bibl>.</note>. He spoke to them of their wives and children and their fathers' Gods, as men will at such a time; for then they do not care whether their common-place phrases seem to be out of date or not, but loudly reiterate the old appeals, believing that they may be of some service at the awful moment.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When he thought that he had exhorted them, not enough, but as much as the scanty time allowed, he retired, and led <pb n="317"/> the land-forces to the shore, extending the line as far as he could, so that they might be of the greatest use in encouraging the combatants on board ship.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Demosthenes, Menander, and Euthydemus, who had gone on board the Athenian fleet to take the command, now quitted their own station, and proceeded straight to the closed mouth of the harbour, intending to force their way to the open sea where a passage was still left.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans and their allies had already put out with nearly the same number of ships<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Disposition of the Syracusan fleet. The Athenians rush to the mouth of the harbour. The Syracusans bear down upon them. Fury and disorder of the conflict.

Will they fly from the fliers?</hi></note> as before. A detachment of them guarded the entrance of the harbour; the remainder were disposed all round it in such a manner that they might fall on the Athenians from every side at once, and that their land-forces might at the same time be able to co-operate wherever the ships retreated to the shore. Sicanus and Agatharchus commanded the Syracusan fleet, each of them a wing; Pythen and the Corinthians occupied the centre.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When the Athenians approached the closed mouth of the harbour the violence of their onset overpowered the ships which were stationed there; they then attempted to loosen the fastenings. Whereupon from all sides the Syracusans and their allies came bearing down upon them, and the conflict was no longer confined to the entrance, but extended throughout the harbour. No previous engagement had been so fierce and obstinate.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Great was the eagerness with which the rowers on both sides rushed upon their enemies whenever the word of command was given; and keen was the contest between the pilots as they man&oelig;uvred one against another. The marines too were full of anxiety that, when ship struck ship, the service on deck should not fall short of the rest; every one in the place assigned to him was eager to be <pb n="318"/> foremost among his fellows.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Many vessels meeting&mdash;and never did so many fight in so small a space, for the two fleets together amounted to nearly two hundred&mdash;they were seldom able to strike in the regular manner, because they had no opportunity of first retiring or breaking the line; they generally fouled one another as ship dashed against ship in the hurry of flight or pursuit.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>All the time that another vessel was bearing down, the men on deck poured showers of javelins and arrows and stones upon the enemy; and when the two closed, the marines fought hand to hand, and endeavoured to board.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In many places, owing to the want of room, they who had struck another found that they were struck themselves; often two or even more vessels were unavoidably entangled about one, and the pilots had to make plans of attack and defence, not against one adversary only, but against several coming from different sides. The crash of so many ships dashing against one another took away the wits of the crews, and made it impossible to hear the boatswains, whose voices in both fleets rose high, as they gave directions to the rowers, or cheered them on in the excitement of the struggle.

The Sicilian soldier was animated by the hope of increasing the glory which he had already won, while the invader was tormented by the fear that his fortunes might sink lower still.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The last chance of the Athenians lay in their ships, and their anxiety was dreadful. The fortune of the battle varied; and it was not possible that the spectators on the shore should all receive the same impression of it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Being quite close and having different points of view, they would some of them see their own ships victorious; their courage would then revive, and they would earnestly call upon the Gods not to take from them their hope of deliverance. But others, who saw their ships worsted, cried and shrieked aloud, and were by the sight alone more utterly unnerved than the defeated combatants themselves. Others again, who had fixed their gaze on some part of the struggle which was undecided, were in a state of excitement still more terrible; they kept swaying their bodies to and fro in an agony of hope and fear as the stubborn conflict went on and on; for at every instant they were all but saved or all but lost.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And while the strife hung in the balance you might hear in the Athenian army at once lamentation, shouting, cries of victory or defeat, and all the various sounds which are wrung from a great host in extremity of danger. Not less agonising were the feelings of those on board.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At length the Syracusans and their allies, after a protracted struggle, put the Athenians to flight, and triumphantly bearing down upon them, and encouraging one another with loud cries and exhortations, drove them <pb n="320"/> to land.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Then that part of the navy which had not been taken in the deep water fell back in confusion to the shore, and the crews rushed out of the ships into the camp<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.41">7.41 init.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 7.74">74 fin.</bibl></note> And the land-forces, no longer now divided in feeling, but uttering one universal groan of intolerable anguish, ran, some of them to save the ships, others to defend what remained of the wall; but the greater number began to look to themselves and to their own safety. Never had there been a greater panic in an Athenian army than at that moment.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They now suffered what they had done to others at Pylos. For at Pylos the Lacedaemonians, when they saw their ships destroyed, knew that their friends who had crossed over into the island of Sphacteria were lost with them<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.14">4.14 init.</bibl></note>.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians, overwhelmed by their misery, never so much as thought of recovering their wrecks or of asking leave to collect their dead. Their intention was to retreat that very night.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Demosthenes came to Nicias and proposed that they should once more man their remaining vessels and endeavour to force the passage at daybreak, saying that they had more ships fit for service than the enemy. For the Athenian fleet still numbered sixty, but the enemy had less than fifty. Nicias approved of his proposal, and they would have manned the ships, but the sailors refused to embark;

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They thought very much as he did, and wanted to carry out his plan, but doubted whether their men, who were too glad to repose after a great battle, and in time of festival&mdash;for there happened on that very day to be a sacrifice to Heracles&mdash;could be induced to obey. Most of them, in the exultation of victory, were drinking and keeping holiday, and at such a time how could they ever be expected to take up arms and go forth at the order of the generals? On these grounds the authorities decided that the thing was impossible.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Whereupon Hermocrates himself, fearing lest the Athenians should gain a start and quietly pass the most difficult places in the night, contrived the following plan: when it was growing dark he sent certain of his own acquaintance, accompanied by a few horsemen, to the Athenian camp.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>not only was there the great fact that they had lost their whole fleet, and instead of their expected triumph had brought the utmost peril upon Athens as well as upon themselves, but also the sights which presented themselves as they quitted the camp were painful to every eye and mind.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The dead were unburied, and when any one saw the body of a friend lying on the ground <pb n="323"/> he was smitten with sorrow and dread, while the sick or wounded who still survived but had to be left were even a greater trial to the living, and more to be pitied than those who were gone.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Their prayers and lamentations drove their companions to distraction; they would beg that they might be taken with them, and call by name any friend or relation whom they saw passing; they would hang upon their departing comrades and follow as far as they could, and, when their limbs and strength failed them, and they dropped behind, many were the imprecations and cries which they uttered. So that the whole army was in tears, and such was their despair that they could hardly make up their minds to stir, although they were leaving an enemy's country, having suffered calamities too great for tears already, and dreading miseries yet greater in the unknown future.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>There was also a general feeling of shame and self-reproach,&mdash;indeed they seemed, not like an army, but like the fugitive population of a city captured after a siege; and of a great city too. For the whole multitude who were marching together numbered not less than forty thousand. Each of them took with him anything he could carry which was likely to be of use. Even the heavy-armed and cavalry, contrary to their practice when under arms, conveyed about their persons their own food, some because they had no attendants, others because they could not trust them; for they had long been deserting, and most of them had gone off all at once. Nor was the food which they carried sufficient;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>for the supplies of the camp had failed. Their disgrace and the universality of the misery, although there might be some consolation in the very community of suffering, were nevertheless at that moment hard to bear, especially when they remembered from what pride and splendour they had fallen into their present low estate.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Never had an Hellenic army<note anchored="yes">Omitting <foreign lang="greek">tw=|.</foreign></note> experienced such a reverse. They had come intending to <pb n="324"/> enslave others, and they were going away in fear that they would be themselves enslaved. Instead of the prayers and hymns with which they had put to sea, they were now departing amid appeals to heaven of another sort. They were no longer sailors but landsmen, depending, not upon their fleet, but upon their infantry. Yet in face of the great danger which still threatened them all these things appeared endurable.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The army marched disposed in a hollow<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians move on in two divisions, one under Nicias, and the other under Demosthenes.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When they arrived at the ford of the river Anapus they found a force of the Syracusans and of their allies drawn up to meet them; these they put to flight, and getting command of the ford, proceeded on their march.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Syracusans continually harassed them, the cavalry riding alongside, and the light-armed troops hurling darts at them. On this day the Athenians proceeded about four and a half miles and encamped at a hill. On the next day they started early, and, having advanced more than two miles, descended into a level plain, and encamped. The country was inhabited, and they were desirous of obtaining food from the houses, and also water which they might carry with them, as there was little to be had for many miles in the country which lay before them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Meanwhile the Syracusans had gone forward, and at a point where the road ascends a steep hill called the Acraean height, and there is a precipitous ravine on either side, were blocking up the pass by a wall.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>On the next day the Athenians advanced, although again impeded by the numbers of the enemy's cavalry who rode alongside, and of their javelin-men who threw darts at them. For a long time the Athenians maintained the struggle, but at last retired to their own encampment. Their supplies were now cut off, because the horsemen circumscribed their movements.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In the morning they started early and resumed their march. They pressed onwards to the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians make no impression on the Syracusan position.</hi></note> hill where the way was barred, and found in front of them the Syracusan infantry drawn up to defend the wall, in deep array, for <pb n="327"/> the pass was narrow.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Whereupon the Athenians advanced and assaulted the barrier, but the enemy, who were numerous and had the advantage of position, threw missiles upon them from the hill, which was steep;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and so, not being able to force their way, they again retired and rested. During the conflict, as is often the case in the fall of the year, there came on a storm of rain and thunder, whereby the Athenians were yet more disheartened, for they thought that everything was conspiring to their destruction<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.70">6.70 init.</bibl></note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>While they were resting, Gylippus and the Syracusans despatched a division of their army to raise a wall behind them across the road by which they had come; but the Athenians sent some of their own troops and frustrated their intention.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They then retired with their whole army in the direction of the plain and passed the night. On the following day they again advanced. The Syracusans now surrounded and attacked them on every side, and wounded many of them. If the Athenians advanced they retreated, but charged them when they retired, falling especially upon the hindermost of them, in the hope that, if they could put to flight a few at a time, they might strike a panic into the whole army.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In this fashion the Athenians struggled on for a long time, and having advanced about three-quarters of a mile rested in the plain. The Syracusans then left them and returned to their own encampment.

They intended to take another route and march towards <pb n="328"/> the sea in the direction opposite to that from which the Syracusans were watching them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now their whole line of march lay, not towards Catana, but towards the other side of Sicily, in the direction of Camarina and Gela, and the cities, Hellenic or Barbarian, of that region.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So they lighted numerous fires and departed in the night. And then, as constantly happens in armies<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.125">4.125 init.</bibl></note>, especially in very great ones, and as might be expected when they were marching by night in an enemy's country, and with the enemy from whom they were flying not far off, there arose a panic among them, and they fell into confusion.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The army of Nicias, which was leading the way, kept together, and got on considerably in advance, but that of Demosthenes, which was the larger half, was severed from the other division, and marched in worse order.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At daybreak, however, they succeeded in reaching the sea, and striking into the Helorine road marched along it, intending as soon as they arrived at the Cacyparis to follow up the course of the river through the interior of the island. They were expecting that the Sicels for whom they had sent would meet them on this road.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When they had reached the river they found there also a guard of the Syracusans cutting off the passage by a wall and palisade. They forced their way through and, crossing the river, passed on towards another river which is called the Erineus, this being the direction in which their guides led them.

They easily found the line of their retreat, and quickly following, came up with them about the time of the midday meal.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The troops of Demosthenes were last; they were marching <pb n="329"/> slowly and in disorder, not having recovered from the panic of the previous night, when they were overtaken by the Syracusans, who immediately fell upon them and fought. Separated as they were from the others, they were easily hemmed in by the Syracusan cavalry and driven into a narrow space.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The division of Nicias was now as much as six miles in advance, for he marched faster, thinking that their safety depended at such a time, not in remaining and fighting, if they could avoid it, but in retreating as quickly as they could, and resisting only when they were positively compelled.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Demosthenes, on the other hand, who had been more incessantly harassed throughout the retreat, because marching last he was first attacked by the enemy, now, when he saw the Syracusans pursuing him, instead of pressing onward, ranged his army in order of battle. Thus lingering he was surrounded, and he and the Athenians under his command were in the greatest confusion. For they were crushed into a walled enclosure, having a road on both sides and planted thickly with olive-trees, and missiles were hurled at them from all points.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Syracusans naturally preferred this mode of attack to a regular engagement. For to risk themselves against desperate men would have been only playing into the hands of the Athenians. Moreover, every one was sparing of his life; their good fortune was already assured, and they did not want to fall in the hour of victory. Even by this irregular mode of fighting they thought that they could overpower and capture the Athenians.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But <pb n="330"/> only a few cities accepted the offer. At length an agreement was made for the entire force under Demosthenes. Their arms were to be surrendered, but no one was to suffer death, either from violence or from imprisonment, or from want of the bare means of life.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So they all surrendered, being in number six thousand, and gave up what money they had. This they threw into the hollows of shields and filled four. The captives were at once taken to the city. On the same day Nicias and his division reached the river Erineus, which he crossed, and halted his army on a rising ground.

					<milestone n="83" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>On the following day he was overtaken by the Syracusans, who told him that Demosthenes<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Nicias being in formed of the surrender of Demosthenes tries in vain to negotiate with Gylippus.

He, not believing them, procured a truce while he sent a horseman to go and see.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Upon the return of the horseman bringing assurance of the fact, he sent a herald to Gylippus and the Syracusans, saying that he would agree, on behalf of the Athenian state, to pay the expenses which the Syracusans had incurred in the war, on condition that they should let his army go; until the money was paid he would give Athenian citizens as hostages, a man for a talent.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Gylippus and the Syracusans would not accept these proposals, but attacked and surrounded this division of the army as they had the other, and hurled missiles at them from every side until the evening.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They too were grievously in want of food and necessaries. Nevertheless they meant to wait for the dead of the night and then to proceed. They were just resuming their arms, when the Syracusans discovered them and raised the Paean.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians hurried on to the river Assinarus. They hoped to gain a little relief if they forded the river, for the mass of horsemen and other troops overwhelmed and crushed them; and they were worn out by fatigue and thirst. But no sooner did they reach the water than they lost all order and rushed in;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>every man was trying to cross first, and, the enemy pressing upon them at the same time, the passage of the river became hopeless. Being compelled to keep close together they fell one upon another, and trampled each other under foot: some at once perished, pierced by their own spears; others got entangled in the baggage and were carried down the stream.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Syracusans stood upon the further bank of the river, which was steep, and hurled missiles from above on the Athenians, who were huddled together in the deep bed of the stream and for the most part were drinking greedily.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Peloponnesians came down the bank and slaughtered them, falling chiefly upon those who were in the river. Whereupon the water at once became foul, but was drunk all the same, although muddy and dyed with blood, and the crowd fought for it.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The total of the public prisoners when collected was not great; for many were appropriated by the soldiers, and the whole of Sicily was full of them, they not having capitulated like the troops under Demosthenes.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A large number also perished; the slaughter at the river being very great, quite as great as any which took place in the Sicilian war; and not a few had fallen in the frequent attacks which were made upon the Athenians during their march. Still many escaped, some at the time, others ran away after an interval of slavery, and all these found refuge at Catana.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Syracusans and their allies collected their forces and returned with the spoil, and as<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The public prisoners are confined in the quarries; Nicias and Demosthenes are put to death.</hi></note> many prisoners as they could take with them, into the city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The captive Athenians and allies they deposited in the quarries, which they thought would be the safest place of confinement. Nicias and Demosthenes they put to the sword, although against the will of Gylippus. For Gylippus thought that to carry home with him to Lacedaemon the generals of the enemy, over and above all his other successes, would be a brilliant triumph.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>One of them, Demosthenes, happened to be the greatest foe, and the other the greatest friend of the Lacedaemonians, both in the same matter of Pylos and Sphacteria. For Nicias had taken up their cause<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.16">5.16 med.</bibl></note>, and had persuaded the Athenians to make the peace which set at liberty the prisoners taken in the island.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Lacedaemonians were grateful to him for the service, and this was the main reason why he trusted Gylippus and surrendered himself to him. But certain Syracusans, who had been in communication with him, were afraid (such was the report) that <pb n="333"/> on some suspicion of their guilt he might be put to the torture and bring trouble on them in the hour of their prosperity. Others, and especially the Corinthians, feared that, being rich, he might by bribery escape and do them further mischief.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>So the Syracusans gained the consent of the allies and had him executed. For these or the like reasons he suffered death. No one of the Hellenes in my time was less deserving of so miserable an end; for he lived in the practice of every virtue.

At first the sun by day was still scorching and suffocating, for they had no roof over their heads, while the autumn nights were cold, and the extremes of temperature engendered violent disorders.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Being cramped for room they had to do everything on the same spot.
					
					The corpses of those who died from their wounds, exposure to heat and cold, and the like, lay heaped one upon another.

Every kind of misery which could befall man in such a place befell them.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Whichever way they looked there was trouble; they were overwhelmed by their calamity, and were in fear and consternation unutterable. The citizens and the city were alike distressed; they had lost a host of cavalry and hoplites and the flower of their youth, and there were none to replace them<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.64">7.64</bibl>.</note>. And when they saw an insufficient number of ships in their docks, and no crews to man them, nor money in the treasury, they despaired of deliverance. They had no doubt that their enemies in Sicily, after the great victory which they had already gained, would at once sail against the Piraeus. Their enemies in Hellas, whose resources were now doubled, would likewise set upon them with all their might both by sea and land, and would be assisted by their own revolted allies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Still they determined, so far as their situation allowed, not to give <pb n="336"/> way. They would procure timber and money by whatever means they might, and build a navy. They would make sure of their allies, and above all of Euboea. Expenses in the city were to be economised, and they were to choose a council of the elder men, who should advise together, and lay before the people the measures which from time to time might be required.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After the manner of a democracy, they were very amenable to discipline while their fright lasted. They proceeded to carry out these resolutions. And so the summer ended.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the following winter all Hellas was stirred by the great overthrow of the Athenians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The neutral states, the Lacedaemonian and Athenian allies, are all alike eager to have a share in a war which appears to be nearly at an end and to involve no danger.

The states which had been neutral determined that the time had come when, invited or not, they could no longer stand aloof from the war; they must of their own accord attack the Athenians. They considered, one and all, that if the Sicilian expedition had succeeded, they would sooner or later have been attacked by them. The war would not last long, and they might as well share in the glory of it. The Lacedaemonian allies, animated by a common feeling, were more eager than ever to make a speedy end of their great hardships.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But none showed greater alacrity than the subjects of the Athenians, who were everywhere willing even beyond their power to revolt; for they judged by their excited feelings<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.108">4.108 med.</bibl></note>, and would not admit a possibility that the Athenians could survive another summer.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>To the Lacedaemonians themselves all this was most encouraging; and they had in addition the prospect that their allies from Sicily would join them at the beginning of spring with a large force of ships as well as men; necessity having at last compelled them to become a naval power.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Everything looked hopeful, and they determined to strike promptly and vigorously. They considered that by the <pb n="337"/> successful termination of the war they would be finally delivered from dangers such as would have surrounded them if the Athenians had become masters of Sicily<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.90">6.90</bibl>.</note>.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The whole number of ships which the allies were to build was fixed by the Lacedaemonians at a hundred: twenty-five were to be built by themselves and twenty-five by the Boeotians, fifteen by the Phocians and Locrians, fifteen by the Corinthians, ten by the Arcadians, Pellenians, and Sicyonians, ten by the Megarians, Troezenians, Epidaurians, and Hermionians. Every sort of preparation was made, for the Lacedaemonians were determined to prosecute the war at the first appearance of spring.

Agis accepted their proposals, and summoned from Lacedaemon Alcamenes the son of Sthenelaidas, and Melanthus, that they might take the command in Euboea. They came, accompanied by three hundred of the Neodamodes. But while he was making ready to convey them across the strait, there arrived envoys from Lesbos, which was likewise anxious to revolt;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>and as the Boeotians<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.2">3.2 fin.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.5">5 med.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.13">13 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 8.100">8.100 med.</bibl></note> were in their interest, Agis was persuaded to defer the expedition to Euboea while he prepared to assist the Lesbians. He appointed Alcamenes, who had been designed for Euboea, their governor; and he further promised them ten ships, the Boeotians promising ten more. All this was done without the authority of the Lacedaemonian government;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for Agis, while he was with his army at Decelea, had the right to send troops whithersoever he pleased, to raise levies, and to exact money. And at that particular time he might be said to have far more influence over the allies than the Lacedaemonians at home, for he had an army at his disposal, and might appear in formidable strength anywhere at any time.
				</p>
				<p>While he was supporting the Lesbians, certain Chians and Erythraeans (who were also ready<note type="margin" anchored="yes">(3) <hi>The Chians and Erythraeans assisted by Tissaphernes ask aid from Sparta.

					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>they were accompanied by an envoy from Tissaphernes, whom King Darius the son of Artaxerxes had appointed to be military <pb n="339"/> governor of the provinces on the coast of Asia. Tissaphernes too was inviting the assistance of the Lacedaemonians, and promised to maintain their troops;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>for the King had quite lately been demanding of him the revenues due from the Hellenic cities in his province, which he had been prevented by the Athenians from collecting, and therefore still owed. He thought that if he could weaken the Athenians he would be more likely to get his tribute; he hoped also to make the Lacedaemonians allies of the King, and by their help either to slay or take alive, in accordance with the King's orders, Amorges the natural son of Pissuthnes, who had revolted in Caria.

					<milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/>

They had been commissioned by Pharnabazus to bring up a fleet to the Hellespont; like Tissaphernes he was anxious, if possible, to induce the cities in his province to revolt from the Athenians, that he might obtain the tribute from them; and he wanted the alliance between the Lacedaemonians and the King to come from himself.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The two parties&mdash;that is to say, the envoys of Pharnabazus and those of Tissaphernes&mdash;were acting independently; and a vehement contest arose at Lacedaemon, the one party urging the Lacedaemonians to send a fleet and army to Ionia and Chios, the other to begin with the Hellespont.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They were themselves far more favourable to the proposals of the Chians and Tissaphernes; for Alcibiades was in their interest, and he was a great hereditary friend of Endius, one of the Ephors of that year.&mdash;Through this friendship the Lacedaemonian name of Alcibiades had come into his family;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for Alcibiades was the name of <pb n="340"/> Endius' father<note anchored="yes">Literally, 'for Endius was called Endius the son of Alcibiades;' implying that in the family of Endius the names Endius and Alcibiades alternated.</note>.&mdash;Nevertheless the Lacedaemonians, before giving an answer, sent a commissioner, Phrynis, one of their Perioeci, to see whether the Chians had as many ships as they said, and whether the power of the city was equal to her reputation. He reported that what they had heard was true. Whereupon they at once made alliance with the Chians and Erythraeans and voted them forty ships&mdash;there being at Chios already, as the Chians informed them, no less than sixty.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Of the forty ships they at first intended to send out ten themselves under the command of Melancridas their admiral; but an earthquake occurred; so instead of Melancridas they appointed Chalcideus, and instead of the ten ships they prepared to send five only, which they equipped in Laconia. So the winter ended, and with it the nineteenth year in the Peloponnesian War of which Thucydides wrote the history.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>At the beginning of the next summer the Chians were eager to get the fleet sent off at once.<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The ships are to be dragged over the Isthmus.</hi></note> For their proposals, like those of the other allies, had been made secretly, and they were afraid that the Athenians would detect them. Thereupon the Lacedaemonians sent to Corinth three Spartans, who were to give orders that the ships then lying at the Isthmus should be as quickly as possible dragged over from the Corinthian gulf to the coast on the other side. They were all to be despatched to Chios, including the ships which Agis had been equipping for Lesbos. The allied fleet then at the Isthmus numbered in all thirtynine.

				<p>
					<milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Calligitus and Timagoras, who represented Pharnabazus, took no part in the expedition to Chios,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Agis, who had originally favoured Lesbos, acquiesces in the expedition to Chios.</hi></note> nor did they offer to contribute towards the expenses of it the money which they had brought with them, <pb n="341"/> amounting to twenty-five talents<note anchored="yes">&pound;5,000.</note>; they thought of sailing later with another expedition.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Agis, when he saw that the Lacedaemonians were bent on going to Chios first, offered no opposition; so the allies held a conference at Corinth, and after some deliberation determined to sail, first of all to Chios, under the command of Chalcideus, who was equipping the five ships in Laconia, then to proceed to Lesbos, under the command of Alcamenes, whom Agis had previously designed to appoint to that island, and finally to the Hellespont; for this last command they had selected Clearchus the son of Rhamphias.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They resolved to carry over the Isthmus half the ships first; these were to sail at once, that the attention of the Athenians might be distracted between those which were starting and those which were to follow.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They meant to sail quite openly, taking it for granted that the Athenians were powerless, since no navy of theirs worth speaking of had as yet appeared. In pursuance of their plans they conveyed twenty-one ships over the Isthmus.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>They were in a hurry to be off, but the Corinthians were unwilling to join them until the conclusion<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Corinthians are delayed by their Isthmian games. Meanwhile the Athenians detect the treason of the chians and exact pledges of them.</hi></note> of the Isthmian games, which were then going on. Agis was prepared to respect their scruples and to take the responsibility of the expedition on himself.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But the Corinthians would not agree to this proposal, and there was delay. In the meantime the Athenians began to discover the proceedings of the Chians, and despatched one of their generals, Aristocrates, to accuse them of treason. They denied the charge; whereupon he desired them to send back with him a few ships as a pledge of their fidelity to the alliance;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and they sent seven. They could not refuse his request, for the Chian people were ignorant of the whole matter, while the oligarchs, who were in the plot, did not want to break with the multitude until they had secured their <pb n="342"/> ground. Arid the Peloponnesian ships had delayed so long that they had ceased to expect them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="10" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the Isthmian games were celebrated. The Athenians, to whom they had been<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The first Peloponnesian squadron is driven by the Athenians into Piraeum and the commander, Alcamenes, slain.</hi></note> formally notified, sent representatives to them; and now their eyes began to be opened to the designs of the Chians. On their return home they took immediate measures to prevent the enemy's ships getting away from Cenchreae unperceived.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When the games were over, the Peloponnesians, under the command of Alcamenes, with their twenty-one ships set sail for Chios; the Athenians, with an equal number, first sailed up to them and tried to draw them into the open sea. The Peloponnesians did not follow them far, but soon turned back to Cenchreae; the Athenians likewise retired, because they could not depend on the fidelity of the seven Chian ships which formed a part of their fleet.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So they manned some more ships, making the whole number thirty-seven, and when the Peloponnesians resumed their voyage along the coast they pursued them into Piraeum, a lonely harbour, the last in the Corinthian territory before you reach Epidauria. One ship was lost by the Peloponnesians at sea, but they got the rest together and came to anchor in the harbour.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Again the Athenians attacked them, not only on the water, but also after they had landed; there was a fierce struggle, but no regular engagement; most of the enemy's ships were damaged by the Athenians on the beach, and their commander, Alcamenes, was slain. Some Athenians also fell.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For on the day after the battle the Corinthians had come <pb n="343"/> to assist the Peloponnesian ships, and the other inhabitants of the country quickly followed them. Foreseeing how great would be the labour of keeping guard on so desolate a spot, the Peloponnesians knew not what to do; they even entertained the idea of burning their ships, but on second thoughts they determined to draw them high up on shore, and to keep guard over them with their landforces stationed near, until some good opportunity of escape should occur. Agis was informed of their condition, and sent Thermon, a Spartan, to them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The first tidings which had reached Sparta were to the effect that the ships had left the Isthmus (the Ephors having told Alcamenes to send a horseman announcing the fact), and immediately they determined to send out the five ships of their own which they had ready, under the command of Chalcideus, who was to be accompanied by Alcibiades. But when they were on the point of departure, a second messenger reported that the other squadron had been chased into Piraeum; and then, disheartened by finding that they had begun the Ionian war with a failure, they determined to give up sending the ships from Laconia, and even to recall some others which had already sailed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="12" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Alcibiades, seeing the state of affairs, advised Endius and the Ephors to persevere in the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>They are going to do nothing; but Alcibiades insists that the Lacedaemonian contingent shall at once put to sea.</hi></note> expedition. They would arrive, he said, before the Chians had heard of the misadventure of the ships. He would himself, as soon as he reached Ionia, represent to the cities the weakness of the Athenians and the alacrity of the Lacedaemonians, and they would revolt at once; for they would believe him sooner than any one.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>To Endius he argued in private '<note anchored="yes">Or, 'that he would win honour by effecting through his (Alcibiades') agency a revolt in Ionia and gaining the alliance of the King.'</note> that he would win honour if he were the instrument of effecting a revolt in Ionia, and of gaining the alliance of the King<note anchored="yes">Or, 'that he would win honour by effecting through his (Alcibiades') agency a revolt in Ionia and gaining the alliance of the King.'</note>; he <pb n="344"/> should not allow such a prize to fall into the hands of Agis';&mdash;now Agis was a personal enemy of Alcibiades.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>His opinion prevailed with Endius and the other Ephors. So he put to sea with the .five ships, accompanied by Chalcideus the Lacedaemonian, and hastened on his way.

					<milestone n="13" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About this time sixteen Peloponnesian ships which had remained with Gylippus to the end of<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Return of some ships from Sicily.</hi></note> the Sicilian war were returning home. They were caught in the neighbourhood of Leucadia and roughly handled by twenty-seven Athenian vessels, under the command of Hippocles the son of Menippus, which were on the watch for ships coming from Sicily; but all except one of them escaped the Athenians and sailed into Corinth.

					<milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Chalcideus and Alcibiades on their voyage seized every one whom they met in order that their<note type="margin" anchored="yes">(1) <hi>Chios, then</hi> (2) <hi>Erythrae,</hi> (3) <hi>Clazomenae, are induced to revolt by Chalcideus and Alcibiades.</hi></note> coming might not be reported. They touched first at the promontory of Corycus on the mainland, and there releasing their prisoners they held a preliminary conference with certain of the Chians, who were in the plot, and who advised them to give no notice of their intention, but to sail at once to the city.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So they appeared suddenly at Chios, to the great wonder and alarm of the people. The oligarchs had contrived that the council should be sitting at the time. Chalcideus and Alcibiades made speeches and announced that many more ships were on their way, but said nothing about the blockade of Piraeum.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So Chios first, and afterwards Erythrae, revolted from Athens. They then sailed with three vessels to Clazomenae, which they induced to revolt. The Clazomenians at once crossed over to the mainland and fortified Polichn&egrave;, intending in case of need to retreat thither from the little island on which Clazomenae stands. All the revolted cities were occupied in raising fortifications and preparing for war. <pb n="345"/>

The greatest city of all had gone over to the enemy, and the rest of their allies were certain to rise. In the extremity of their alarm they abrogated the penalties denounced against any one who should propose or put to the vote the employment of the thousand talents which throughout the war they had hitherto jealously reserved<note anchored="yes">Cp. ii 24.</note>. They now passed a decree permitting their use, and resolved to man a large number of ships; also to send at once to Chios eight ships which had been keeping guard at Piraeum, and had gone away under the command of Strombichides the son of Diotimus in pursuit of Chalcideus, but not overtaking him had returned. Twelve other ships, under the command of Thrasycles, were to follow immediately;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>these too were to be taken from the blockading force. They also withdrew the seven Chian ships which were assisting them in the blockade of Piraeum; and setting free the slaves in them, put the freemen in chains. Other ships were then quickly manned by them and sent to take the place of all those which had been subtracted from the blockading squadron, and they proposed to equip thirty more. They were full of energy, and spared no effort for the recovery of Chios.

But Chalcideus with twentythree ships was on his way from Chios to Teos, intending to attack it; he was assisted by the land-forces of Clazomenae and Erythrae, which followed his movements on the shore.

The troops waited a little for the return of Chalcideus from the pursuit, but as he did not come they proceeded without him to demolish the fort which the Athenians had built for the protection of Teos on the land side. A few barbarians under the command of Stages, a lieutenant of Tissaphernes, came and joined in the work of demolition.

During the same summer they sent out a Chian fleet numbering thirteen ships. The expedition was directed first against Lesbos, the Lacedaemonians having originally instructed their officers to proceed from Chios to Lesbos, and thence to the Hellespont<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.8">8.8 med.</bibl></note>. It was placed under the command of Deiniadas, one of the Perioeci. Meanwhile the infantry of the Peloponnesians and of the neighboring allies, under Evalas, a Spartan, moved along the shore towards Clazomenae and Cym&egrave;.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The fleet sailed to Lesbos, and first induced Methymna to rebel; there leaving four of their ships, with the remainder they raised a revolt in Mytilene.

On the third day after his arrival a division of the Athenian fleet, numbering twenty-five ships, sailed to Lesbos under the command of Leon and Diomedon; Leon had arrived from Athens later than Diomedon with a reinforcement of ten ships.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>On the same day, towards evening, Astyochus put to sea, and taking with him one Chian ship, sailed to Lesbos, that he might render any assistance which he could to the Chian fleet. He came to Pyrrha, and on the following day to Eresus, where <pb n="350"/> he heard that Mytilen&egrave; had been taken by the Athenians at the first blow.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenian ships had sailed right into the harbour when they were least expected, and captured the Chian vessels;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>the men on board had then landed, and defeating in a battle a Mytilenean force which came out to meet them, had taken possession of the city. Astyochus heard the news from the Eresians, and from the Chian ships which had been left with Eubulus at Methymna. They had fled when Mytilen&egrave; was taken, and had now fallen in with him; but only three out of the four, for one of them had been captured by the Athenians. Upon this, instead of going on to Mytilen&egrave;, he raised a revolt in Eresus, and armed the inhabitants: he then disembarked the heavy-armed from his ships and sent them by land to Antissa and Methymna under the command of Eteonicus;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and with his own and the three Chian ships coasted thither himself, hoping that the Methymnaeans would take courage at the sight of them and persevere in their revolt. But everything went against him in Lesbos; so he re-embarked his troops and sailed back to Chios. The land-forces from the ships which were intended to go to the Hellespont<note anchored="yes">The meaning is obscure; see note.</note> also returned to their several homes.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Not long afterwards six ships came to Chios from the allied forces of the Peloponnesians now collected at Cenchreae. The Athenians, when they had re-established their influence in Lesbos, sailed away, and having taken Polichn&egrave; on the mainland, which the Clazomenians were fortifying<note anchored="yes">Cp. viii 14 fin.</note>, brought them all back to their city on the island, except the authors of the revolt, who had escaped to Daphnus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Leon and Diomedon, who were at Lesbos with the rest of the Athenian fleet, stationed their ships at the islands called Oenussae which lie in front of Chios, at Sidussa and Pteleum, which were forts held by them in the Erythraean territory, and at Lesbos itself, and carried on the war by sea against the Chians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The marines whom they had on board were hoplites taken from the roll and compelled to serve. They made descents upon Cardamyl&egrave; and Bolissus, and having defeated with heavy loss the Chians who came out to meet them, they devastated all that region. In another battle at Phanae they defeated them again, and in a third at Leuconium. Henceforward the Chians remained within their walls. The Athenians ravaged their country, which was well stocked, and from the Persian War until that time had never been touched by an invader.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>No people as far as I know, except the Chians and Lacedaemonians (but the Chians not equally with the Lacedaemonians), have preserved moderation in prosperity, and in proportion as their city has gained in power have gained also in the stability of their administration.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In this revolt they may seem to have shown a want of prudence, yet they did not venture upon it until many brave allies were ready to share the peril with them, and until the Athenians themselves seemed to confess that after their calamity in Sicily the state of their affairs was hopelessly bad. And, if they were deceived through the uncertainty of human things, this error of judgment was <pb n="352"/> common to many who, like them, believed that the Athenian power would speedily be overthrown.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But now that they were driven off the sea and saw their lands ravaged, some of their citizens undertook to bring back the city to the Athenians. The magistrates perceived their design, but instead of acting themselves, they sent to Erythrae for Astyochus the admiral. He came with four ships which he had on the spot, and they considered together by what means the conspiracy might be suppressed with the least violence, whether by taking hostages or in some other way.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Soon afterwards Pedaritus and his army<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.28">8.28 fin.</bibl></note> having come by land from Miletus to <pb n="358"/> Erythrae, where he crossed the channel, arrived in Chios.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Some of the Lesbians renewing their proposal to revolt, Astyochus suggested to Pedaritus and the Chians that they should go with the fleet to Lesbos and raise the country; they would thus increase the number of their allies, and, even if the attempt did not wholly succeed, they would injure the Athenians. But they would not listen, and Pedaritus refused to let him have the Chian ships.

					<milestone n="33" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So Astyochus took five Corinthian ships<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.23">8.23 fin.</bibl></note> and a sixth from Megara, one from Hermion&egrave;, and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Astyochus sets sail for Miletus to assume the command of the fleet.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Touching at Corycus in Erythraean he passed the night there. The Athenian ships from Samos were now on their way to Chios; they had put in at a place where they were only divided from the Peloponnesians by a hill, and neither fleet knew that the other was so near.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But that night there came a despatch from Pedaritus informing Astyochus that certain Erythraean prisoners had been released by the Athenians from Samos on condition of betraying Erythrae, and had gone thither with that intention. Whereupon Astyochus sailed back to Erythrae.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So narrowly did he escape falling into the hands of the Athenians. Pedaritus sailed over to meet him. They then enquired about the supposed traitors, and found that the whole matter was a trick which the men had devised in order to get away from Samos; so they acquitted them of the charge, and Pedaritus returned to Chios, while Astyochus resumed his voyage to Miletus. <pb n="359"/>

A great storm came on, and the Chian ships with difficulty escaped into their harbour, but of the Athenian ships the three which were most zealous in the pursuit were disabled and driven ashore near the city of Chios; the crews were either lost or taken captive. The remainder of the fleet found shelter in the harbour called Phoenicus, lying under Mount Mimas, whence again setting sail they put in at Lesbos, and made preparations for building the fort which they meant to establish in Chios.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Peloponnesian authorities at Miletus, when they heard of their arrival, ordered one half of these ships to protect Cnidus, and the other half to cruise off Triopium and seize the merchant-vessels which put in there from Egypt. This Triopium is a promontory in the district of Cnidus on which there is a temple of Apollo.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians, hearing of their intentions, sailed from Samos and captured the six ships which were keeping guard at Triopium; the crews escaped. They then sailed to Cnidus, and attacking the town, which was unwalled, all but took it.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>On the following day they made a second attack, but during the <pb n="360"/> night the inhabitants had improved their hasty defences, and some of the men who had escaped from the ships captured at Triopium had come into the city. So the Athenian assault was less destructive than on the first day; and after retiring from the city and devastating the country belonging to it they sailed back to Samos.

					<milestone n="36" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>About the same time Astyochus arrived at Miletus and took the command of the fleet. He<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Milesians are in earnest.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Peloponnesians however considered the former treaty made between Tissaphernes and Chalcideus defective and disadvantageous to them; so before the departure of Theramenes they made new terms of alliance, which were as follows:&mdash;

				<p>
					<milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>After the conclusion of the treaty, Theramenes, having delivered over the fleet to Astyochus,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Chians are reduced to inaction. The conspirators are executed, and the government becomes a close oligarchy. Pedaritus complains to Sparta of Astyochus.</hi></note> sailed away in a small boat and was no more heard of.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians, who had now crossed over with their troops from Lesbos to Chios, and had the upper hand both by land and sea, began to fortify Delphinium, a place not far distant from the town of Chios, which had the double advantage of being strong by land and of possessing harbours.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Chians meanwhile remained inactive; they had been already badly beaten in several battles, and their internal condition was far from satisfactory; for Tydeus the son of Ion and his accomplices had been executed by Pedaritus on a charge of complicity with Athens, and the city was reduced by the strong hand to a mere oligarchy. Hence they were in a state of mutual distrust, and could not be persuaded that either they or the mercenaries<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.28">8.28 fin.</bibl></note> brought by Pedaritus were a match for the enemy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They sent however to Miletus and requested the aid of Astyochus, but he refused. Whereupon Pedaritus sent a despatch to Lacedaemon, complaining of his misconduct.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>So favourable to the Athenians was the <pb n="362"/> course of affairs in Chios. The main fleet, which they had left at Samos, from time to time made threatening movements against the enemy at Miletus, but as they would never come out, the Athenians at length retired to Samos and there remained.

				<p>
					<milestone n="39" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same winter, about the solstice, twenty-seven ships which Calligitus of Megara and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Lacedaemonians resolve to assist Pharnabazus at the Hellespont.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Lacedaemonians sent at the same time eleven Spartans to act as advisers<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.85">2.85 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 3.69">3.69 med.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 5.63">5.63 fin.</bibl></note> to Astyochus, one of whom was Lichas the son of Arcesilaus<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.50">5.50 med.</bibl></note>. Besides receiving a general commission to assist in the direction of affairs to the best of their judgment, they were empowered on their arrival at Miletus to send on, if they saw fit, these ships, or a larger or smaller number, to Pharnabazus at the Hellespont under the command of Clearchus<note anchored="yes">Cp <bibl n="Thuc. 8.8">8.8 med.</bibl></note> the son of Rhamphias, who sailed with them. The eleven might also, if they thought good, deprive Astyochus of his command and appoint Antisthenes in his place, for the despatch of Pedaritus had excited suspicion against him.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>So the ships sailed from Malea over the open sea until they came to Melos. There they lighted on ten Athenian ships; of these they took three without their crews and burned them. But then, fearing that the remainder which had escaped would, as in fact they did, give information of their approach to the fleet at Samos, they took the precaution of going by a longer route. And sailing round by Crete they put in at Caunus in Asia.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They thought that they were now safe, and sent a messenger to the fleet at Miletus requesting a convoy. <pb n="363"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="40" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the Chians and Pedaritus continued to send messengers to Astyochus, who continued<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Chians are blockaded. Their slaves desert. Astyochus is at last induced to go to their aid.</hi></note> to delay. They implored him to come to their help with his whole fleet, saying that they were blockaded, and that he should not allow the chief ally of Sparta in Ionia to be cut off from the sea and overrun and devastated by land.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the Chians had more domestic slaves than any other state with the exception of Lacedaemon, and their offences were always more severely punished because of their number; so that, when the Athenian army appeared to be firmly settled in their fortifications, most of them at once deserted to the enemy<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.27">7.27 fin.</bibl></note>. And they did the greatest damage, because they knew the country.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Chians pressed upon the Lacedaemonians the necessity of coming to their assistance while there was still hope of interfering to some purpose; the fortification of Delphinium, though not yet completed, was in progress, and the Athenians were beginning to extend the lines of defence which protected their army and ships. Astyochus, seeing that the allies were zealous in the cause, although he had fully meant to carry out his threat, now determined to relieve the Chians.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="41" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>But in the meantime he received a message from Caunus, informing him that the twenty-seven<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>But he hears of the twenty-seven ships bringing the commissioners from Lacedaemon, and coasts southward to meet them. He is persuaded by the Cnidians to sail against twenty Athenian ships which are watching for them.</hi></note> ships and his Lacedaemonian advisers had arrived. He thought that everything should give way to the importance of convoying so large a reinforcement which would secure to the Lacedaemonians greater command of the sea, and that he must first of all provide for the safe passage of the commissioners who were to report on his conduct.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So he at once gave up his intended expedition to Chios and sailed for <pb n="364"/>
				</p>
				<p>Caunus. As he coasted along he made a descent on the island of Cos Meropis. The city was unfortified and had been overthrown by an earthquake, the greatest which has ever happened within our memory. The citizens had fled into the mountains;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>so he sacked the town and overran and despoiled the country, but let go the free inhabitants whom he found. From Cos he came by night to Cnidus, and was prevailed upon by the importunity of the Cnidians, instead of disembarking his men, to sail at once, just as he was, against twenty Athenian ships with which Charminus (one of the generals at Samos) was watching for the twenty-seven ships expected from Peloponnesus, being those which Astyochus was going to escort.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians at Samos had heard from Melos of their coming, and Charminus was cruising off the islands of Sym&egrave;, Chalc&egrave;, and Rhodes, and on the coast of Lycia; he had by this time discovered that they were at Caunus.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="42" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So Astyochus sailed at once to Sym&egrave; before his arrival was reported, in the hope that he might<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>His ships lose their way in the fog, and his left wing is attacked and defeated by the Athenians, who in their turn fly at the sudden appearance of the rest of the fleet.</hi></note> come upon the Athenian squadron in the open sea. The rain and cloudy state of the atmosphere caused confusion among his ships, which lost their way in the dark.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When dawn broke, the fleet was dispersed and the left wing alone was visible to the Athenians, while the other ships were still straggling off the shore of the island. Charminus and the Athenians put out to sea with part of their twenty ships, supposing that these were only the squadron from Caunus for which they were watching.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They at once attacked them, sank three of them, disabled others, and were gaining the victory, when to their surprise there appeared the larger part of the Lacedaemonian fleet threatening to surround them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Whereupon they fled, and in their flight lost six ships, but with the rest gained the island of Teutlussa, and thence Halicarnassus. The Peloponnesians touched at Cnidus, and there uniting <pb n="365"/> with the twenty-seven ships from Caunus, they all sailed to Sym&egrave; and raised a trophy; they then returned and put into port again at Cnidus.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="43" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>As soon as the Athenians heard the result of the seafight they sailed from Samos to Sym&egrave;<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Peloponnesians, who are now at Cnidus, confer with Tissaphernes Lichas points out the consequences involved in the two treaties. Tissaphernes goes away in a rage.</hi></note> with their whole fleet. They did not attack the Peloponnesians at Cnidus, nor the Peloponnesians them; but they carried away the heavy tackle of their own ships which had been left at Sym&egrave;, and touching at Loryma, a place on the mainland, returned to Samos.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Peloponnesians were now all together at Cnidus, and were making the repairs necessary after the battle, while the Lacedaemonian commissioners conferred with Tissaphernes (who was himself on the spot) as to any matters in his past dealings with them at which they were displeased, and as to the best manner of securing their common interests in the future conduct of the war. Lichas entered into the enquiry with great energy; he took exception to both the treaties;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>that of Chalcideus and that of Theramenes were equally objectionable. For the King at that time of day to claim power over all the countries which his ancestors had formerly held was monstrous. If either treaty were carried out, the inhabitants of all the islands, of Thessaly, of Locris, and of all Hellas, as far as Boeotia, would again be reduced to slavery; instead of giving the Hellenes freedom, the Lacedaemonians would be imposing upon them the yoke of Persia.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So he desired them to conclude some more satisfactory treaty, for he would have nothing to say to these; he did not want to have the fleet maintained upon any such terms. Tissaphernes was indignant, and without settling anything went away in a rage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="44" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile the Peloponnesians had been receiving communications from the chief men of Rhodes, and resolved to sail thither. They hoped to gain over an island <pb n="366"/> which was strong alike in sailors and in infantry; if successful, they might henceforward maintain<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Peloponnesians persuade</hi> (11) <hi>Rhodes to revolt; there they draw up their ships and do nothing for eleven weeks. The Athenians, who arrive too late to hinder the revolt, make descents upon the island.</hi></note> their navy by the help of their own allies without asking Tissaphernes for money.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So in the same winter they sailed from Cnidus against Rhodes, and first attacked Camirus with ninety-four ships. The inhabitants, who were in ignorance of the plot and dwelt in an unfortified city, were alarmed and began to fly. The Lacedaemonians re-assured them, and assembling the people not only of Camirus, but of Lindus and Ialysus, the two other cities of Rhodes, persuaded all of them to revolt from the Athenians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thus Rhodes went over to the Peloponnesians. Nearly at the same time the Athenians, who had heard of their intentions, brought up the fleet from Samos, hoping to forestall them; they appeared in the offing, but finding that they were just too late, sailed to Chalc&egrave; for the present, and thence back to Samos.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They then fought against Rhodes, making descents upon it from Chalc&egrave;, Cos, and Samos, while the Peloponnesians, having collected thirty-two talents<note anchored="yes">&pound;64,000</note> from the Rhodians, drew up their ships, and did nothing for eleven weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="45" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Before the Peloponnesians had removed to Rhodes affairs took a new turn. After the<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Alcibiades, in fear of his life from the Spartans, retires to Tissaphernes, whom he supplies with argument against the Peloponnesians and instructs in various ways. By his advice the pay is curtailed, and the revolted cities who beg for money are refused.</hi></note> death of Chalcideus and the engagement at Miletus<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.24">8.24 init.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 8.25">25</bibl>.</note>, Alcibiades fell under suspicion at Sparta, and orders came fro home to Astyochus that he should be put to death. Agis hated him, and he was generally distrusted. In fear he retired to Tissaphernes, and soon, by working upon him, did all he could to injure the Peloponnesian cause. He was his constant adviser, and induced him to cut down the <pb n="367"/> pay of the sailors from an Attic drachma to half a drachma<note anchored="yes">About 4<hi>d.</hi></note>, and this was only to be given at irregular intervals.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Tissaphernes was instructed by him to tell the Peloponnesians that the Athenians, with their long experience of naval affairs, gave half a drachma only, not from poverty, but lest their sailors should be demoralised by high pay, and spend their money on pleasures which injured their health, and thereby impaired their efficiency;<note anchored="yes">Others translate (omitting 'the payment too was made irregularly '), 'also lest they should get away from their ships too freely, leaving the pay still owing them as a pledge.'</note> the payment too was made irregularly, that the arrears, which they would forfeit by desertion, might be a pledge of their continuance in the service<note anchored="yes">Others translate (omitting 'the payment too was made irregularly '), 'also lest they should get away from their ships too freely, leaving the pay still owing them as a pledge.'</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He also recommended him to bribe the trierarchs and the generals of the allied cities into consenting. They all yielded with the exception of the Syracusans: Hermocrates alone stood firm on behalf of the whole alliance.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the allies who had revolted came asking for money, Alcibiades drove them away himself, saying on behalf of Tissaphernes that the Chians must have lost all sense of shame; they were the richest people in Hellas, and now, when they were being saved by foreign aid, they wanted other men, not only to risk life, but to expend money in their cause.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To the other cities he replied that, having paid such large sums to the Athenians before they revolted, they would be inexcusable if they were not willing to contribute as much and even more for their own benefit.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He represented further that Tissaphernes was now carrying on the war at his own expense, and must be expected to be careful. But if supplies should come from the King he would restore the full pay, and do whatever was reasonable for the cities.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="46" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Alcibiades also advised Tissaphernes not to be in a hurry about putting an end to the war, and neither to bring up the Phoenician fleet which he was preparing, nor to give pay to more Hellenic sailors; he should not be so anxious to put the whole power both by sea and <pb n="368"/> land into the same hands. Let the dominion only remain divided, and then, whichever of the two rivals was troublesome, the King might always<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Tissaphernes should balance the contending powers against one another and finally get rid of both. The Athenians are the more natural allies of the King because they only desire empire at sea, and do not profess to be the liberators of Hellas.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But if one defeated the other and became supreme on both elements, who would help Tissaphernes to overthrow the conqueror? He would have to take the field in person and fight, which he might not like, at great risk and expense. The danger would be easily averted at a fraction of the cost, and at no risk to himself, if he wore out the Hellenes in internal strife.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Alcibiades also said that the Athenians would be more suitable partners of empire, because they were less likely to encroach by land, and both their principles and their practice in carrying on the war accorded better with the King's interest. For if he helped them to subject the element of the sea to themselves, they would gladly help him in the subjugation of the Hellenes who were in his country, whereas the Lacedaemonians came to be their liberators. But a power which was at that very moment emancipating the Hellenes from the dominion of another Hellenic power like themselves would not be satisfied to leave them under the yoke of the Barbarian<note anchored="yes">More literally: 'unless they failed at some time or other to crush the Athenians'; or 'unless the Persians got the Lacedaemonians out of the way': see note.</note> if they once succeeded in crushing the Athenians<note anchored="yes">More literally: 'unless they failed at some time or other to crush the Athenians'; or 'unless the Persians got the Lacedaemonians out of the way': see note.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So he advised him first to wear them both out, and when he had clipped the Athenians as close as he could, then to get the Peloponnesians out of his country.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To this course Tissaphernes was strongly inclined, if we may judge from his acts. For he gave his full confidence to Alcibiades, whose advice he approved, and kept the Peloponnesians ill-provided, at the same time refusing to <pb n="369"/> let them fight at sea, and insisting that they must wait until the Phoenician ships arrived; they would then fight at an advantage. In this manner he ruined their affairs and impaired the efficiency of their navy, which had once been in first-rate condition. There were many other ways in which he showed openly and unmistakably that he was not in earnest in the cause of his allies.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="47" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>In giving this advice to Tissaphernes and the King, now that he had passed under their protection,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Alcibiades intrigues with the leading men at Samos for his own restoration He would make Tissaphernes the friend of Athens.

But he had another motive; he was preparing the way for his own return from exile. He knew that, if he did not destroy his country altogether, the time would come when he would persuade his countrymen to recall him; and he thought that his arguments would be most effectual if he were seen to be on intimate terms with Tissaphernes.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the result proved that he was right. The Athenian soldiers at Samos soon perceived that he had great influence with him, and he sent messages to the chief persons among them, whom he begged to remember him to all good men and true, and to let them know that he would be glad to return to his country and cast in his lot with them. He would at the same time make Tissaphernes their friend; but they must establish an oligarchy, and abolish the villainous democracy which had driven him out. Partly moved by these messages, but still more of their own inclination, the trierarchs and leading Athenians at Samos were now eager to overthrow the democracy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="48" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The matter was stirred in the camp first of all, and introduced into the city afterwards. A few persons went over from Samos to Alcibiades, and conferred with him: to them he held out the hope that he would make, first <pb n="370"/> of all Tissaphernes, and secondly the King himself, their friend, if they would put down democracy;<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>A few of the oligarchs confer with Alcibiades.

And so the aristocracy, on whom the heaviest burdens are apt to fall<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.63">8.63 fin.</bibl></note>, conceived great hopes of getting the government into their own hands, and overcoming their enemies.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Returning to Samos, the envoys drew all such as seemed desirable accomplices into a conspiracy, while the language held in public to the main body of the army was that the King would be their friend and would supply them with money if Alcibiades was restored and democracy given up.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now the multitude were at first dissatisfied with the scheme, but the prospect of the King's pay was so grateful to them that they offered no opposition; and the authors of the movement, after they had broached the idea to the people, once more considered the proposals of Alcibiades among themselves and the members of their clubs. Most of them thought the matter safe and straightforward enough.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Phrynichus, who was still general, was of another mind. He maintained, and rightly, that Alcibiades cared no more for oligarchy than he did for democracy, and in seeking to change the existing form of government was only considering how he might be recalled and restored to his country at the invitation of the clubs; whereas their one care should be to avoid disunion. Why should the King go out of his way to join the Athenians whom he did not trust, when he would only get into trouble with the Peloponnesians, who were now as great a naval power, and held some of the most important cities in his dominion?&mdash;it would be much easier for him to make friends with them, who had never done him any harm.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As to the allies, to whom they had promised the blessings of oligarchy which they were now <pb n="371"/> about to enjoy themselves, he would be bound that the revolted cities would not return to them, and that their old allies would be not a whit more loyal in consequence. The form of government was indifferent to them if they could only be free, but they did not want to be in subjection either to an oligarchy or to a democracy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And as for the socalled nobility, the allies thought that they would be quite as troublesome as the people; they were the persons who suggested crimes to the popular mind; who provided the means for their execution; and who reaped the fruits themselves. As far as it rested with the oligarchy the punishment of death would be inflicted unscrupulously, and without trial, whereas the people brought the oligarchs to their senses, and were a refuge to which the oppressed might always have recourse.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Experience had taught the cities this lesson, and he was well aware of their feelings. He was therefore himself utterly dissatisfied with the proposals of Alcibiades, and disapproved of the whole affair.

				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Phrynichus now knew that a proposal would be made for the restoration of Alcibiades, which<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Phrynichus, thinking to betray Alcibiades to Astyochus, is himself betrayed by them both. He continues to make treasonable proposals to them;</hi></note> the Athenians would certainly accept; and having opposed his return he feared that Alcibiades, if he were recalled, would do him a mischief, because he had stood in his way.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So he had recourse to the following device. He secretly sent a letter to Astyochus, the Lacedaemonian admiral, who was still at Miletus, informing him that Alcibiades was gaining over Tissaphernes to the Athenians and ruining the Peloponnesian <pb n="372"/> interests. He gave full particulars, adding that Astyochus must excuse him if he sought to harm an enemy even at some cost to his country<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.92">6.92</bibl> for a similar excuse.</note>.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now Astyochus had no idea of punishing Alcibiades, who moreover no longer came within his reach. On the contrary, he went to him and to Tissaphernes at Magnesia, and, turning informer, told them of the letter which he had received from Samos. (He was believed to have sold himself to Tissaphernes, to whom he now betrayed everything; and this was the reason why he was so unwilling to bestir himself about the reduction of the pay<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.45">8.45 med.</bibl></note>.)
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Alcibiades immediately sent a despatch denouncing to the leaders of the army at Samos the treason of Phrynichus, and demanding that he should be put to death.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Phrynichus was confounded<note anchored="yes">Placing the comma after <foreign lang="greek">Fru/nixos.</foreign></note>, and in fact the revelation placed him in the greatest danger. However he sent again to Astyochus, blaming him for having violated his former confidence. He then proceeded to say that he was ready to give the Peloponnesians the opportunity of destroying the whole Athenian army, and he explained in detail how Samos, which was unfortified, might best be attacked; adding that he was in danger of his life for their sakes, and that he need no longer apologise if by this or any other means he could save himself from destruction at the hands of his worst enemies. Again the message was communicated by Astyochus to Alcibiades.

				<p>
					<milestone n="51" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Now Phrynichus was well aware of his treachery, and he knew that another letter from Alcibiades<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>of which he also gives information to the Athenians. Thus he is purged of his treason, and outwits Alcibiades, who is thought to have acted from spite.</hi></note> giving further information was on the point of arriving. Before its arrival he himself warned the army that, Samos being unwalled and some of the ships not anchoring within the harbour, the enemy were going to attack the fleet; of this he had certain knowledge. They <pb n="373"/> ought therefore to fortify the place as quickly as they could, and to take every precaution. As he was a general he could execute his proposals by his own authority.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So they set to work, and in consequence Samos, which would have been fortified in any case, was fortified all the sooner. Not long afterwards the expected letter came from Alcibiades warning the Athenians that the army was being betrayed by Phrynichus, and that the enemy were going to make an attack.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But Alcibiades was not trusted; he was thought to have attributed to Phrynichus out of personal animosity complicity in the enemy's designs, with which he was himself acquainted. Thus he did him no harm, but rather strengthened his position by telling the same tale.

For his quarrel with them had broken out before the Peloponnesians went to Rhodes, where they were at present stationed<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.45">8.45 init.</bibl></note>; and the words of Alcibiades, who had previously warned Tissaphernes that the Lacedaemonians were the liberators of all the cities of Hellas, were verified by the protest of Lichas, who declared that 'for the King to hold all the cities which he or his ancestors had held was a stipulation not to be endured.' So Alcibiades, who was playing for a great stake, was very assiduous in paying his court to Tissaphernes. <pb n="374"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Meanwhile Peisander and the other envoys who had been sent from Samos arrived at Athens<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Peisander and his colleagues arrive at.

They said much in few words, insisting above all that if the Athenians restored Alcibiades and modified their democracy they might secure the alliance of the King and gain the victory over the Peloponnesians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>There was great opposition to any change in the democracy, and the enemies of Alcibiades were loud in protesting that it would be a dreadful thing if he were permitted to return in defiance of the law. The Eumolpidae and Ceryces called heaven and earth to witness that the city must never restore a man who had been banished for profaning the mysteries. Amid violent expressions of indignation Peisander came forward, and having up the objectors one by one he pointed out to them that the Peloponnesians had a fleet ready for action as large as their own, that they numbered more cities among their allies, and that they were furnished with money by Tissaphernes and the King; whereas the Athenians had spent everything:
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>he then asked them whether there was the least hope of saving the country unless the King could be won over. They all acknowledged that there was none. He then said to them plainly:&mdash;
				</p>
				<p>'But this alliance is impossible unless we are governed in a wiser manner, and office is confined to a smaller number: then the King will trust us. Do not let us be dwelling on the form of the constitution<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/wmen</foreign> with most MSS.</note> which we may hereafter change as we please, when the very existence of Athens is at stake.

				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="54" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The people were very angry at the first suggestion of an oligarchy; but when Peisander proved to them that they had no other resource, partly in fear, and partly in hope <pb n="375"/> that it might be hereafter changed, they gave way.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So a decree was passed that Peisander himself and ten others should go<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>But is there any alternative?

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Peisander also denounced Phrynichus, and therefore the people dismissed him and his colleague Scironides from their commands, and appointed Diomedon and Leon to be admirals in their room. Peisander thought that Phrynichus would stand in the way of the negotiations with Alcibiades, and for this reason he calumniated him, alleging that he had betrayed Iasus and Amorges.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then he went, one after another, to all the clubs which already existed in Athens for the management of trials and elections, and exhorted them to unite, and by concerted action put down the democracy. When he had completed all the necessary preparations and the plot was ripe, he and his colleagues proceeded on their voyage to Tissaphernes.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same winter Leon and Diomedon, who had now entered upon their command,<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians command Rhodes from Chalc&egrave;.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>About this time Xenophantidas, a Lacedaemonian, brought word to Rhodes from Pedaritus, the governor of Chios, that the Athenian fortification was now completed<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.40">8.40 fin.</bibl></note>, and that if the Peloponnesians with their whole fleet did not at once come to the rescue Chios would be lost.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Meanwhile Pedaritus in person with his mercenaries<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.28">8.28 fin.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 8.38">38 med.</bibl></note> and the whole Chian army attacked the lines which protected the Athenian fleet; he took a part of the wall and obtained possession of certain ships which were drawn up on shore. But the Athenians rushed out upon them, and first putting to flight the Chians, soon defeated the rest of his forces. Pedaritus himself was slain, together with many of the Chians, and a great quantity of arms was taken.

Meanwhile Peisander and his colleagues came to Tissaphernes and proposed an agreement.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But Alcibiades was not as yet quite sure of Tissaphernes, who was more afraid of the Peloponnesians than of the Athenians, and was still desirous, in accordance with the lesson which he had been taught by Alcibiades himself, to wear them both out. So he had recourse to the device of making Tissaphernes ask too much, that the negotiations might be broken off. And I imagine that Tissaphernes himself equally wanted them to fail;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>he was moved by his fears, while Alcibiades, seeing that his reluctance was insuperable, did not wish the Athenians to think that he was unable to persuade him&mdash;he wanted them to believe that Tissaphernes was already persuaded and anxious to make terms but could not, because they themselves would not grant enough.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And so, speaking on behalf of Tissaphernes who was himself present, he made such exorbitant demands that, although for a time the Athenians were willing to grant anything which he asked, at length the responsibility of breaking off the conference was thrown upon them. He and Tissaphernes demanded, first the cession of all <pb n="377"/> Ionia to the King, then that of the neighboring islands; and there were some other conditions. Thus far the Athenians offered no opposition. But at last, fearing that his utter inability to fulfil his promise would be exposed, at the third interview he demanded permission for the King to build ships, and sail along his own coast wherever and with as many vessels as he pleased. This was too much; the Athenians now perceived that matters were hopeless, and that they had been duped by Alcibiades. So they departed in anger to Samos.

					<milestone n="57" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Immediately afterwards, and during the same winter, Tissaphernes came down to Caunus wishing to bring back the Peloponnesians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Tissaphernes, holding the balance, now thinks that the time has come to make another treaty with the Lacedaemonians.</hi></note> to Miletus, and once more to make a treaty with them on such terms as he could get; he was willing to maintain them, for he did not want to become wholly their enemy, and was afraid that if their large fleet were at a loss for supplies they might be compelled to fight and be defeated, or their crews might desert; in either case the Athenians would gain their ends without his assistance. Above all he feared lest they should ravage the adjoining mainland in search of food.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Taking into account all these possibilities, and true to his policy, which was to hold the balance evenly between the two contending powers, he sent for the Lacedaemonians, furnished them with supplies, and made a third treaty with them, which ran as follows:&mdash;

But they determined, as they were already compromised, to proceed by themselves, and to take measures for carrying the movement through; they meant also to persevere in the war, and were willing enough to contribute money or anything else which might be wanted out of their own houses, since they would now be toiling, not for others, but for themselves<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.48">8.48 init.</bibl></note>.

The recent change was exactly what they desired; for the government had been reformed without danger to themselves, and the democracy, who would have opposed them, had been overthrown.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Thus the result in the case of Thasos, and also, as I imagine, of many other states, was the opposite of what the oligarchical conspirators had intended.

The whole scheme now came to light.
					
					
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>A motion was made to abolish all the existing magistracies and the payment of magistrates, and to choose a presiding board of five; these five were to choose a hundred, and each of the hundred was to co-opt three others. The Four Hundred thus selected were to meet in the council-chamber; they were to have absolute authority, and might govern as they deemed best; the Five Thousand were to be summoned by them whenever they chose.

					<milestone n="68" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The mover of this proposal, and to outward appearance the most active partisan of the revolution, was-Peisander, but the real author and maturer of the whole scheme, who had been longest interested in it, was Antiphon, a man inferior in virtue to none of his contemporaries, and possessed of remarkable powers of thought and gifts of speech. He did not like to come forward in the assembly, or in <pb n="385"/> any other public arena. To the multitude, who were suspicious of his great abilities, he was<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The leading intellect of he revolution was Antiphon, who had hitherto led a retired life; he was the best life; he was the best adviser of clients, and when his own turn cane made the best defence of himself Phrynichus and Theramenes were also men of great ability, and fit instruments to accomplish the arduous task.</hi></note> an object of dislike; but there was no man who could do more for any who consulted him, whether their business lay in the courts of justice or in the assembly.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and became exposed to the of the people, and he being accused of taking part in the plot had to speak in his own case, his defence was undoubtedly the best ever made by ally man tried on a capital charge down to my time.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Phrynichus also showed extraordinary zeal in the interests of the oligarchy. He was afraid of Alcibiades, whom he knew to be cognisant of the intrigue which when at Samos he had carried on with Astyochus<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.50">8.50</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 8.51">51</bibl>.</note>, and he thought that no oligarchy would ever be likely to restore him. Having once set his hand to the work he was deemed by the others to be the man upon whom they could best depend in the hour of danger.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Another chief leader of the revolutionary party was Theramenes the son of Hagnon, a good speaker and a sagacious man. No wonder then that, in the hands of all these able men, the attempt, however arduous, succeeded. For an easy thing it certainly was not, about one hundred years after the fall of the tyrants, to destroy the liberties of the Athenians, who not only were a free, but during more than one half of this time had been an imperial people.

The Four Hundred then installed themselves in the council-chamber; for the present they elected by lot Prytanes of their own number, and did all that was customary in the way of prayers and sacrifices to the Gods at their entrance into office. Soon however they wholly changed the democratic system; and although they did not recall the exiles, because Alcibiades was one of them, they governed the city with a high hand.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Some few whom they thought would be better out of the way were put to death by them, others imprisoned, others again <pb n="387"/> exiled.

But when he drew near there was no sign of the slightest disorder within; the Athenians, sending out their cavalry and a force of heavy and light-armed troops and archers, struck down a few of his soldiers who had ventured too far, and retained possession of some arms and dead bodies;

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>There was a certain Hyperbolus, an Athenian of no character, who, not for any fear of his power and influence, but for his villany, and because the city was ashamed of him, had been ostracised. This man was assassinated by them, and they were abetted in the act by Charminus, one of the generals, and by certain of the <pb n="389"/> Athenians at Samos, to whom they pledged their faith.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They also joined these Athenians in other deeds of violence, and were eager to fall upon the popular party. But the people, discovering their intention, gave information to the generals Leon and Diomedon, who were impatient of the attempted oligarchy because they were respected by the multitude, to Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus, one of whom was a trierarch and the other a private soldier, and to others who were thought to be the steadiest opponents of the oligarchical movement. They entreated them not to allow the Samian people to be destroyed, and the island of Samos, without which the Athenian empire would never have lasted until then, to be estranged.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Thereupon the generals went to the soldiers one by one, and begged them to interfere, addressing themselves especially to the Parali, or crew of the ship Paralus, all freeborn Athenians, who were at any time ready to attack oligarchy, real or imaginary. Leon and Diomedon, whenever they sailed to any other place, left some ships for the protection of the Samians.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And so, when the three hundred began the attack, all the crews, especially the Parali, hastened to the rescue, and the popular party gained the victory. Of the three hundred they slew about thirty, and the three most guilty were banished; the rest they forgave, and henceforward all lived together under a democracy.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>No sooner had he arrived than the Four Hundred imprisoned two or three of the Parali, and taking away their ship transferred the rest of the crew to a troop-ship which was ordered to keep guard about Euboea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Chaereas, seeing promptly <pb n="390"/> how matters stood, had contrived to steal away and get back to Samos, where he told the soldiers with much aggravation the news from Athens, how they were punishing everybody with stripes, and how no one might speak a word against the government; he declared that their wives and children were being outraged, and that the oligarchy were going to take the relations of all the men serving at Samos who were not of their faction and shut them up, intending, if the fleet did not submit, to put them to death.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>All the Samians who were of full age took the same oath, and the Athenian soldiers determined to make common cause with the Samians in their troubles and dangers, and invited them to share their fortunes.

And again, with the help of the fleet we are better able to obtain supplies than the Athenians at home. Indeed the only reason why the citizens have so long retained the command of the Piraeus is that we who are stationed at Samos are the advanced guard of the Piraeus itself.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And now if they will not agree to give us back the constitution, it will come to this-that we shall be better able to drive them off the sea than they us. The help which the city gives us against our enemies is poor and worthless;

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>An assembly was called, at which Alcibiades lamented the cruel and unjust fate which had banished him; he then spoke at length of their political prospects; and bright indeed were the hopes of future victory with which he inspired them, while he magnified to excess his present influence over Tissaphernes. He meant thereby first to frighten <pb n="395"/> the oligarchy at home, and effect the dissolution of their clubs; and secondly, to exalt himself in the eyes of the army at Samos and fortify their resolution; thirdly, to widen the breach between Tissaphernes and the enemy, and blast the hopes of the Lacedaemonians. Having these objects in view, Alcibiades carried his fulsome assurances to the utmost.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He was now more hated than ever. As before, the soldiers began to gather in knots and to express discontent; and not only the soldiers, but some men of position complained that they had never yet received their full pay, and that the sum given was too small, while even this was irregularly paid; if nobody would fight, or go where food could be got, the men would desert.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the men saw the action they, sailor-like, lost all control of themselves, and rushed upon him, intending to stone him; but he, perceiving what was coming, ran to an altar, where taking refuge he escaped unhurt, and they were parted.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Milesians, who were likewise discontented, captured by a sudden assault a fort which had been built in Miletus by Tissaphernes, and drove out the garrison which he had placed there. Of <pb n="397"/> this proceeding the allies approved, especially the Syracusans;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Lichas, however, was displeased, and said that the Milesians and the inhabitants of the King's country should submit to the necessary humiliation, and manage to keep on good terms with Tissaphernes until the war was well over. His conduct on this and on other occasions excited a strong feeling against him among the Milesians; and afterwards, when he fell sick and died, they would not let him be buried where his Lacedaemonian comrades would have laid him.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Tissaphernes sent with him an envoy, one of his own attendants, a Carian named Gaulites, who spoke both Greek and Persian<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.109">4.109 med.</bibl></note>. He was instructed to complain of the destruction of the fort by the Milesians, and also to defend Tissaphernes against their charges.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At first the soldiers would not listen to them, but shouted 'Death to the subverters of the democracy.'
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When quiet had been with difficulty restored, the envoys told them that the change was not meant for the destruction but for the preservation of the state, and that there was no intention of betraying Athens to the enemy, which might have been effected by the new government already if they had pleased during the recent invasion. They declared that all the Five Thousand were in turn to have a share in the administration<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.93">8.93 med.</bibl></note>; and that the families of the sailors were not being outraged, as Chaereas slanderously reported, or in any way molested;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>they were living quietly in their several homes. They defended themselves at length, but the more they said, the more furious and unwilling to listen grew the multitude. Various proposals were made; above all they wanted to sail to the Piraeus. Then Alcibiades appears to have done as eminent<note anchored="yes">Reading <foreign lang="greek">prw=tos.</foreign></note> a service to the state as any man ever did. For if the Athenians at Samos in their excitement had been allowed to sail against their fellow-citizens, the enemy would instantly have obtained possession of Ionia and the Hellespont.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This he prevented, and at that moment no one else could have restrained the multitude: but he did restrain them, and with sharp words protected <pb n="399"/> the envoys against the fury of individuals in the crowd.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He then dismissed them himself with the reply that he had nothing to say against the rule of the Five Thousand, but that the Four Hundred must be got rid of, and the old council of Five Hundred restored.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>If they had reduced the expenditure in order that the soldiers on service might be better off for supplies, he highly approved. For the rest he entreated them to stand firm, and not give way to the enemy; if the city was preserved, there was good hope that they might be reconciled amongst themselves, but if once anything happened either to the army at Samos or to their fellow-citizens at home, there would be no one left to be reconciled with.

					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Alcibiades complimented them, and requested them to come with their forces when they were summoned; he then dismissed them. These Argives came with the Parali who had been ordered by the Four Hundred to cruise off Euboea in a troop-ship<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.74">8.74 med.</bibl></note>; they were afterwards employed in conveying to Lacedaemon certain envoys sent by the Four Hundred, Laespodias, Aristophon, and Melesias.

					<milestone n="87" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During the same summer, and just at the time when the Peloponnesians were most offended with Tissaphernes on various grounds, and above all on account of the restoration of Alcibiades, which finally proved him to be a partisan of the Athenians, he, as if he were wanting to clear himself of these suspicions, prepared to go to <pb n="400"/> Aspendus and fetch the Phoenician ships; and he desired Lichas to go with him. He also said<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Tissaphernes goes to fetch the Phoenician ships. What was his real intention? There were various answers. Thucydides is convinced that he was only pursuing his neutralising policy.</hi></note> that he would assign the charge of the army to his lieutenant Tamos, who would provide for them during his absence.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Why he went to Aspendus, and having gone there never brought the ships, is a question not easy to answer, and which has been answered in various ways.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Phoenician fleet of a hundred and forty-seven ships came as far as Aspendus&mdash;there is no doubt about this; but why they never came further is matter of conjecture. Some think that, in going to Aspendus, Tissaphernes was still pursuing his policy of wearing out the Peloponnesians; at any rate Tamos, who was in charge, supplied them no better, but rather worse. Others are of opinion that he brought up the Phoenician fleet to Aspendus in order to make money by selling the crews their discharge; for he certainly had no idea of using them in actual service. Others think that he was influenced by the outcry against him which had reached Lacedaemon; and that he wanted to create an impression of his honesty: 'Now at any rate he has gone to fetch the ships, and they are really manned.'
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>I believe beyond all question that he wanted to wear out and to neutralise the Hellenic forces; his object was to damage them both while he was losing time in going to Aspendus, and to paralyse their action, and not strengthen either of them by his alliance. For if he had chosen to finish the war, finished it might have been once for all, as any one may see: he would have brought up the ships, and would in all probability have given the victory to the Lacedaemonians, who lay opposite to the Athenians and were fully a match for them already.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The excuse which he gave for not bringing them is the most conclusive evidence against him; he said that there was not as many collected as the King had commanded. But if so, the King would <pb n="401"/> have been all the better pleased, for his money would have been saved and Tissaphernes would have accomplished the same result at less expense.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Whatever may have been his intention, Tissaphernes came to Aspendus and conferred with the Phoenicians, and the Peloponnesians at his request sent Philip, a Lacedaemonian, with two triremes to fetch the ships.
				</p>

					<milestone n="88" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>Alcibiades, when he learned that Tissaphernes was going to Aspendus, sailed thitherward himself<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Alcibiades, knowing that Tissaphernes never intended to bring up the Phoenician fleet, promise to keep it back.</hi></note> with thirteen ships, promising the army at Samos that he would not fail to do them a great service. He would either bring the Phoenician ships to the Athenians, or, at any rate, make sure that they did not join the Peloponnesians. He had probably known all along the real mind of Tissaphernes, and that he never meant to bring them at all. He wanted further to injure him as much as possible in the opinion of the Peloponnesians when they observed how friendly Tissaphernes was towards himself and the Athenians; their distrust would compel him to change sides. So he set sail and went on his voyage eastward, making directly for Phaselis and Caunus.

The greater number of the oligarchs, who were already dissatisfied, and would have gladly got out of the whole affair if they safely could, were now much encouraged. They began to come together and to criticise the conduct of affairs.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Their leaders were some of the oligarchical generals and actually in office at the time, for example, Theramenes the son of Hagnon and <pb n="402"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This was the political phrase of which they availed themselves, but the truth was that most of them were given up to private ambition of that sort which is more fatal than anything to an oligarchy succeeding a democracy. For the instant an oligarchy is established the promoters of it disdain mere equality, and everybody thinks that he ought to be far above everybody else. Whereas in a democracy, when an election is made, a man is less disappointed at a failure because he has not been competing with his equals.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The influence which most sensibly affected them were the great power of Alcibiades at Samos, and an impression that the oligarchy was not likely to be permanent. Accordingly every one was struggling hard to be the first champion of the people himself.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="90" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The leading men among the Four Hundred most violently opposed to the restoration of democracy were Phrynichus, who had been general at Samos, and had there come into antagonism with Alcibiades<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.48">8.48</bibl>.</note>, Aristarchus, a man who had always been the most thorough-going enemy of the people, Peisander, and Antiphon. These and the other leaders, both at the first establishment of the oligarchy<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.71">8.71 fin.</bibl></note>, and again later when the army at Samos declared for the <pb n="403"/> democracy<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.86">8.86 fin.</bibl></note>, sent envoys of their own number to Lacedaemon, and were always anxious to make peace; meanwhile they continued the fortification which<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Phrynichus, Aristarchus, Peisander, and Antiphon, the thorough-going oligarchs, are ready to betray Athens to the enemy if they can save their own power. They send, for the third time, an embassy to Sparta, and carry on with increased vigour the fortification of Eetionea.</hi></note> they had begun to build at Eetionea. They were confirmed in their purposes after the return of their own ambassadors from Samos; for they saw that not only the people, but even those who had appeared steadfast adherents of their own party, were now changing their minds.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So, fearing what might happen both at Athens and Samos, they sent Antiphon, Phrynichus, and ten others, in great haste, authorising them to make peace with Lacedaemon upon anything like tolerable terms; at the same time they proceeded more diligently than ever with the fortification of Eetionea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The design was (so Theramenes and his party averred) not to bar the Piraeus against the fleet at Samos should they sail thither with hostile intentions, but rather to admit the enemy with his sea and land forces whenever they pleased. This Eetionea is the mole of the Piraeus and forms one side of the entrance;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>the new fortification was to be so connected with the previously existing wall, which looked towards the land, that a handful of men stationed between the two walls might command the approach from the sea. For the old wall looking towards the land, and the new inner wall in process of construction facing the water, ended at the same point in one of the two forts which protected the narrow mouth of the harbour. A cross-wall was added, taking in the largest storehouse in the Piraeus and the nearest to the new fortification, which it joined;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>this the authorities held themselves, and commanded every one to deposit their corn there, not only what came in by sea but what they had on the spot, and to take from thence all that they wanted to sell. <pb n="404"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="91" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>For some time Theramenes had been circulating whispers of their designs, and when the envoys<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The envoys are unsuccessful: but a Lacedaemonian squadron hovering about the coast seems to be acting in concert with the ruling party.</hi></note> returned from Lacedaemon without having effected anything in the nature of a treaty for the Athenian people, he declared that this fort was likely to prove the ruin of Athens.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the Euboeans had requested the Peloponnesians to send them a fleet<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.60">8.60 med.</bibl></note>, and just at this time two and forty ships, including Italian vessels from Tarentum and Locri and a few from Sicily, were stationed at Las in Laconia, and were making ready to sail to Euboea under the command of Agesandridas the son of Agesander, a Spartan. Theramenes insisted that these ships were intended, not for Euboea, but for the party who were fortifying Eetionea, and that, if the people were not on the alert, they would be undone before they knew where they were.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The charge was not a mere calumny, but had some foundation in the disposition of the ruling party. For what would have best pleased them would have been, retaining the oligarchy in any case, to have preserved the Athenian empire over the allies; failing this, to keep merely their ships and walls, and to be independent; if this too proved impracticable, at any rate they would not see democracy restored, and themselves fall the first victims, but would rather bring in the enemy and come to terms with them, not caring if thereby the city lost walls and ships and everything else, provided that they could save their own lives.

					<milestone n="92" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So they worked diligently at the fort, which had entrances and postern-gates and every facility for introducing the enemy, and did their best to finish the building in time.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As yet the murmurs of discontent had been secret and confined to a few; when suddenly Phrynichus, after his return from the embassy to Lacedaemon, in a full market-place, having just quitted the council-chamber, was struck by an assassin, one of the force employed in guarding the frontier, <pb n="405"/> and fell dead. The man who dealt the blow escaped; his accomplice, an Argive, was seized<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>Phrynichus is assassinated. The enemies of the oligarchy, secretly instigated by Theramenes, now grow bolder. The soldiers who were building the fort seize the oligarch Alexicles.

After a scene of tumult, in which the two parties nearly come to blows, the fort is demolished to the cry of 'Let the Five Thousand rule.'</hi></note> and put to the torture by order of the Four Hundred, but did not disclose any name or say who had instigated the deed. All he would confess was that a number of persons used to assemble at the house of the commander of the frontier guard, and in other houses. No further measures followed; and so Theramenes and Aristocrates, and the other citizens, whether members of the Four Hundred or not, who were of the same mind, were emboldened to take decided steps.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Peloponnesians had already sailed round from Las, and having overrun Aegina had cast anchor at Epidaurus; and Theramenes insisted that if they had been on their way to Euboea they would never have gone up the Saronic gulf to Aegina and then returned and anchored at Epidaurus, but that some one had invited them for the purposes which he had always alleged; it was impossible therefore to be any longer indifferent.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After many insinuations and inflammatory harangues, the people began to take active measures. The hoplites who were at work on the fortification of Eetionea in the Piraeus, among whom was Aristocrates with his own tribe, which, as taxiarch, he commanded, seized Alexicles, an oligarchical general who had been most concerned with the clubs, and shut him up in a house. Others joined in the act, including one Hermon, who commanded the Peripoli stationed at Munychia;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>above all, the rank and file of the hoplites heartily approved. The Four Hundred, who were assembled in the councilhouse when the news was brought to them, were ready in a moment to take up arms, except Theramenes and his associates, who disapproved of their proceedings;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>to these <pb n="406"/> they began to use threats. Theramenes protested, and offered to go with them at once and rescue Alexicles. So, taking one of the generals who was of his own faction, he went down to the Piraeus. Aristarchus and certain young knights came also to the scene of action.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Great and bewildering was the tumult, for in the city the people fancied that the Piraeus was in the hands of the insurgents, and that their prisoner had been killed, and the inhabitants of the Piraeus that they were on the point of being attacked from the city. The elder men with difficulty restrained the citizens, who were running up and down and flying to arms.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Thucydides of Pharsalus, the proxenus of Athens in that city, happening to be on the spot, kept throwing himself in every man's way and loudly entreating the people, when the enemy was lying in wait so near, not to destroy their country. At length they were pacified, and refrained from laying hands on one another.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Theramenes, who was himself a general, came to the Piraeus, and in an angry voice pretended to rate the soldiers, while Aristarchus and the party opposed to the people were furious. No effect was produced on the mass of the hoplites, who were for going to work at once.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>They began asking Theramenes if he thought that the fort was being built to any good end, and whether it would not be better demolished. He answered that, if they thought so, he thought so too. And immediately the hoplites and a crowd of men from the Piraeus got on the walls and began to pull them down. The cry addressed to the people was,' Whoever wishes the Five Thousand to rule and not the Four Hundred, let him come and help us.'
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>For they still veiled their real minds under the name of the Five Thousand, and did not venture to say outright 'Whoever wishes the people to rule': they feared that the Five Thousand might actually exist, and that a man speaking in ignorance to his neighbour might get into trouble. The Four Hundred therefore did not wish the Five Thousand either to exist or to be known not to exist, thinking that to give so many a <pb n="407"/> share in the government would be downright democracy, while at the same time the mystery tended to make the people afraid of one another.
				</p>
				<p>
					<milestone n="93" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The next day the Four Hundred, although much disturbed, met in the council-chamber.<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The soldiers march from the Piraeus to the city. The Four Hundred send deputies to them and try negotiation. They promise to publish the names of the Five Thousand; out of whom the Four Hundred are to be elected.</hi></note> Meanwhile the hoplites in the Piraeus let go Alexicles whom they had seized, and having demolished the fort went to the theatre of Dionysus near Munychia; there piling arms they held an assembly, and resolved to march at once to the city, which they accordingly did, and again piled arms in the temple of the Dioscuri. Presently deputies appeared sent by the Four Hundred.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>These conversed with them singly, and tried to persuade the more reasonable part of them to keep quiet and restrain their comrades, promising that they would publish the names of the Five Thousand, and that out of these the Four Hundred should be in turn elected in such a manner as the Five Thousand might think fit. In the meantime they begged them not to ruin everything, or to drive the city upon the enemy.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The discussion became general on both sides, and at length the whole body of soldiers grew calmer, and turned their thoughts to the danger which threatened the commonwealth. They finally agreed that an assembly should be held on a fixed day in the theatre of Dionysus to deliberate on the restore. ation of harmony.

Every man of the popular party thought that this was what they had been so often told by Theramenes and his friends, and that the ships were sailing to the fort, happily now <pb n="408"/> demolished.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nor is it impossible that Agesandridas may have been hovering about Epidaurus and the neighbourhood by agreement; but it is equally likely that he lingered there of his own accord, with an eye to the agitation which prevailed at Athens, hoping to be on the spot at the critical moment.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians in their haste were compelled to employ crews not yet trained to work together, the city was in a state of revolution, and the matter was vital and urgent; Euboea was all in all to them now that they were shut out from Attica<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.27">7.27 fin.</bibl>, 28 init.</note>. They despatched a fleet under the command of Thymochares to Eretria;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>these ships, added to those which were at Euboea before, made up thirty-six. No sooner had they arrived than they were constrained to fight; for Agesandridas, after his men had taken their midday meal, brought out his own ships from Oropus, which is distant by sea about seven miles from the city of Eretria, and bore down upon them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians at once began to man their <pb n="409"/> ships, fancying that their crews were close at hand; but it had been so contrived that they were getting their provisions from houses at the end of the town, and not in the market, for the Eretrians intentionally sold nothing there that the men might lose time in embarking; the enemy would then come upon them before they were ready, and they would be compelled to put out as best they could.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A signal was also raised at Eretria telling the fleet at Oropus when to attack. The Athenians putting out in this hurried manner, and fighting off the harbour of Eretria, nevertheless resisted for a little while, but before long they fled and were pursued to the shore.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Those of them who took refuge in the city of Eretria, relying on the friendship of the inhabitants, fared worst, for they were butchered by them; but such as gained the fortified position which the Athenians held in the Eretrian territory escaped, and also the crews of the vessels which reached Chalcis.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Peloponnesians, who had taken twenty-two Athenian ships and had killed or made prisoners of the men, erected a trophy. Not long afterwards they induced all Euboea to revolt, except Oreus of which the Athenians still maintained possession. They then set in order the affairs of the island.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But what <pb n="410"/> touched them nearest, and most agitated their minds, was the fear lest their enemies, emboldened by victory, should at once attack the Piraeus, in which no ships were left; indeed they fancied that they were all but there. And had the Peloponnesians been a little more enterprising they could easily have executed such a plan.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Either they might have cruised near, and would then have aggravated the divisions in the city; or by remaining and carrying on a blockade they might have compelled the fleet in Ionia, although hostile to the oligarchy, to come and assist their kindred and their native city; and then the Hellespont, Ionia, all the islands between Ionia and Euboea, in a word, the whole Athenian empire, would have fallen into their hands. But on this as on so many other occasions the Lacedaemonians proved themselves to be the most convenient enemies whom the Athenians could possibly have had.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When the news came the Athenians in their extremity still contrived to man twenty ships, and<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>They immediately depose the Four Hundred, and establish a new government (the best which Thucydides had known) of Five Thousand, being the citizens who supplied themselves with arms.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>No one was <pb n="411"/> to receive pay for holding any office, on pain of falling under a curse. In the numerous other assemblies which were afterwards held they appointed Nomothetae, and by a series of decrees established a constitution. This government during its early days was the best which the Athenians ever enjoyed within my memory. Oligarchy and Democracy were duly attempered. And thus after the miserable state into which she had fallen, the city was again able to raise her head.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The people also passed a vote recalling Alcibiades and others from exile, and sending to him and to the army in Samos exhorted them to act vigorously.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>This was an Athenian fort on the borders of Boeotia which the Corinthians<note anchored="yes">Or, 'which Corinthian volunteers, 'omitting' on their own account.'</note>, having called the Boeotians to their aid, were now besieging on their own account, in order to revenge an overthrow inflicted by the garrison of Oeno&egrave; upon a party of them who were going home from Decelea.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Aristarchus entered into communication with the besiegers, and deceived the garrison by telling them that the Athenian government had come to terms with the Lacedaemonians, and that by one of the conditions of the peace they were required to give up-the place to the Boeotians. They, trusting him, whom they knew to be a general, and being in entire ignorance of what had happened because they were closely invested, capitulated and came out.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>During this summer and about the same time Mindarus transferred the fleet of the Peloponnesians<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>No sign of the Phoenician ships. The Peloponnesians now become aware that Tissaphernes is thoroughly dishonest, and transfer their fleet to Pharnabazus at the Hellespont They are detained at Chios.</hi></note> to the Hellespont, They had been waiting at Miletus. But none of the commissioners whom Tissaphernes on going to Aspendus appointed to supply the fleet gave them anything; and neither the Phoenician ships nor Tissaphernes himself had as yet made their appearance; Philip, who had been sent with Tissaphernes, and Hippocrates, a Spartan then in Phaselis, had informed the admiral Mindarus that the ships would never come, and that Tissaphernes was thoroughly dishonest in his dealings with them. All this time Pharnabazus was inviting them and was eager to secure the assistance of the fleet; he wanted, like Tissaphernes, to raise a revolt, whereby he hoped to profit, among the cities in his own dominion which still remained faithful to Athens. So at length Mindarus, in good order and giving the signal suddenly, lest he should be discovered by the Athenians at Samos, put to sea from Miletus with seventy-three ships, and set sail for the Hellespont, whither in this same summer a Peloponnesian force had already gone in sixteen ships, and had overrun a portion of the Chersonese. But meeting with a storm Mindarus was driven into Icarus, and being detained there five or six days by stress of weather, he put in at Chios.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>When Thrasyllus at Samos heard that he had started from Miletus he sailed away in all haste<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenians pursue them.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Observing that Mindarus was at Chios, and thinking that he could keep him there, he placed scouts at Lesbos and on the mainland opposite, that he might be informed if the ships made any attempt to sail away. He himself coasted along the island to Methymna and <pb n="413"/> ordered a supply of barley-meal and other provisions, intending, if he were long detained, to make Lesbos his head-quarters while attacking Chios. He wanted also to sail against the Lesbian town of Eresus, which had revolted, and, if possible, to destroy the place.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now certain of the chief citizens of Methymna who had been driven into exile had conveyed to the island about fifty hoplites, partisans of theirs, from Cym&egrave;, besides others whom they hired on the mainland, to the number of three hundred in all. They were commanded by Anaxander, a Theban, who was chosen leader because the Lesbians were of Theban descent<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.2">3.2 fin.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.5">5 med.</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 3.13">13 init.</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 8.5">8.5 init.</bibl></note>. They first of all attacked Methymna. In this attempt they were foiled by the timely arrival of the Athenian garrison from Mytilen&egrave;, and being a second time repulsed outside the walls, had marched over the mountains and induced Eresus to revolt.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Thither Thrasyllus sailed, having determined to attack them with all his ships. He found that Thrasybulus had already reached the place, having started from Samos with five ships as soon as he heard that the exiles had landed. But he had come too late to prevent the revolt, and was lying off Eresus.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>There Thrasyllus was also joined by two ships which were on their way home from the Hellespont, and by a squadron from Methymna. The whole fleet now consisted of sixty-seven ships, from the crews of which the generals formed an army, and prepared by the help of engines and by every possible means to take Eresus.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They touched at the harbour of the island Carteria, which belongs to Phocaea, and there taking their midday meal, sailed past the Cymaean territory, and supped at Argennusae on the mainland over against Mytilen&egrave;.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They sailed away some time before dawn, and at Harmatus, which is opposite Methymna on the mainland, they again took their midday meal; they quickly passed by the promontory of Lectum, Larissa, Hamaxitus, and the neighboring towns, and finally arrived at Rhoeteum in the Hellespont before midnight. Some of the ships also put into Sigeum and other places in the neighbourhood.

					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>The Athenians, who lay with eighteen ships at Sestos<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.80">8.80 fin.</bibl></note>, knew from the beacons which their<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>The Athenian squadron at Sestos escapes from them with some loss,</hi></note> scouts kindled, and from the sudden blaze of many watch-fires which appeared in the enemy's country, that the Peloponnesians were on the point of sailing into the strait. That very night, getting close under the Chersonese, they moved towards Elaeus, in the hope of reaching the open sea before the enemy's ships arrived.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They passed unseen the sixteen Peloponnesian ships<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.99">8.99 fin.</bibl></note> which were at Abydos, and had been told by<note anchored="yes">Or 'had told.'</note> their now approaching friends to keep a sharp look-out if the Athenians tried to get away.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>One which ran ashore near the temple of Protesilaus the Peloponnesians took, together with the crew; two others without the crews; a fourth they burnt on the shore of Imbros; the crew escaped. <pb n="415"/>

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians, whose scouts had failed them, and who had never imagined that the enemy's fleet could pass them undetected, were quietly besieging Eresus; but on finding out their mistake they instantly set sail and followed the enemy to the Hellespont.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They fell in with and took two Peloponnesian ships, which during the pursuit had ventured too far into the open sea. On the following day they came to Elaeus, where they remained at anchor, and the ships which had taken refuge at Imbros joined them; the next five days were spent in making preparations for the impending engagement.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Perceiving that a battle was imminent, the Athenians, numbering seventy-six ships, extended their line along the Chersonese from Idacus to Arrhiani, and the Peloponnesians, numbering eighty-eight ships, from Abydos to Dardanus. The Syracusans held the right wing of the Peloponnesians;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>the other wing, on which were the swiftest ships, was led by Mindarus himself. Thrasyllus commanded the left wing of the Athenians, and Thrasybulus the right; the other generals had their several posts.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Peloponnesians were eager to begin the engagement, intending, as their left wing extended beyond the right of the Athenians, to prevent them, if possible, from sailing out of the straits <pb n="416"/> again, and also to thrust their centre back on the land which was near. The Athenians, seeing their intention, advanced from the land the wing on which the enemy wanted to cut them off, and succeeded in getting beyond them.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But their left wing by this time had passed the promontory of Cynossema, and the result was that the centre of their line was thinned and weakened&mdash;all the more since their numbers were inferior and the sharp projection of the shore about Cynossema hindered those who were on one side from seeing what was taking place on the other.

				<p>
					<milestone n="105" unit="chapter"/>
					<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>So the Peloponnesians, falling upon the centre of the Athenian fleet, forced their enemies'<note type="margin" anchored="yes"><hi>But in the moment of victory the Peloponnesians fall into confusion and are defeated by a sudden turn of Thrasybulus.</hi></note> ships back on the beach, and having gained a decisive advantage, disembarked to follow up their victory.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Neither Thrasybulus on the right wing, who was pressed hard by superior numbers, nor Thrasyllus on the left, was able to assist them. The promontory of Cynossema hindered the left wing from seeing the action, and the ships of the Syracusans and others, equal in number to their own, kept them fully engaged. But at last, while the victorious Peloponnesians were incautiously pursuing, some one ship, some another, a part of their line began to fall into disorder.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thrasybulus remarked their confusion, and at once left off extending his wing; then turning upon the ships which were opposed to him, he repulsed and put them to flight; he next faced<note anchored="yes">Or, 'intercepted.</note> the conquering and now scattered ships of the Peloponnesian centre, struck at them, and threw them into such a panic that hardly any of them resisted. The Syracusans too had by this time given way to Thrasyllus, and were still more inclined to fly when they saw the others flying. <pb n="417"/>

Not many ships were taken by the Athenians; for the Hellespont, being narrow, afforded a retreat to the enemy within a short distance. Nevertheless nothing could have been more opportune for them than this victory at sea;
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>for some time past they had feared the Peloponnesian navy on account of their disaster in Sicily, as well as of the various smaller defeats which they had sustained<note anchored="yes">Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.95">8.95</bibl>, <bibl n="Thuc. 8.102">102</bibl>.</note>.

					<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They had taken eight Chian vessels, five Corinthian, two Ambracian, two Boeotian, and of the Leucadians, Lacedaemonians, Syracusans, and Pellenians one each. Their own loss amounted to fifteen ships.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They raised a trophy on the promontory of Cynossema, and then collecting the wrecks, and giving up to the enemy his dead under a flag of truce, sent a trireme carrying intelligence of the victory to Athens.
					
					<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>On the arrival of the ship and the news of a success so incredible after the calamities which had befallen them in Euboea and during the revolution, the Athenians were greatly encouraged.

					<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Meanwhile the Peloponnesians sailed from Abydos to Elaeus, and recovered as many of their own captured vessels as were still seaworthy; the rest had been burnt by the Elaeusians.
