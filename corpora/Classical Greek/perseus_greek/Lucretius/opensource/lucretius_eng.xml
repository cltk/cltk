<p>PROEM</p>

<l>Mother of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, delight of Gods and men,</l>
<l>Dear Venus that beneath the gliding stars</l>
<l>Makest to teem the many-voyaged main</l>
<l>And fruitful lands- for all of living things</l>
<l>Through thee alone are evermore conceived,</l>
<l>Through thee are risen to visit the great sun-</l>
<l>Before thee, Goddess, and thy coming on,</l>
<l>Flee stormy wind and massy cloud away,</l>
<l>For thee the daedal Earth bears scented flowers,</l>
<l>For thee waters of the unvexed deep</l>
<l>Smile, and the hollows of the serene sky</l>
<l>Glow with diffused radiance for thee!</l>
<l>For soon as comes the springtime face of day,</l>
<l>And procreant gales blow from the West unbarred,</l>
<l>First fowls of air, smit to the heart by thee,</l>
<l>Foretoken thy approach, O thou Divine,</l>
<l>And leap the wild herds round the happy fields</l>
<l>Or swim the bounding torrents. Thus amain,</l>
<l>Seized with the spell, all creatures follow thee</l>
<l>Whithersoever thou walkest forth to lead,</l>
<l>And thence through seas and mountains and swift streams,</l>
<l>Through leafy homes of birds and greening plains,</l>
<l>Kindling the lure of love in every breast,</l>
<l>Thou bringest the eternal generations forth,</l>
<l>Kind after kind. And since 'tis thou alone</l>
<l>Guidest the Cosmos, and without thee naught</l>
<l>Is risen to reach the shining shores of light,</l>
<l>Nor aught of joyful or of lovely born,</l>
<l>Thee do I crave co-partner in that verse</l>
<l>Which I presume on Nature to compose</l>
<l>For Memmius mine, whom thou hast willed to be</l>
<l>Peerless in every grace at every hour-</l>
<l>Wherefore indeed, Divine one, give my words</l>
<l>Immortal charm. Lull to a timely rest</l>
<l>O'er sea and land the savage works of war,</l>
<l>For thou alone hast power with public peace</l>
<l>To aid mortality; since he who rules</l>
<l>The savage works of battle, puissant Mars,</l>
<l>How often to thy bosom flings his strength</l>
<l>O'ermastered by the eternal wound of love-</l>
<l>And there, with eyes and full throat backward thrown,</l>
<l>Gazing, my Goddess, open-mouthed at thee,</l>
<l>Pastures on love his greedy sight, his breath</l>
<l>Hanging upon thy lips. Him thus reclined</l>
<l>Fill with thy holy body, round, above!</l>
<l>Pour from those lips soft syllables to win</l>
<l>Peace for the Romans, glorious Lady, peace!</l>
<l>For in a season troublous to the state</l>
<l>Neither may I attend this task of mine</l>
<l>With thought untroubled, nor mid such events</l>
<l>The illustrious scion of the Memmian house</l>
<l>Neglect the civic cause.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="50"/>
<l>And for the rest, summon to judgments true,</l>
<l>Unbusied ears and singleness of mind</l>
<l>Withdrawn from cares; lest these my gifts, arranged</l>
<l>For thee with eager service, thou disdain</l>
<l>Before thou comprehendest: since for thee</l>
<l>I prove the supreme law of Gods and sky,</l>
<l>And the primordial germs of things unfold,</l>
<l>Whence Nature all creates, and multiplies</l>
<l>And fosters all, and whither she resolves</l>
<l>Each in the end when each is overthrown.</l>
<l>This ultimate stock we have devised to name</l>
<l>Procreant atoms, matter, seeds of things,</l>
<l>Or primal bodies, as primal to the world.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="62"/>
<l rend="indent">                         Whilst human kind</l>
<l>Throughout the lands lay miserably crushed</l>
<l>Before all eyes beneath Religion- who</l>
<l>Would show her head along the region skies,</l>
<l>Glowering on mortals with her hideous face-</l>
<l>A Greek it was who first opposing dared</l>
<l>Raise mortal eyes that terror to withstand,</l>
<l>Whom nor the fame of Gods nor lightning's stroke</l>
<l>Nor threatening thunder of the ominous sky</l>
<l>Abashed; but rather chafed to angry zest</l>
<l>His dauntless heart to be the first to rend</l>
<l>The crossbars at the gates of Nature old.</l>
<l>And thus his will and hardy wisdom won;</l>
<l>And forward thus he fared afar, beyond</l>
<l>The flaming ramparts of the world, until</l>
<l>He wandered the unmeasurable All.</l>
<l>Whence he to us, a conqueror, reports</l>
<l>What things can rise to being, what cannot,</l>
<l>And by what law to each its scope prescribed,</l>
<l>Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.</l>
<l>Wherefore Religion now is under foot,</l>
<l>And us his victory now exalts to heaven.</l>

<milestone unit="card" n="80"/>
<l rend="indent">  I fear perhaps thou deemest that we fare</l>
<l>An impious road to realms of thought profane;</l>
<l>But 'tis that same religion oftener far</l>
<l>Hath bred the foul impieties of men:</l>
<l>As once at Aulis, the elected chiefs,</l>
<l>Foremost of heroes, Danaan counsellors,</l>
<l>Defiled Diana's altar, virgin queen,</l>
<l>With Agamemnon's daughter, foully slain.</l>
<l>She felt the chaplet round her maiden locks</l>
<l>And fillets, fluttering down on either cheek,</l>
<l>And at the altar marked her grieving sire,</l>
<l>The priests beside him who concealed the knife,</l>
<l>And all the folk in tears at sight of her.</l>
<l>With a dumb terror and a sinking knee</l>
<l>She dropped; nor might avail her now that first</l>
<l>'Twas she who gave the king a father's name.</l>
<l>They raised her up, they bore the trembling girl</l>
<l>On to the altar- hither led not now</l>
<l>With solemn rites and hymeneal choir,</l>
<l>But sinless woman, sinfully foredone,</l>
<l>A parent felled her on her bridal day,</l>
<l>Making his child a sacrificial beast</l>
<l>To give the ships auspicious winds for Troy:</l>
<l>Such are the crimes to which Religion leads.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="102"/>
<l rend="indent">  And there shall come the time when even thou,</l>
<l>Forced by the soothsayer's terror-tales, shalt seek</l>
<l>To break from us. Ah, many a dream even now</l>
<l>Can they concoct to rout thy plans of life,</l>
<l>And trouble all thy fortunes with base fears.</l>
<l>I own with reason: for, if men but knew</l>
<l>Some fixed end to ills, they would be strong</l>
<l>By some device unconquered to withstand</l>
<l>Religions and the menacings of seers.</l>
<l>But now nor skill nor instrument is theirs,</l>
<l>Since men must dread eternal pains in death.</l>
<l>For what the soul may be they do not know,</l>
<l>Whether 'tis born, or enter in at birth,</l>
<l>And whether, snatched by death, it die with us,</l>
<l>Or visit the shadows and the vasty caves</l>
<l>Of Orcus, or by some divine decree</l>
<l>Enter the brute herds, as our Ennius sang,</l>
<l>Who first from lovely <placeName key="tgn,2003745">Helicon</placeName> brought down</l>
<l>A laurel wreath of bright perennial leaves,</l>
<l>Renowned forever among the Italian clans.</l>
<l>Yet Ennius too in everlasting verse</l>
<l>Proclaims those vaults of Acheron to be,</l>
<l>Though thence, he said, nor souls nor bodies fare,</l>
<l>But only phantom figures, strangely wan,</l>
<l>And tells how once from out those regions rose</l>
<l>Old Homer's ghost to him and shed salt tears</l>
<l>And with his words unfolded Nature's source.</l>
<l>Then be it ours with steady mind to clasp</l>
<l>The purport of the skies- the law behind</l>
<l>The wandering courses of the sun and moon;</l>
<l>To scan the powers that speed all life below;</l>
<l>But most to see with reasonable eyes</l>
<l>Of what the mind, of what the soul is made,</l>
<l>And what it is so terrible that breaks</l>
<l>On us asleep, or waking in disease,</l>
<l>Until we seem to mark and hear at hand</l>
<l>Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="136"/>
<l rend="indent">  I know how hard it is in Latian verse</l>
<l>To tell the dark discoveries of the Greeks,</l>
<l>Chiefly because our pauper-speech must find</l>
<l>Strange terms to fit the strangeness of the thing;</l>
<l>Yet worth of thine and the expected joy</l>
<l>Of thy sweet friendship do persuade me on</l>
<l>To bear all toil and wake the clear nights through,</l>
<l>Seeking with what of words and what of song</l>
<l>I may at last most gloriously uncloud</l>
<l>For thee the light beyond, wherewith to view</l>
<l>The core of being at the centre hid.</l>

<milestone unit="card" n="146"/>
<p>SUBSTANCE IS ETERNAL</p>

<l>This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,</l>
<l>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</l>
<l>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</l>
<l>But only Nature's aspect and her law,</l>
<l>Which, teaching us, hath this exordium:</l>
<l>Nothing from nothing ever yet was born.</l>
<l>Fear holds dominion over mortality</l>
<l>Only because, seeing in land and sky</l>
<l>So much the cause whereof no wise they know,</l>
<l>Men think Divinities are working there.</l>
<l>Meantime, when once we know from nothing still</l>
<l>Nothing can be create, we shall divine</l>
<l>More clearly what we seek: those elements</l>
<l>From which alone all things created are,</l>
<l>And how accomplished by no tool of Gods.</l>
<l>Suppose all sprang from all things: any kind</l>
<l>Might take its origin from any thing,</l>
<l>No fixed seed required. Men from the sea</l>
<l>Might rise, and from the land the scaly breed,</l>
<l>And, fowl full fledged come bursting from the sky;</l>
<l>The horned cattle, the herds and all the wild</l>
<l>Would haunt with varying offspring tilth and waste;</l>
<l>Nor would the same fruits keep their olden trees,</l>
<l>But each might grow from any stock or limb</l>
<l>By chance and change. Indeed, and were there not</l>
<l>For each its procreant atoms, could things have</l>
<l>Each its unalterable mother old?</l>
<l>But, since produced from fixed seeds are all,</l>
<l>Each birth goes forth upon the shores of light</l>
<l>From its own stuff, from its own primal bodies.</l>
<l>And all from all cannot become, because</l>
<l>In each resides a secret power its own.</l>
<l>Again, why see we lavished o'er the lands</l>
<l>At spring the rose, at summer heat the corn,</l>
<l>The vines that mellow when the autumn lures,</l>
<l>If not because the fixed seeds of things</l>
<l>At their own season must together stream,</l>
<l>And new creations only be revealed</l>
<l>When the due times arrive and pregnant earth</l>
<l>Safely may give unto the shores of light</l>
<l>Her tender progenies? But if from naught</l>
<l>Were their becoming, they would spring abroad</l>
<l>Suddenly, unforeseen, in alien months,</l>
<l>With no primordial germs, to be preserved</l>
<l>From procreant unions at an adverse hour.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="185"/>
<l>Nor on the mingling of the living seeds</l>
<l>Would space be needed for the growth of things</l>
<l>Were life an increment of nothing: then</l>
<l>The tiny babe forthwith would walk a man,</l>
<l>And from the turf would leap a branching tree-</l>
<l>Wonders unheard of; for, by Nature, each</l>
<l>Slowly increases from its lawful seed,</l>
<l>And through that increase shall conserve its kind.</l>
<l>Whence take the proof that things enlarge and feed</l>
<l>From out their proper matter. Thus it comes</l>
<l>That earth, without her seasons of fixed rains,</l>
<l>Could bear no produce such as makes us glad,</l>
<l>And whatsoever lives, if shut from food,</l>
<l>Prolongs its kind and guards its life no more.</l>
<l>Thus easier 'tis to hold that many things</l>
<l>Have primal bodies in common (as we see</l>
<l>The single letters common to many words)</l>
<l>Than aught exists without its origins.</l>
<l>Moreover, why should Nature not prepare</l>
<l>Men of a bulk to ford the seas afoot,</l>
<l>Or rend the mighty mountains with their hands,</l>
<l>Or conquer Time with length of days, if not</l>
<l>Because for all begotten things abides</l>
<l>The changeless stuff, and what from that may spring</l>
<l>Is fixed forevermore? Lastly we see</l>
<l>How far the tilled surpass the fields untilled</l>
<l>And to the labour of our hands return</l>
<l>Their more abounding crops; there are indeed</l>
<l>Within the earth primordial germs of things,</l>
<l>Which, as the ploughshare turns the fruitful clods</l>
<l>And kneads the mould, we quicken into birth.</l>
<l>Else would ye mark, without all toil of ours,</l>
<l>Spontaneous generations, fairer forms.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="205"/>
<l>Confess then, naught from nothing can become,</l>
<l>Since all must have their seeds, wherefrom to grow,</l>
<l>Wherefrom to reach the gentle fields of air.</l>
<l>Hence too it comes that Nature all dissolves</l>
<l>Into their primal bodies again, and naught</l>
<l>Perishes ever to annihilation.</l>
<l>For, were aught mortal in its every part,</l>
<l>Before our eyes it might be snatched away</l>
<l>Unto destruction; since no force were needed</l>
<l>To sunder its members and undo its bands.</l>
<l>Whereas, of truth, because all things exist,</l>
<l>With seed imperishable, Nature allows</l>
<l>Destruction nor collapse of aught, until</l>
<l>Some outward force may shatter by a blow,</l>
<l>Or inward craft, entering its hollow cells,</l>
<l>Dissolve it down. And more than this, if Time,</l>
<l>That wastes with eld the works along the world,</l>
<l>Destroy entire, consuming matter all,</l>
<l>Whence then may <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> back to light of life</l>
<l>Restore the generations kind by kind?</l>
<l>Or how, when thus restored, may daedal Earth</l>
<l>Foster and plenish with her ancient food,</l>
<l>Which, kind by kind, she offers unto each?</l>
<l>Whence may the water-springs, beneath the sea,</l>
<l>Or inland rivers, far and wide away,</l>
<l>Keep the unfathomable ocean full?</l>
<l>And out of what does Ether feed the stars?</l>
<l>For lapsed years and infinite age must else</l>
<l>Have eat all shapes of mortal stock away:</l>
<l>But be it the Long Ago contained those germs,</l>
<l>By which this sum of things recruited lives,</l>
<l>Those same infallibly can never die,</l>
<l>Nor nothing to nothing evermore return.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="238"/>
<l>And, too, the selfsame power might end alike</l>
<l>All things, were they not still together held</l>
<l>By matter eternal, shackled through its parts,</l>
<l>Now more, now less. A touch might be enough</l>
<l>To cause destruction. For the slightest force</l>
<l>Would loose the weft of things wherein no part</l>
<l>Were of imperishable stock. But now</l>
<l>Because the fastenings of primordial parts</l>
<l>Are put together diversely and stuff</l>
<l>Is everlasting, things abide the same</l>
<l>Unhurt and sure, until some power comes on</l>
<l>Strong to destroy the warp and woof of each:</l>
<l>Nothing returns to naught; but all return</l>
<l>At their collapse to primal forms of stuff.</l>
<l>Lo, the rains perish which Ether-father throws</l>
<l>Down to the bosom of Earth-mother; but then</l>
<l>Upsprings the shining grain, and boughs are green</l>
<l>Amid the trees, and trees themselves wax big</l>
<l>And lade themselves with fruits; and hence in turn</l>
<l>The race of man and all the wild are fed;</l>
<l>Hence joyful cities thrive with boys and girls;</l>
<l>And leafy woodlands echo with new birds;</l>
<l>Hence cattle, fat and drowsy, lay their bulk</l>
<l>Along the joyous pastures whilst the drops</l>
<l>Of white ooze trickle from distended bags;</l>
<l>Hence the young scamper on their weakling joints</l>
<l>Along the tender herbs, fresh hearts afrisk</l>
<l>With warm new milk. Thus naught of what so seems</l>
<l>Perishes utterly, since Nature ever</l>
<l>Upbuilds one thing from other, suffering naught</l>
<l>To come to birth but through some other's death.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>And now, since I have taught that things cannot</l>
<l>Be born from nothing, nor the same, when born,</l>
<l>To nothing be recalled, doubt not my words,</l>
<l>Because our eyes no primal germs perceive;</l>
<l>For mark those bodies which, though known to be</l>
<l>In this our world, are yet invisible:</l>
<l>The winds infuriate lash our face and frame,</l>
<l>Unseen, and swamp huge ships and rend the clouds,</l>
<l>Or, eddying wildly down, bestrew the plains</l>
<l>With mighty trees, or scour the mountain tops</l>
<l>With forest-crackling blasts. Thus on they rave</l>
<l>With uproar shrill and ominous moan. The winds,</l>
<l>'Tis clear, are sightless bodies sweeping through</l>
<l>The sea, the lands, the clouds along the sky,</l>
<l>Vexing and whirling and seizing all amain;</l>
<l>And forth they flow and pile destruction round,</l>
<l>Even as the water's soft and supple bulk</l>
<l>Becoming a river of abounding floods,</l>
<l>Which a wide downpour from the lofty hills</l>
<l>Swells with big showers, dashes headlong down</l>
<l>Fragments of woodland and whole branching trees;</l>
<l>Nor can the solid bridges bide the shock</l>
<l>As on the waters whelm: the turbulent stream,</l>
<l>Strong with a hundred rains, beats round the piers,</l>
<l>Crashes with havoc, and rolls beneath its waves</l>
<l>Down-toppled masonry and ponderous stone,</l>
<l>Hurling away whatever would oppose.</l>
<l>Even so must move the blasts of all the winds,</l>
<l>Which, when they spread, like to a mighty flood,</l>
<l>Hither or thither, drive things on before</l>
<l>And hurl to ground with still renewed assault,</l>
<l>Or sometimes in their circling vortex seize</l>
<l>And bear in cones of whirlwind down the world:</l>
<l>The winds are sightless bodies and naught else-</l>
<l>Since both in works and ways they rival well</l>
<l>The mighty rivers, the visible in form.</l>
<l>Then too we know the varied smells of things</l>
<l>Yet never to our nostrils see them come;</l>
<l>With eyes we view not burning heats, nor cold,</l>
<l>Nor are we wont men's voices to behold.</l>
<l>Yet these must be corporeal at the base,</l>
<l>Since thus they smite the senses: naught there is</l>
<l>Save body, having property of touch.</l>
<l>And raiment, hung by surf-beat shore, grows moist,</l>
<l>The same, spread out before the sun, will dry;</l>
<l>Yet no one saw how sank the moisture in,</l>
<l>Nor how by heat off-driven. Thus we know,</l>
<l>That moisture is dispersed about in bits</l>
<l>Too small for eyes to see. Another case:</l>
<l>A ring upon the finger thins away</l>
<l>Along the under side, with years and suns;</l>
<l>The drippings from the eaves will scoop the stone;</l>
<l>The hooked ploughshare, though of iron, wastes</l>
<l>Amid the fields insidiously. We view</l>
<l>The rock-paved highways worn by many feet;</l>
<l>And at the gates the brazen statues show</l>
<l>Their right hands leaner from the frequent touch</l>
<l>Of wayfarers innumerable who greet.</l>
<l>We see how wearing-down hath minished these,</l>
<l>But just what motes depart at any time,</l>
<l>The envious nature of vision bars our sight.</l>
<l>Lastly whatever days and nature add</l>
<l>Little by little, constraining things to grow</l>
<l>In due proportion, no gaze however keen</l>
<l>Of these our eyes hath watched and known. No more</l>
<l>Can we observe what's lost at any time,</l>
<l>When things wax old with eld and foul decay,</l>
<l>Or when salt seas eat under beetling crags.</l>
<l>Thus Nature ever by unseen bodies works.</l>
 
<milestone unit="card" n="329"/>
<p>THE VOID</p>

<l>But yet creation's neither crammed nor blocked</l>
<l>About by body: there's in things a void-</l>
<l>Which to have known will serve thee many a turn,</l>
<l>Nor will not leave thee wandering in doubt,</l>
<l>Forever searching in the sum of all,</l>
<l>And losing faith in these pronouncements mine.</l>
<l>There's place intangible, a void and room.</l>
<l>For were it not, things could in nowise move;</l>
<l>Since body's property to block and check</l>
<l>Would work on all and at an times the same.</l>
<l>Thus naught could evermore push forth and go,</l>
<l>Since naught elsewhere would yield a starting place.</l>
<l>But now through oceans, lands, and heights of heaven,</l>
<l>By divers causes and in divers modes,</l>
<l>Before our eyes we mark how much may move,</l>
<l>Which, finding not a void, would fail deprived</l>
<l>Of stir and motion; nay, would then have been</l>
<l>Nowise begot at all, since matter, then,</l>
<l>Had staid at rest, its parts together crammed.</l>
<l>Then too, however solid objects seem,</l>
<l>They yet are formed of matter mixed with void:</l>
<l>In rocks and caves the watery moisture seeps,</l>
<l>And beady drops stand out like plenteous tears;</l>
<l>And food finds way through every frame that lives;</l>
<l>The trees increase and yield the season's fruit</l>
<l>Because their food throughout the whole is poured,</l>
<l>Even from the deepest roots, through trunks and boughs;</l>
<l>And voices pass the solid walls and fly</l>
<l>Reverberant through shut doorways of a house;</l>
<l>And stiffening frost seeps inward to our bones.</l>
<l>Which but for voids for bodies to go through</l>
<l>'Tis clear could happen in nowise at all.</l>
<l>Again, why see we among objects some</l>
<l>Of heavier weight, but of no bulkier size?</l>
<l>Indeed, if in a ball of wool there be</l>
<l>As much of body as in lump of lead,</l>
<l>The two should weigh alike, since body tends</l>
<l>To load things downward, while the void abides,</l>
<l>By contrary nature, the imponderable.</l>
<l>Therefore, an object just as large but lighter</l>
<l>Declares infallibly its more of void;</l>
<l>Even as the heavier more of matter shows,</l>
<l>And how much less of vacant room inside.</l>
<l>That which we're seeking with sagacious quest</l>
<l>Exists, infallibly, commixed with things-</l>
<l>The void, the invisible inane.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="370" />
<l rend="indent">Right here</l>
<l>I am compelled a question to expound,</l>
<l>Forestalling something certain folk suppose,</l>
<l>Lest it avail to lead thee off from truth:</l>
<l>Waters (they say) before the shining breed</l>
<l>Of the swift scaly creatures somehow give,</l>
<l>And straightway open sudden liquid paths,</l>
<l>Because the fishes leave behind them room</l>
<l>To which at once the yielding billows stream.</l>
<l>Thus things among themselves can yet be moved,</l>
<l>And change their place, however full the Sum-</l>
<l>Received opinion, wholly false forsooth.</l>
<l>For where can scaly creatures forward dart,</l>
<l>Save where the waters give them room? Again,</l>
<l>Where can the billows yield a way, so long</l>
<l>As ever the fish are powerless to go?</l>
<l>Thus either all bodies of motion are deprived,</l>
<l>Or things contain admixture of a void</l>
<l>Where each thing gets its start in moving on.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Lastly, where after impact two broad bodies</l>
<l>Suddenly spring apart, the air must crowd</l>
<l>The whole new void between those bodies formed;</l>
<l>But air, however it stream with hastening gusts,</l>
<l>Can yet not fill the gap at once- for first</l>
<l>It makes for one place, ere diffused through all.</l>
<l>And then, if haply any think this comes,</l>
<l>When bodies spring apart, because the air</l>
<l>Somehow condenses, wander they from truth:</l>
<l>For then a void is formed, where none before;</l>
<l>And, too, a void is filled which was before.</l>
<l>Nor can air be condensed in such a wise;</l>
<l>Nor, granting it could, without a void, I hold,</l>
<l>It still could not contract upon itself</l>
<l>And draw its parts together into one.</l>
<l>Wherefore, despite demur and counter-speech,</l>
<l>Confess thou must there is a void in things.</l>
<l rend="indent">  And still I might by many an argument</l>
<l>Here scrape together credence for my words.</l>
<l>But for the keen eye these mere footprints serve,</l>
<l>Whereby thou mayest know the rest thyself.</l>
<l>As dogs full oft with noses on the ground,</l>
<l>Find out the silent lairs, though hid in brush,</l>
<l>Of beasts, the mountain-rangers, when but once</l>
<l>They scent the certain footsteps of the way,</l>
<l>Thus thou thyself in themes like these alone</l>
<l>Can hunt from thought to thought, and keenly wind</l>
<l>Along even onward to the secret places</l>
<l>And drag out truth. But, if thou loiter loth</l>
<l>Or veer, however little, from the point,</l>
<l>This I can promise, Memmius, for a fact:</l>
<l>Such copious drafts my singing tongue shall pour</l>
<l>From the large well-springs of my plenished breast</l>
<l>That much I dread slow age will steal and coil</l>
<l>Along our members, and unloose the gates</l>
<l>Of life within us, ere for thee my verse</l>
<l>Hath put within thine ears the stores of proofs</l>
<l>At hand for one soever question broached.</l>

<milestone unit="card" n="418"/>
<p>NOTHING EXISTS per se EXCEPT ATOMS AND THE VOID</p>

<l>But, now again to weave the tale begun,</l>
<l>All nature, then, as self-sustained, consists</l>
<l>Of twain of things: of bodies and of void</l>
<l>In which they're set, and where they're moved around.</l>
<l>For common instinct of our race declares</l>
<l>That body of itself exists: unless</l>
<l>This primal faith, deep-founded, fail us not,</l>
<l>Naught will there be whereunto to appeal</l>
<l>On things occult when seeking aught to prove</l>
<l>By reasonings of mind. Again, without</l>
<l>That place and room, which we do call the inane,</l>
<l>Nowhere could bodies then be set, nor go</l>
<l>Hither or thither at all- as shown before.</l>
<l>Besides, there's naught of which thou canst declare</l>
<l>It lives disjoined from body, shut from void-</l>
<l>A kind of third in nature. For whatever</l>
<l>Exists must be a somewhat; and the same,</l>
<l>If tangible, however fight and slight,</l>
<l>Will yet increase the count of body's sum,</l>
<l>With its own augmentation big or small;</l>
<l>But, if intangible and powerless ever</l>
<l>To keep a thing from passing through itself</l>
<l>On any side, 'twill be naught else but that</l>
<l>Which we do call the empty, the inane.</l>
<l>Again, whate'er exists, as of itself,</l>
<l>Must either act or suffer action on it,</l>
<l>Or else be that wherein things move and be:</l>
<l>Naught, saving body, acts, is acted on;</l>
<l>Naught but the inane can furnish room. And thus,</l>
<l>Beside the inane and bodies, is no third</l>
<l>Nature amid the number of all things-</l>
<l>Remainder none to fall at any time</l>
<l>Under our senses, nor be seized and seen</l>
<l>By any man through reasonings of mind.</l>
<l>Name o'er creation with what names thou wilt,</l>
<l>Thou'lt find but properties of those first twain,</l>
<l>Or see but accidents those twain produce.</l>
<l rend="indent">  A property is that which not at all</l>
<l>Can be disjoined and severed from a thing</l>
<l>Without a fatal dissolution: such,</l>
<l>Weight to the rocks, heat to the fire, and flow</l>
<l>To the wide waters, touch to corporal things,</l>
<l>Intangibility to the viewless void.</l>
<l>But state of slavery, pauperhood, and wealth,</l>
<l>Freedom, and war, and concord, and all else</l>
<l>Which come and go whilst nature stands the same,</l>
<l>We're wont, and rightly, to call accidents.</l>
<l>Even time exists not of itself; but sense</l>
<l>Reads out of things what happened long ago,</l>
<l>What presses now, and what shall follow after:</l>
<l>No man, we must admit, feels time itself,</l>
<l>Disjoined from motion and repose of things.</l>
<l>Thus, when they say there "is" the ravishment</l>
<l>Of Princess Helen, "is" the siege and sack</l>
<l>Of Trojan Town, look out, they force us not</l>
<l>To admit these acts existent by themselves,</l>
<l>Merely because those races of mankind</l>
<l>(Of whom these acts were accidents) long since</l>
<l>Irrevocable age has borne away:</l>
<l>For all past actions may be said to be</l>
<l>But accidents, in one way, of mankind,-</l>
<l>In other, of some region of the world.</l>
<l>Add, too, had been no matter, and no room</l>
<l>Wherein all things go on, the fire of love</l>
<l>Upblown by that fair form, the glowing coal</l>
<l>Under the Phrygian Alexander's breast,</l>
<l>Had ne'er enkindled that renowned strife</l>
<l>Of savage war, nor had the wooden horse</l>
<l>Involved in flames old Pergama, by a birth</l>
<l>At midnight of a brood of the Hellenes.</l>
<l>And thus thou canst remark that every act</l>
<l>At bottom exists not of itself, nor is</l>
<l>As body is, nor has like name with void;</l>
<l>But rather of sort more fitly to be called</l>
<l>An accident of body, and of place</l>
<l>Wherein all things go on.</l>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE ATOMS</p>

<l rend="indent">                        Bodies, again,</l>
<l>Are partly primal germs of things, and partly</l>
<l>Unions deriving from the primal germs.</l>
<l>And those which are the primal germs of things</l>
<l>No power can quench; for in the end they conquer</l>
<l>By their own solidness; though hard it be</l>
<l>To think that aught in things has solid frame;</l>
<l>For lightnings pass, no less than voice and shout,</l>
<l>Through hedging walls of houses, and the iron</l>
<l>White-dazzles in the fire, and rocks will burn</l>
<l>With exhalations fierce and burst asunder.</l>
<l>Totters the rigid gold dissolved in heat;</l>
<l>The ice of bronze melts conquered in the flame;</l>
<l>Warmth and the piercing cold through silver seep,</l>
<l>Since, with the cups held rightly in the hand,</l>
<l>We oft feel both, as from above is poured</l>
<l>The dew of waters between their shining sides:</l>
<l>So true it is no solid form is found.</l>
<l>But yet because true reason and nature of things</l>
<l>Constrain us, come, whilst in few verses now</l>
<l>I disentangle how there still exist</l>
<l>Bodies of solid, everlasting frame-</l>
<l>The seeds of things, the primal germs we teach,</l>
<l>Whence all creation around us came to be.</l>
<l>First since we know a twofold nature exists,</l>
<l>Of things, both twain and utterly unlike-</l>
<l>Body, and place in which an things go on-</l>
<l>Then each must be both for and through itself,</l>
<l>And all unmixed: where'er be empty space,</l>
<l>There body's not; and so where body bides,</l>
<l>There not at all exists the void inane.</l>
<l>Thus primal bodies are solid, without a void.</l>
<l>But since there's void in all begotten things,</l>
<l>All solid matter must be round the same;</l>
<l>Nor, by true reason canst thou prove aught hides</l>
<l>And holds a void within its body, unless</l>
<l>Thou grant what holds it be a solid. Know,</l>
<l>That which can hold a void of things within</l>
<l>Can be naught else than matter in union knit.</l>
<l>Thus matter, consisting of a solid frame,</l>
<l>Hath power to be eternal, though all else,</l>
<l>Though all creation, be dissolved away.</l>
<l>Again, were naught of empty and inane,</l>
<l>The world were then a solid; as, without</l>
<l>Some certain bodies to fill the places held,</l>
<l>The world that is were but a vacant void.</l>
<l>And so, infallibly, alternate-wise</l>
<l>Body and void are still distinguished,</l>
<l>Since nature knows no wholly full nor void.</l>
<l>There are, then, certain bodies, possessed of power</l>
<l>To vary forever the empty and the full;</l>
<l>And these can nor be sundered from without</l>
<l>By beats and blows, nor from within be torn</l>
<l>By penetration, nor be overthrown</l>
<l>By any assault soever through the world-</l>
<l>For without void, naught can be crushed, it seems,</l>
<l>Nor broken, nor severed by a cut in twain,</l>
<l>Nor can it take the damp, or seeping cold</l>
<l>Or piercing fire, those old destroyers three;</l>
<l>But the more void within a thing, the more</l>
<l>Entirely it totters at their sure assault.</l>
<l>Thus if first bodies be, as I have taught,</l>
<l>Solid, without a void, they must be then</l>
<l>Eternal; and, if matter ne'er had been</l>
<l>Eternal, long ere now had all things gone</l>
<l>Back into nothing utterly, and all</l>
<l>We see around from nothing had been born-</l>
<l>But since I taught above that naught can be</l>
<l>From naught created, nor the once begotten</l>
<l>To naught be summoned back, these primal germs</l>
<l>Must have an immortality of frame.</l>
<l>And into these must each thing be resolved,</l>
<l>When comes its supreme hour, that thus there be</l>
<l>At hand the stuff for plenishing the world.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>So primal germs have solid singleness</l>
<l>Nor otherwise could they have been conserved</l>
<l>Through aeons and infinity of time</l>
<l>For the replenishment of wasted worlds.</l>
<l>Once more, if nature had given a scope for things</l>
<l>To be forever broken more and more,</l>
<l>By now the bodies of matter would have been</l>
<l>So far reduced by breakings in old days</l>
<l>That from them nothing could, at season fixed,</l>
<l>Be born, and arrive its prime and top of life.</l>
<l>For, lo, each thing is quicker marred than made;</l>
<l>And so whate'er the long infinitude</l>
<l>Of days and all fore-passed time would now</l>
<l>By this have broken and ruined and dissolved,</l>
<l>That same could ne'er in all remaining time</l>
<l>Be builded up for plenishing the world.</l>
<l>But mark: infallibly a fixed bound</l>
<l>Remaineth stablished 'gainst their breaking down;</l>
<l>Since we behold each thing soever renewed,</l>
<l>And unto all, their seasons, after their kind,</l>
<l>Wherein they arrive the flower of their age.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="551" />
<l rend="indent">    Again, if bounds have not been set against</l>
<l>The breaking down of this corporeal world,</l>
<l>Yet must all bodies of whatever things</l>
<l>Have still endured from everlasting time</l>
<l>Unto this present, as not yet assailed</l>
<l>By shocks of peril. But because the same</l>
<l>Are, to thy thinking, of a nature frail,</l>
<l>It ill accords that thus they could remain</l>
<l>(As thus they do) through everlasting time,</l>
<l>Vexed through the ages (as indeed they are)</l>
<l>By the innumerable blows of chance.</l>
<l rend="indent">  So in our programme of creation, mark</l>
<l>How 'tis that, though the bodies of all stuff</l>
<l>Are solid to the core, we yet explain</l>
<l>The ways whereby some things are fashioned soft-</l>
<l>Air, water, earth, and fiery exhalations-</l>
<l>And by what force they function and go on:</l>
<l>The fact is founded in the void of things.</l>
<l>But if the primal germs themselves be soft,</l>
<l>Reason cannot be brought to bear to show</l>
<l>The ways whereby may be created these</l>
<l>Great crags of basalt and the during iron;</l>
<l>For their whole nature will profoundly lack</l>
<l>The first foundations of a solid frame.</l>
<l>But powerful in old simplicity,</l>
<l>Abide the solid, the primeval germs;</l>
<l>And by their combinations more condensed,</l>
<l>All objects can be tightly knit and bound</l>
<l>And made to show unconquerable strength.</l>
<l>Again, since all things kind by kind obtain</l>
<l>Fixed bounds of growing and conserving life;</l>
<l>Since Nature hath inviolably decreed</l>
<l>What each can do, what each can never do;</l>
<l>Since naught is changed, but all things so abide</l>
<l>That ever the variegated birds reveal</l>
<l>The spots or stripes peculiar to their kind,</l>
<l>Spring after spring: thus surely all that is</l>
<l>Must be composed of matter immutable.</l>
<l>For if the primal germs in any wise</l>
<l>Were open to conquest and to change, 'twould be</l>
<l>Uncertain also what could come to birth</l>
<l>And what could not, and by what law to each</l>
<l>Its scope prescribed, its boundary stone that clings</l>
<l>So deep in Time. Nor could the generations</l>
<l>Kind after kind so often reproduce</l>
<l>The nature, habits, motions, ways of life,</l>
<l>Of their progenitors.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="599"/>
<l rend="indent">                              And then again,</l>
<l>Since there is ever an extreme bounding point</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>Of that first body which our senses now</l>
<l>Cannot perceive: That bounding point indeed</l>
<l>Exists without all parts, a minimum</l>
<l>Of nature, nor was e'er a thing apart,</l>
<l>As of itself,- nor shall hereafter be,</l>
<l>Since 'tis itself still parcel of another,</l>
<l>A first and single part, whence other parts</l>
<l>And others similar in order lie</l>
<l>In a packed phalanx, filling to the full</l>
<l>The nature of first body: being thus</l>
<l>Not self-existent, they must cleave to that</l>
<l>From which in nowise they can sundered be.</l>
<l>So primal germs have solid singleness,</l>
<l>Which tightly packed and closely joined cohere</l>
<l>By virtue of their minim particles-</l>
<l>No compound by mere union of the same;</l>
<l>But strong in their eternal singleness,</l>
<l>Nature, reserving them as seeds for things,</l>
<l>Permitteth naught of rupture or decrease.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Moreover, were there not a minimum,</l>
<l>The smallest bodies would have infinites,</l>
<l>Since then a half-of-half could still be halved,</l>
<l>With limitless division less and less.</l>
<l>Then what the difference 'twixt the sum and least?</l>
<l>None: for however infinite the sum,</l>
<l>Yet even the smallest would consist the same</l>
<l>Of infinite parts. But since true reason here</l>
<l>Protests, denying that the mind can think it,</l>
<l>Convinced thou must confess such things there are</l>
<l>As have no parts, the minimums of nature.</l>
<l>And since these are, likewise confess thou must</l>
<l>That primal bodies are solid and eterne.</l>
<l>Again, if Nature, creatress of all things,</l>
<l>Were wont to force all things to be resolved</l>
<l>Unto least parts, then would she not avail</l>
<l>To reproduce from out them anything;</l>
<l>Because whate'er is not endowed with parts</l>
<l>Cannot possess those properties required</l>
<l>Of generative stuff- divers connections,</l>
<l>Weights, blows, encounters, motions, whereby things</l>
<l>Forevermore have being and go on.</l>

<milestone unit="card" n="635"/>
<p>CONFUTATION OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS</p>

<l rend="indent">  And on such grounds it is that those who held</l>
<l>The stuff of things is fire, and out of fire</l>
<l>Alone the cosmic sum is formed, are seen</l>
<l>Mightily from true reason to have lapsed.</l>
<l>Of whom, chief leader to do battle, comes</l>
<l>That Heraclitus, famous for dark speech</l>
<l>Among the silly, not the serious Greeks</l>
<l>Who search for truth. For dolts are ever prone</l>
<l>That to bewonder and adore which hides</l>
<l>Beneath distorted words, holding that true</l>
<l>Which sweetly tickles in their stupid ears,</l>
<l>Or which is rouged in finely finished phrase.</l>
<l>For how, I ask, can things so varied be,</l>
<l>If formed of fire, single and pure? No whit</l>
<l>'Twould help for fire to be condensed or thinned,</l>
<l>If all the parts of fire did still preserve</l>
<l>But fire's own nature, seen before in gross.</l>
<l>The heat were keener with the parts compressed,</l>
<l>Milder, again, when severed or dispersed-</l>
<l>And more than this thou canst conceive of naught</l>
<l>That from such causes could become; much less</l>
<l>Might earth's variety of things be born</l>
<l>From any fires soever, dense or rare.</l>
<l>This too: if they suppose a void in things,</l>
<l>Then fires can be condensed and still left rare;</l>
<l>But since they see such opposites of thought</l>
<l>Rising against them, and are loath to leave</l>
<l>An unmixed void in things, they fear the steep</l>
<l>And lose the road of truth. Nor do they see,</l>
<l>That, if from things we take away the void,</l>
<l>All things are then condensed, and out of all</l>
<l>One body made, which has no power to dart</l>
<l>Swiftly from out itself not anything-</l>
<l>As throws the fire its light and warmth around,</l>
<l>Giving thee proof its parts are not compact.</l>
<l>But if perhaps they think, in other wise,</l>
<l>Fires through their combinations can be quenched</l>
<l>And change their substance, very well: behold,</l>
<l>If fire shall spare to do so in no part,</l>
<l>Then heat will perish utterly and all,</l>
<l>And out of nothing would the world be formed.</l>
<l>For change in anything from out its bounds</l>
<l>Means instant death of that which was before;</l>
<l>And thus a somewhat must persist unharmed</l>
<l>Amid the world, lest all return to naught,</l>
<l>And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew.</l>
<l>Now since indeed there are those surest bodies</l>
<l>Which keep their nature evermore the same,</l>
<l>Upon whose going out and coming in</l>
<l>And changed order things their nature change,</l>
<l>And all corporeal substances transformed,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know those primal bodies, then,</l>
<l>Are not of fire. For 'twere of no avail</l>
<l>Should some depart and go away, and some</l>
<l>Be added new, and some be changed in order,</l>
<l>If still all kept their nature of old heat:</l>
<l>For whatsoever they created then</l>
<l>Would still in any case be only fire.</l>
<l>The truth, I fancy, this: bodies there are</l>
<l>Whose clashings, motions, order, posture, shapes</l>
<l>Produce the fire and which, by order changed,</l>
<l>Do change the nature of the thing produced,</l>
<l>And are thereafter nothing like to fire</l>
<l>Nor whatso else has power to send its bodies</l>
<l>With impact touching on the senses' touch.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Again, to say that all things are but fire</l>
<l>And no true thing in number of all things</l>
<l>Exists but fire, as this same fellow says,</l>
<l>Seems crazed folly. For the man himself</l>
<l>Against the senses by the senses fights,</l>
<l>And hews at that through which is all belief,</l>
<l>Through which indeed unto himself is known</l>
<l>The thing he calls the fire. For, though he thinks</l>
<l>The senses truly can perceive the fire,</l>
<l>He thinks they cannot as regards all else,</l>
<l>Which still are palpably as clear to sense-</l>
<l>To me a thought inept and crazy too.</l>
<l>For whither shall we make appeal? for what</l>
<l>More certain than our senses can there be</l>
<l>Whereby to mark asunder error and truth?</l>
<l>Besides, why rather do away with all,</l>
<l>And wish to allow heat only, then deny</l>
<l>The fire and still allow all else to be?-</l>
<l>Alike the madness either way it seems.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="705"/>
<l>Thus whosoe'er have held the stuff of things</l>
<l>To be but fire, and out of fire the sum,</l>
<l>And whosoever have constituted air</l>
<l>As first beginning of begotten things,</l>
<l>And all whoever have held that of itself</l>
<l>Water alone contrives things, or that earth</l>
<l>Createth all and changes things anew</l>
<l>To divers natures, mightily they seem</l>
<l>A long way to have wandered from the truth.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Add, too, whoever make the primal stuff</l>
<l>Twofold, by joining air to fire, and earth</l>
<l>To water; add who deem that things can grow</l>

<l>Its lightnings' flash. And though for much she seem</l>
<l>The mighty and the wondrous isle to men,</l>
<l>Most rich in all good things, and fortified</l>
<l>With generous strength of heroes, she hath ne'er</l>
<l>Possessed within her aught of more renown,</l>
<l>Nor aught more holy, wonderful, and dear</l>
<l>Than this true man. Nay, ever so far and pure</l>
<l>The lofty music of his breast divine</l>
<l>Lifts up its voice and tells of glories found,</l>
<l>That scarce he seems of human stock create.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Yet he and those forementioned (known to be</l>
<l>So far beneath him, less than he in all),</l>
<l>Though, as discoverers of much goodly truth,</l>
<l>They gave, as 'twere from out of the heart's own shrine,</l>
<l>Responses holier and soundlier based</l>
<l>Than ever the Pythia pronounced for men</l>
<l>From out the triped and the Delphian laurel,</l>
<l>Have still in matter of first-elements</l>
<l>Made ruin of themselves, and, great men, great</l>
<l>Indeed and heavy there for them the fall:</l>
<l>First, because, banishing the void from things,</l>
<l>They yet assign them motion, and allow</l>
<l>Things soft and loosely textured to exist,</l>
<l>As air, dew, fire, earth, animals, and grains,</l>
<l>Without admixture of void amid their frame.</l>
<l>Next, because, thinking there can be no end</l>
<l>In cutting bodies down to less and less</l>
<l>Nor pause established to their breaking up,</l>
<l>They hold there is no minimum in things;</l>
<l>Albeit we see the boundary point of aught</l>
<l>Is that which to our senses seems its least,</l>
<l>Whereby thou mayst conjecture, that, because</l>
<l>The things thou canst not mark have boundary points,</l>
<l>They surely have their minimums. Then, too,</l>
<l>Since these philosophers ascribe to things</l>
<l>Soft primal germs, which we behold to be</l>
<l>Of birth and body mortal, thus, throughout,</l>
<l>The sum of things must be returned to naught,</l>
<l>And, born from naught, abundance thrive anew-</l>
<l>Thou seest how far each doctrine stands from truth.</l>
<l>And, next, these bodies are among themselves</l>
<l>In many ways poisons and foes to each,</l>
<l>Wherefore their congress will destroy them quite</l>
<l>Or drive asunder as we see in storms</l>
<l>Rains, winds, and lightnings all asunder fly.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="763"/>
<l rend="indent">  Thus too, if all things are create of four,</l>
<l>And all again dissolved into the four,</l>
<l>How can the four be called the primal germs</l>
<l>Of things, more than all things themselves be thought,</l>
<l>By retroversion, primal germs of them?</l>
<l>For ever alternately are both begot,</l>
<l>With interchange of nature and aspect</l>
<l>From immemorial time. But if percase</l>
<l>Thou think'st the frame of fire and earth, the air,</l>
<l>The dew of water can in such wise meet</l>
<l>As not by mingling to resign their nature,</l>
<l>From them for thee no world can be create-</l>
<l>No thing of breath, no stock or stalk of tree:</l>
<l>In the wild congress of this varied heap</l>
<l>Each thing its proper nature will display,</l>
<l>And air will palpably be seen mixed up</l>
<l>With earth together, unquenched heat with water.</l>
<l>But primal germs in bringing things to birth</l>
<l>Must have a latent, unseen quality,</l>
<l>Lest some outstanding alien element</l>
<l>Confuse and minish in the thing create</l>
<l>Its proper being.</l>
<l rend="indent">                     But these men begin</l>
<l>From heaven, and from its fires; and first they feign</l>
<l>That fire will turn into the winds of air,</l>
<l>Next, that from air the rain begotten is,</l>
<l>And earth created out of rain, and then</l>
<l>That all, reversely, are returned from earth-</l>
<l>The moisture first, then air thereafter heat-</l>
<l>And that these same ne'er cease in interchange,</l>
<l>To go their ways from heaven to earth, from earth</l>
<l>Unto the stars of the aethereal world-</l>
<l>Which in no wise at all the germs can do.</l>
<l>Since an immutable somewhat still must be,</l>
<l>Lest all things utterly be sped to naught;</l>
<l>For change in anything from out its bounds</l>
<l>Means instant death of that which was before.</l>
<l>Wherefore, since those things, mentioned heretofore,</l>
<l>Suffer a changed state, they must derive</l>
<l>From others ever unconvertible,</l>
<l>Lest an things utterly return to naught.</l>
<l>Then why not rather presuppose there be</l>
<l>Bodies with such a nature furnished forth</l>
<l>That, if perchance they have created fire,</l>
<l>Can still (by virtue of a few withdrawn,</l>
<l>Or added few, and motion and order changed)</l>
<l>Fashion the winds of air, and thus all things</l>
<l>Forevermore be interchanged with all?</l>
<l rend="indent">  "But facts in proof are manifest," thou sayest,</l>
<l>"That all things grow into the winds of air</l>
<l>And forth from earth are nourished, and unless</l>
<l>The season favour at propitious hour</l>
<l>With rains enough to set the trees a-reel</l>
<l>Under the soak of bulking thunderheads,</l>
<l>And sun, for its share, foster and give heat,</l>
<l>No grains, nor trees, nor breathing things can grow."</l>
<l>True- and unless hard food and moisture soft</l>
<l>Recruited man, his frame would waste away,</l>
<l>And life dissolve from out his thews and bones;</l>
<l>For out of doubt recruited and fed are we</l>
<l>By certain things, as other things by others.</l>
<l>Because in many ways the many germs</l>
<l>Common to many things are mixed in things,</l>
<l>No wonder 'tis that therefore divers things</l>
<l>By divers things are nourished. And, again,</l>
<l>Often it matters vastly with what others,</l>
<l>In what positions the primordial germs</l>
<l>Are bound together, and what motions, too,</l>
<l>They give and get among themselves; for these</l>
<l>Same germs do put together sky, sea, lands,</l>
<l>Rivers, and sun, grains, trees, and breathing things,</l>
<l>But yet commixed they are in divers modes</l>
<l>With divers things, forever as they move.</l>
<l>Nay, thou beholdest in our verses here</l>
<l>Elements many, common to many worlds,</l>
<l>Albeit thou must confess each verse, each word</l>
<l>From one another differs both in sense</l>
<l>And ring of sound- so much the elements</l>
<l>Can bring about by change of order alone.</l>
<l>But those which are the primal germs of things</l>
<l>Have power to work more combinations still,</l>
<l>Whence divers things can be produced in turn.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="830"/>
<l rend="indent">  Now let us also take for scrutiny</l>
<l>The homeomeria of Anaxagoras,</l>
<l>So called by Greeks, for which our pauper-speech</l>
<l>Yieldeth no name in the Italian tongue,</l>
<l>Although the thing itself is not o'erhard</l>
<l>For explanation. First, then, when he speaks</l>
<l>Of this homeomeria of things, he thinks</l>
<l>Bones to be sprung from littlest bones minute,</l>
<l>And from minute and littlest flesh all flesh,</l>
<l>And blood created out of drops of blood,</l>
<l>Conceiving gold compact of grains of gold,</l>
<l>And earth concreted out of bits of earth,</l>
<l>Fire made of fires, and water out of waters,</l>
<l>Feigning the like with all the rest of stuff.</l>
<l>Yet he concedes not any void in things,</l>
<l>Nor any limit to cutting bodies down.</l>
<l>Wherefore to me he seems on both accounts</l>
<l>To err no less than those we named before.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="847"/>
<l>Add too: these germs he feigns are far too frail-</l>
<l>If they be germs primordial furnished forth</l>
<l>With but same nature as the things themselves,</l>
<l>And travail and perish equally with those,</l>
<l>And no rein curbs them from annihilation.</l>
<l>For which will last against the grip and crush</l>
<l>Under the teeth of death? the fire? the moist?</l>
<l>Or else the air? which then? the blood? the bones?</l>
<l>No one, methinks, when every thing will be</l>
<l>At bottom as mortal as whate'er we mark</l>
<l>To perish by force before our gazing eyes.</l>
<l>But my appeal is to the proofs above</l>
<l>That things cannot fall back to naught, nor yet</l>
<l>From naught increase. And now again, since food</l>
<l>Augments and nourishes the human frame,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know our veins and blood and bones</l>
<l>And thews are formed of particles unlike</l>
<l>To them in kind; or if they say all foods</l>
<l>Are of mixed substance having in themselves</l>
<l>Small bodies of thews, and bones, and also veins</l>
<l>And particles of blood, then every food,</l>
<l>Solid or liquid, must itself be thought</l>
<l>As made and mixed of things unlike in kind-</l>
<l>Of bones, of thews, of ichor and of blood.</l>
<l>Again, if all the bodies which upgrow</l>
<l>From earth, are first within the earth, then earth</l>
<l>Must be compound of alien substances.</l>
<l>Which spring and bloom abroad from out the earth.</l>
<l>Transfer the argument, and thou may'st use</l>
<l>The selfsame words: if flame and smoke and ash</l>
<l>Still lurk unseen within the wood, the wood</l>
<l>Must be compound of alien substances</l>
<l>Which spring from out the wood.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="875"/>
<l rend="indent">                            Right here remains</l>
<l>A certain slender means to skulk from truth,</l>
<l>Which Anaxagoras takes unto himself,</l>
<l>Who holds that all things lurk commixed with all</l>
<l>While that one only comes to view, of which</l>
<l>The bodies exceed in number all the rest,</l>
<l>And lie more close to hand and at the fore-</l>
<l>A notion banished from true reason far.</l>
<l>For then 'twere meet that kernels of the grains</l>
<l>Should oft, when crunched between the might of stones,</l>
<l>Give forth a sign of blood, or of aught else</l>
<l>Which in our human frame is fed; and that</l>
<l>Rock rubbed on rock should yield a gory ooze.</l>
<l>Likewise the herbs ought oft to give forth drops</l>
<l>Of sweet milk, flavoured like the uddered sheep's;</l>
<l>Indeed we ought to find, when crumbling up</l>
<l>The earthy clods, there herbs, and grains, and leaves,</l>
<l>All sorts dispersed minutely in the soil;</l>
<l>Lastly we ought to find in cloven wood</l>
<l>Ashes and smoke and bits of fire there hid.</l>
<l>But since fact teaches this is not the case,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know things are not mixed with things</l>
<l>Thuswise; but seeds, common to many things,</l>
<l>Commixed in many ways, must lurk in things.</l>
<l rend="indent">  "But often it happens on skiey hills" thou sayest,</l>
<l>"That neighbouring tops of lofty trees are rubbed</l>
<l>One against other, smote by the blustering south,</l>
<l>Till all ablaze with bursting flower of flame."</l>
<l>Good sooth- yet fire is not ingraft in wood,</l>
<l>But many are the seeds of heat, and when</l>
<l>Rubbing together they together flow,</l>
<l>They start the conflagrations in the forests.</l>
<l>Whereas if flame, already fashioned, lay</l>
<l>Stored up within the forests, then the fires</l>
<l>Could not for any time be kept unseen,</l>
<l>But would be laying all the wildwood waste</l>
<l>And burning all the boscage. Now dost see</l>
<l>(Even as we said a little space above)</l>
<l>How mightily it matters with what others,</l>
<l>In what positions these same primal germs</l>
<l>Are bound together? And what motions, too,</l>
<l>They give and get among themselves? how, hence,</l>
<l>The same, if altered 'mongst themselves, can body</l>
<l>Both igneous and ligneous objects forth-</l>
<l>Precisely as these words themselves are made</l>
<l>By somewhat altering their elements,</l>
<l>Although we mark with name indeed distinct</l>
<l>The igneous from the ligneous. Once again,</l>
<l>If thou suppose whatever thou beholdest,</l>
<l>Among all visible objects, cannot be,</l>
<l>Unless thou feign bodies of matter endowed</l>
<l>With a like nature,- by thy vain device</l>
<l>For thee will perish all the germs of things:</l>
<l>'Twill come to pass they'll laugh aloud, like men,</l>
<l>Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,</l>
<l>Or moisten with salty tear-drops cheeks and chins.</l>

<p>THE INFINITY OF THE UNIVERSE</p>

<l rend="indent">  Now learn of what remains! More keenly hear!</l>
<l>And for myself, my mind is not deceived</l>
<l>How dark it is: But the large hope of praise</l>
<l>Hath strook with pointed thyrsus through my heart;</l>
<l>On the same hour hath strook into my breast</l>
<l>Sweet love of the Muses, wherewith now instinct,</l>
<l>I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,</l>
<l>Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,</l>
<l>Trodden by step of none before. I joy</l>
<l>To come on undefiled fountains there,</l>
<l>To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,</l>
<l>To seek for this my head a signal crown</l>
<l>From regions where the Muses never yet</l>
<l>Have garlanded the temples of a man:</l>
<l>First, since I teach concerning mighty things,</l>
<l>And go right on to loose from round the mind</l>
<l>The tightened coils of dread religion;</l>
<l>Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame</l>
<l>Songs so pellucid, touching all throughout</l>
<l>Even with the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem,</l>
<l>Is not without a reasonable ground:</l>
<l>But as physicians, when they seek to give</l>
<l>Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch</l>
<l>The brim around the cup with the sweet juice</l>
<l>And yellow of the honey, in order that</l>
<l>The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled</l>
<l>As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down</l>
<l>The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,</l>
<l>Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus</l>
<l>Grow strong again with recreated health:</l>
<l>So now I too (since this my doctrine seems</l>
<l>In general somewhat woeful unto those</l>
<l>Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd</l>
<l>Starts back from it in horror) have desired</l>
<l>To expound our doctrine unto thee in song</l>
<l>Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,</l>
<l>To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse-</l>
<l>If by such method haply I might hold</l>
<l>The mind of thee upon these lines of ours,</l>
<l>Till thou see through the nature of all things,</l>
<l>And how exists the interwoven frame.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="951"/>
<l rend="indent">  But since I've taught that bodies of matter, made</l>
<l>Completely solid, hither and thither fly</l>
<l>Forevermore unconquered through all time,</l>
<l>Now come, and whether to the sum of them</l>
<l>There be a limit or be none, for thee</l>
<l>Let us unfold; likewise what has been found</l>
<l>To be the wide inane, or room, or space</l>
<l>Wherein all things soever do go on,</l>
<l>Let us examine if it finite be</l>
<l>All and entire, or reach unmeasured round</l>
<l>And downward an illimitable profound.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Thus, then, the All that is is limited</l>
<l>In no one region of its onward paths,</l>
<l>For then 'tmust have forever its beyond.</l>
<l>And a beyond 'tis seen can never be</l>
<l>For aught, unless still further on there be</l>
<l>A somewhat somewhere that may bound the same-</l>
<l>So that the thing be seen still on to where</l>
<l>The nature of sensation of that thing</l>
<l>Can follow it no longer. Now because</l>
<l>Confess we must there's naught beside the sum,</l>
<l>There's no beyond, and so it lacks all end.</l>
<l>It matters nothing where thou post thyself,</l>
<l>In whatsoever regions of the same;</l>
<l>Even any place a man has set him down</l>
<l>Still leaves about him the unbounded all</l>
<l>Outward in all directions; or, supposing</l>
<l>A moment the all of space finite to be,</l>
<l>If some one farthest traveller runs forth</l>
<l>Unto the extreme coasts and throws ahead</l>
<l>A flying spear, is't then thy wish to think</l>
<l>It goes, hurled off amain, to where 'twas sent</l>
<l>And shoots afar, or that some object there</l>
<l>Can thwart and stop it? For the one or other</l>
<l>Thou must admit and take. Either of which</l>
<l>Shuts off escape for thee, and does compel</l>
<l>That thou concede the all spreads everywhere,</l>
<l>Owning no confines. Since whether there be</l>
<l>Aught that may block and check it so it comes</l>
<l>Not where 'twas sent, nor lodges in its goal,</l>
<l>Or whether borne along, in either view</l>
<l>'Thas started not from any end. And so</l>
<l>I'll follow on, and whereso'er thou set</l>
<l>The extreme coasts, I'll query, "what becomes</l>
<l>Thereafter of thy spear?" 'Twill come to pass</l>
<l>That nowhere can a world's-end be, and that</l>
<l>The chance for further flight prolongs forever</l>
<l>The flight itself. Besides, were all the space</l>
<l>Of the totality and sum shut in</l>
<l>With fixed coasts, and bounded everywhere,</l>
<l>Then would the abundance of world's matter flow</l>
<l>Together by solid weight from everywhere</l>
<l>Still downward to the bottom of the world,</l>
<l>Nor aught could happen under cope of sky,</l>
<l>Nor could there be a sky at all or sun-</l>
<l>Indeed, where matter all one heap would lie,</l>
<l>By having settled during infinite time.</l>
<l>But in reality, repose is given</l>
<l>Unto no bodies 'mongst the elements,</l>
<l>Because there is no bottom whereunto</l>
<l>They might, as 'twere, together flow, and where</l>
<l>They might take up their undisturbed abodes.</l>
<l>In endless motion everything goes on</l>
<l>Forevermore; out of all regions, even</l>
<l>Out of the pit below, from forth the vast,</l>
<l>Are hurtled bodies evermore supplied.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1002"/>
<l>The nature of room, the space of the abyss</l>
<l>Is such that even the flashing thunderbolts</l>
<l>Can neither speed upon their courses through,</l>
<l>Gliding across eternal tracts of time,</l>
<l>Nor, further, bring to pass, as on they run,</l>
<l>That they may bate their journeying one whit:</l>
<l>Such huge abundance spreads for things around-</l>
<l>Room off to every quarter, without end.</l>
<l>Lastly, before our very eyes is seen</l>
<l>Thing to bound thing: air hedges hill from hill,</l>
<l>And mountain walls hedge air; land ends the sea,</l>
<l>And sea in turn all lands; but for the All</l>
<l>Truly is nothing which outside may bound.</l>
<l>That, too, the sum of things itself may not</l>
<l>Have power to fix a measure of its own,</l>
<l>Great nature guards, she who compels the void</l>
<l>To bound all body, as body all the void,</l>
<l>Thus rendering by these alternates the whole</l>
<l>An infinite; or else the one or other,</l>
<l>Being unbounded by the other, spreads,</l>
<l>Even by its single nature, ne'ertheless</l>
<l>Immeasurably forth....</l>
<l>Nor sea, nor earth, nor shining vaults of sky,</l>
<l>Nor breed of mortals, nor holy limbs of gods</l>
<l>Could keep their place least portion of an hour:</l>
<l>For, driven apart from out its meetings fit,</l>
<l>The stock of stuff, dissolved, would be borne</l>
<l>Along the illimitable inane afar,</l>
<l>Or rather, in fact, would ne'er have once combined</l>
<l>And given a birth to aught, since, scattered wide,</l>
<l>It could not be united. For of truth</l>
<l>Neither by counsel did the primal germs</l>
<l>'Stablish themselves, as by keen act of mind,</l>
<l>Each in its proper place; nor did they make,</l>
<l>Forsooth, a compact how each germ should move;</l>
<l>But since, being many and changed in many modes</l>
<l>Along the All, they're driven abroad and vexed</l>
<l>By blow on blow, even from all time of old,</l>
<l>They thus at last, after attempting all</l>
<l>The kinds of motion and conjoining, come</l>
<l>Into those great arrangements out of which</l>
<l>This sum of things established is create,</l>
<l>By which, moreover, through the mighty years,</l>
<l>It is preserved, when once it has been thrown</l>
<l>Into the proper motions, bringing to pass</l>
<l>That ever the streams refresh the greedy main</l>
<l>With river-waves abounding, and that earth,</l>
<l>Lapped in warm exhalations of the sun,</l>
<l>Renews her broods, and that the lusty race</l>
<l>Of breathing creatures bears and blooms, and that</l>
<l>The gliding fires of ether are alive-</l>
<l>What still the primal germs nowise could do,</l>
<l>Unless from out the infinite of space</l>
<l>Could come supply of matter, whence in season</l>
<l>They're wont whatever losses to repair.</l>
<l>For as the nature of breathing creatures wastes,</l>
<l>Losing its body, when deprived of food:</l>
<l>So all things have to be dissolved as soon</l>
<l>As matter, diverted by what means soever</l>
<l>From off its course, shall fail to be on hand.</l>
<l>Nor can the blows from outward still conserve,</l>
<l>On every side, whatever sum of a world</l>
<l>Has been united in a whole. They can</l>
<l>Indeed, by frequent beating, check a part,</l>
<l>Till others arriving may fulfil the sum;</l>
<l>But meanwhile often are they forced to spring</l>
<l>Rebounding back, and, as they spring, to yield,</l>
<l>Unto those elements whence a world derives,</l>
<l>Room and a time for flight, permitting them</l>
<l>To be from off the massy union borne</l>
<l>Free and afar. Wherefore, again, again:</l>
<l>Needs must there come a many for supply;</l>
<l>And also, that the blows themselves shall be</l>
<l>Unfailing ever, must there ever be</l>
<l>An infinite force of matter all sides round.</l>

<l>With like procedure, that all breathing things</l>
<l>Head downward roam about, and yet cannot</l>

<l>Bodies can be at standstill in the void,</l>
<l>Deprived of force of weight; nor yet may void</l>
<l>Furnish support to any,- nay, it must,</l>

<p>PROEM</p>

<l>'Tis sweet, when, down the mighty main, the winds</l>
<l>Roll up its waste of waters, from the land</l>
<l>To watch another's labouring anguish far,</l>
<l>Not that we joyously delight that man</l>
<l>Should thus be smitten, but because 'tis sweet</l>
<l>To mark what evils we ourselves be spared;</l>
<l>'Tis sweet, again, to view the mighty strife</l>
<l>Of armies embattled yonder o'er the plains,</l>
<l>Ourselves no sharers in the peril; but naught</l>
<l>There is more goodly than to hold the high</l>
<l>Serene plateaus, well fortressed by the wise,</l>
<l>Whence thou may'st look below on other men</l>
<l>And see them ev'rywhere wand'ring, all dispersed</l>
<l>In their lone seeking for the road of life;</l>
<l>Rivals in genius, or emulous in rank,</l>
<l>Pressing through days and nights with hugest toil</l>
<l>For summits of power and mastery of the world.</l>
<l>O wretched minds of men! O blinded hearts!</l>
<l>In how great perils, in what darks of life</l>
<l>Are spent the human years, however brief!-</l>
<l>O not to see that nature for herself</l>
<l>Barks after nothing, save that pain keep off,</l>
<l>Disjoined from the body, and that mind enjoy</l>
<l>Delightsome feeling, far from care and fear!</l>
<l>Therefore we see that our corporeal life</l>
<l>Needs little, altogether, and only such</l>
<l>As takes the pain away, and can besides</l>
<l>Strew underneath some number of delights.</l>
<l>More grateful 'tis at times (for nature craves</l>
<l>No artifice nor luxury), if forsooth</l>
<l>There be no golden images of boys</l>
<l>Along the halls, with right hands holding out</l>
<l>The lamps ablaze, the lights for evening feasts,</l>
<l>And if the house doth glitter not with gold</l>
<l>Nor gleam with silver, and to the lyre resound</l>
<l>No fretted and gilded ceilings overhead,</l>
<l>Yet still to lounge with friends in the soft grass</l>
<l>Beside a river of water, underneath</l>
<l>A big tree's boughs, and merrily to refresh</l>
<l>Our frames, with no vast outlay- most of all</l>
<l>If the weather is laughing and the times of the year</l>
<l>Besprinkle the green of the grass around with flowers.</l>
<l>Nor yet the quicker will hot fevers go,</l>
<l>If on a pictured tapestry thou toss,</l>
<l>Or purple robe, than if 'tis thine to lie</l>
<l>Upon the poor man's bedding. Wherefore, since</l>
<l>Treasure, nor rank, nor glory of a reign</l>
<l>Avail us naught for this our body, thus</l>
<l>Reckon them likewise nothing for the mind:</l>
<l>Save then perchance, when thou beholdest forth</l>
<l>Thy legions swarming round the Field of Mars,</l>
<l>Rousing a mimic warfare- either side</l>
<l>Strengthened with large auxiliaries and horse,</l>
<l>Alike equipped with arms, alike inspired;</l>
<l>Or save when also thou beholdest forth</l>
<l>Thy fleets to swarm, deploying down the sea:</l>
<l>For then, by such bright circumstance abashed,</l>
<l>Religion pales and flees thy mind; O then</l>
<l>The fears of death leave heart so free of care.</l>
<l>But if we note how all this pomp at last</l>
<l>Is but a drollery and a mocking sport,</l>
<l>And of a truth man's dread, with cares at heels,</l>
<l>Dreads not these sounds of arms, these savage swords</l>
<l>But among kings and lords of all the world</l>
<l>Mingles undaunted, nor is overawed</l>
<l>By gleam of gold nor by the splendour bright</l>
<l>Of purple robe, canst thou then doubt that this</l>
<l>Is aught, but power of thinking?- when, besides</l>
<l>The whole of life but labours in the dark.</l>
<l>For just as children tremble and fear all</l>
<l>In the viewless dark, so even we at times</l>
<l>Dread in the light so many things that be</l>
<l>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</l>
<l>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</l>
<l>This terror then, this darkness of the mind,</l>
<l>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</l>
<l>Nor glittering arrows of morning can disperse,</l>
<l>But only nature's aspect and her law.</l>

<p> ATOMIC MOTIONS</p>

<l rend="indent">  Now come: I will untangle for thy steps</l>
<l>Now by what motions the begetting bodies</l>
<l>Of the world-stuff beget the varied world,</l>
<l>And then forever resolve it when begot,</l>
<l>And by what force they are constrained to this,</l>
<l>And what the speed appointed unto them</l>
<l>Wherewith to travel down the vast inane:</l>
<l>Do thou remember to yield thee to my words.</l>
<l>For truly matter coheres not, crowds not tight,</l>
<l>Since we behold each thing to wane away,</l>
<l>And we observe how all flows on and off,</l>
<l>As 'twere, with age-old time, and from our eyes</l>
<l>How eld withdraws each object at the end,</l>
<l>Albeit the sum is seen to bide the same,</l>
<l>Unharmed, because these motes that leave each thing</l>
<l>Diminish what they part from, but endow</l>
<l>With increase those to which in turn they come,</l>
<l>Constraining these to wither in old age,</l>
<l>And those to flower at the prime (and yet</l>
<l>Biding not long among them). Thus the sum</l>
<l>Forever is replenished, and we live</l>
<l>As mortals by eternal give and take.</l>
<l>The nations wax, the nations wane away;</l>
<l>In a brief space the generations pass,</l>
<l>And like to runners hand the lamp of life</l>
<l>One unto other.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="80"/>
<l rend="indent">                       But if thou believe</l>
<l>That the primordial germs of things can stop,</l>
<l>And in their stopping give new motions birth,</l>
<l>Afar thou wanderest from the road of truth.</l>
<l>For since they wander through the void inane,</l>
<l>All the primordial germs of things must needs</l>
<l>Be borne along, either by weight their own,</l>
<l>Or haply by another's blow without.</l>
<l>For, when, in their incessancy so oft</l>
<l>They meet and clash, it comes to pass amain</l>
<l>They leap asunder, face to face: not strange-</l>
<l>Being most hard, and solid in their weights,</l>
<l>And naught opposing motion, from behind.</l>
<l>And that more clearly thou perceive how all</l>
<l>These mites of matter are darted round about,</l>
<l>Recall to mind how nowhere in the sum</l>
<l>Of All exists a bottom,- nowhere is</l>
<l>A realm of rest for primal bodies; since</l>
<l>(As amply shown and proved by reason sure)</l>
<l>Space has no bound nor measure, and extends</l>
<l>Unmetered forth in all directions round.</l>
<l>Since this stands certain, thus 'tis out of doubt</l>
<l>No rest is rendered to the primal bodies</l>
<l>Along the unfathomable inane; but rather,</l>
<l>Inveterately plied by motions mixed,</l>
<l>Some, at their jamming, bound aback and leave</l>
<l>Huge gaps between, and some from off the blow</l>
<l>Are hurried about with spaces small between.</l>
<l>And all which, brought together with slight gaps,</l>
<l>In more condensed union bound aback,</l>
<l>Linked by their own all inter-tangled shapes,-</l>
<l>These form the irrefragable roots of rocks</l>
<l>And the brute bulks of iron, and what else</l>
<l>Is of their kind...</l>
<l>The rest leap far asunder, far recoil,</l>
<l>Leaving huge gaps between: and these supply</l>
<l>For us thin air and splendour-lights of the sun.</l>
<l>And many besides wander the mighty void-</l>
<l>Cast back from unions of existing things,</l>
<l>Nowhere accepted in the universe,</l>
<l>And nowise linked in motions to the rest.</l>
<l>And of this fact (as I record it here)</l>
<l>An image, a type goes on before our eyes</l>
<l>Present each moment; for behold whenever</l>
<l>The sun's light and the rays, let in, pour down</l>
<l>Across dark halls of houses: thou wilt see</l>
<l>The many mites in many a manner mixed</l>
<l>Amid a void in the very light of the rays,</l>
<l>And battling on, as in eternal strife,</l>
<l>And in battalions contending without halt,</l>
<l>In meetings, partings, harried up and down.</l>
<l>From this thou mayest conjecture of what sort</l>
<l>The ceaseless tossing of primordial seeds</l>
<l>Amid the mightier void- at least so far</l>
<l>As small affair can for a vaster serve,</l>
<l>And by example put thee on the spoor</l>
<l>Of knowledge. For this reason too 'tis fit</l>
<l>Thou turn thy mind the more unto these bodies</l>
<l>Which here are witnessed tumbling in the light:</l>
<l>Namely, because such tumblings are a sign</l>
<l>That motions also of the primal stuff</l>
<l>Secret and viewless lurk beneath, behind.</l>
<l>For thou wilt mark here many a speck, impelled</l>
<l>By viewless blows, to change its little course,</l>
<l>And beaten backwards to return again,</l>
<l>Hither and thither in all directions round.</l>
<l>Lo, all their shifting movement is of old,</l>
<l>From the primeval atoms; for the same</l>
<l>Primordial seeds of things first move of self,</l>
<l>And then those bodies built of unions small</l>
<l>And nearest, as it were, unto the powers</l>
<l>Of the primeval atoms, are stirred up</l>
<l>By impulse of those atoms' unseen blows,</l>
<l>And these thereafter goad the next in size:</l>
<l>Thus motion ascends from the primevals on,</l>
<l>And stage by stage emerges to our sense,</l>
<l>Until those objects also move which we</l>
<l>Can mark in sunbeams, though it not appears</l>
<l>What blows do urge them.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="142"/>
<l rend="indent">   Now what the speed to matter's atoms given</l>
<l>Thou mayest in few, my Memmius, learn from this:</l>
<l>When first the dawn is sprinkling with new light</l>
<l>The lands, and all the breed of birds abroad</l>
<l>Flit round the trackless forests, with liquid notes</l>
<l>Filling the regions along the mellow air,</l>
<l>We see 'tis forthwith manifest to man</l>
<l>How suddenly the risen sun is wont</l>
<l>At such an hour to overspread and clothe</l>
<l>The whole with its own splendour; but the sun's</l>
<l>Warm exhalations and this serene light</l>
<l>Travel not down an empty void; and thus</l>
<l>They are compelled more slowly to advance,</l>
<l>Whilst, as it were, they cleave the waves of air;</l>
<l>Nor one by one travel these particles</l>
<l>Of the warm exhalations, but are all</l>
<l>Entangled and enmassed, whereby at once</l>
<l>Each is restrained by each, and from without</l>
<l>Checked, till compelled more slowly to advance.</l>
<l>But the primordial atoms with their old</l>
<l>Simple solidity, when forth they travel</l>
<l>Along the empty void, all undelayed</l>
<l>By aught outside them there, and they, each one</l>
<l>Being one unit from nature of its parts,</l>
<l>Are borne to that one place on which they strive</l>
<l>Still to lay hold, must then, beyond a doubt,</l>
<l>Outstrip in speed, and be more swiftly borne</l>
<l>Than light of sun, and over regions rush,</l>
<l>Of space much vaster, in the self-same time</l>
<l>The sun's effulgence widens round the sky.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>Nor to pursue the atoms one by one,</l>
<l>To see the law whereby each thing goes on.</l>
<l>But some men, ignorant of matter, think,</l>
<l>Opposing this, that not without the gods,</l>
<l>In such adjustment to our human ways,</l>
<l>Can nature change the seasons of the years,</l>
<l>And bring to birth the grains and all of else</l>
<l>To which divine Delight, the guide of life,</l>
<l>Persuades mortality and leads it on,</l>
<l>That, through her artful blandishments of love,</l>
<l>It propagate the generations still,</l>
<l>Lest humankind should perish. When they feign</l>
<l>That gods have stablished all things but for man,</l>
<l>They seem in all ways mightily to lapse</l>
<l>From reason's truth: for ev'n if ne'er I knew</l>
<l>What seeds primordial are, yet would I dare</l>
<l>This to affirm, ev'n from deep judgment based</l>
<l>Upon the ways and conduct of the skies-</l>
<l>This to maintain by many a fact besides-</l>
<l>That in no wise the nature of the world</l>
<l>For us was builded by a power divine-</l>
<l>So great the faults it stands encumbered with:</l>
<l>The which, my Memmius, later on, for thee</l>
<l>We will clear up. Now as to what remains</l>
<l>Concerning motions we'll unfold our thought.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="184"/>
<l rend="indent">  Now is the place, meseems, in these affairs</l>
<l>To prove for thee this too: nothing corporeal</l>
<l>Of its own force can e'er be upward borne,</l>
<l>Or upward go- nor let the bodies of flames</l>
<l>Deceive thee here: for they engendered are</l>
<l>With urge to upwards, taking thus increase,</l>
<l>Whereby grow upwards shining grains and trees,</l>
<l>Though all the weight within them downward bears.</l>
<l>Nor, when the fires will leap from under round</l>
<l>The roofs of houses, and swift flame laps up</l>
<l>Timber and beam, 'tis then to be supposed</l>
<l>They act of own accord, no force beneath</l>
<l>To urge them up. 'Tis thus that blood, discharged</l>
<l>From out our bodies, spurts its jets aloft</l>
<l>And spatters gore. And hast thou never marked</l>
<l>With what a force the water will disgorge</l>
<l>Timber and beam? The deeper, straight and down,</l>
<l>We push them in, and, many though we be,</l>
<l>The more we press with main and toil, the more</l>
<l>The water vomits up and flings them back,</l>
<l>That, more than half their length, they there emerge,</l>
<l>Rebounding. Yet we never doubt, meseems,</l>
<l>That all the weight within them downward bears</l>
<l>Through empty void. Well, in like manner, flames</l>
<l>Ought also to be able, when pressed out,</l>
<l>Through winds of air to rise aloft, even though</l>
<l>The weight within them strive to draw them down.</l>
<l>Hast thou not seen, sweeping so far and high,</l>
<l>The meteors, midnight flambeaus of the sky,</l>
<l>How after them they draw long trails of flame</l>
<l>Wherever Nature gives a thoroughfare?</l>
<l>How stars and constellations drop to earth,</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> not? Nay, too, the sun from peak of heaven</l>
<l>Sheds round to every quarter its large heat,</l>
<l>And sows the new-ploughed intervales with light:</l>
<l>Thus also sun's heat downward tends to earth.</l>
<l>Athwart the rain thou seest the lightning fly;</l>
<l>Now here, now there, bursting from out the clouds,</l>
<l>The fires dash zig-zag- and that flaming power</l>
<l>Falls likewise down to earth.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="216"/>
<l rend="indent">                              In these affairs</l>
<l>We wish thee also well aware of this:</l>
<l>The atoms, as their own weight bears them down</l>
<l>Plumb through the void, at scarce determined times,</l>
<l>In scarce determined places, from their course</l>
<l>Decline a little- call it, so to speak,</l>
<l>Mere changed trend. For were it not their wont</l>
<l>Thuswise to swerve, down would they fall, each one,</l>
<l>Like drops of rain, through the unbottomed void;</l>
<l>And then collisions ne'er could be nor blows</l>
<l>Among the primal elements; and thus</l>
<l>Nature would never have created aught.</l>
<l rend="indent">  But, if perchance be any that believe</l>
<l>The heavier bodies, as more swiftly borne</l>
<l>Plumb down the void, are able from above</l>
<l>To strike the lighter, thus engendering blows</l>
<l>Able to cause those procreant motions, far</l>
<l>From highways of true reason they retire.</l>
<l>For whatsoever through the waters fall,</l>
<l>Or through thin air, must quicken their descent,</l>
<l>Each after its weight- on this account, because</l>
<l>Both bulk of water and the subtle air</l>
<l>By no means can retard each thing alike,</l>
<l>But give more quick before the heavier weight;</l>
<l>But contrariwise the empty void cannot,</l>
<l>On any side, at any time, to aught</l>
<l>Oppose resistance, but will ever yield,</l>
<l>True to its bent of nature. Wherefore all,</l>
<l>With equal speed, though equal not in weight,</l>
<l>Must rush, borne downward through the still inane.</l>
<l>Thus ne'er at all have heavier from above</l>
<l>Been swift to strike the lighter, gendering strokes</l>
<l>Which cause those divers motions, by whose means</l>
<l>Nature transacts her work. And so I say,</l>
<l>The atoms must a little swerve at times-</l>
<l>But only the least, lest we should seem to feign</l>
<l>Motions oblique, and fact refute us there.</l>
<l>For this we see forthwith is manifest:</l>
<l>Whatever the weight, it can't obliquely go,</l>
<l>Down on its headlong journey from above,</l>
<l>At least so far as thou canst mark; but who</l>
<l>Is there can mark by sense that naught can swerve</l>
<l>At all aside from off its road's straight line?</l>
<l rend="indent">  Again, if ev'r all motions are co-linked,</l>
<l>And from the old ever arise the new</l>
<l>In fixed order, and primordial seeds</l>
<l>Produce not by their swerving some new start</l>
<l>Of motion to sunder the covenants of fate,</l>
<l>That cause succeed not cause from everlasting,</l>
<l>Whence this free will for creatures o'er the lands,</l>
<l>Whence is it wrested from the fates,- this will</l>
<l>Whereby we step right forward where desire</l>
<l>Leads each man on, whereby the same we swerve</l>
<l>In motions, not as at some fixed time,</l>
<l>Nor at some fixed line of space, but where</l>
<l>The mind itself has urged? For out of doubt</l>
<l>In these affairs 'tis each man's will itself</l>
<l>That gives the start, and hence throughout our limbs</l>
<l>Incipient motions are diffused. Again,</l>
<l>Dost thou not see, when, at a point of time,</l>
<l>The bars are opened, how the eager strength</l>
<l>Of horses cannot forward break as soon</l>
<l>As pants their mind to do? For it behooves</l>
<l>That all the stock of matter, through the frame,</l>
<l>Be roused, in order that, through every joint,</l>
<l>Aroused, it press and follow mind's desire;</l>
<l>So thus thou seest initial motion's gendered</l>
<l>From out the heart, aye, verily, proceeds</l>
<l>First from the spirit's will, whence at the last</l>
<l>'Tis given forth through joints and body entire.</l>
<l>Quite otherwise it is, when forth we move,</l>
<l>Impelled by a blow of another's mighty powers</l>
<l>And mighty urge; for then 'tis clear enough</l>
<l>All matter of our total body goes,</l>
<l>Hurried along, against our own desire-</l>
<l>Until the will has pulled upon the reins</l>
<l>And checked it back, throughout our members all;</l>
<l>At whose arbitrament indeed sometimes</l>
<l>The stock of matter's forced to change its path,</l>
<l>Throughout our members and throughout our joints,</l>
<l>And, after being forward cast, to be</l>
<l>Reined up, whereat it settles back again.</l>
<l>So seest thou not, how, though external force</l>
<l>Drive men before, and often make them move,</l>
<l>Onward against desire, and headlong snatched,</l>
<l>Yet is there something in these breasts of ours</l>
<l>Strong to combat, strong to withstand the same?-</l>
<l>Wherefore no less within the primal seeds</l>
<l>Thou must admit, besides all blows and weight,</l>
<l>Some other cause of motion, whence derives</l>
<l>This power in us inborn, of some free act.-</l>
<l>Since naught from nothing can become, we see.</l>
<l>For weight prevents all things should come to pass</l>
<l>Through blows, as 'twere, by some external force;</l>
<l>But that man's mind itself in all it does</l>
<l>Hath not a fixed necessity within,</l>
<l>Nor is not, like a conquered thing, compelled</l>
<l>To bear and suffer,- this state comes to man</l>
<l>From that slight swervement of the elements</l>
<l>In no fixed line of space, in no fixed time.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="294"/>
<l rend="indent">  Nor ever was the stock of stuff more crammed,</l>
<l>Nor ever, again, sundered by bigger gaps:</l>
<l>For naught gives increase and naught takes away;</l>
<l>On which account, just as they move to-day,</l>
<l>The elemental bodies moved of old</l>
<l>And shall the same hereafter evermore.</l>
<l>And what was wont to be begot of old</l>
<l>Shall be begotten under selfsame terms</l>
<l>And grow and thrive in power, so far as given</l>
<l>To each by Nature's changeless, old decrees.</l>
<l>The sum of things there is no power can change,</l>
<l>For naught exists outside, to which can flee</l>
<l>Out of the world matter of any kind,</l>
<l>Nor forth from which a fresh supply can spring,</l>
<l>Break in upon the founded world, and change</l>
<l>Whole nature of things, and turn their motions about.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="308" />
<l rend="indent">                          Herein wonder not</l>
<l>How 'tis that, while the seeds of things are all</l>
<l>Moving forever, the sum yet seems to stand</l>
<l>Supremely still, except in cases where</l>
<l>A thing shows motion of its frame as whole.</l>
<l>For far beneath the ken of senses lies</l>
<l>The nature of those ultimates of the world;</l>
<l>And so, since those themselves thou canst not see,</l>
<l>Their motion also must they veil from men-</l>
<l>For mark, indeed, how things we can see, oft</l>
<l>Yet hide their motions, when afar from us</l>
<l>Along the distant landscape. Often thus,</l>
<l>Upon a hillside will the woolly flocks</l>
<l>Be cropping their goodly food and creeping about</l>
<l>Whither the summons of the grass, begemmed</l>
<l>With the fresh dew, is calling, and the lambs,</l>
<l>Well filled, are frisking, locking horns in sport:</l>
<l>Yet all for us seem blurred and blent afar-</l>
<l>A glint of white at rest on a green hill.</l>
<l>Again, when mighty legions, marching round,</l>
<l>Fill all the quarters of the plains below,</l>
<l>Rousing a mimic warfare, there the sheen</l>
<l>Shoots up the sky, and all the fields about</l>
<l>Glitter with brass, and from beneath, a sound</l>
<l>Goes forth from feet of stalwart soldiery,</l>
<l>And mountain walls, smote by the shouting, send</l>
<l>The voices onward to the stars of heaven,</l>
<l>And hither and thither darts the cavalry,</l>
<l>And of a sudden down the midmost fields</l>
<l>Charges with onset stout enough to rock</l>
<l>The solid earth: and yet some post there is</l>
<l>Up the high mountains, viewed from which they seem</l>
<l>To stand- a gleam at rest along the plains.</l>

<l>Nor in no other wise could offspring know</l>
<l>Mother, nor mother offspring- which we see</l>
<l>They yet can do, distinguished one from other,</l>
<l>No less than human beings, by clear signs.</l>
<l>Thus oft before fair temples of the gods,</l>
<l>Beside the incense-burning altars slain,</l>
<l>Drops down the yearling calf, from out its breast</l>
<l>Breathing warm streams of blood; the orphaned mother,</l>
<l>Ranging meanwhile green woodland pastures round,</l>
<l>Knows well the footprints, pressed by cloven hoofs,</l>
<l>With eyes regarding every spot about,</l>
<l>For sight somewhere of youngling gone from her;</l>
<l>And, stopping short, filleth the leafy lanes</l>
<l>With her complaints; and oft she seeks again</l>
<l>Within the stall, pierced by her yearning still.</l>
<l>Nor tender willows, nor dew-quickened grass,</l>
<l>Nor the loved streams that glide along low banks,</l>
<l>Can lure her mind and turn the sudden pain;</l>
<l>Nor other shapes of calves that graze thereby</l>
<l>Distract her mind or lighten pain the least-</l>
<l>So keen her search for something known and hers.</l>
<l>Moreover, tender kids with bleating throats</l>
<l>Do know their horned dams, and butting lambs</l>
<l>The flocks of sheep, and thus they patter on,</l>
<l>Unfailingly each to its proper teat,</l>
<l>As nature intends. Lastly, with any grain,</l>
<l>Thou'lt see that no one kernel in one kind</l>
<l>Is so far like another, that there still</l>
<l>Is not in shapes some difference running through.</l>
<l>By a like law we see how earth is pied</l>
<l>With shells and conchs, where, with soft waves, the sea</l>
<l>Beats on the thirsty sands of curving shores.</l>
<l>Wherefore again, again, since seeds of things</l>
<l>Exist by nature, nor were wrought with hands</l>
<l>After a fixed pattern of one other,</l>
<l>They needs must flitter to and fro with shapes</l>
<l>In types dissimilar to one another.</l>

<l>Easy enough by thought of mind to solve</l>
<l>Why fires of lightning more can penetrate</l>
<l>Than these of ours from pitch-pine born on earth.</l>
<l>For thou canst say lightning's celestial fire,</l>
<l>So subtle, is formed of figures finer far,</l>
<l>And passes thus through holes which this our fire,</l>
<l>Born from the wood, created from the pine,</l>
<l>Cannot. Again, light passes through the horn</l>
<l>On the lantern's side, while rain is dashed away.</l>
<l>And why?- unless those bodies of light should be</l>
<l>Finer than those of water's genial showers.</l>
<l>We see how quickly through a colander</l>
<l>The wines will flow; how, on the other hand,</l>
<l>The sluggish olive-oil delays: no doubt,</l>
<l>Because 'tis wrought of elements more large,</l>
<l>Or else more crook'd and intertangled. Thus</l>
<l>It comes that the primordials cannot be</l>
<l>So suddenly sundered one from other, and seep,</l>
<l>One through each several hole of anything.</l>

<milestone unit="card" n="398"/>
<l rend="indent">  And note, besides, that liquor of honey or milk</l>
<l>Yields in the mouth agreeable taste to tongue,</l>
<l>Whilst nauseous wormwood, pungent centaury,</l>
<l>With their foul flavour set the lips awry;</l>
<l>Thus simple 'tis to see that whatsoever</l>
<l>Can touch the senses pleasingly are made</l>
<l>Of smooth and rounded elements, whilst those</l>
<l>Which seem the bitter and the sharp, are held</l>
<l>Entwined by elements more crook'd, and so</l>
<l>Are wont to tear their ways into our senses,</l>
<l>And rend our body as they enter in.</l>
<l>In short all good to sense, all bad to touch,</l>
<l>Being up-built of figures so unlike,</l>
<l>Are mutually at strife- lest thou suppose</l>
<l>That the shrill rasping of a squeaking saw</l>
<l>Consists of elements as smooth as song</l>
<l>Which, waked by nimble fingers, on the strings</l>
<l>The sweet musicians fashion; or suppose</l>
<l>That same-shaped atoms through men's nostrils pierce</l>
<l>When foul cadavers burn, as when the stage</l>
<l>Is with Cilician saffron sprinkled fresh,</l>
<l>And the altar near exhales Panchaean scent;</l>
<l>Or hold as of like seed the goodly hues</l>
<l>Of things which feast our eyes, as those which sting</l>
<l>Against the smarting pupil and draw tears,</l>
<l>Or show, with gruesome aspect, grim and vile.</l>
<l>For never a shape which charms our sense was made</l>
<l>Without some elemental smoothness; whilst</l>
<l>Whate'er is harsh and irksome has been framed</l>
<l>Still with some roughness in its elements.</l>
<l>Some, too, there are which justly are supposed</l>
<l>To be nor smooth nor altogether hooked,</l>
<l>With bended barbs, but slightly angled-out,</l>
<l>To tickle rather than to wound the sense-</l>
<l>And of which sort is the salt tartar of wine</l>
<l>And flavours of the gummed elecampane.</l>
<l>Again, that glowing fire and icy rime</l>
<l>Are fanged with teeth unlike whereby to sting</l>
<l>Our body's sense, the touch of each gives proof.</l>
<l>For touch- by sacred majesties of Gods!-</l>
<l>Touch is indeed the body's only sense-</l>
<l>Be't that something in-from-outward works,</l>
<l>Be't that something in the body born</l>
<l>Wounds, or delighteth as it passes out</l>
<l>Along the procreant paths of Aphrodite;</l>
<l>Or be't the seeds by some collision whirl</l>
<l>Disordered in the body and confound</l>
<l>By tumult and confusion all the sense-</l>
<l>As thou mayst find, if haply with the hand</l>
<l>Thyself thou strike thy body's any part.</l>
<l>On which account, the elemental forms</l>
<l>Must differ widely, as enabled thus</l>
<l>To cause diverse sensations.</l>
<l rend="indent">                             And, again,</l>
<l>What seems to us the hardened and condensed</l>
<l>Must be of atoms among themselves more hooked,</l>
<l>Be held compacted deep within, as 'twere</l>
<l>By branch-like atoms- of which sort the chief</l>
<l>Are diamond stones, despisers of all blows,</l>
<l>And stalwart flint and strength of solid iron,</l>
<l>And brazen bars, which, budging hard in locks,</l>
<l>Do grate and scream. But what are liquid, formed</l>
<l>Of fluid body, they indeed must be</l>
<l>Of elements more smooth and round- because</l>
<l>Their globules severally will not cohere:</l>
<l>To suck the poppy-seeds from palm of hand</l>
<l>Is quite as easy as drinking water down,</l>
<l>And they, once struck, roll like unto the same.</l>
<l>But that thou seest among the things that flow</l>
<l>Some bitter, as the brine of ocean is,</l>
<l>Is not the least a marvel...</l>
<l>For since 'tis fluid, smooth its atoms are</l>
<l>And round, with painful rough ones mixed therein;</l>
<l>Yet need not these be held together hooked:</l>
<l>In fact, though rough, they're globular besides,</l>
<l>Able at once to roll, and rasp the sense.</l>
<l>And that the more thou mayst believe me here,</l>
<l>That with smooth elements are mixed the rough</l>
<l>(Whence Neptune's salt astringent body comes),</l>
<l>There is a means to separate the twain,</l>
<l>And thereupon dividedly to see</l>
<l>How the sweet water, after filtering through</l>
<l>So often underground, flows freshened forth</l>
<l>Into some hollow; for it leaves above</l>
<l>The primal germs of nauseating brine,</l>
<l>Since cling the rough more readily in earth.</l>
<l>Lastly, whatso thou markest to disperse</l>
<l>Upon the instant- smoke, and cloud, and flame-</l>
<l>Must not (even though not all of smooth and round)</l>
<l>Be yet co-linked with atoms intertwined,</l>
<l>That thus they can, without together cleaving,</l>
<l>So pierce our body and so bore the rocks.</l>
<l>Whatever we see...</l>
<l>Given to senses, that thou must perceive</l>
<l>They're not from linked but pointed elements.</l>

<l rend="indent">  The which now having taught, I will go on</l>
<l>To bind thereto a fact to this allied</l>
<l>And drawing from this its proof: these primal germs</l>
<l>Vary, yet only with finite tale of shapes.</l>
<l>For were these shapes quite infinite, some seeds</l>
<l>Would have a body of infinite increase.</l>
<l>For in one seed, in one small frame of any,</l>
<l>The shapes can't vary from one another much.</l>
<l>Assume, we'll say, that of three minim parts</l>
<l>Consist the primal bodies, or add a few:</l>
<l>When, now, by placing all these parts of one</l>
<l>At top and bottom, changing lefts and rights,</l>
<l>Thou hast with every kind of shift found out</l>
<l>What the aspect of shape of its whole body</l>
<l>Each new arrangement gives, for what remains,</l>
<l>If thou percase wouldst vary its old shapes,</l>
<l>New parts must then be added; follows next,</l>
<l>If thou percase wouldst vary still its shapes,</l>
<l>That by like logic each arrangement still</l>
<l>Requires its increment of other parts.</l>
<l>Ergo, an augmentation of its frame</l>
<l>Follows upon each novelty of forms.</l>
<l>Wherefore, it cannot be thou'lt undertake</l>
<l>That seeds have infinite differences in form,</l>
<l>Lest thus thou forcest some indeed to be</l>
<l>Of an immeasurable immensity-</l>
<l>Which I have taught above cannot be proved.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>And now for thee barbaric robes, and gleam</l>
<l>Of Meliboean purple, touched with dye</l>
<l>Of the Thessalian shell...</l>
<l>The peacock's golden generations, stained</l>
<l>With spotted gaieties, would lie o'erthrown</l>
<l>By some new colour of new things more bright;</l>
<l>The odour of myrrh and savours of honey despised;</l>
<l>The swan's old lyric, and Apollo's hymns,</l>
<l>Once modulated on the many chords,</l>
<l>Would likewise sink o'ermastered and be mute:</l>
<l>For, lo, a somewhat, finer than the rest,</l>
<l>Would be arising evermore. So, too,</l>
<l>Into some baser part might all retire,</l>
<l>Even as we said to better might they come:</l>
<l>For, lo, a somewhat, loathlier than the rest</l>
<l>To nostrils, ears, and eyes, and taste of tongue,</l>
<l>Would then, by reasoning reversed, be there.</l>
<l>Since 'tis not so, but unto things are given</l>
<l>Their fixed limitations which do bound</l>
<l>Their sum on either side, 'tmust be confessed</l>
<l>That matter, too, by finite tale of shapes</l>
<l>Does differ. Again, from earth's midsummer heats</l>
<l>Unto the icy hoar-frosts of the year</l>
<l>The forward path is fixed, and by like law</l>
<l>O'ertravelled backwards at the dawn of spring.</l>
<l>For each degree of hot, and each of cold,</l>
<l>And the half-warm, all filling up the sum</l>
<l>In due progression, lie, my Memmius, there</l>
<l>Betwixt the two extremes: the things create</l>
<l>Must differ, therefore, by a finite change,</l>
<l>Since at each end marked off they ever are</l>
<l>By fixed point- on one side plagued by flames</l>
<l>And on the other by congealing frosts.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="522"/>
<l rend="indent">  The which now having taught, I will go on</l>
<l>To bind thereto a fact to this allied</l>
<l>And drawing from this its proof: those primal germs</l>
<l>Which have been fashioned all of one like shape</l>
<l>Are infinite in tale; for, since the forms</l>
<l>Themselves are finite in divergences,</l>
<l>Then those which are alike will have to be</l>
<l>Infinite, else the sum of stuff remains</l>
<l>A finite- what I've proved is not the fact,</l>
<l>Showing in verse how corpuscles of stuff,</l>
<l>From everlasting and to-day the same,</l>
<l>Uphold the sum of things, all sides around</l>
<l>By old succession of unending blows.</l>
<l>For though thou view'st some beasts to be more rare,</l>
<l>And mark'st in them a less prolific stock,</l>
<l>Yet in another region, in lands remote,</l>
<l>That kind abounding may make up the count;</l>
<l>Even as we mark among the four-foot kind</l>
<l>Snake-handed elephants, whose thousands wall</l>

<l>Such few examples. Or suppose, besides,</l>
<l>We feign some thing, one of its kind and sole</l>
<l>With body born, to which is nothing like</l>
<l>In all the lands: yet now unless shall be</l>
<l>An infinite count of matter out of which</l>
<l>Thus to conceive and bring it forth to life,</l>
<l>It cannot be created and- what's more-</l>
<l>It cannot take its food and get increase.</l>
<l>Yea, if through all the world in finite tale</l>
<l>Be tossed the procreant bodies of one thing,</l>
<l>Whence, then, and where in what mode, by what power,</l>
<l>Shall they to meeting come together there,</l>
<l>In such vast ocean of matter and tumult strange?-</l>
<l>No means they have of joining into one.</l>
<l>But, just as, after mighty ship-wrecks piled,</l>
<l>The mighty main is wont to scatter wide</l>
<l>The rowers' banks, the ribs, the yards, the prow,</l>
<l>The masts and swimming oars, so that afar</l>
<l>Along all shores of lands are seen afloat</l>
<l>The carven fragments of the rended poop,</l>
<l>Giving a lesson to mortality</l>
<l>To shun the ambush of the faithless main,</l>
<l>The violence and the guile, and trust it not</l>
<l>At any hour, however much may smile</l>
<l>The crafty enticements of the placid deep:</l>
<l>Exactly thus, if once thou holdest true</l>
<l>That certain seeds are finite in their tale,</l>
<l>The various tides of matter, then, must needs</l>
<l>Scatter them flung throughout the ages all,</l>
<l>So that not ever can they join, as driven</l>
<l>Together into union, nor remain</l>
<l>In union, nor with increment can grow-</l>
<l>But facts in proof are manifest for each:</l>
<l>Things can be both begotten and increase.</l>
<l>'Tis therefore manifest that primal germs,</l>
<l>Are infinite in any class thou wilt-</l>
<l>From whence is furnished matter for all things.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Nor can those motions that bring death prevail</l>
<l>Forever, nor eternally entomb</l>
<l>The welfare of the world; nor, further, can</l>
<l>Those motions that give birth to things and growth</l>
<l>Keep them forever when created there.</l>
<l>Thus the long war, from everlasting waged,</l>
<l>With equal strife among the elements</l>
<l>Goes on and on. Now here, now there, prevail</l>
<l>The vital forces of the world- or fall.</l>
<l>Mixed with the funeral is the wildered wail</l>
<l>Of infants coming to the shores of light:</l>
<l>No night a day, no dawn a night hath followed</l>
<l>That heard not, mingling with the small birth-cries,</l>

<l>Resting on other earth. Unto her car</l>
<l>They've yoked the wild beasts, since a progeny,</l>
<l>However savage, must be tamed and chid</l>
<l>By care of parents. They have girt about</l>
<l>With turret-crown the summit of her head,</l>
<l>Since, fortressed in her goodly strongholds high,</l>
<l>'Tis she sustains the cities; now, adorned</l>
<l>With that same token, to-day is carried forth,</l>
<l>With solemn awe through many a mighty land,</l>
<l>The image of that mother, the divine.</l>
<l>Her the wide nations, after antique rite,</l>
<l>Do name Idaean Mother, giving her</l>
<l>Escort of Phrygian bands, since first, they say,</l>
<l>From out those regions 'twas that grain began</l>
<l>Through all the world. To her do they assign</l>
<l>The Galli, the emasculate, since thus</l>
<l>They wish to show that men who violate</l>
<l>The majesty of the mother and have proved</l>
<l>Ingrate to parents are to be adjudged</l>
<l>Unfit to give unto the shores of light</l>
<l>A living progeny. The Galli come:</l>
<l>And hollow cymbals, tight-skinned tambourines</l>
<l>Resound around to bangings of their hands;</l>
<l>The fierce horns threaten with a raucous bray;</l>
<l>The tubed pipe excites their maddened minds</l>
<l>In Phrygian measures; they bear before them knives,</l>
<l>Wild emblems of their frenzy, which have power</l>
<l>The rabble's ingrate heads and impious hearts</l>
<l>To panic with terror of the goddess' might.</l>
<l>And so, when through the mighty cities borne,</l>
<l>She blesses man with salutations mute,</l>
<l>They strew the highway of her journeyings</l>
<l>With coin of brass and silver, gifting her</l>
<l>With alms and largesse, and shower her and shade</l>
<l>With flowers of roses falling like the snow</l>
<l>Upon the Mother and her companion-bands.</l>
<l>Here is an armed troop, the which by Greeks</l>
<l>Are called the Phrygian Curetes. Since</l>
<l>Haply among themselves they use to play</l>
<l>In games of arms and leap in measure round</l>
<l>With bloody mirth and by their nodding shake</l>
<l>The terrorizing crests upon their heads,</l>
<l>This is the armed troop that represents</l>
<l>The arm'd Dictaean Curetes, who, in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>,</l>
<l>As runs the story, whilom did out-drown</l>
<l>That infant cry of Zeus, what time their band,</l>

<l>To measured step beat with the brass on brass,</l>
<l>That Saturn might not get him for his jaws,</l>
<l>And give its mother an eternal wound</l>
<l>Along her heart. And 'tis on this account</l>
<l>That armed they escort the mighty Mother,</l>
<l>Or else because they signify by this</l>
<l>That she, the goddess, teaches men to be</l>
<l>Eager with armed valour to defend</l>
<l>Their motherland, and ready to stand forth,</l>
<l>The guard and glory of their parents' years.</l>
<l>A tale, however beautifully wrought,</l>
<l>That's wide of reason by a long remove:</l>

<l>Immortal aeons and supreme repose,</l>
<l>Withdrawn from our affairs, detached, afar:</l>
<l>Immune from peril and immune from pain,</l>
<l>Themselves abounding in riches of their own,</l>
<l>Needing not us, they are not touched by wrath</l>
<l>They are not taken by service or by gift.</l>
<l>Truly is earth insensate for all time;</l>
<l>But, by obtaining germs of many things,</l>
<l>In many a way she brings the many forth</l>
<l>Into the light of sun. And here, whoso</l>
<l>Decides to call the ocean Neptune, or</l>
<l>The grain-crop <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>, and prefers to abuse</l>

<l>So great in any sort of herb thou wilt,</l>
<l>So great again in any river of earth</l>
<l>Are the distinct diversities of matter.</l>
<l>Hence, further, every creature- any one</l>
<l>From out them all- compounded is the same</l>
<l>Of bones, blood, veins, heat, moisture, flesh, and thews-</l>
<l>All differing vastly in their forms, and built</l>

<l>To shoot the sparks and scatter embers wide.</l>
<l>If, with like reasoning of mind, all else</l>
<l>Thou traverse through, thou wilt discover thus</l>
<l>That in their frame the seeds of many things</l>
<l>They hide, and divers shapes of seeds contain.</l>
<l>Further, thou markest much, to which are given</l>

<l>Among which, chief, are most burnt offerings.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>

<l>A smell of scorching enters in our frame</l>
<l>Where the bright colour from the dye goes not;</l>
<l>And colour in one way, flavour in quite another</l>
<l>Works inward to our senses- so mayst see</l>
<l>They differ too in elemental shapes.</l>
<l>Thus unlike forms into one mass combine,</l>

<l>Limbs of a sea-beast to a land-beast knit,</l>
<l>And nature along the all-producing earth</l>
<l>Feeding those dire Chimaeras breathing flame</l>
<l>From hideous jaws- Of which 'tis simple fact</l>
<l>That none have been begot; because we see</l>
<l>All are from fixed seed and fixed dam</l>
<l>Engendered and so function as to keep</l>
<l>Throughout their growth their own ancestral type.</l>
<l>This happens surely by a fixed law:</l>
<l>For from all food-stuff, when once eaten down,</l>
<l>Go sundered atoms, suited to each creature,</l>
<l>Throughout their bodies, and, conjoining there,</l>
<l>Produce the proper motions; but we see</l>
<l>How, contrariwise, nature upon the ground</l>
<l>Throws off those foreign to their frame; and many</l>
<l>With viewless bodies from their bodies fly,</l>
<l>By blows impelled- those impotent to join</l>
<l>To any part, or, when inside, to accord</l>
<l>And to take on the vital motions there.</l>
<l>But think not, haply, living forms alone</l>
<l>Are bound by these laws: they distinguished all.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>For just as all things of creation are,</l>
<l>In their whole nature, each to each unlike,</l>
<l>So must their atoms be in shape unlike-</l>
<l>Not since few only are fashioned of like form,</l>
<l>But since they all, as general rule, are not</l>
<l>The same as all. Nay, here in these our verses,</l>
<l>Elements many, common to many words,</l>
<l>Thou seest, though yet 'tis needful to confess</l>
<l>The words and verses differ, each from each,</l>
<l>Compounded out of different elements-</l>
<l>Not since few only, as common letters, run</l>
<l>Through all the words, or no two words are made,</l>
<l>One and the other, from all like elements,</l>
<l>But since they all, as general rule, are not</l>
<l>The same as all. Thus, too, in other things,</l>
<l>Whilst many germs common to many things</l>
<l>There are, yet they, combined among themselves,</l>
<l>Can form new wholes to others quite unlike.</l>
<l>Thus fairly one may say that humankind,</l>
<l>The grains, the gladsome trees, are all made up</l>
<l>Of different atoms. Further, since the seeds</l>
<l>Are different, difference must there also be</l>
<l>In intervening spaces, thoroughfares,</l>
<l>Connections, weights, blows, clashings, motions, all</l>
<l>Which not alone distinguish living forms,</l>
<l>But sunder earth's whole ocean from the lands,</l>
<l>And hold all heaven from the lands away.</l>

<p>ABSENCE OF SECONDARY QUALITIES</p>

<l rend="indent">  Now come, this wisdom by my sweet toil sought</l>
<l>Look thou perceive, lest haply thou shouldst guess</l>
<l>That the white objects shining to thine eyes</l>
<l>Are gendered of white atoms, or the black</l>
<l>Of a black seed; or yet believe that aught</l>
<l>That's steeped in any hue should take its dye</l>
<l>From bits of matter tinct with hue the same.</l>
<l>For matter's bodies own no hue the least-</l>
<l>Or like to objects or, again, unlike.</l>
<l>But, if percase it seem to thee that mind</l>
<l>Itself can dart no influence of its own</l>
<l>Into these bodies, wide thou wand'rest off.</l>
<l>For since the blind-born, who have ne'er surveyed</l>
<l>The light of sun, yet recognise by touch</l>
<l>Things that from birth had ne'er a hue for them,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know that bodies can be brought</l>
<l>No less unto the ken of our minds too,</l>
<l>Though yet those bodies with no dye be smeared.</l>
<l>Again, ourselves whatever in the dark</l>
<l>We touch, the same we do not find to be</l>
<l>Tinctured with any colour.</l>
<l rend="indent">                          Now that here</l>
<l>I win the argument, I next will teach</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>Now, every colour changes, none except,</l>
<l>And every...</l>
<l>Which the primordials ought nowise to do.</l>
<l>Since an immutable somewhat must remain,</l>
<l>Lest all things utterly be brought to naught.</l>
<l>For change of anything from out its bounds</l>
<l>Means instant death of that which was before.</l>
<l>Wherefore be mindful not to stain with colour</l>
<l>The seeds of things, lest things return for thee</l>
<l>All utterly to naught.</l>
<l rend="indent">                         But now, if seeds</l>
<l>Receive no property of colour, and yet</l>
<l>Be still endowed with variable forms</l>
<l>From which all kinds of colours they beget</l>
<l>And vary (by reason that ever it matters much</l>
<l>With what seeds, and in what positions joined,</l>
<l>And what the motions that they give and get),</l>
<l>Forthwith most easily thou mayst devise</l>
<l>Why what was black of hue an hour ago</l>
<l>Can of a sudden like the marble gleam,-</l>
<l>As ocean, when the high winds have upheaved</l>
<l>Its level plains, is changed to hoary waves</l>
<l>Of marble whiteness: for, thou mayst declare,</l>
<l>That, when the thing we often see as black</l>
<l>Is in its matter then commixed anew,</l>
<l>Some atoms rearranged, and some withdrawn,</l>
<l>And added some, 'tis seen forthwith to turn</l>
<l>Glowing and white. But if of azure seeds</l>
<l>Consist the level waters of the deep,</l>
<l>They could in nowise whiten: for however</l>
<l>Thou shakest azure seeds, the same can never</l>
<l>Pass into marble hue. But, if the seeds-</l>
<l>Which thus produce the ocean's one pure sheen-</l>
<l>Be now with one hue, now another dyed,</l>
<l>As oft from alien forms and divers shapes</l>
<l>A cube's produced all uniform in shape,</l>
<l>'Twould be but natural, even as in the cube</l>
<l>We see the forms to be dissimilar,</l>
<l>That thus we'd see in brightness of the deep</l>
<l>(Or in whatever one pure sheen thou wilt)</l>
<l>Colours diverse and all dissimilar.</l>
<l>Besides, the unlike shapes don't thwart the least</l>
<l>The whole in being externally a cube;</l>
<l>But differing hues of things do block and keep</l>
<l>The whole from being of one resultant hue.</l>
<l>Then, too, the reason which entices us</l>
<l>At times to attribute colours to the seeds</l>
<l>Falls quite to pieces, since white things are not</l>
<l>Create from white things, nor are black from black,</l>
<l>But evermore they are create from things</l>
<l>Of divers colours. Verily, the white</l>
<l>Will rise more readily, is sooner born</l>
<l>Out of no colour, than of black or aught</l>
<l>Which stands in hostile opposition thus.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="795"/>
<l rend="indent">  Besides, since colours cannot be, sans light,</l>
<l>And the primordials come not forth to light,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know they are not clothed with colour-</l>
<l>Truly, what kind of colour could there be</l>
<l>In the viewless dark? Nay, in the light itself</l>
<l>A colour changes, gleaming variedly,</l>
<l>When smote by vertical or slanting ray.</l>
<l>Thus in the sunlight shows the down of doves</l>
<l>That circles, garlanding, the nape and throat:</l>
<l>Now it is ruddy with a bright gold-bronze,</l>
<l>Now, by a strange sensation it becomes</l>
<l>Green-emerald blended with the coral-red.</l>
<l>The peacock's tail, filled with the copious light,</l>
<l>Changes its colours likewise, when it turns.</l>
<l>Wherefore, since by some blow of light begot,</l>
<l>Without such blow these colours can't become.</l>
<l rend="indent">  And since the pupil of the eye receives</l>
<l>Within itself one kind of blow, when said</l>
<l>To feel a white hue, then another kind,</l>
<l>When feeling a black or any other hue,</l>
<l>And since it matters nothing with what hue</l>
<l>The things thou touchest be perchance endowed,</l>
<l>But rather with what sort of shape equipped,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know the atoms need not colour,</l>
<l>But render forth sensations, as of touch,</l>
<l>That vary with their varied forms.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="817"/>
<l rend="indent">                                   Besides,</l>
<l>Since special shapes have not a special colour,</l>
<l>And all formations of the primal germs</l>
<l>Can be of any sheen thou wilt, why, then,</l>
<l>Are not those objects which are of them made</l>
<l>Suffused, each kind with colours of every kind?</l>
<l>For then 'twere meet that ravens, as they fly,</l>
<l>Should dartle from white pinions a white sheen,</l>
<l>Or swans turn black from seed of black, or be</l>
<l>Of any single varied dye thou wilt.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Again, the more an object's rent to bits,</l>
<l>The more thou see its colour fade away</l>
<l>Little by little till 'tis quite extinct;</l>
<l>As happens when the gaudy linen's picked</l>
<l>Shred after shred away: the purple there,</l>
<l>Phoenician red, most brilliant of all dyes,</l>
<l>Is lost asunder, ravelled thread by thread;</l>
<l>Hence canst perceive the fragments die away</l>
<l>From out their colour, long ere they depart</l>
<l>Back to the old primordials of things.</l>
<l>And, last, since thou concedest not all bodies</l>
<l>Send out a voice or smell, it happens thus</l>
<l>That not to all thou givest sounds and smells.</l>
<l>So, too, since we behold not all with eyes,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know some things there are as much</l>
<l>Orphaned of colour, as others without smell,</l>
<l>And reft of sound; and those the mind alert</l>
<l>No less can apprehend than it can mark</l>
<l>The things that lack some other qualities.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="842"/>
<l rend="indent">  But think not haply that the primal bodies</l>
<l>Remain despoiled alone of colour: so,</l>
<l>Are they from warmth dissevered and from cold</l>
<l>And from hot exhalations; and they move,</l>
<l>Both sterile of sound and dry of juice; and throw</l>
<l>Not any odour from their proper bodies.</l>
<l>Just as, when undertaking to prepare</l>
<l>A liquid balm of myrrh and marjoram,</l>
<l>And flower of nard, which to our nostrils breathes</l>
<l>Odour of nectar, first of all behooves</l>
<l>Thou seek, as far as find thou may and can,</l>
<l>The inodorous olive-oil (which never sends</l>
<l>One whiff of scent to nostrils), that it may</l>
<l>The least debauch and ruin with sharp tang</l>
<l>The odorous essence with its body mixed</l>
<l>And in it seethed. And on the same account</l>
<l>The primal germs of things must not be thought</l>
<l>To furnish colour in begetting things,</l>
<l>Nor sound, since pow'rless they to send forth aught</l>
<l>From out themselves, nor any flavour, too,</l>
<l>Nor cold, nor exhalation hot or warm.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>The rest; yet since these things are mortal all-</l>
<l>The pliant mortal, with a body soft;</l>
<l>The brittle mortal, with a crumbling frame;</l>
<l>The hollow with a porous-all must be</l>
<l>Disjoined from the primal elements,</l>
<l>If still we wish under the world to lay</l>
<l>Immortal ground-works, whereupon may rest</l>
<l>The sum of weal and safety, lest for thee</l>
<l>All things return to nothing utterly.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Now, too: whate'er we see possessing sense</l>
<l>Must yet confessedly be stablished all</l>
<l>From elements insensate. And those signs,</l>
<l>So clear to all and witnessed out of hand,</l>
<l>Do not refute this dictum nor oppose;</l>
<l>But rather themselves do lead us by the hand,</l>
<l>Compelling belief that living things are born</l>
<l>Of elements insensate, as I say.</l>
<l>Sooth, we may see from out the stinking dung</l>
<l>Live worms spring up, when, after soaking rains,</l>
<l>The drenched earth rots; and all things change the same:</l>
<l>Lo, change the rivers, the fronds, the gladsome pastures</l>
<l>Into the cattle, the cattle their nature change</l>
<l>Into our bodies, and from our body, oft</l>
<l>Grow strong the powers and bodies of wild beasts</l>
<l>And mighty-winged birds. Thus nature changes</l>
<l>All foods to living frames, and procreates</l>
<l>From them the senses of live creatures all,</l>
<l>In manner about as she uncoils in flames</l>
<l>Dry logs of wood and turns them all to fire.</l>
<l>And seest not, therefore, how it matters much</l>
<l>After what order are set the primal germs,</l>
<l>And with what other germs they all are mixed,</l>
<l>And what the motions that they give and get?</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="886"/>
<l rend="indent">  But now, what is't that strikes thy sceptic mind,</l>
<l>Constraining thee to sundry arguments</l>
<l>Against belief that from insensate germs</l>
<l>The sensible is gendered?- Verily,</l>
<l>'Tis this: that liquids, earth, and wood, though mixed,</l>
<l>Are yet unable to gender vital sense.</l>
<l>And, therefore, 'twill be well in these affairs</l>
<l>This to remember: that I have not said</l>
<l>Senses are born, under conditions all,</l>
<l>From all things absolutely which create</l>
<l>Objects that feel; but much it matters here</l>
<l>Firstly, how small the seeds which thus compose</l>
<l>The feeling thing, then, with what shapes endowed,</l>
<l>And lastly what they in positions be,</l>
<l>In motions, in arrangements. Of which facts</l>
<l>Naught we perceive in logs of wood and clods;</l>
<l>And yet even these, when sodden by the rains,</l>
<l>Give birth to wormy grubs, because the bodies</l>
<l>Of matter, from their old arrangements stirred</l>
<l>By the new factor, then combine anew</l>
<l>In such a way as genders living things.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Next, they who deem that feeling objects can</l>
<l>From feeling objects be create, and these,</l>
<l>In turn, from others that are wont to feel</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>When soft they make them; for all sense is linked</l>
<l>With flesh, and thews, and veins- and such, we see,</l>
<l>Are fashioned soft and of a mortal frame.</l>
<l>Yet be't that these can last forever on:</l>
<l>They'll have the sense that's proper to a part,</l>
<l>Or else be judged to have a sense the same</l>
<l>As that within live creatures as a whole.</l>
<l>But of themselves those parts can never feel,</l>
<l>For all the sense in every member back</l>
<l>To something else refers- a severed hand,</l>
<l>Or any other member of our frame,</l>
<l>Itself alone cannot support sensation.</l>
<l>It thus remains they must resemble, then,</l>
<l>Live creatures as a whole, to have the power</l>
<l>Of feeling sensation concordant in each part</l>
<l>With the vital sense; and so they're bound to feel</l>
<l>The things we feel exactly as do we.</l>
<l>If such the case, how, then, can they be named</l>
<l>The primal germs of things, and how avoid</l>
<l>The highways of destruction?- since they be</l>
<l>Mere living things and living things be all</l>
<l>One and the same with mortal. Grant they could,</l>
<l>Yet by their meetings and their unions all,</l>
<l>Naught would result, indeed, besides a throng</l>
<l>And hurly-burly all of living things-</l>
<l>Precisely as men, and cattle, and wild beasts,</l>
<l>By mere conglomeration each with each</l>
<l>Can still beget not anything of new.</l>
<l>But if by chance they lose, inside a body,</l>
<l>Their own sense and another sense take on,</l>
<l>What, then, avails it to assign them that</l>
<l>Which is withdrawn thereafter? And besides,</l>
<l>To touch on proof that we pronounced before,</l>
<l>Just as we see the eggs of feathered fowls</l>
<l>To change to living chicks, and swarming worms</l>
<l>To bubble forth when from the soaking rains</l>
<l>The earth is sodden, sure, sensations all</l>
<l>Can out of non-sensations be begot.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="931"/>
<l rend="indent">  But if one say that sense can so far rise</l>
<l>From non-sense by mutation, or because</l>
<l>Brought forth as by a certain sort of birth,</l>
<l>'Twill serve to render plain to him and prove</l>
<l>There is no birth, unless there be before</l>
<l>Some formed union of the elements,</l>
<l>Nor any change, unless they be unite.</l>
<l rend="indent">  In first place, senses can't in body be</l>
<l>Before its living nature's been begot,-</l>
<l>Since all its stuff, in faith, is held dispersed</l>
<l>About through rivers, air, and earth, and all</l>
<l>That is from earth created, nor has met</l>
<l>In combination, and, in proper mode,</l>
<l>Conjoined into those vital motions which</l>
<l>Kindle the all-perceiving senses- they</l>
<l>That keep and guard each living thing soever.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Again, a blow beyond its nature's strength</l>
<l>Shatters forthwith each living thing soe'er,</l>
<l>And on it goes confounding all the sense</l>
<l>Of body and mind. For of the primal germs</l>
<l>Are loosed their old arrangements, and, throughout,</l>
<l>The vital motions blocked,- until the stuff,</l>
<l>Shaken profoundly through the frame entire,</l>
<l>Undoes the vital knots of soul from body</l>
<l>And throws that soul, to outward wide-dispersed,</l>
<l>Through all the pores. For what may we surmise</l>
<l>A blow inflicted can achieve besides</l>
<l>Shaking asunder and loosening all apart?</l>
<l>It happens also, when less sharp the blow,</l>
<l>The vital motions which are left are wont</l>
<l>Oft to win out- win out, and stop and still</l>
<l>The uncouth tumults gendered by the blow,</l>
<l>And call each part to its own courses back,</l>
<l>And shake away the motion of death which now</l>
<l>Begins its own dominion in the body,</l>
<l>And kindle anew the senses almost gone.</l>
<l>For by what other means could they the more</l>
<l>Collect their powers of thought and turn again</l>
<l>From very doorways of destruction</l>
<l>Back unto life, rather than pass whereto</l>
<l>They be already well-nigh sped and so</l>
<l>Pass quite away?</l>
<l rend="indent">                   Again, since pain is there</l>
<l>Where bodies of matter, by some force stirred up,</l>
<l>Through vitals and through joints, within their seats</l>
<l>Quiver and quake inside, but soft delight,</l>
<l>When they remove unto their place again:</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know the primal germs can be</l>
<l>Assaulted by no pain, nor from themselves</l>
<l>Take no delight; because indeed they are</l>
<l>Not made of any bodies of first things,</l>
<l>Under whose strange new motions they might ache</l>
<l>Or pluck the fruit of any dear new sweet.</l>
<l>And so they must be furnished with no sense.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="973"/>
<l rend="indent">  Once more, if thus, that every living thing</l>
<l>May have sensation, needful 'tis to assign</l>
<l>Sense also to its elements, what then</l>
<l>Of those fixed elements from which mankind</l>
<l>Hath been, by their peculiar virtue, formed?</l>
<l>Of verity, they'll laugh aloud, like men,</l>
<l>Shaken asunder by a spasm of mirth,</l>
<l>Or sprinkle with dewy tear-drops cheeks and chins,</l>
<l>And have the cunning hardihood to say</l>
<l>Much on the composition of the world,</l>
<l>And in their turn inquire what elements</l>
<l>They have themselves,- since, thus the same in kind</l>
<l>As a whole mortal creature, even they</l>
<l>Must also be from other elements,</l>
<l>And then those others from others evermore-</l>
<l>So that thou darest nowhere make a stop.</l>
<l>Oho, I'll follow thee until thou grant</l>
<l>The seed (which here thou say'st speaks, laughs, and thinks)</l>
<l>Is yet derived out of other seeds</l>
<l>Which in their turn are doing just the same.</l>

<l>And that a man may laugh, though not, forsooth,</l>
<l>Compounded out of laughing elements,</l>
<l>And think and utter reason with learn'd speech,</l>
<l>Though not himself compounded, for a fact,</l>
<l>Of sapient seeds and eloquent, why, then,</l>

<p> INFINITE WORLDS</p>

<l rend="indent">  Once more, we all from seed celestial spring,</l>

<l>The fostering mother, as she takes the drops</l>
<l>Of liquid moisture, pregnant bears her broods-</l>
<l>The shining grains, and gladsome shrubs and trees,</l>
<l>And bears the human race and of the wild</l>
<l>The generations all, the while she yields</l>
<l>The foods wherewith all feed their frames and lead</l>

<l>Wherefore she owneth that maternal name,</l>
<l>By old desert. What was before from earth,</l>
<l>The same in earth sinks back, and what was sent</l>
<l>From shores of ether, that, returning home,</l>
<l>The vaults of sky receive. Nor thus doth death</l>
<l>So far annihilate things that she destroys</l>
<l>The bodies of matter; but she dissipates</l>
<l>Their combinations, and conjoins anew</l>
<l>One element with others; and contrives</l>
<l>That all things vary forms and change their colours</l>
<l>And get sensations and straight give them o'er.</l>
<l>And thus may'st know it matters with what others</l>
<l>And in what structure the primordial germs</l>

<l>And straightway now a ruin, inheres at rest</l>
<l>Deep in the eternal atoms of the world.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Why, even in these our very verses here</l>

<l>The same, the grains, and trees, and living things.</l>
<l>And if not all alike, at least the most-</l>
<l>But what distinctions by positions wrought!</l>
<l>And thus no less in things themselves, when once</l>
<l>Around are changed the intervals between,</l>

<l>Together at random, without design, in vain-</l>
<l>And as at last those seeds together dwelt,</l>
<l>Which, when together of a sudden thrown,</l>
<l>Should alway furnish the commencements fit</l>
<l>Of mighty things- the earth, the sea, the sky,</l>
<l>And race of living creatures. Thus, I say,</l>
<l>Again, again, 'tmust be confessed there are</l>
<l>Such congregations of matter otherwhere,</l>
<l>Like this our world which vasty ether holds</l>
<l>In huge embrace.</l>
<l rend="indent">                   Besides, when matter abundant</l>
<l>Is ready there, when space on hand, nor object</l>
<l>Nor any cause retards, no marvel 'tis</l>
<l>That things are carried on and made complete,</l>
<l>Perforce. And now, if store of seeds there is</l>
<l>So great that not whole life-times of the living</l>
<l>Can count the tale...</l>
<l>And if their force and nature abide the same,</l>
<l>Able to throw the seeds of things together</l>
<l>Into their places, even as here are thrown</l>
<l>The seeds together in this world of ours,</l>
<l>'Tmust be confessed in other realms there are</l>
<l>Still other worlds, still other breeds of men,</l>
<l>And other generations of the wild.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Hence too it happens in the sum there is</l>
<l>No one thing single of its kind in birth,</l>
<l>And single and sole in growth, but rather it is</l>
<l>One member of some generated race,</l>
<l>Among full many others of like kind.</l>
<l>First, cast thy mind abroad upon the living:</l>
<l>Thou'lt find the race of mountain-ranging wild</l>
<l>Even thus to be, and thus the scions of men</l>
<l>To be begot, and lastly the mute flocks</l>
<l>Of scaled fish, and winged frames of birds.</l>
<l>Wherefore confess we must on grounds the same</l>
<l>That earth, sun, moon, and ocean, and all else,</l>
<l>Exist not sole and single- rather in number</l>
<l>Exceeding number. Since that deeply set</l>
<l>Old boundary stone of life remains for them</l>
<l>No less, and theirs a body of mortal birth</l>
<l>No less, than every kind which here on earth</l>
<l>Is so abundant in its members found.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Which well perceived if thou hold in mind,</l>
<l>Then Nature, delivered from every haughty lord,</l>
<l>And forthwith free, is seen to do all things</l>
<l>Herself and through herself of own accord,</l>
<l>Rid of all gods. For- by their holy hearts</l>
<l>Which pass in long tranquillity of peace</l>
<l>Untroubled ages and a serene life!-</l>
<l>Who hath the power (I ask), who hath the power</l>
<l>To rule the sum of the immeasurable,</l>
<l>To hold with steady hand the giant reins</l>
<l>Of the unfathomed deep? Who hath the power</l>
<l>At once to roll a multitude of skies,</l>
<l>At once to heat with fires ethereal all</l>
<l>The fruitful lands of multitudes of worlds,</l>
<l>To be at all times in all places near,</l>
<l>To stablish darkness by his clouds, to shake</l>
<l>The serene spaces of the sky with sound,</l>
<l>And hurl his lightnings,- ha, and whelm how oft</l>
<l>In ruins his own temples, and to rave,</l>
<l>Retiring to the wildernesses, there</l>
<l>At practice with that thunderbolt of his,</l>
<l>Which yet how often shoots the guilty by,</l>
<l>And slays the honourable blameless ones!</l>

<l rend="indent">  Ere since the birth-time of the world, ere since</l>
<l>The risen first-born day of sea, earth, sun,</l>

<l>Which the great All, the while it flung them on,</l>
<l>Brought hither, that from them the sea and lands</l>
<l>Could grow more big, and that the house of heaven</l>
<l>Might get more room and raise its lofty roofs</l>
<l>Far over earth, and air arise around.</l>
<l>For bodies all, from out all regions, are</l>
<l>Divided by blows, each to its proper thing,</l>
<l>And all retire to their own proper kinds:</l>
<l>The moist to moist retires; earth gets increase</l>
<l>From earthy body; and fires, as on a forge,</l>
<l>Beat out new fire; and ether forges ether;</l>
<l>Till nature, author and ender of the world,</l>
<l>Hath led all things to extreme bound of growth:</l>
<l>As haps when that which hath been poured inside</l>
<l>The vital veins of life is now no more</l>
<l>Than that which ebbs within them and runs off.</l>
<l>This is the point where life for each thing ends;</l>
<l>This is the point where nature with her powers</l>
<l>Curbs all increase. For whatsoe'er thou seest</l>
<l>Grow big with glad increase, and step by step</l>
<l>Climb upward to ripe age, these to themselves</l>
<l>Take in more bodies than they send from selves,</l>
<l>Whilst still the food is easily infused</l>
<l>Through all the veins, and whilst the things are not</l>
<l>So far expanded that they cast away</l>
<l>Such numerous atoms as to cause a waste</l>
<l>Greater than nutriment whereby they wax.</l>
<l>For 'tmust be granted, truly, that from things</l>
<l>Many a body ebbeth and runs off;</l>
<l>But yet still more must come, until the things</l>
<l>Have touched development's top pinnacle;</l>
<l>Then old age breaks their powers and ripe strength</l>

<l>For ever the ampler and more wide a thing,</l>
<l>As soon as ever its augmentation ends,</l>
<l>It scatters abroad forthwith to all sides round</l>
<l>More bodies, sending them from out itself.</l>
<l>Nor easily now is food disseminate</l>
<l>Through all its veins; nor is that food enough</l>
<l>To equal with a new supply on hand</l>
<l>Those plenteous exhalations it gives off.</l>
<l>Thus, fairly, all things perish, when with ebbing</l>
<l>They're made less dense and when from blows without</l>
<l>They are laid low; since food at last will fail</l>
<l>Extremest eld, and bodies from outside</l>

<l>O thee I follow, glory of the Greeks,</l>
<l>And set my footsteps squarely planted now</l>
<l>Even in the impress and the marks of thine-</l>
<l>Less like one eager to dispute the palm,</l>
<l>More as one craving out of very love</l>
<l>That I may copy thee!- for how should swallow</l>
<l>Contend with swans or what compare could be</l>
<l>In a race between young kids with tumbling legs</l>
<l>And the strong might of the horse? Our father thou,</l>
<l>And finder-out of truth, and thou to us</l>
<l>Suppliest a father's precepts; and from out</l>
<l>Those scriven leaves of thine, renowned soul</l>
<l>(Like bees that sip of all in flowery wolds),</l>
<l>We feed upon thy golden sayings all-</l>
<l>Golden, and ever worthiest endless life.</l>
<l>For soon as ever thy planning thought that sprang</l>
<l>From god-like mind begins its loud proclaim</l>
<l>Of nature's courses, terrors of the brain</l>
<l>Asunder flee, the ramparts of the world</l>
<l>Dispart away, and through the void entire</l>
<l>I see the movements of the universe.</l>
<l>Rises to vision the majesty of gods,</l>
<l>And their abodes of everlasting calm</l>
<l>Which neither wind may shake nor rain-cloud splash,</l>
<l>Nor snow, congealed by sharp frosts, may harm</l>
<l>With its white downfall: ever, unclouded sky</l>
<l>O'er roofs, and laughs with far-diffused light.</l>
<l>And nature gives to them their all, nor aught</l>
<l>May ever pluck their peace of mind away.</l>
<l>But nowhere to my vision rise no more</l>
<l>The vaults of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>, though the broad earth</l>
<l>Bars me no more from gazing down o'er all</l>
<l>Which under our feet is going on below</l>
<l>Along the void. O, here in these affairs</l>
<l>Some new divine delight and trembling awe</l>
<l>Takes hold through me, that thus by power of thine</l>
<l>Nature, so plain and manifest at last,</l>
<l>Hath been on every side laid bare to man!</l>
<l rend="indent">  And since I've taught already of what sort</l>
<l>The seeds of all things are, and how, distinct</l>
<l>In divers forms, they flit of own accord,</l>
<l>Stirred with a motion everlasting on,</l>
<l>And in what mode things be from them create,</l>
<l>Now, after such matters, should my verse, meseems,</l>
<l>Make clear the nature of the mind and soul,</l>
<l>And drive that dread of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> without,</l>
<l>Headlong, which so confounds our human life</l>
<l>Unto its deeps, pouring o'er all that is</l>
<l>The black of death, nor leaves not anything</l>
<l>To prosper- a liquid and unsullied joy.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="41"/>
<l>For as to what men sometimes will affirm:</l>
<l>That more than Tartarus (the realm of death)</l>
<l>They fear diseases and a life of shame,</l>
<l>And know the substance of the soul is blood,</l>
<l>Or rather wind (if haply thus their whim),</l>
<l>And so need naught of this our science, then</l>
<l>Thou well may'st note from what's to follow now</l>
<l>That more for glory do they braggart forth</l>
<l>Than for belief. For mark these very same:</l>
<l>Exiles from country, fugitives afar</l>
<l>From sight of men, with charges foul attaint,</l>
<l>Abased with every wretchedness, they yet</l>
<l>Live, and where'er the wretches come, they yet</l>
<l>Make the ancestral sacrifices there,</l>
<l>Butcher the black sheep, and to gods below</l>
<l>Offer the honours, and in bitter case</l>
<l>Turn much more keenly to religion.</l>
<l>Wherefore, it's surer testing of a man</l>
<l>In doubtful perils- mark him as he is</l>
<l>Amid adversities; for then alone</l>
<l>Are the true voices conjured from his breast,</l>
<l>The mask off-stripped, reality behind.</l>
<l>And greed, again, and the blind lust of honours</l>
<l>Which force poor wretches past the bounds of law,</l>
<l>And, oft allies and ministers of crime,</l>
<l>To push through nights and days with hugest toil</l>
<l>To rise untrammelled to the peaks of power-</l>
<l>These wounds of life in no mean part are kept</l>
<l>Festering and open by this fright of death.</l>
<l>For ever we see fierce Want and foul Disgrace</l>
<l>Dislodged afar from secure life and sweet,</l>
<l>Like huddling Shapes before the doors of death.</l>
<l>And whilst, from these, men wish to scape afar,</l>
<l>Driven by false terror, and afar remove,</l>
<l>With civic blood a fortune they amass,</l>
<l>They double their riches, greedy, heapers-up</l>
<l>Of corpse on corpse they have a cruel laugh</l>
<l>For the sad burial of a brother-born,</l>
<l>And hatred and fear of tables of their kin.</l>
<l>Likewise, through this same terror, envy oft</l>
<l>Makes them to peak because before their eyes</l>
<l>That man is lordly, that man gazed upon</l>
<l>Who walks begirt with honour glorious,</l>
<l>Whilst they in filth and darkness roll around;</l>
<l>Some perish away for statues and a name,</l>
<l>And oft to that degree, from fright of death,</l>
<l>Will hate of living and beholding light</l>
<l>Take hold on humankind that they inflict</l>
<l>Their own destruction with a gloomy heart-</l>
<l>Forgetful that this fear is font of cares,</l>
<l>This fear the plague upon their sense of shame,</l>
<l>And this that breaks the ties of comradry</l>
<l>And oversets all reverence and faith,</l>
<l>Mid direst slaughter. For long ere to-day</l>
<l>Often were traitors to country and dear parents</l>
<l>Through quest to shun the realms of <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>.</l>
<l>For just as children tremble and fear all</l>
<l>In the viewless dark, so even we at times</l>
<l>Dread in the light so many things that be</l>
<l>No whit more fearsome than what children feign,</l>
<l>Shuddering, will be upon them in the dark.</l>
<l>This terror, then, this darkness of the mind,</l>
<l>Not sunrise with its flaring spokes of light,</l>
<l>Nor glittering arrows of morning sun disperse,</l>
<l>But only nature's aspect and her law.</l>

<p> NATURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE MIND</p>

<l rend="indent">  First, then, I say, the mind which oft we call</l>
<l>The intellect, wherein is seated life's</l>
<l>Counsel and regimen, is part no less</l>
<l>Of man than hand and foot and eyes are parts</l>
<l>Of one whole breathing creature. [But some hold]</l>
<l>That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated,</l>
<l>But is of body some one vital state,-</l>
<l>Named "harmony" by Greeks, because thereby</l>
<l>We live with sense, though intellect be not</l>
<l>In any part: as oft the body is said</l>
<l>To have good health (when health, however, 's not</l>
<l>One part of him who has it), so they place</l>
<l>The sense of mind in no fixed part of man.</l>
<l>Mightily, diversly, meseems they err.</l>
<l>Often the body palpable and seen</l>
<l>Sickens, while yet in some invisible part</l>
<l>We feel a pleasure; oft the other way,</l>
<l>A miserable in mind feels pleasure still</l>
<l>Throughout his body- quite the same as when</l>
<l>A foot may pain without a pain in head.</l>
<l>Besides, when these our limbs are given o'er</l>
<l>To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame</l>
<l>At random void of sense, a something else</l>
<l>Is yet within us, which upon that time</l>
<l>Bestirs itself in many a wise, receiving</l>
<l>All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.</l>
<l>Now, for to see that in man's members dwells</l>
<l>Also the soul, and body ne'er is wont</l>
<l>To feel sensation by a "harmony"</l>
<l>Take this in chief: the fact that life remains</l>
<l>Oft in our limbs, when much of body's gone;</l>
<l>Yet that same life, when particles of heat,</l>
<l>Though few, have scattered been, and through the mouth</l>
<l>Air has been given forth abroad, forthwith</l>
<l>Forever deserts the veins, and leaves the bones.</l>
<l>Thus mayst thou know that not all particles</l>
<l>Perform like parts, nor in like manner all</l>
<l>Are props of weal and safety: rather those-</l>
<l>The seeds of wind and exhalations warm-</l>
<l>Take care that in our members life remains.</l>
<l>Therefore a vital heat and wind there is</l>
<l>Within the very body, which at death</l>
<l>Deserts our frames. And so, since nature of mind</l>
<l>And even of soul is found to be, as 'twere,</l>
<l>A part of man, give over "harmony"-</l>
<l>Name to musicians brought from Helicon,-</l>
<l>Unless themselves they filched it otherwise,</l>
<l>To serve for what was lacking name till then.</l>
<l>Whate'er it be, they're welcome to it- thou,</l>
<l>Hearken my other maxims.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="136"/>
<l rend="indent">                                Mind and soul,</l>
<l>I say, are held conjoined one with other,</l>
<l>And form one single nature of themselves;</l>
<l>But chief and regnant through the frame entire</l>
<l>Is still that counsel which we call the mind,</l>
<l>And that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.</l>
<l>Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts</l>
<l>Be blandishments of joys; and therefore here</l>
<l>The intellect, the mind. The rest of soul,</l>
<l>Throughout the body scattered, but obeys-</l>
<l>Moved by the nod and motion of the mind.</l>
<l>This, for itself, sole through itself, hath thought;</l>
<l>This for itself hath mirth, even when the thing</l>
<l>That moves it, moves nor soul nor body at all.</l>
<l>And as, when head or eye in us is smit</l>
<l>By assailing pain, we are not tortured then</l>
<l>Through all the body, so the mind alone</l>
<l>Is sometimes smitten, or livens with a joy,</l>
<l>Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs</l>
<l>And through the frame is stirred by nothing new.</l>
<l>But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce,</l>
<l>We mark the whole soul suffering all at once</l>
<l>Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread</l>
<l>Over the body, and the tongue is broken,</l>
<l>And fails the voice away, and ring the ears,</l>
<l>Mists blind the eyeballs, and the joints collapse,-</l>
<l>Aye, men drop dead from terror of the mind.</l>
<l>Hence, whoso will can readily remark</l>
<l>That soul conjoined is with mind, and, when</l>
<l>'Tis strook by influence of the mind, forthwith</l>
<l>In turn it hits and drives the body too.</l>
<l rend="indent">  And this same argument establisheth</l>
<l>That nature of mind and soul corporeal is:</l>
<l>For when 'tis seen to drive the members on,</l>
<l>To snatch from sleep the body, and to change</l>
<l>The countenance, and the whole state of man</l>
<l>To rule and turn,- what yet could never be</l>
<l>Sans contact, and sans body contact fails-</l>
<l>Must we not grant that mind and soul consist</l>
<l>Of a corporeal nature?- And besides</l>
<l>Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours</l>
<l>Suffers the mind and with our body feels.</l>
<l>If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones</l>
<l>And bares the inner thews hits not the life,</l>
<l>Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse,</l>
<l>And, on the ground, dazed tumult in the mind,</l>
<l>And whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.</l>
<l>So nature of mind must be corporeal, since</l>
<l>From stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Now, of what body, what components formed</l>
<l>Is this same mind I will go on to tell.</l>
<l>First, I aver, 'tis superfine, composed</l>
<l>Of tiniest particles- that such the fact</l>
<l>Thou canst perceive, if thou attend, from this:</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="182"/>
<l>Nothing is seen to happen with such speed</l>
<l>As what the mind proposes and begins;</l>
<l>Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly</l>
<l>Than aught whose nature's palpable to eyes.</l>
<l>But what's so agile must of seeds consist</l>
<l>Most round, most tiny, that they may be moved,</l>
<l>When hit by impulse slight. So water moves,</l>
<l>In waves along, at impulse just the least-</l>
<l>Being create of little shapes that roll;</l>
<l>But, contrariwise, the quality of honey</l>
<l>More stable is, its liquids more inert,</l>
<l>More tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter</l>
<l>Cleaves more together, since, indeed, 'tis made</l>
<l>Of atoms not so smooth, so fine, and round.</l>
<l>For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow</l>
<l>High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee</l>
<l>Downward from off the top; but, contrariwise,</l>
<l>A pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat</l>
<l>It can't at all. Thus, in so far as bodies</l>
<l>Are small and smooth, is their mobility;</l>
<l>But, contrariwise, the heavier and more rough,</l>
<l>The more immovable they prove. Now, then,</l>
<l>Since nature of mind is movable so much,</l>
<l>Consist it must of seeds exceeding small</l>
<l>And smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee,</l>
<l>Good friend, will serve thee opportune in else.</l>
<l>This also shows the nature of the same,</l>
<l>How nice its texture, in how small a space</l>
<l>'Twould go, if once compacted as a pellet:</l>
<l>When death's unvexed repose gets hold on man</l>
<l>And mind and soul retire, thou markest there</l>
<l>From the whole body nothing ta'en in form,</l>
<l>Nothing in weight. Death grants ye everything,</l>
<l>But vital sense and exhalation hot.</l>
<l>Thus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds,</l>
<l>Twined through the veins, the vitals, and the thews,</l>
<l>Seeing that, when 'tis from whole body gone,</l>
<l>The outward figuration of the limbs</l>
<l>Is unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.</l>
<l>Just so, when vanished the bouquet of wine,</l>
<l>Or when an unguent's perfume delicate</l>
<l>Into the winds away departs, or when</l>
<l>From any body savour's gone, yet still</l>
<l>The thing itself seems minished naught to eyes,</l>
<l>Thereby, nor aught abstracted from its weight-</l>
<l>No marvel, because seeds many and minute</l>
<l>Produce the savours and the redolence</l>
<l>In the whole body of the things.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="228"/>
<l rend="indent">And so,</l>
<l>Again, again, nature of mind and soul</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know created is of seeds</l>
<l>The tiniest ever, since at flying-forth</l>
<l>It beareth nothing of the weight away.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Yet fancy not its nature simple so.</l>
<l>For an impalpable aura, mixed with heat,</l>
<l>Deserts the dying, and heat draws off the air;</l>
<l>And heat there's none, unless commixed with air:</l>
<l>For, since the nature of all heat is rare,</l>
<l>Athrough it many seeds of air must move.</l>
<l>Thus nature of mind is triple; yet those all</l>
<l>Suffice not for creating sense- since mind</l>
<l>Accepteth not that aught of these can cause</l>
<l>Sense-bearing motions, and much less the thoughts</l>
<l>A man revolves in mind. So unto these</l>
<l>Must added be a somewhat, and a fourth;</l>
<l>That somewhat's altogether void of name;</l>
<l>Than which existeth naught more mobile, naught</l>
<l>More an impalpable, of elements</l>
<l>More small and smooth and round. That first transmits</l>
<l>Sense-bearing motions through the frame, for that</l>
<l>Is roused the first, composed of little shapes;</l>
<l>Thence heat and viewless force of wind take up</l>
<l>The motions, and thence air, and thence all things</l>
<l>Are put in motion; the blood is strook, and then</l>
<l>The vitals all begin to feel, and last</l>
<l>To bones and marrow the sensation comes-</l>
<l>Pleasure or torment. Nor will pain for naught</l>
<l>Enter so far, nor a sharp ill seep through,</l>
<l>But all things be perturbed to that degree</l>
<l>That room for life will fail, and parts of soul</l>
<l>Will scatter through the body's every pore.</l>
<l>Yet as a rule, almost upon the skin</l>
<l>These motion aIl are stopped, and this is why</l>
<l>We have the power to retain our life.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Now in my eagerness to tell thee how</l>
<l>They are commixed, through what unions fit</l>
<l>They function so, my country's pauper-speech</l>
<l>Constrains me sadly. As I can, however,</l>
<l>I'll touch some points and pass.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="262"/>
<l rend="indent">In such a wise</l>
<l>Course these primordials 'mongst one another</l>
<l>With inter-motions that no one can be</l>
<l>From other sundered, nor its agency</l>
<l>Perform, if once divided by a space;</l>
<l>Like many powers in one body they work.</l>
<l>As in the flesh of any creature still</l>
<l>Is odour and savour and a certain warmth,</l>
<l>And yet from all of these one bulk of body</l>
<l>Is made complete, so, viewless force of wind</l>
<l>And warmth and air, commingled, do create</l>
<l>One nature, by that mobile energy</l>
<l>Assisted which from out itself to them</l>
<l>Imparts initial motion, whereby first</l>
<l>Sense-bearing motion along the vitals springs.</l>
<l>For lurks this essence far and deep and under,</l>
<l>Nor in our body is aught more shut from view,</l>
<l>And 'tis the very soul of all the soul.</l>
<l>And as within our members and whole frame</l>
<l>The energy of mind and power of soul</l>
<l>Is mixed and latent, since create it is</l>
<l>Of bodies small and few, so lurks this fourth,</l>
<l>This essence void of name, composed of small,</l>
<l>And seems the very soul of all the soul,</l>
<l>And holds dominion o'er the body all.</l>
<l>And by like reason wind and air and heat</l>
<l>Must function so, commingled through the frame,</l>
<l>And now the one subside and now another</l>
<l>In interchange of dominance, that thus</l>
<l>From all of them one nature be produced,</l>
<l>Lest heat and wind apart, and air apart,</l>
<l>Make sense to perish, by disseverment.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="288"/>
<l>There is indeed in mind that heat it gets</l>
<l>When seething in rage, and flashes from the eyes</l>
<l>More swiftly fire; there is, again, that wind,</l>
<l>Much, and so cold, companion of all dread,</l>
<l>Which rouses the shudder in the shaken frame;</l>
<l>There is no less that state of air composed,</l>
<l>Making the tranquil breast, the serene face.</l>
<l>But more of hot have they whose restive hearts,</l>
<l>Whose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage-</l>
<l>Of which kind chief are fierce abounding lions,</l>
<l>Who often with roaring burst the breast o'erwrought,</l>
<l>Unable to hold the surging wrath within;</l>
<l>But the cold mind of stags has more of wind,</l>
<l>And speedier through their inwards rouses up</l>
<l>The icy currents which make their members quake.</l>
<l>But more the oxen live by tranquil air,</l>
<l>Nor e'er doth smoky torch of wrath applied,</l>
<l>O'erspreading with shadows of a darkling murk,</l>
<l>Rouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark,</l>
<l>Pierced through by icy javelins of fear;</l>
<l>But have their place half-way between the two-</l>
<l>Stags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:</l>
<l>Though training make them equally refined,</l>
<l>It leaves those pristine vestiges behind</l>
<l>Of each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose</l>
<l>Evil can e'er be rooted up so far</l>
<l>That one man's not more given to fits of wrath,</l>
<l>Another's not more quickly touched by fear,</l>
<l>A third not more long-suffering than he should.</l>
<l>And needs must differ in many things besides</l>
<l>The varied natures and resulting habits</l>
<l>Of humankind- of which not now can I</l>
<l>Expound the hidden causes, nor find names</l>
<l>Enough for all the divers shapes of those</l>
<l>Primordials whence this variation springs.</l>
<l>But this meseems I'm able to declare:</l>
<l>Those vestiges of natures left behind</l>
<l>Which reason cannot quite expel from us</l>
<l>Are still so slight that naught prevents a man</l>
<l>From living a life even worthy of the gods.</l>
<l rend="indent">  So then this soul is kept by all the body,</l>
<l>Itself the body's guard, and source of weal:</l>
<l>For they with common roots cleave each to each,</l>
<l>Nor can be torn asunder without death.</l>
<l>Not easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense</l>
<l>To tear their fragrance forth, without its nature</l>
<l>Perishing likewise: so, not easy 'tis</l>
<l>From all the body nature of mind and soul</l>
<l>To draw away, without the whole dissolved.</l>
<l>With seeds so intertwined even from birth,</l>
<l>They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life;</l>
<l>No energy of body or mind, apart,</l>
<l>Each of itself without the other's power,</l>
<l>Can have sensation; but our sense, enkindled</l>
<l>Along the vitals, to flame is blown by both</l>
<l>With mutual motions. Besides the body alone</l>
<l>Is nor begot nor grows, nor after death</l>
<l>Seen to endure. For not as water at times</l>
<l>Gives off the alien heat, nor is thereby</l>
<l>Itself destroyed, but unimpaired remains-</l>
<l>Not thus, I say, can the deserted frame</l>
<l>Bear the dissevering of its joined soul,</l>
<l>But, rent and ruined, moulders all away.</l>
<l>Thus the joint contact of the body and soul</l>
<l>Learns from their earliest age the vital motions,</l>
<l>Even when still buried in the mother's womb;</l>
<l>So no dissevering can hap to them,</l>
<l>Without their bane and ill. And thence mayst see</l>
<l>That, as conjoined is their source of weal,</l>
<l>Conjoined also must their nature be.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="350"/>
<l rend="indent">  If one, moreover, denies that body feel,</l>
<l>And holds that soul, through all the body mixed,</l>
<l>Takes on this motion which we title "sense,"</l>
<l>He battles in vain indubitable facts:</l>
<l>For who'll explain what body's feeling is,</l>
<l>Except by what the public fact itself</l>
<l>Has given and taught us? "But when soul is parted,</l>
<l>Body's without all sense." True!- loses what</l>
<l>Was even in its life-time not its own;</l>
<l>And much beside it loses, when soul's driven</l>
<l>Forth from that life-time. Or, to say that eyes</l>
<l>Themselves can see no thing, but through the same</l>
<l>The mind looks forth, as out of opened doors,</l>
<l>Is- a hard saying; since the feel in eyes</l>
<l>Says the reverse. For this itself draws on</l>
<l>And forces into the pupils of our eyes</l>
<l>Our consciousness. And note the case when often</l>
<l>We lack the power to see refulgent things,</l>
<l>Because our eyes are hampered by their light-</l>
<l>With a mere doorway this would happen not;</l>
<l>For, since it is our very selves that see,</l>
<l>No open portals undertake the toil.</l>
<l>Besides, if eyes of ours but act as doors,</l>
<l>Methinks that, were our sight removed, the mind</l>
<l>Ought then still better to behold a thing-</l>
<l>When even the door-posts have been cleared away.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Herein in these affairs nowise take up</l>
<l>What honoured sage, Democritus, lays down-</l>
<l>That proposition, that primordials</l>
<l>Of body and mind, each super-posed on each,</l>
<l>Vary alternately and interweave</l>
<l>The fabric of our members. For not only</l>
<l>Are the soul-elements smaller far than those</l>
<l>Which this our body and inward parts compose,</l>
<l>But also are they in their number less,</l>
<l>And scattered sparsely through our frame. And thus</l>
<l>This canst thou guarantee: soul's primal germs</l>
<l>Maintain between them intervals as large</l>
<l>At least as are the smallest bodies, which,</l>
<l>When thrown against us, in our body rouse</l>
<l>Sense-bearing motions.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="381"/>
<l rend="indent">Hence it comes that we</l>
<l>Sometimes don't feel alighting on our frames</l>
<l>The clinging dust, or chalk that settles soft;</l>
<l>Nor mists of night, nor spider's gossamer</l>
<l>We feel against us, when, upon our road,</l>
<l>Its net entangles us, nor on our head</l>
<l>The dropping of its withered garmentings;</l>
<l>Nor bird-feathers, nor vegetable down,</l>
<l>Flying about, so light they barely fall;</l>
<l>Nor feel the steps of every crawling thing,</l>
<l>Nor each of all those footprints on our skin</l>
<l>Of midges and the like. To that degree</l>
<l>Must many primal germs be stirred in us</l>
<l>Ere once the seeds of soul that through our frame</l>
<l>Are intermingled 'gin to feel that those</l>
<l>Primordials of the body have been strook,</l>
<l>And ere, in pounding with such gaps between,</l>
<l>They clash, combine and leap apart in turn.</l>
<l rend="indent">  But mind is more the keeper of the gates,</l>
<l>Hath more dominion over life than soul.</l>
<l>For without intellect and mind there's not</l>
<l>One part of soul can rest within our frame</l>
<l>Least part of time; companioning, it goes</l>
<l>With mind into the winds away, and leaves</l>
<l>The icy members in the cold of death.</l>
<l>But he whose mind and intellect abide</l>
<l>Himself abides in life. However much</l>
<l>The trunk be mangled, with the limbs lopped off,</l>
<l>The soul withdrawn and taken from the limbs,</l>
<l>Still lives the trunk and draws the vital air.</l>
<l>Even when deprived of all but all the soul,</l>
<l>Yet will it linger on and cleave to life,-</l>
<l>Just as the power of vision still is strong,</l>
<l>If but the pupil shall abide unharmed,</l>
<l>Even when the eye around it's sorely rent-</l>
<l>Provided only thou destroyest not</l>
<l>Wholly the ball, but, cutting round the pupil,</l>
<l>Leavest that pupil by itself behind-</l>
<l>For more would ruin sight. But if that centre,</l>
<l>That tiny part of eye, be eaten through,</l>
<l>Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes,</l>
<l>Though in all else the unblemished ball be clear.</l>
<l>'Tis by like compact that the soul and mind</l>
<l>Are each to other bound forevermore.</l>

<milestone unit="card" n="417"/>
<p>THE SOUL IS MORTAL</p>

<l rend="indent">  Now come: that thou mayst able be to know</l>
<l>That minds and the light souls of all that live</l>
<l>Have mortal birth and death, I will go on</l>
<l>Verses to build meet for thy rule of life,</l>
<l>Sought after long, discovered with sweet toil.</l>
<l>But under one name I'd have thee yoke them both;</l>
<l>And when, for instance, I shall speak of soul,</l>
<l>Teaching the same to be but mortal, think</l>
<l>Thereby I'm speaking also of the mind-</l>
<l>Since both are one, a substance inter-joined.</l>
<l>First, then, since I have taught how soul exists</l>
<l>A subtle fabric, of particles minute,</l>
<l>Made up from atoms smaller much than those</l>
<l>Of water's liquid damp, or fog, or smoke,</l>
<l>So in mobility it far excels,</l>
<l>More prone to move, though strook by lighter cause</l>
<l>Even moved by images of smoke or fog-</l>
<l>As where we view, when in our sleeps we're lulled,</l>
<l>The altars exhaling steam and smoke aloft-</l>
<l>For, beyond doubt, these apparitions come</l>
<l>To us from outward. Now, then, since thou seest,</l>
<l>Their liquids depart, their waters flow away,</l>
<l>When jars are shivered, and since fog and smoke</l>
<l>Depart into the winds away, believe</l>
<l>The soul no less is shed abroad and dies</l>
<l>More quickly far, more quickly is dissolved</l>
<l>Back to its primal bodies, when withdrawn</l>
<l>From out man's members it has gone away.</l>
<l>For, sure, if body (container of the same</l>
<l>Like as a jar), when shivered from some cause,</l>
<l>And rarefied by loss of blood from veins,</l>
<l>Cannot for longer hold the soul, how then</l>
<l>Thinkst thou it can be held by any air-</l>
<l>A stuff much rarer than our bodies be?</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="445"/>
<l rend="indent">  Besides we feel that mind to being comes</l>
<l>Along with body, with body grows and ages.</l>
<l>For just as children totter round about</l>
<l>With frames infirm and tender, so there follows</l>
<l>A weakling wisdom in their minds; and then,</l>
<l>Where years have ripened into robust powers,</l>
<l>Counsel is also greater, more increased</l>
<l>The power of mind; thereafter, where already</l>
<l>The body's shattered by master-powers of eld,</l>
<l>And fallen the frame with its enfeebled powers,</l>
<l>Thought hobbles, tongue wanders, and the mind gives way;</l>
<l>All fails, all's lacking at the selfsame time.</l>
<l>Therefore it suits that even the soul's dissolved,</l>
<l>Like smoke, into the lofty winds of air;</l>
<l>Since we behold the same to being come</l>
<l>Along with body and grow, and, as I've taught,</l>
<l>Crumble and crack, therewith outworn by eld.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Then, too, we see, that, just as body takes</l>
<l>Monstrous diseases and the dreadful pain,</l>
<l>So mind its bitter cares, the grief, the fear;</l>
<l>Wherefore it tallies that the mind no less</l>
<l>Partaker is of death; for pain and disease</l>
<l>Are both artificers of death,- as well</l>
<l>We've learned by the passing of many a man ere now.</l>
<l>Nay, too, in diseases of body, often the mind</l>
<l>Wanders afield; for 'tis beside itself,</l>
<l>And crazed it speaks, or many a time it sinks,</l>
<l>With eyelids closing and a drooping nod,</l>
<l>In heavy drowse, on to eternal sleep;</l>
<l>From whence nor hears it any voices more,</l>
<l>Nor able is to know the faces here</l>
<l>Of those about him standing with wet cheeks</l>
<l>Who vainly call him back to light and life.</l>
<l>Wherefore mind too, confess we must, dissolves,</l>
<l>Seeing, indeed, contagions of disease</l>
<l>Enter into the same. Again, O why,</l>
<l>When the strong wine has entered into man,</l>
<l>And its diffused fire gone round the veins,</l>
<l>Why follows then a heaviness of limbs,</l>
<l>A tangle of the legs as round he reels,</l>
<l>A stuttering tongue, an intellect besoaked,</l>
<l>Eyes all aswim, and hiccups, shouts, and brawls,</l>
<l>And whatso else is of that ilk?- Why this?-</l>
<l>If not that violent and impetuous wine</l>
<l>Is wont to confound the soul within the body?</l>
<l>But whatso can confounded be and balked,</l>
<l>Gives proof, that if a hardier cause got in,</l>
<l>'Twould hap that it would perish then, bereaved</l>
<l>Of any life thereafter.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="487"/>
<l rend="indent">And, moreover,</l>
<l>Often will some one in a sudden fit,</l>
<l>As if by stroke of lightning, tumble down</l>
<l>Before our eyes, and sputter foam, and grunt,</l>
<l>Blither, and twist about with sinews taut,</l>
<l>Gasp up in starts, and weary out his limbs</l>
<l>With tossing round. No marvel, since distract</l>
<l>Through frame by violence of disease.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>Confounds, he foams, as if to vomit soul,</l>
<l>As on the salt sea boil the billows round</l>
<l>Under the master might of winds. And now</l>
<l>A groan's forced out, because his limbs are griped,</l>
<l>But, in the main, because the seeds of voice</l>
<l>Are driven forth and carried in a mass</l>
<l>Outwards by mouth, where they are wont to go,</l>
<l>And have a builded highway. He becomes</l>
<l>Mere fool, since energy of mind and soul</l>
<l>Confounded is, and, as I've shown, to-riven,</l>
<l>Asunder thrown, and torn to pieces all</l>
<l>By the same venom. But, again, where cause</l>
<l>Of that disease has faced about, and back</l>
<l>Retreats sharp poison of corrupted frame</l>
<l>Into its shadowy lairs, the man at first</l>
<l>Arises reeling, and gradually comes back</l>
<l>To all his senses and recovers soul.</l>
<l>Thus, since within the body itself of man</l>
<l>The mind and soul are by such great diseases</l>
<l>Shaken, so miserably in labour distraught,</l>
<l>Why, then, believe that in the open air,</l>
<l>Without a body, they can pass their life,</l>
<l>Immortal, battling with the master winds?</l>
<l>And, since we mark the mind itself is cured,</l>
<l>Like the sick body, and restored can be</l>
<l>By medicine, this is forewarning too</l>
<l>That mortal lives the mind. For proper it is</l>
<l>That whosoe'er begins and undertakes</l>
<l>To alter the mind, or meditates to change</l>
<l>Any another nature soever, should add</l>
<l>New parts, or readjust the order given,</l>
<l>Or from the sum remove at least a bit.</l>
<l>But what's immortal willeth for itself</l>
<l>Its parts be nor increased, nor rearranged,</l>
<l>Nor any bit soever flow away:</l>
<l>For change of anything from out its bounds</l>
<l>Means instant death of that which was before.</l>
<l>Ergo, the mind, whether in sickness fallen,</l>
<l>Or by the medicine restored, gives signs,</l>
<l>As I have taught, of its mortality.</l>
<l>So surely will a fact of truth make head</l>
<l>'Gainst errors' theories all, and so shut off</l>
<l>All refuge from the adversary, and rout</l>
<l>Error by two-edged confutation.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="548"/>
<l rend="indent">  And since the mind is of a man one part,</l>
<l>Which in one fixed place remains, like ears,</l>
<l>And eyes, and every sense which pilots life;</l>
<l>And just as hand, or eye, or nose, apart,</l>
<l>Severed from us, can neither feel nor be,</l>
<l>But in the least of time is left to rot,</l>
<l>Thus mind alone can never be, without</l>
<l>The body and the man himself, which seems,</l>
<l>As 'twere the vessel of the same- or aught</l>
<l>Whate'er thou'lt feign as yet more closely joined:</l>
<l>Since body cleaves to mind by surest bonds.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Again, the body's and the mind's live powers</l>
<l>Only in union prosper and enjoy;</l>
<l>For neither can nature of mind, alone of self</l>
<l>Sans body, give the vital motions forth;</l>
<l>Nor, then, can body, wanting soul, endure</l>
<l>And use the senses. Verily, as the eye,</l>
<l>Alone, up-rended from its roots, apart</l>
<l>From all the body, can peer about at naught,</l>
<l>So soul and mind it seems are nothing able,</l>
<l>When by themselves. No marvel, because, commixed</l>
<l>Through veins and inwards, and through bones and thews,</l>
<l>Their elements primordial are confined</l>
<l>By all the body, and own no power free</l>
<l>To bound around through interspaces big,</l>
<l>Thus, shut within these confines, they take on</l>
<l>Motions of sense, which, after death, thrown out</l>
<l>Beyond the body to the winds of air,</l>
<l>Take on they cannot- and on this account,</l>
<l>Because no more in such a way confined.</l>
<l>For air will be a body, be alive,</l>
<l>If in that air the soul can keep itself,</l>
<l>And in that air enclose those motions all</l>
<l>Which in the thews and in the body itself</l>
<l>A while ago 'twas making. So for this,</l>
<l>Again, again, I say confess we must,</l>
<l>That, when the body's wrappings are unwound,</l>
<l>And when the vital breath is forced without,</l>
<l>The soul, the senses of the mind dissolve,-</l>
<l>Since for the twain the cause and ground of life</l>
<l>Is in the fact of their conjoined estate.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Once more, since body's unable to sustain</l>
<l>Division from the soul, without decay</l>
<l>And obscene stench, how canst thou doubt but that</l>
<l>The soul, uprisen from the body's deeps,</l>
<l>Has filtered away, wide-drifted like a smoke,</l>
<l>Or that the changed body crumbling fell</l>
<l>With ruin so entire, because, indeed,</l>
<l>Its deep foundations have been moved from place,</l>
<l>The soul out-filtering even through the frame,</l>
<l>And through the body's every winding way</l>
<l>And orifice? And so by many means</l>
<l>Thou'rt free to learn that nature of the soul</l>
<l>Hath passed in fragments out along the frame,</l>
<l>And that 'twas shivered in the very body</l>
<l>Ere ever it slipped abroad and swam away</l>
<l>Into the winds of air.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="592"/>
<l rend="indent">For never a man</l>
<l>Dying appears to feel the soul go forth</l>
<l>As one sure whole from all his body at once,</l>
<l>Nor first come up the throat and into mouth;</l>
<l>But feels it failing in a certain spot,</l>
<l>Even as he knows the senses too dissolve</l>
<l>Each in its own location in the frame.</l>
<l>But were this mind of ours immortal mind,</l>
<l>Dying 'twould scarce bewail a dissolution,</l>
<l>But rather the going, the leaving of its coat,</l>
<l>Like to a snake. Wherefore, when once the body</l>
<l>Hath passed away, admit we must that soul,</l>
<l>Shivered in all that body, perished too.</l>
<l>Nay, even when moving in the bounds of life,</l>
<l>Often the soul, now tottering from some cause,</l>
<l>Craves to go out, and from the frame entire</l>
<l>Loosened to be; the countenance becomes</l>
<l>Flaccid, as if the supreme hour were there;</l>
<l>And flabbily collapse the members all</l>
<l>Against the bloodless trunk- the kind of case</l>
<l>We see when we remark in common phrase,</l>
<l>"That man's quite gone," or "fainted dead away";</l>
<l>And where there's now a bustle of alarm,</l>
<l>And all are eager to get some hold upon</l>
<l>The man's last link of life. For then the mind</l>
<l>And all the power of soul are shook so sore,</l>
<l>And these so totter along with all the frame,</l>
<l>That any cause a little stronger might</l>
<l>Dissolve them altogether.- Why, then, doubt</l>
<l>That soul, when once without the body thrust,</l>
<l>There in the open, an enfeebled thing,</l>
<l>Its wrappings stripped away, cannot endure</l>
<l>Not only through no everlasting age,</l>
<l>But even, indeed, through not the least of time?</l>
<l rend="indent">  Then, too, why never is the intellect,</l>
<l>The counselling mind, begotten in the head,</l>
<l>The feet, the hands, instead of cleaving still</l>
<l>To one sole seat, to one fixed haunt, the breast,</l>
<l>If not that fixed places be assigned</l>
<l>For each thing's birth, where each, when 'tis create,</l>
<l>Is able to endure, and that our frames</l>
<l>Have such complex adjustments that no shift</l>
<l>In order of our members may appear?</l>
<l>To that degree effect succeeds to cause,</l>
<l>Nor is the flame once wont to be create</l>
<l>In flowing streams, nor cold begot in fire.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="624"/>
<l rend="indent">  Besides, if nature of soul immortal be,</l>
<l>And able to feel, when from our frame disjoined,</l>
<l>The same, I fancy, must be thought to be</l>
<l>Endowed with senses five,- nor is there way</l>
<l>But this whereby to image to ourselves</l>
<l>How under-souls may roam in <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>.</l>
<l>Thus painters and the elder race of bards</l>
<l>Have pictured souls with senses so endowed.</l>
<l>But neither eyes, nor nose, nor hand, alone</l>
<l>Apart from body can exist for soul,</l>
<l>Nor tongue nor ears apart. And hence indeed</l>
<l>Alone by self they can nor feel nor be.</l>
<l rend="indent">  And since we mark the vital sense to be</l>
<l>In the whole body, all one living thing,</l>
<l>If of a sudden a force with rapid stroke</l>
<l>Should slice it down the middle and cleave in twain,</l>
<l>Beyond a doubt likewise the soul itself,</l>
<l>Divided, dissevered, asunder will be flung</l>
<l>Along with body. But what severed is</l>
<l>And into sundry parts divides, indeed</l>
<l>Admits it owns no everlasting nature.</l>
<l>We hear how chariots of war, areek</l>
<l>With hurly slaughter, lop with flashing scythes</l>
<l>The limbs away so suddenly that there,</l>
<l>Fallen from the trunk, they quiver on the earth,</l>
<l>The while the mind and powers of the man</l>
<l>Can feel no pain, for swiftness of his hurt,</l>
<l>And sheer abandon in the zest of battle:</l>
<l>With the remainder of his frame he seeks</l>
<l>Anew the battle and the slaughter, nor marks</l>
<l>How the swift wheels and scythes of ravin have dragged</l>
<l>Off with the horses his left arm and shield;</l>
<l>Nor other how his right has dropped away,</l>
<l>Mounting again and on. A third attempts</l>
<l>With leg dismembered to arise and stand,</l>
<l>Whilst, on the ground hard by, the dying foot</l>
<l>Twitches its spreading toes. And even the head,</l>
<l>When from the warm and living trunk lopped off,</l>
<l>Keeps on the ground the vital countenance</l>
<l>And open eyes, until 't has rendered up</l>
<l>All remnants of the soul. Nay, once again:</l>
<l>If, when a serpent's darting forth its tongue,</l>
<l>And lashing its tail, thou gettest chance to hew</l>
<l>With axe its length of trunk to many parts,</l>
<l>Thou'lt see each severed fragment writhing round</l>
<l>With its fresh wound, and spattering up the sod,</l>
<l>And there the fore-part seeking with the jaws</l>
<l>After the hinder, with bite to stop the pain.</l>
<l>So shall we say that these be souls entire</l>
<l>In all those fractions?- but from that 'twould follow</l>
<l>One creature'd have in body many souls.</l>
<l>Therefore, the soul, which was indeed but one,</l>
<l>Has been divided with the body too:</l>
<l>Each is but mortal, since alike is each</l>
<l>Hewn into many parts. Again, how often</l>
<l>We view our fellow going by degrees,</l>
<l>And losing limb by limb the vital sense;</l>
<l>First nails and fingers of the feet turn blue,</l>
<l>Next die the feet and legs, then o'er the rest</l>
<l>Slow crawl the certain footsteps of cold death.</l>
<l>And since this nature of the soul is torn,</l>
<l>Nor mounts away, as at one time, entire,</l>
<l>We needs must hold it mortal. But perchance</l>
<l>If thou supposest that the soul itself</l>
<l>Can inward draw along the frame, and bring</l>
<l>Its parts together to one place, and so</l>
<l>From all the members draw the sense away,</l>
<l>Why, then, that place in which such stock of soul</l>
<l>Collected is, should greater seem in sense.</l>
<l>But since such place is nowhere, for a fact,</l>
<l>As said before, 'tis rent and scattered forth,</l>
<l>And so goes under. Or again, if now</l>
<l>I please to grant the false, and say that soul</l>
<l>Can thus be lumped within the frames of those</l>
<l>Who leave the sunshine, dying bit by bit,</l>
<l>Still must the soul as mortal be confessed;</l>
<l>Nor aught it matters whether to wrack it go,</l>
<l>Dispersed in the winds, or, gathered in a mass</l>
<l>From all its parts, sink down to brutish death,</l>
<l>Since more and more in every region sense</l>
<l>Fails the whole man, and less and less of life</l>
<l>In every region lingers.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="670"/>
<l rend="indent">                         And besides,</l>
<l>If soul immortal is, and winds its way</l>
<l>Into the body at the birth of man,</l>
<l>Why can we not remember something, then,</l>
<l>Of life-time spent before? why keep we not</l>
<l>Some footprints of the things we did of, old?</l>
<l>But if so changed hath been the power of mind,</l>
<l>That every recollection of things done</l>
<l>Is fallen away, at no o'erlong remove</l>
<l>Is that, I trow, from what we mean by death.</l>
<l>Wherefore 'tis sure that what hath been before</l>
<l>Hath died, and what now is is now create.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Moreover, if after the body hath been built</l>
<l>Our mind's live powers are wont to be put in,</l>
<l>Just at the moment that we come to birth,</l>
<l>And cross the sills of life, 'twould scarcely fit</l>
<l>For them to live as if they seemed to grow</l>
<l>Along with limbs and frame, even in the blood,</l>
<l>But rather as in a cavern all alone.</l>
<l>(Yet all the body duly throngs with sense.)</l>
<l>But public fact declares against all this:</l>
<l>For soul is so entwined through the veins,</l>
<l>The flesh, the thews, the bones, that even the teeth</l>
<l>Share in sensation, as proven by dull ache,</l>
<l>By twinge from icy water, or grating crunch</l>
<l>Upon a stone that got in mouth with bread.</l>
<l>Wherefore, again, again, souls must be thought</l>
<l>Nor void of birth, nor free from law of death;</l>
<l>Nor, if, from outward, in they wound their way,</l>
<l>Could they be thought as able so to cleave</l>
<l>To these our frames, nor, since so interwove,</l>
<l>Appears it that they're able to go forth</l>
<l>Unhurt and whole and loose themselves unscathed</l>
<l>From all the thews, articulations, bones.</l>
<l>But, if perchance thou thinkest that the soul,</l>
<l>From outward winding in its way, is wont</l>
<l>To seep and soak along these members ours,</l>
<l>Then all the more 'twill perish, being thus</l>
<l>With body fused- for what will seep and soak</l>
<l>Will be dissolved and will therefore die.</l>
<l>For just as food, dispersed through all the pores</l>
<l>Of body, and passed through limbs and all the frame,</l>
<l>Perishes, supplying from itself the stuff</l>
<l>For other nature, thus the soul and mind,</l>
<l>Though whole and new into a body going,</l>
<l>Are yet, by seeping in, dissolved away,</l>
<l>Whilst, as through pores, to all the frame there pass</l>
<l>Those particles from which created is</l>
<l>This nature of mind, now ruler of our body,</l>
<l>Born from that soul which perished, when divided</l>
<l>Along the frame.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="711"/>
<l rend="indent">Wherefore it seems that soul</l>
<l>Hath both a natal and funeral hour.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Besides are seeds of soul there left behind</l>
<l>In the breathless body, or not? If there they are,</l>
<l>It cannot justly be immortal deemed,</l>
<l>Since, shorn of some parts lost, 'thas gone away:</l>
<l>But if, borne off with members uncorrupt,</l>
<l>'Thas fled so absolutely all away</l>
<l>It leaves not one remainder of itself</l>
<l>Behind in body, whence do cadavers, then,</l>
<l>From out their putrid flesh exhale the worms,</l>
<l>And whence does such a mass of living things,</l>
<l>Boneless and bloodless, o'er the bloated frame</l>
<l>Bubble and swarm? But if perchance thou thinkest</l>
<l>That souls from outward into worms can wind,</l>
<l>And each into a separate body come,</l>
<l>And reckonest not why many thousand souls</l>
<l>Collect where only one has gone away,</l>
<l>Here is a point, in sooth, that seems to need</l>
<l>Inquiry and a putting to the test:</l>
<l>Whether the souls go on a hunt for seeds</l>
<l>Of worms wherewith to build their dwelling places,</l>
<l>Or enter bodies ready-made, as 'twere.</l>
<l>But why themselves they thus should do and toil</l>
<l>'Tis hard to say, since, being free of body,</l>
<l>They flit around, harassed by no disease,</l>
<l>Nor cold nor famine; for the body labours</l>
<l>By more of kinship to these flaws of life,</l>
<l>And mind by contact with that body suffers</l>
<l>So many ills. But grant it be for them</l>
<l>However useful to construct a body</l>
<l>To which to enter in, 'tis plain they can't.</l>
<l>Then, souls for self no frames nor bodies make,</l>
<l>Nor is there how they once might enter in</l>
<l>To bodies ready-made- for they cannot</l>
<l>Be nicely interwoven with the same,</l>
<l>And there'll be formed no interplay of sense</l>
<l>Common to each.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="741"/>
<l rend="indent">                   Again, why is't there goes</l>
<l>Impetuous rage with lion's breed morose,</l>
<l>And cunning with foxes, and to deer why given</l>
<l>The ancestral fear and tendency to flee,</l>
<l>And why in short do all the rest of traits</l>
<l>Engender from the very start of life</l>
<l>In the members and mentality, if not</l>
<l>Because one certain power of mind that came</l>
<l>From its own seed and breed waxes the same</l>
<l>Along with all the body? But were mind</l>
<l>Immortal, were it wont to change its bodies,</l>
<l>How topsy-turvy would earth's creatures act!</l>
<l>The Hyrcan hound would flee the onset oft</l>
<l>Of antlered stag, the scurrying hawk would quake</l>
<l>Along the winds of air at the coming dove,</l>
<l>And men would dote, and savage beasts be wise;</l>
<l>For false the reasoning of those that say</l>
<l>Immortal mind is changed by change of body-</l>
<l>For what is changed dissolves, and therefore dies.</l>
<l>For parts are re-disposed and leave their order;</l>
<l>Wherefore they must be also capable</l>
<l>Of dissolution through the frame at last,</l>
<l>That they along with body perish all.</l>
<l>But should some say that always souls of men</l>
<l>Go into human bodies, I will ask:</l>
<l>How can a wise become a dullard soul?</l>
<l>And why is never a child's a prudent soul?</l>
<l>And the mare's filly why not trained so well</l>
<l>As sturdy strength of steed? We may be sure</l>
<l>They'll take their refuge in the thought that mind</l>
<l>Becomes a weakling in a weakling frame.</l>
<l>Yet be this so, 'tis needful to confess</l>
<l>The soul but mortal, since, so altered now</l>
<l>Throughout the frame, it loses the life and sense</l>
<l>It had before. Or how can mind wax strong</l>
<l>Coequally with body and attain</l>
<l>The craved flower of life, unless it be</l>
<l>The body's colleague in its origins?</l>
<l>Or what's the purport of its going forth</l>
<l>From aged limbs?- fears it, perhaps, to stay,</l>
<l>Pent in a crumbled body? Or lest its house,</l>
<l>Outworn by venerable length of days,</l>
<l>May topple down upon it? But indeed</l>
<l>For an immortal perils are there none.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="776"/>
<l rend="indent">  Again, at parturitions of the wild</l>
<l>And at the rites of Love, that souls should stand</l>
<l>Ready hard by seems ludicrous enough-</l>
<l>Immortals waiting for their mortal limbs</l>
<l>In numbers innumerable, contending madly</l>
<l>Which shall be first and chief to enter in!-</l>
<l>Unless perchance among the souls there be</l>
<l>Such treaties stablished that the first to come</l>
<l>Flying along, shall enter in the first,</l>
<l>And that they make no rivalries of strength!</l>
<l rend="indent">  Again, in ether can't exist a tree,</l>
<l>Nor clouds in ocean deeps, nor in the fields</l>
<l>Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,</l>
<l>Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged</l>
<l>Where everything may grow and have its place.</l>
<l>Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone</l>
<l>Without the body, nor exist afar</l>
<l>From thews and blood. But if 'twere possible,</l>
<l>Much rather might this very power of mind</l>
<l>Be in the head, the shoulders or the heels,</l>
<l>And, born in any part soever, yet</l>
<l>In the same man, in the same vessel abide.</l>
<l>But since within this body even of ours</l>
<l>Stands fixed and appears arranged sure</l>
<l>Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,</l>
<l>Deny we must the more that they can have</l>
<l>Duration and birth, wholly outside the frame.</l>
<l>For, verily, the mortal to conjoin</l>
<l>With the eternal, and to feign they feel</l>
<l>Together, and can function each with each,</l>
<l>Is but to dote: for what can be conceived</l>
<l>Of more unlike, discrepant, ill-assorted,</l>
<l>Than something mortal in a union joined</l>
<l>With an immortal and a secular</l>
<l>To bear the outrageous tempests?</l>
<l rend="indent">                            Then, again,</l>
<l>Whatever abides eternal must indeed</l>
<l>Either repel all strokes, because 'tis made</l>
<l>Of solid body, and permit no entrance</l>
<l>Of aught with power to sunder from within</l>
<l>The parts compact- as are those seeds of stuff</l>
<l>Whose nature we've exhibited before;</l>
<l>Or else be able to endure through time</l>
<l>For this: because they are from blows exempt,</l>
<l>As is the void, the which abides untouched,</l>
<l>Unsmit by any stroke; or else because</l>
<l>There is no room around, whereto things can,</l>
<l>As 'twere, depart in dissolution all,-</l>
<l>Even as the sum of sums eternal is,</l>
<l>Without or place beyond whereto things may</l>
<l>Asunder fly, or bodies which can smite,</l>
<l>And thus dissolve them by the blows of might.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="819"/>
<l rend="indent">  But if perchance the soul's to be adjudged</l>
<l>Immortal, mainly on ground 'tis kept secure</l>
<l>In vital forces- either because there come</l>
<l>Never at all things hostile to its weal,</l>
<l>Or else because what come somehow retire,</l>
<l>Repelled or ere we feel the harm they work,</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>

<l>That which torments it with the things to be,</l>
<l>Keeps it in dread, and wearies it with cares;</l>
<l>And even when evil acts are of the past,</l>
<l>Still gnaw the old transgressions bitterly.</l>
<l>Add, too, that frenzy, peculiar to the mind,</l>
<l>And that oblivion of the things that were;</l>
<l>Add its submergence in the murky waves</l>
<l>Of drowse and torpor.</l>

<p>FOLLY OF THE FEAR OF DEATH</p>

<l rend="indent">                        Therefore death to us</l>
<l>Is nothing, nor concerns us in the least,</l>
<l>Since nature of mind is mortal evermore.</l>
<l>And just as in the ages gone before</l>
<l>We felt no touch of ill, when all sides round</l>
<l>To battle came the Carthaginian host,</l>
<l>And the times, shaken by tumultuous war,</l>
<l>Under the aery coasts of arching heaven</l>
<l>Shuddered and trembled, and all humankind</l>
<l>Doubted to which the empery should fall</l>
<l>By land and sea, thus when we are no more,</l>
<l>When comes that sundering of our body and soul</l>
<l>Through which we're fashioned to a single state,</l>
<l>Verily naught to us, us then no more,</l>
<l>Can come to pass, naught move our senses then-</l>
<l>No, not if earth confounded were with sea,</l>
<l>And sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel</l>
<l>The nature of mind and energy of soul,</l>
<l>After their severance from this body of ours,</l>
<l>Yet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds</l>
<l>And wedlock of the soul and body live,</l>
<l>Through which we're fashioned to a single state.</l>
<l>And, even if time collected after death</l>
<l>The matter of our frames and set it all</l>
<l>Again in place as now, and if again</l>
<l>To us the light of life were given, O yet</l>
<l>That process too would not concern us aught,</l>
<l>When once the self-succession of our sense</l>
<l>Has been asunder broken. And now and here,</l>
<l>Little enough we're busied with the selves</l>
<l>We were aforetime, nor, concerning them,</l>
<l>Suffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze</l>
<l>Backwards across all yesterdays of time</l>
<l>The immeasurable, thinking how manifold</l>
<l>The motions of matter are, then couldst thou well</l>
<l>Credit this too: often these very seeds</l>
<l>(From which we are to-day) of old were set</l>
<l>In the same order as they are to-day-</l>
<l>Yet this we can't to consciousness recall</l>
<l>Through the remembering mind. For there hath been</l>
<l>An interposed pause of life, and wide</l>
<l>Have all the motions wandered everywhere</l>
<l>From these our senses. For if woe and ail</l>
<l>Perchance are toward, then the man to whom</l>
<l>The bane can happen must himself be there</l>
<l>At that same time. But death precludeth this,</l>
<l>Forbidding life to him on whom might crowd</l>
<l>Such irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:</l>
<l>Nothing for us there is to dread in death,</l>
<l>No wretchedness for him who is no more,</l>
<l>The same estate as if ne'er born before,</l>
<l>When death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="870"/>
<l rend="indent">  Hence, where thou seest a man to grieve because</l>
<l>When dead he rots with body laid away,</l>
<l>Or perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,</l>
<l>Know well: he rings not true, and that beneath</l>
<l>Still works an unseen sting upon his heart,</l>
<l>However he deny that he believes.</l>
<l>His shall be aught of feeling after death.</l>
<l>For he, I fancy, grants not what he says,</l>
<l>Nor what that presupposes, and he fails</l>
<l>To pluck himself with all his roots from life</l>
<l>And cast that self away, quite unawares</l>
<l>Feigning that some remainder's left behind.</l>
<l>For when in life one pictures to oneself</l>
<l>His body dead by beasts and vultures torn,</l>
<l>He pities his state, dividing not himself</l>
<l>Therefrom, removing not the self enough</l>
<l>From the body flung away, imagining</l>
<l>Himself that body, and projecting there</l>
<l>His own sense, as he stands beside it: hence</l>
<l>He grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks</l>
<l>That in true death there is no second self</l>
<l>Alive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,</l>
<l>Or stand lamenting that the self lies there</l>
<l>Mangled or burning. For if it an evil is</l>
<l>Dead to be jerked about by jaw and fang</l>
<l>Of the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not</l>
<l>Bitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,</l>
<l>Or suffocate in honey, and, reclined</l>
<l>On the smooth oblong of an icy slab,</l>

<l>But ask the mourner what's the bitterness</l>
<l>That man should waste in an eternal grief,</l>
<l>If, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?</l>

<l>Yet not at all do those primordial germs</l>
<l>Roam round our members, at that time, afar</l>
<l>From their own motions that produce our senses-</l>
<l>Since, when he's startled from his sleep, a man</l>
<l>Collects his senses. Death is, then, to us</l>
<l>Much less- if there can be a less than that</l>
<l>Which is itself a nothing: for there comes</l>

<l>Why this bemoaning and beweeping death?</l>
<l>For if thy life aforetime and behind</l>

<l>Was heaped as in sieve to flow away</l>
<l>And perish unavailingly, why not,</l>
<l>Even like a banqueter, depart the halls,</l>
<l>Laden with life? why not with mind content</l>
<l>Take now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?</l>
<l>But if whatever thou enjoyed hath been</l>
<l>Lavished and lost, and life is now offence,</l>
<l>Why seekest more to add- which in its turn</l>
<l>Will perish foully and fall out in vain?</l>
<l>O why not rather make an end of life,</l>
<l>Of labour? For all I may devise or find</l>
<l>To pleasure thee is nothing: all things are</l>
<l>The same forever. Though not yet thy body</l>
<l>Wrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts</l>
<l>Outworn, still things abide the same, even if</l>
<l>Thou goest on to conquer all of time</l>
<l>With length of days, yea, if thou never diest"-</l>
<l>What were our answer, but that Nature here</l>
<l>Urges just suit and in her words lays down</l>
<l>True cause of action? Yet should one complain,</l>
<l>Riper in years and elder, and lament,</l>
<l>Poor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,</l>
<l>Then would she not, with greater right, on him</l>

<l>What's not at hand, contemning present good,</l>
<l>That life has slipped away, unperfected</l>
<l>And unavailing unto thee. And now,</l>
<l>Or ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head</l>
<l>Stands- and before thou canst be going home</l>
<l>Sated and laden with the goodly feast.</l>
<l>But now yield all that's alien to thine age,-</l>
<l>Up, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must."</l>

<p>PROEM</p>

<l>I wander afield, thriving in sturdy thought,</l>
<l>Through unpathed haunts of the Pierides,</l>
<l>Trodden by step of none before. I joy</l>
<l>To come on undefiled fountains there,</l>
<l>To drain them deep; I joy to pluck new flowers,</l>
<l>To seek for this my head a signal crown</l>
<l>From regions where the Muses never yet</l>
<l>Have garlanded the temples of a man:</l>
<l>First, since I teach concerning mighty things,</l>
<l>And go right on to loose from round the mind</l>
<l>The tightened coils of dread religion;</l>
<l>Next, since, concerning themes so dark, I frame</l>
<l>Song so pellucid, touching all throughout</l>
<l>Even with the Muses' charm- which, as 'twould seem,</l>
<l>Is not without a reasonable ground:</l>
<l>For as physicians, when they seek to give</l>
<l>Young boys the nauseous wormwood, first do touch</l>
<l>The brim around the cup with the sweet juice</l>
<l>And yellow of the honey, in order that</l>
<l>The thoughtless age of boyhood be cajoled</l>
<l>As far as the lips, and meanwhile swallow down</l>
<l>The wormwood's bitter draught, and, though befooled,</l>
<l>Be yet not merely duped, but rather thus</l>
<l>Grow strong again with recreated health:</l>
<l>So now I too (since this my doctrine seems</l>
<l>In general somewhat woeful unto those</l>
<l>Who've had it not in hand, and since the crowd</l>
<l>Starts back from it in horror) have desired</l>
<l>To expound our doctrine unto thee in song</l>
<l>Soft-speaking and Pierian, and, as 'twere,</l>
<l>To touch it with sweet honey of the Muse-</l>

<p>EXISTENCE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES</p>

<l rend="indent">  But since I've taught already of what sort</l>
<l>The seeds of all things are, and how distinct</l>
<l>In divers forms they flit of own accord,</l>
<l>Stirred with a motion everlasting on,</l>
<l>And in what mode things be from them create,</l>
<l>And since I've taught what the mind's nature is,</l>
<l>And of what things 'tis with the body knit</l>
<l>And thrives in strength, and by what mode uptorn</l>
<l>That mind returns to its primordials,</l>
<l>Now will I undertake an argument-</l>
<l>One for these matters of supreme concern-</l>
<l>That there exist those somewhats which we call</l>
<l>The images of things: these, like to films</l>
<l>Scaled off the utmost outside of the things,</l>
<l>Flit hither and thither through the atmosphere,</l>
<l>And the same terrify our intellects,</l>
<l>Coming upon us waking or in sleep,</l>
<l>When oft we peer at wonderful strange shapes</l>
<l>And images of people lorn of light,</l>
<l>Which oft have horribly roused us when we lay</l>
<l>In slumber- that haply nevermore may we</l>
<l>Suppose that souls get loose from <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>,</l>
<l>Or shades go floating in among the living,</l>
<l>Or aught of us is left behind at death,</l>
<l>When body and mind, destroyed together, each</l>
<l>Back to its own primordials goes away.</l>
<l rend="indent">  And thus I say that effigies of things,</l>
<l>And tenuous shapes from off the things are sent,</l>
<l>From off the utmost outside of the things,</l>
<l>Which are like films or may be named a rind,</l>
<l>Because the image bears like look and form</l>
<l>With whatso body has shed it fluttering forth-</l>
<l>A fact thou mayst, however dull thy wits,</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="54"/>
<l>Well learn from this: mainly, because we see</l>
<l>Even 'mongst visible objects many be</l>
<l>That send forth bodies, loosely some diffused-</l>
<l>Like smoke from oaken logs and heat from fires-</l>
<l>And some more interwoven and condensed-</l>
<l>As when the locusts in the summertime</l>
<l>Put off their glossy tunics, or when calves</l>
<l>At birth drop membranes from their body's surface,</l>
<l>Or when, again, the slippery serpent doffs</l>
<l>Its vestments 'mongst the thorns- for oft we see</l>
<l>The breres augmented with their flying spoils:</l>
<l>Since such takes place, 'tis likewise certain too</l>
<l>That tenuous images from things are sent,</l>
<l>From off the utmost outside of the things.</l>
<l>For why those kinds should drop and part from things,</l>
<l>Rather than others tenuous and thin,</l>
<l>No power has man to open mouth to tell;</l>
<l>Especially, since on outsides of things</l>
<l>Are bodies many and minute which could,</l>
<l>In the same order which they had before,</l>
<l>And with the figure of their form preserved,</l>
<l>Be thrown abroad, and much more swiftly too,</l>
<l>Being less subject to impediments,</l>
<l>As few in number and placed along the front.</l>
<l>For truly many things we see discharge</l>
<l>Their stuff at large, not only from their cores</l>
<l>Deep-set within, as we have said above,</l>
<l>But from their surfaces at times no less-</l>
<l>Their very colours too. And commonly</l>
<l>The awnings, saffron, red and dusky blue,</l>
<l>Stretched overhead in mighty theatres,</l>
<l>Upon their poles and cross-beams fluttering,</l>
<l>Have such an action quite; for there they dye</l>
<l>And make to undulate with their every hue</l>
<l>The circled throng below, and all the stage,</l>
<l>And rich attire in the patrician seats.</l>
<l>And ever the more the theatre's dark walls</l>
<l>Around them shut, the more all things within</l>
<l>Laugh in the bright suffusion of strange glints,</l>
<l>The daylight being withdrawn. And therefore, since</l>
<l>The canvas hangings thus discharge their dye</l>
<l>From off their surface, things in general must</l>
<l>Likewise their tenuous effigies discharge,</l>
<l>Because in either case they are off-thrown</l>
<l>From off the surface. So there are indeed</l>
<l>Such certain prints and vestiges of forms</l>
<l>Which flit around, of subtlest texture made,</l>
<l>Invisible, when separate, each and one.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="90"/>
<l>Again, all odour, smoke, and heat, and such</l>
<l>Streams out of things diffusedly, because,</l>
<l>Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth</l>
<l>And rising out, along their bending path</l>
<l>They're torn asunder, nor have gateways straight</l>
<l>Wherethrough to mass themselves and struggle abroad.</l>
<l>But contrariwise, when such a tenuous film</l>
<l>Of outside colour is thrown off, there's naught</l>
<l>Can rend it, since 'tis placed along the front</l>
<l>Ready to hand. Lastly those images</l>
<l>Which to our eyes in mirrors do appear,</l>
<l>In water, or in any shining surface,</l>
<l>Must be, since furnished with like look of things,</l>
<l>Fashioned from images of things sent out.</l>
<l>There are, then, tenuous effigies of forms,</l>
<l>Like unto them, which no one can divine</l>
<l>When taken singly, which do yet give back,</l>
<l>When by continued and recurrent discharge</l>
<l>Expelled, a picture from the mirrors' plane.</l>
<l>Nor otherwise, it seems, can they be kept</l>
<l>So well conserved that thus be given back</l>
<l>Figures so like each object.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="110"/>
<l rend="indent">                          Now then, learn</l>
<l>How tenuous is the nature of an image.</l>
<l>And in the first place, since primordials be</l>
<l>So far beneath our senses, and much less</l>
<l>E'en than those objects which begin to grow</l>
<l>Too small for eyes to note, learn now in few</l>
<l>How nice are the beginnings of all things-</l>
<l>That this, too, I may yet confirm in proof:</l>
<l>First, living creatures are sometimes so small</l>
<l>That even their third part can nowise be seen;</l>
<l>Judge, then, the size of any inward organ-</l>
<l>What of their sphered heart, their eyes, their limbs,</l>
<l>The skeleton?- How tiny thus they are!</l>
<l>And what besides of those first particles</l>
<l>Whence soul and mind must fashioned be?- <placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> not</l>
<l>How nice and how minute? Besides, whatever</l>
<l>Exhales from out its body a sharp smell-</l>
<l>The nauseous absinth, or the panacea,</l>
<l>Strong southernwood, or bitter centaury-</l>
<l>If never so lightly with thy [fingers] twain</l>
<l>Perchance [thou touch] a one of them</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>Then why not rather know that images</l>
<l>Flit hither and thither, many, in many modes,</l>
<l>Bodiless and invisible?</l>
<l rend="indent">                                   But lest</l>
<l>Haply thou holdest that those images</l>
<l>Which come from objects are the sole that flit,</l>
<l>Others indeed there be of own accord</l>
<l>Begot, self-formed in earth's aery skies,</l>
<l>Which, moulded to innumerable shapes,</l>
<l>Are borne aloft, and, fluid as they are,</l>
<l>Cease not to change appearance and to turn</l>
<l>Into new outlines of all sorts of forms;</l>
<l>As we behold the clouds grow thick on high</l>
<l>And smirch the serene vision of the world,</l>
<l>Stroking the air with motions. For oft are seen</l>
<l>The giants' faces flying far along</l>
<l>And trailing a spread of shadow; and at times</l>
<l>The mighty mountains and mountain-sundered rocks</l>
<l>Going before and crossing on the sun,</l>
<l>Whereafter a monstrous beast dragging amain</l>
<l>And leading in the other thunderheads.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="143"/>
<l>Now [hear] how easy and how swift they be</l>
<l>Engendered, and perpetually flow off</l>
<l>From things and gliding pass away....</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>For ever every outside streams away</l>
<l>From off all objects, since discharge they may;</l>
<l>And when this outside reaches other things,</l>
<l>As chiefly glass, it passes through; but where</l>
<l>It reaches the rough rocks or stuff of wood,</l>
<l>There 'tis so rent that it cannot give back</l>
<l>An image. But when gleaming objects dense,</l>
<l>As chiefly mirrors, have been set before it,</l>
<l>Nothing of this sort happens. For it can't</l>
<l>Go, as through glass, nor yet be rent- its safety,</l>
<l>By virtue of that smoothness, being sure.</l>
<l>'Tis therefore that from them the images</l>
<l>Stream back to us; and howso suddenly</l>
<l>Thou place, at any instant, anything</l>
<l>Before a mirror, there an image shows;</l>
<l>Proving that ever from a body's surface</l>
<l>Flow off thin textures and thin shapes of things.</l>
<l>Thus many images in little time</l>
<l>Are gendered; so their origin is named</l>
<l>Rightly a speedy. And even as the sun</l>
<l>Must send below, in little time, to earth</l>
<l>So many beams to keep all things so full</l>
<l>Of light incessant; thus, on grounds the same,</l>
<l>From things there must be borne, in many modes,</l>
<l>To every quarter round, upon the moment,</l>
<l>The many images of things; because</l>
<l>Unto whatever face of things we turn</l>
<l>The mirror, things of form and hue the same</l>
<l>Respond. Besides, though but a moment since</l>
<l>Serenest was the weather of the sky,</l>
<l>So fiercely sudden is it foully thick</l>
<l>That ye might think that round about all murk</l>
<l>Had parted forth from <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> and filled</l>
<l>The mighty vaults of sky- so grievously,</l>
<l>As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome night,</l>
<l>Do faces of black horror hang on high-</l>
<l>Of which how small a part an image is</l>
<l>There's none to tell or reckon out in words.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="176"/>
<l rend="indent">  Now come; with what swift motion they are borne,</l>
<l>These images, and what the speed assigned</l>

<l>Alone is wasted, toward whatever region</l>
<l>Each with its divers impulse tends- I'll tell</l>
<l>In verses sweeter than they many are;</l>
<l>Even as the swan's slight note is better far</l>

<l>Which, as it were, are forward knocked along</l>
<l>And through the interspaces of the air</l>
<l>To pass delay not, urged by blows behind;</l>
<l>For light by light is instantly supplied</l>
<l>And gleam by following gleam is spurred and driven.</l>
<l>Thus likewise must the images have power</l>
<l>Through unimaginable space to speed</l>
<l>Within a point of time,- first, since a cause</l>
<l>Exceeding small there is, which at their back</l>
<l>Far forward drives them and propels, where, too,</l>
<l>They're carried with such winged lightness on;</l>
<l>And, secondly, since furnished, when sent off,</l>
<l>With texture of such rareness that they can</l>

<l>Around the coasts. Nor ever cease to flit</l>
<l>The varied voices, sounds athrough the air.</l>
<l>Then too there comes into the mouth at times</l>
<l>The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea</l>
<l>We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch</l>
<l>The wormword being mixed, its bitter stings.</l>
<l>To such degree from all things is each thing</l>
<l>Borne streamingly along, and sent about</l>
<l>To every region round; and nature grants</l>
<l>Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,</l>
<l>Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,</l>
<l>And all the time are suffered to descry</l>
<l>And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="230"/>
<l>Besides, since shape examined by our hands</l>
<l>Within the dark is known to be the same</l>
<l>As that by eyes perceived within the light</l>
<l>And lustrous day, both touch and sight must be</l>
<l>By one like cause aroused. So, if we test</l>
<l>A square and get its stimulus on us</l>
<l>Within the dark, within the light what square</l>
<l>Can fall upon our sight, except a square</l>
<l>That images the things? Wherefore it seems</l>
<l>The source of seeing is in images,</l>
<l>Nor without these can anything be viewed.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Now these same films I name are borne about</l>
<l>And tossed and scattered into regions all.</l>
<l>But since we do perceive alone through eyes,</l>
<l>It follows hence that whitherso we turn</l>
<l>Our sight, all things do strike against it there</l>
<l>With form and hue. And just how far from us</l>
<l>Each thing may be away, the image yields</l>
<l>To us the power to see and chance to tell:</l>
<l>For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead</l>
<l>And drives along the air that's in the space</l>
<l>Betwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air</l>
<l>All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere,</l>
<l>Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise</l>
<l>Passes across. Therefore it comes we see</l>
<l>How far from us each thing may be away,</l>
<l>And the more air there be that's driven before,</l>
<l>And too the longer be the brushing breeze</l>
<l>Against our eyes, the farther off removed</l>
<l>Each thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work</l>
<l>With mightily swift order all goes on,</l>
<l>So that upon one instant we may see</l>
<l>What kind the object and how far away.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Nor over-marvellous must this be deemed</l>
<l>In these affairs that, though the films which strike</l>
<l>Upon the eyes cannot be singly seen,</l>
<l>The things themselves may be perceived. For thus</l>
<l>When the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke</l>
<l>And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our wont</l>
<l>To feel each private particle of wind</l>
<l>Or of that cold, but rather all at once;</l>
<l>And so we see how blows affect our body,</l>
<l>As if one thing were beating on the same</l>
<l>And giving us the feel of its own body</l>
<l>Outside of us. Again, whene'er we thump</l>
<l>With finger-tip upon a stone, we touch</l>
<l>But the rock's surface and the outer hue,</l>
<l>Nor feel that hue by contact- rather feel</l>
<l>The very hardness deep within the rock.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="269"/>
<l rend="indent">  Now come, and why beyond a looking-glass</l>
<l>An image may be seen, perceive. For seen</l>
<l>It soothly is, removed far within.</l>
<l>'Tis the same sort as objects peered upon</l>
<l>Outside in their true shape, whene'er a door</l>
<l>Yields through itself an open peering-place,</l>
<l>And lets us see so many things outside</l>
<l>Beyond the house. Also that sight is made</l>
<l>By a twofold twin air: for first is seen</l>
<l>The air inside the door-posts; next the doors,</l>
<l>The twain to left and right; and afterwards</l>
<l>A light beyond comes brushing through our eyes,</l>
<l>Then other air, then objects peered upon</l>
<l>Outside in their true shape. And thus, when first</l>
<l>The image of the glass projects itself,</l>
<l>As to our gaze it comes, it shoves ahead</l>
<l>And drives along the air that's in the space</l>
<l>Betwixt it and our eyes, and brings to pass</l>
<l>That we perceive the air ere yet the glass.</l>
<l>But when we've also seen the glass itself,</l>
<l>Forthwith that image which from us is borne</l>
<l>Reaches the glass, and there thrown back again</l>
<l>Comes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls</l>
<l>Ahead of itself another air, that then</l>
<l>'Tis this we see before itself, and thus</l>
<l>It looks so far removed behind the glass.</l>
<l>Wherefore again, again, there's naught for wonder</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>In those which render from the mirror's plane</l>
<l>A vision back, since each thing comes to pass</l>
<l>By means of the two airs. Now, in the glass</l>
<l>The right part of our members is observed</l>
<l>Upon the left, because, when comes the image</l>
<l>Hitting against the level of the glass,</l>
<l>'Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off</l>
<l>Backwards in line direct and not oblique,-</l>
<l>Exactly as whoso his plaster-mask</l>
<l>Should dash, before 'twere dry, on post or beam,</l>
<l>And it should straightway keep, at clinging there,</l>
<l>Its shape, reversed, facing him who threw,</l>
<l>And so remould the features it gives back:</l>
<l>It comes that now the right eye is the left,</l>
<l>The left the right.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="302"/><l rend="indent">An image too may be</l>
<l>From mirror into mirror handed on,</l>
<l>Until of idol-films even five or six</l>
<l>Have thus been gendered. For whatever things</l>
<l>Shall hide back yonder in the house, the same,</l>
<l>However far removed in twisting ways,</l>
<l>May still be all brought forth through bending paths</l>
<l>And by these several mirrors seen to be</l>
<l>Within the house, since nature so compels</l>
<l>All things to be borne backward and spring off</l>
<l>At equal angles from all other things.</l>
<l>To such degree the image gleams across</l>
<l>From mirror unto mirror; where 'twas left</l>
<l>It comes to be the right, and then again</l>
<l>Returns and changes round unto the left.</l>
<l>Again, those little sides of mirrors curved</l>
<l>Proportionate to the bulge of our own flank</l>
<l>Send back to us their idols with the right</l>
<l>Upon the right; and this is so because</l>
<l>Either the image is passed on along</l>
<l>From mirror unto mirror, and thereafter,</l>
<l>When twice dashed off, flies back unto ourselves;</l>
<l>Or else the image wheels itself around,</l>
<l>When once unto the mirror it has come,</l>
<l>Since the curved surface teaches it to turn</l>
<l>To usward. Further, thou might'st well believe</l>
<l>That these film-idols step along with us</l>
<l>And set their feet in unison with ours</l>
<l>And imitate our carriage, since from that</l>
<l>Part of a mirror whence thou hast withdrawn</l>
<l>Straightway no images can be returned.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Further, our eye-balls tend to flee the bright</l>
<l>And shun to gaze thereon; the sun even blinds,</l>
<l>If thou goest on to strain them unto him,</l>
<l>Because his strength is mighty, and the films</l>
<l>Heavily downward from on high are borne</l>
<l>Through the pure ether and the viewless winds,</l>
<l>And strike the eyes, disordering their joints.</l>
<l>So piecing lustre often burns the eyes,</l>
<l>Because it holdeth many seeds of fire</l>
<l>Which, working into eyes, engender pain.</l>
<l>Again, whatever jaundiced people view</l>
<l>Becomes wan-yellow, since from out their bodies</l>
<l>Flow many seeds wan-yellow forth to meet</l>
<l>The films of things, and many too are mixed</l>
<l>Within their eye, which by contagion paint</l>
<l>All things with sallowness.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="337"/>
<l rend="indent">Again, we view</l>
<l>From dark recesses things that stand in light,</l>
<l>Because, when first has entered and possessed</l>
<l>The open eyes this nearer darkling air,</l>
<l>Swiftly the shining air and luminous</l>
<l>Followeth in, which purges then the eyes</l>
<l>And scatters asunder of that other air</l>
<l>The sable shadows, for in large degrees</l>
<l>This air is nimbler, nicer, and more strong.</l>
<l>And soon as ever 'thas filled and oped with light</l>
<l>The pathways of the eyeballs, which before</l>
<l>Black air had blocked, there follow straightaway</l>
<l>Those films of things out-standing in the light,</l>
<l>Provoking vision- what we cannot do</l>
<l>From out the light with objects in the dark,</l>
<l>Because that denser darkling air behind</l>
<l>Followeth in, and fills each aperture</l>
<l>And thus blockades the pathways of the eyes</l>
<l>That there no images of any things</l>
<l>Can be thrown in and agitate the eyes.</l>
<l rend="indent">  And when from far away we do behold</l>
<l>The squared towers of a city, oft</l>
<l>Rounded they seem,- on this account because</l>
<l>Each distant angle is perceived obtuse,</l>
<l>Or rather it is not perceived at all;</l>
<l>And perishes its blow nor to our gaze</l>
<l>Arrives its stroke, since through such length of air</l>
<l>Are borne along the idols that the air</l>
<l>Makes blunt the idol of the angle's point</l>
<l>By numerous collidings. When thuswise</l>
<l>The angles of the tower each and all</l>
<l>Have quite escaped the sense, the stones appear</l>
<l>As rubbed and rounded on a turner's wheel-</l>
<l>Yet not like objects near and truly round,</l>
<l>But with a semblance to them, shadowily.</l>
<l>Likewise, our shadow in the sun appears</l>
<l>To move along and follow our own steps</l>
<l>And imitate our carriage- if thou thinkest</l>
<l>Air that is thus bereft of light can walk,</l>
<l>Following the gait and motion of mankind.</l>
<l>For what we use to name a shadow, sure</l>
<l>Is naught but air deprived of light. No marvel:</l>
<l>Because the earth from spot to spot is reft</l>
<l>Progressively of light of sun, whenever</l>
<l>In moving round we get within its way,</l>
<l>While any spot of earth by us abandoned</l>
<l>Is filled with light again, on this account</l>
<l>It comes to pass that what was body's shadow</l>
<l>Seems still the same to follow after us</l>
<l>In one straight course. Since, evermore pour in</l>
<l>New lights of rays, and perish then the old,</l>
<l>Just like the wool that's drawn into the flame.</l>
<l>Therefore the earth is easily spoiled of light</l>
<l>And easily refilled and from herself</l>
<l>Washeth the black shadows quite away.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="379"/>
<l rend="indent">  And yet in this we don't at all concede</l>
<l>That eyes be cheated. For their task it is</l>
<l>To note in whatsoever place be light,</l>
<l>In what be shadow: whether or no the gleams</l>
<l>Be still the same, and whether the shadow which</l>
<l>Just now was here is that one passing thither,</l>
<l>Or whether the facts be what we said above,</l>
<l>'Tis after all the reasoning of mind</l>
<l>That must decide; nor can our eyeballs know</l>
<l>The nature of reality. And so</l>
<l>Attach thou not this fault of mind to eyes,</l>
<l>Nor lightly think our senses everywhere</l>
<l>Are tottering. The ship in which we sail</l>
<l>Is borne along, although it seems to stand;</l>
<l>The ship that bides in roadstead is supposed</l>
<l>There to be passing by. And hills and fields</l>
<l>Seem fleeing fast astern, past which we urge</l>
<l>The ship and fly under the bellying sails.</l>
<l>The stars, each one, do seem to pause, affixed</l>
<l>To the ethereal caverns, though they all</l>
<l>Forever are in motion, rising out</l>
<l>And thence revisiting their far descents</l>
<l>When they have measured with their bodies bright</l>
<l>The span of heaven. And likewise sun and moon</l>
<l>Seem biding in a roadstead,- objects which,</l>
<l>As plain fact proves, are really borne along.</l>
<l>Between two mountains far away aloft</l>
<l>From midst the whirl of waters open lies</l>
<l>A gaping exit for the fleet, and yet</l>
<l>They seem conjoined in a single isle.</l>
<l>When boys themselves have stopped their spinning round,</l>
<l>The halls still seem to whirl and posts to reel,</l>
<l>Until they now must almost think the roofs</l>
<l>Threaten to ruin down upon their heads.</l>
<l>And now, when nature begins to lift on high</l>
<l>The sun's red splendour and the tremulous fires,</l>
<l>And raise him o'er the mountain-tops, those mountains-</l>
<l>O'er which he seemeth then to thee to be,</l>
<l>His glowing self hard by atingeing them</l>
<l>With his own fire- are yet away from us</l>
<l>Scarcely two thousand arrow-shots, indeed</l>
<l>Oft scarce five hundred courses of a dart;</l>
<l>Although between those mountains and the sun</l>
<l>Lie the huge plains of ocean spread beneath</l>
<l>The vasty shores of ether, and intervene</l>
<l>A thousand lands, possessed by many a folk</l>
<l>And generations of wild beasts. Again,</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="414"/>
<l>A pool of water of but a finger's depth,</l>
<l>Which lies between the stones along the pave,</l>
<l>Offers a vision downward into earth</l>
<l>As far, as from the earth o'erspread on high</l>
<l>The gulfs of heaven; that thus thou seemest to view</l>
<l>Clouds down below and heavenly bodies plunged</l>
<l>Wondrously in heaven under earth.</l>
<l>Then too, when in the middle of the stream</l>
<l>Sticks fast our dashing horse, and down we gaze</l>
<l>Into the river's rapid waves, some force</l>
<l>Seems then to bear the body of the horse,</l>
<l>Though standing still, reversely from his course,</l>
<l>And swiftly push up-stream. And wheresoe'er</l>
<l>We cast our eyes across, all objects seem</l>
<l>Thus to be onward borne and flow along</l>
<l>In the same way as we. A portico,</l>
<l>Albeit it stands well propped from end to end</l>
<l>On equal columns, parallel and big,</l>
<l>Contracts by stages in a narrow cone,</l>
<l>When from one end the long, long whole is seen,-</l>
<l>Until, conjoining ceiling with the floor,</l>
<l>And the whole right side with the left, it draws</l>
<l>Together to a cone's nigh-viewless point.</l>
<l>To sailors on the main the sun he seems</l>
<l>From out the waves to rise, and in the waves</l>
<l>To set and bury his light- because indeed</l>
<l>They gaze on naught but water and the sky.</l>
<l>Again, to gazers ignorant of the sea,</l>
<l>Vessels in port seem, as with broken poops,</l>
<l>To lean upon the water, quite agog;</l>
<l>For any portion of the oars that's raised</l>
<l>Above the briny spray is straight, and straight</l>
<l>The rudders from above. But other parts,</l>
<l>Those sunk, immersed below the water-line,</l>
<l>Seem broken all and bended and inclined</l>
<l>Sloping to upwards, and turned back to float</l>
<l>Almost atop the water. And when the winds</l>
<l>Carry the scattered drifts along the sky</l>
<l>In the night-time, then seem to glide along</l>
<l>The radiant constellations 'gainst the clouds</l>
<l>And there on high to take far other course</l>
<l>From that whereon in truth they're borne. And then,</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="447"/>
<l>If haply our hand be set beneath one eye</l>
<l>And press below thereon, then to our gaze</l>
<l>Each object which we gaze on seems to be,</l>
<l>By some sensation twain- then twain the lights</l>
<l>Of lampions burgeoning in flowers of flame,</l>
<l>And twain the furniture in all the house,</l>
<l>Two-fold the visages of fellow-men,</l>
<l>And twain their bodies. And again, when sleep</l>
<l>Has bound our members down in slumber soft</l>
<l>And all the body lies in deep repose,</l>
<l>Yet then we seem to self to be awake</l>
<l>And move our members; and in night's blind gloom</l>
<l>We think to mark the daylight and the sun;</l>
<l>And, shut within a room, yet still we seem</l>
<l>To change our skies, our oceans, rivers, hills,</l>
<l>To cross the plains afoot, and hear new sounds,</l>
<l>Though still the austere silence of the night</l>
<l>Abides around us, and to speak replies,</l>
<l>Though voiceless. Other cases of the sort</l>
<l>Wondrously many do we see, which all</l>
<l>Seek, so to say, to injure faith in sense-</l>
<l>In vain, because the largest part of these</l>
<l>Deceives through mere opinions of the mind,</l>
<l>Which we do add ourselves, feigning to see</l>
<l>What by the senses are not seen at all.</l>
<l>For naught is harder than to separate</l>
<l>Plain facts from dubious, which the mind forthwith</l>
<l>Adds by itself.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="469"/>
<l rend="indent">                  Again, if one suppose</l>
<l>That naught is known, he knows not whether this</l>
<l>Itself is able to be known, since he</l>
<l>Confesses naught to know. Therefore with him</l>
<l>I waive discussion- who has set his head</l>
<l>Even where his feet should be. But let me grant</l>
<l>That this he knows,- I question: whence he knows</l>
<l>What 'tis to know and not-to-know in turn,</l>
<l>And what created concept of the truth,</l>
<l>And what device has proved the dubious</l>
<l>To differ from the certain?- since in things</l>
<l>He's heretofore seen naught of true. Thou'lt find</l>
<l>That from the senses first hath been create</l>
<l>Concept of truth, nor can the senses be</l>
<l>Rebutted. For criterion must be found</l>
<l>Worthy of greater trust, which shall defeat</l>
<l>Through own authority the false by true;</l>
<l>What, then, than these our senses must there be</l>
<l>Worthy a greater trust? Shall reason, sprung</l>
<l>From some false sense, prevail to contradict</l>
<l>Those senses, sprung as reason wholly is</l>
<l>From out the senses?- For lest these be true,</l>
<l>All reason also then is falsified.</l>
<l>Or shall the ears have power to blame the eyes,</l>
<l>Or yet the touch the ears? Again, shall taste</l>
<l>Accuse this touch or shall the nose confute</l>
<l>Or eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is:</l>
<l>For unto each has been divided off</l>
<l>Its function quite apart, its power to each;</l>
<l>And thus we're still constrained to perceive</l>
<l>The soft, the cold, the hot apart, apart</l>
<l>All divers hues and whatso things there be</l>
<l>Conjoined with hues. Likewise the tasting tongue</l>
<l>Has its own power apart, and smells apart</l>
<l>And sounds apart are known. And thus it is</l>
<l>That no one sense can e'er convict another.</l>
<l>Nor shall one sense have power to blame itself,</l>
<l>Because it always must be deemed the same,</l>
<l>Worthy of equal trust. And therefore what</l>
<l>At any time unto these senses showed,</l>
<l>The same is true.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="500"/><l rend="indent">And if the reason be</l>
<l>Unable to unravel us the cause</l>
<l>Why objects, which at hand were square, afar</l>
<l>Seemed rounded, yet it more availeth us,</l>
<l>Lacking the reason, to pretend a cause</l>
<l>For each configuration, than to let</l>
<l>From out our hands escape the obvious things</l>
<l>And injure primal faith in sense, and wreck</l>
<l>All those foundations upon which do rest</l>
<l>Our life and safety. For not only reason</l>
<l>Would topple down; but even our very life</l>
<l>Would straightaway collapse, unless we dared</l>
<l>To trust our senses and to keep away</l>
<l>From headlong heights and places to be shunned</l>
<l>Of a like peril, and to seek with speed</l>
<l>Their opposites! Again, as in a building,</l>
<l>If the first plumb-line be askew, and if</l>
<l>The square deceiving swerve from lines exact,</l>
<l>And if the level waver but the least</l>
<l>In any part, the whole construction then</l>
<l>Must turn out faulty- shelving and askew,</l>
<l>Leaning to back and front, incongruous,</l>
<l>That now some portions seem about to fall,</l>
<l>And falls the whole ere long- betrayed indeed</l>
<l>By first deceiving estimates: so too</l>
<l>Thy calculations in affairs of life</l>
<l>Must be askew and false, if sprung for thee</l>
<l>From senses false. So all that troop of words</l>
<l>Marshalled against the senses is quite vain.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="522"/>
<l rend="indent">  And now remains to demonstrate with ease</l>
<l>How other senses each their things perceive.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,</l>
<l>When, getting into ears, they strike the sense</l>
<l>With their own body. For confess we must</l>
<l>Even voice and sound to be corporeal,</l>
<l>Because they're able on the sense to strike.</l>
<l>Besides voice often scrapes against the throat,</l>
<l>And screams in going out do make more rough</l>
<l>The wind-pipe- naturally enough, methinks,</l>
<l>When, through the narrow exit rising up</l>
<l>In larger throng, these primal germs of voice</l>
<l>Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,</l>
<l>Also the door of the mouth is scraped against</l>
<l>[By air blown outward] from distended [cheeks].</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>And thus no doubt there is, that voice and words</l>
<l>Consist of elements corporeal,</l>
<l>With power to pain. Nor art thou unaware</l>
<l>Likewise how much of body's ta'en away,</l>
<l>How much from very thews and powers of men</l>
<l>May be withdrawn by steady talk, prolonged</l>
<l>Even from the rising splendour of the morn</l>
<l>To shadows of black evening,- above all</l>
<l>If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.</l>
<l>Therefore the voice must be corporeal,</l>
<l>Since the long talker loses from his frame</l>
<l>A part.</l>
<l rend="indent">        Moreover, roughness in the sound</l>
<l>Comes from the roughness in the primal germs,</l>
<l>As a smooth sound from smooth ones is create;</l>
<l>Nor have these elements a form the same</l>
<l>When the trump rumbles with a hollow roar,</l>
<l>As when barbaric Berecynthian pipe</l>
<l>Buzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans</l>
<l>By night from icy shores of Helicon</l>
<l>With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="549"/>
<l rend="indent">  Thus, when from deep within our frame we force</l>
<l>These voices, and at mouth expel them forth,</l>
<l>The mobile tongue, artificer of words,</l>
<l>Makes them articulate, and too the lips</l>
<l>By their formations share in shaping them.</l>
<l>Hence when the space is short from starting-point</l>
<l>To where that voice arrives, the very words</l>
<l>Must too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.</l>
<l>For then the voice conserves its own formation,</l>
<l>Conserves its shape. But if the space between</l>
<l>Be longer than is fit, the words must be</l>
<l>Through the much air confounded, and the voice</l>
<l>Disordered in its flight across the winds-</l>
<l>And so it haps, that thou canst sound perceive,</l>
<l>Yet not determine what the words may mean;</l>
<l>To such degree confounded and encumbered</l>
<l>The voice approaches us. Again, one word,</l>
<l>Sent from the crier's mouth, may rouse all ears</l>
<l>Among the populace. And thus one voice</l>
<l>Scatters asunder into many voices,</l>
<l>Since it divides itself for separate ears,</l>
<l>Imprinting form of word and a clear tone.</l>
<l>But whatso part of voices fails to hit</l>
<l>The ears themselves perishes, borne beyond,</l>
<l>Idly diffused among the winds. A part,</l>
<l>Beating on solid porticoes, tossed back</l>
<l>Returns a sound; and sometimes mocks the ear</l>
<l>With a mere phantom of a word. </l>
<milestone unit="card" n="572"/>
<l rend="indent">  When this</l>
<l>Thou well hast noted, thou canst render count</l>
<l>Unto thyself and others why it is</l>

<l>Give back like shapes of words in order like,</l>
<l>When search we after comrades wandering</l>
<l>Among the shady mountains, and aloud</l>
<l>Call unto them, the scattered. I have seen</l>
<l>Spots that gave back even voices six or seven</l>
<l>For one thrown forth- for so the very hills,</l>
<l>Dashing them back against the hills, kept on</l>
<l>With their reverberations. And these spots</l>
<l>The neighbouring country-side doth feign to be</l>
<l>Haunts of the goat-foot satyrs and the nymphs;</l>
<l>And tells ye there be fauns, by whose night noise</l>
<l>And antic revels yonder they declare</l>
<l>The voiceless silences are broken oft,</l>
<l>And tones of strings are made and wailings sweet</l>
<l>Which the pipe, beat by players' finger-tips,</l>
<l>Pours out; and far and wide the farmer-race</l>
<l>Begins to hear, when, shaking the garmentings</l>
<l>Of pine upon his half-beast head, god-Pan</l>
<l>With puckered lip oft runneth o'er and o'er</l>
<l>The open reeds,- lest flute should cease to pour</l>
<l>The woodland music! Other prodigies</l>
<l>And wonders of this ilk they love to tell,</l>
<l>Lest they be thought to dwell in lonely spots</l>
<l>And even by gods deserted. This is why</l>
<l>They boast of marvels in their story-tellings;</l>
<l>Or by some other reason are led on-</l>
<l>Greedy, as all mankind hath ever been,</l>
<l>To prattle fables into ears.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="595"/>
<l rend="indent"> Again,</l>
<l>One need not wonder how it comes about</l>
<l>That through those places (through which eyes cannot</l>
<l>View objects manifest) sounds yet may pass</l>
<l>And assail the ears. For often we observe</l>
<l>People conversing, though the doors be closed;</l>
<l>No marvel either, since all voice unharmed</l>
<l>Can wind through bended apertures of things,</l>
<l>While idol-films decline to- for they're rent,</l>
<l>Unless along straight apertures they swim,</l>
<l>Like those in glass, through which all images</l>
<l>Do fly across. And yet this voice itself,</l>
<l>In passing through shut chambers of a house,</l>
<l>Is dulled, and in a jumble enters ears,</l>
<l>And sound we seem to hear far more than words.</l>
<l>Moreover, a voice is into all directions</l>
<l>Divided up, since off from one another</l>
<l>New voices are engendered, when one voice</l>
<l>Hath once leapt forth, outstarting into many-</l>
<l>As oft a spark of fire is wont to sprinkle</l>
<l>Itself into its several fires. And so,</l>
<l>Voices do fill those places hid behind,</l>
<l>Which all are in a hubbub round about,</l>
<l>Astir with sound. But idol-films do tend,</l>
<l>As once sent forth, in straight directions all;</l>
<l>Wherefore one can inside a wall see naught,</l>
<l>Yet catch the voices from beyond the same.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="615"/>
<l rend="indent">  Nor tongue and palate, whereby we flavour feel,</l>
<l>Present more problems for more work of thought.</l>
<l>Firstly, we feel a flavour in the mouth,</l>
<l>When forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,-</l>
<l>As any one perchance begins to squeeze</l>
<l>With hand and dry a sponge with water soaked.</l>
<l>Next, all which forth we squeeze is spread about</l>
<l>Along the pores and intertwined paths</l>
<l>Of the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth</l>
<l>The bodies of the oozy flavour, then</l>
<l>Delightfully they touch, delightfully</l>
<l>They treat all spots, around the wet and trickling</l>
<l>Enclosures of the tongue. And contrariwise,</l>
<l>They sting and pain the sense with their assault,</l>
<l>According as with roughness they're supplied.</l>
<l>Next, only up to palate is the pleasure</l>
<l>Coming from flavour; for in truth when down</l>
<l>'Thas plunged along the throat, no pleasure is,</l>
<l>Whilst into all the frame it spreads around;</l>
<l>Nor aught it matters with what food is fed</l>
<l>The body, if only what thou take thou canst</l>
<l>Distribute well digested to the frame</l>
<l>And keep the stomach in a moist career.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Now, how it is we see some food for some,</l>
<l>Others for others....</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>I will unfold, or wherefore what to some</l>
<l>Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others</l>
<l>Can seem delectable to eat,- why here</l>
<l>So great the distance and the difference is</l>
<l>That what is food to one to some becomes</l>
<l>Fierce poison, as a certain snake there is</l>
<l>Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste</l>
<l>And end itself by gnawing up its coil.</l>
<l>Again, fierce poison is the hellebore</l>
<l>To us, but puts the fat on goats and quails.</l>
<l>That thou mayst know by what devices this</l>
<l>Is brought about, in chief thou must recall</l>
<l>What we have said before, that seeds are kept</l>
<l>Commixed in things in divers modes. Again,</l>
<l>As all the breathing creatures which take food</l>
<l>Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut</l>
<l>And contour of their members bounds them round,</l>
<l>Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist</l>
<l>Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,</l>
<l>Since seeds do differ, divers too must be</l>
<l>The interstices and paths (which we do call</l>
<l>The apertures) in all the members, even</l>
<l>In mouth and palate too. Thus some must be</l>
<l>More small or yet more large, three-cornered some</l>
<l>And others squared, and many others round,</l>
<l>And certain of them many-angled too</l>
<l>In many modes. For, as the combination</l>
<l>And motion of their divers shapes demand,</l>
<l>The shapes of apertures must be diverse</l>
<l>And paths must vary according to their walls</l>
<l>That bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some,</l>
<l>Becomes to others bitter, for him to whom</l>
<l>'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs</l>
<l>Have entered caressingly the palate's pores.</l>
<l>And, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet</l>
<l>Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt</l>
<l>The rough and barbed particles have got</l>
<l>Into the narrows of the apertures.</l>
<l>Now easy it is from these affairs to know</l>
<l>Whatever...</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>Indeed, where one from o'er-abundant bile</l>
<l>Is stricken with fever, or in other wise</l>
<l>Feels the roused violence of some malady,</l>
<l>There the whole frame is now upset, and there</l>
<l>All the positions of the seeds are changed,-</l>
<l>So that the bodies which before were fit</l>
<l>To cause the savour, now are fit no more,</l>
<l>And now more apt are others which be able</l>
<l>To get within the pores and gender sour.</l>
<l>Both sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey-</l>
<l>What oft we've proved above to thee before.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="673"/>
<l>Now come, and I will indicate what wise</l>
<l>Impact of odour on the nostrils touches.</l>
<l>And first, 'tis needful there be many things</l>
<l>From whence the streaming flow of varied odours</l>
<l>May roll along, and we're constrained to think</l>
<l>They stream and dart and sprinkle themselves about</l>
<l>Impartially. But for some breathing creatures</l>
<l>One odour is more apt, to others another-</l>
<l>Because of differing forms of seeds and pores.</l>
<l>Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees</l>
<l>Are led by odour of honey, vultures too</l>
<l>By carcasses. Again, the forward power</l>
<l>Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on</l>
<l>Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast</l>
<l>Hath hastened its career; and the white goose,</l>
<l>The saviour of the Roman citadel,</l>
<l>Forescents afar the odour of mankind.</l>
<l>Thus, diversly to divers ones is given</l>
<l>Peculiar smell that leadeth each along</l>
<l>To his own food or makes him start aback</l>
<l>From loathsome poison, and in this wise are</l>
<l>The generations of the wild preserved.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Yet is this pungence not alone in odours</l>
<l>Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise,</l>
<l>The look of things and hues agree not all</l>
<l>So well with senses unto all, but that</l>
<l>Some unto some will be, to gaze upon,</l>
<l>More keen and painful. Lo, the raving lions,</l>
<l>They dare not face and gaze upon the cock</l>
<l>Who's wont with wings to flap away the night</l>
<l>From off the stage, and call the beaming morn</l>
<l>With clarion voice- and lions straightway thus</l>
<l>Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,</l>
<l>Within the body of the cocks there be</l>
<l>Some certain seeds, which, into lions' eyes</l>
<l>Injected, bore into the pupils deep</l>
<l>And yield such piercing pain they can't hold out</l>
<l>Against the cocks, however fierce they be-</l>
<l>Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least,</l>
<l>Either because they do not penetrate,</l>
<l>Or since they have free exit from the eyes</l>
<l>As soon as penetrating, so that thus</l>
<l>They cannot hurt our eyes in any part</l>
<l>By there remaining.</l>
<l rend="indent">                     To speak once more of odour;</l>
<l>Whatever assail the nostrils, some can travel</l>
<l>A longer way than others. None of them,</l>
<l>However, 's borne so far as sound or voice-</l>
<l>While I omit all mention of such things</l>
<l>As hit the eyesight and assail the vision.</l>
<l>For slowly on a wandering course it comes</l>
<l>And perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed</l>
<l>Easily into all the winds of air;-</l>
<l>And first, because from deep inside the thing</l>
<l>It is discharged with labour (for the fact</l>
<l>That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground,</l>
<l>Or crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger</l>
<l>Is sign that odours flow and part away</l>
<l>From inner regions of the things). And next,</l>
<l>Thou mayest see that odour is create</l>
<l>Of larger primal germs than voice, because</l>
<l>It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough</l>
<l>Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne;</l>
<l>Wherefore, besides, thou wilt observe 'tis not</l>
<l>So easy to trace out in whatso place</l>
<l>The smelling object is. For, dallying on</l>
<l>Along the winds, the particles cool off,</l>
<l>And then the scurrying messengers of things</l>
<l>Arrive our senses, when no longer hot.</l>
<l>So dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="722"/>
<l rend="indent">  Now mark, and hear what objects move the mind,</l>
<l>And learn, in few, whence unto intellect</l>
<l>Do come what come. And first I tell thee this:</l>
<l>That many images of objects rove</l>
<l>In many modes to every region round-</l>
<l>So thin that easily the one with other,</l>
<l>When once they meet, uniteth in mid-air,</l>
<l>Like gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed,</l>
<l>Far thinner are they in their fabric than</l>
<l>Those images which take a hold on eyes</l>
<l>And smite the vision, since through body's pores</l>
<l>They penetrate, and inwardly stir up</l>
<l>The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.</l>
<l>Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus</l>
<l>The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,</l>
<l>And images of people gone before-</l>
<l>Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;</l>
<l>Because the images of every kind</l>
<l>Are everywhere about us borne- in part</l>
<l>Those which are gendered in the very air</l>
<l>Of own accord, in part those others which</l>
<l>From divers things do part away, and those</l>
<l>Which are compounded, made from out their shapes.</l>
<l>For soothly from no living Centaur is</l>
<l>That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast</l>
<l>Like him was ever; but, when images</l>
<l>Of horse and man by chance have come together,</l>
<l>They easily cohere, as aforesaid,</l>
<l>At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.</l>
<l>In the same fashion others of this ilk</l>
<l>Created are. And when they're quickly borne</l>
<l>In their exceeding lightness, easily</l>
<l>(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,</l>
<l>Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind,</l>
<l>Itself so subtle and so strangely quick.</l>
<l rend="indent">  That these things come to pass as I record,</l>
<l>From this thou easily canst understand:</l>
<l>So far as one is unto other like,</l>
<l>Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes</l>
<l>Must come to pass in fashion not unlike.</l>
<l>Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive</l>
<l>Haply a lion through those idol-films</l>
<l>Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know</l>
<l>Also the mind is in like manner moved,</l>
<l>And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see</l>
<l>(Except that it perceives more subtle films)</l>
<l>The lion and aught else through idol-films.</l>
<l>And when the sleep has overset our frame,</l>
<l>The mind's intelligence is now awake,</l>
<l>Still for no other reason, save that these-</l>
<l>The self-same films as when we are awake-</l>
<l>Assail our minds, to such degree indeed</l>
<l>That we do seem to see for sure the man</l>
<l>Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained</l>
<l>Dominion over. And nature forces this</l>
<l>To come to pass because the body's senses</l>
<l>Are resting, thwarted through the members all,</l>
<l>Unable now to conquer false with true;</l>
<l>And memory lies prone and languishes</l>
<l>In slumber, nor protests that he, the man</l>
<l>Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since</l>
<l>Hath been the gain of death and dissolution.</l>
<l rend="indent">  And further, 'tis no marvel idols move</l>
<l>And toss their arms and other members round</l>
<l>In rhythmic time- and often in men's sleeps</l>
<l>It haps an image this is seen to do;</l>
<l>In sooth, when perishes the former image,</l>
<l>And other is gendered of another pose,</l>
<l>That former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</l>
<l>Of course the change must be conceived as speedy;</l>
<l>So great the swiftness and so great the store</l>
<l>Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief</l>
<l>As mind can mark) so great, again, the store</l>
<l>Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies.</l>
<l rend="indent">  It happens also that there is supplied</l>
<l>Sometimes an image not of kind the same;</l>
<l>But what before was woman, now at hand</l>
<l>Is seen to stand there, altered into male;</l>
<l>Or other visage, other age succeeds;</l>
<l>But slumber and oblivion take care</l>
<l>That we shall feel no wonder at the thing.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="777"/>
<l rend="indent">  And much in these affairs demands inquiry,</l>
<l>And much, illumination- if we crave</l>
<l>With plainness to exhibit facts. And first,</l>
<l>Why doth the mind of one to whom the whim</l>
<l>To think has come behold forthwith that thing?</l>
<l>Or do the idols watch upon our will,</l>
<l>And doth an image unto us occur,</l>
<l>Directly we desire- if heart prefer</l>
<l>The sea, the land, or after all the sky?</l>
<l>Assemblies of the citizens, parades,</l>
<l>Banquets, and battles, these and all doth she,</l>
<l>Nature, create and furnish at our word?-</l>
<l>Maugre the fact that in same place and spot</l>
<l>Another's mind is meditating things</l>
<l>All far unlike. And what, again, of this:</l>
<l>When we in sleep behold the idols step,</l>
<l>In measure, forward, moving supple limbs,</l>
<l>Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn</l>
<l>With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads</l>
<l>Repeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?</l>
<l>Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,</l>
<l>And wander to and fro well taught indeed,-</l>
<l>Thus to be able in the time of night</l>
<l>To make such games! Or will the truth be this:</l>
<l>Because in one least moment that we mark-</l>
<l>That is, the uttering of a single sound-</l>
<l>There lurk yet many moments, which the reason</l>
<l>Discovers to exist, therefore it comes</l>
<l>That, in a moment how so brief ye will,</l>
<l>The divers idols are hard by, and ready</l>
<l>Each in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,</l>
<l>So great, again, the store of idol-things,</l>
<l>And so, when perishes the former image,</l>
<l>And other is gendered of another pose,</l>
<l>The former seemeth to have changed its gestures.</l>
<l>And since they be so tenuous, mind can mark</l>
<l>Sharply alone the ones it strains to see;</l>
<l>And thus the rest do perish one and all,</l>
<l>Save those for which the mind prepares itself.</l>
<l>Further, it doth prepare itself indeed,</l>
<l>And hopes to see what follows after each-</l>
<l>Hence this result. For hast thou not observed</l>
<l>How eyes, essaying to perceive the fine,</l>
<l>Will strain in preparation, otherwise</l>
<l>Unable sharply to perceive at all?</l>
<l>Yet know thou canst that, even in objects plain,</l>
<l>If thou attendest not, 'tis just the same</l>
<l>As if 'twere all the time removed and far.</l>
<l>What marvel, then, that mind doth lose the rest,</l>
<l>Save those to which 'thas given up itself?</l>
<l>So 'tis that we conjecture from small signs</l>
<l>Things wide and weighty, and involve ourselves</l>
<l>In snarls of self-deceit.</l>

<p>SOME VITAL FUNCTIONS</p>

<l rend="indent">                           In these affairs</l>
<l>We crave that thou wilt passionately flee</l>
<l>The one offence, and anxiously wilt shun</l>
<l>The error of presuming the clear lights</l>
<l>Of eyes created were that we might see;</l>
<l>Or thighs and knees, aprop upon the feet,</l>
<l>Thuswise can bended be, that we might step</l>
<l>With goodly strides ahead; or forearms joined</l>
<l>Unto the sturdy uppers, or serving hands</l>
<l>On either side were given, that we might do</l>
<l>Life's own demands. All such interpretation</l>
<l>Is aft-for-fore with inverse reasoning,</l>
<l>Since naught is born in body so that we</l>
<l>May use the same, but birth engenders use:</l>
<l>No seeing ere the lights of eyes were born,</l>
<l>No speaking ere the tongue created was;</l>
<l>But origin of tongue came long before</l>
<l>Discourse of words, and ears created were</l>
<l>Much earlier than any sound was heard;</l>
<l>And all the members, so meseems, were there</l>
<l>Before they got their use: and therefore, they</l>
<l>Could not be gendered for the sake of use.</l>
<l>But contrariwise, contending in the fight</l>
<l>With hand to hand, and rending of the joints,</l>
<l>And fouling of the limbs with gore, was there,</l>
<l>O long before the gleaming spears ere flew;</l>
<l>And nature prompted man to shun a wound,</l>
<l>Before the left arm by the aid of art</l>
<l>Opposed the shielding targe. And, verily,</l>
<l>Yielding the weary body to repose,</l>
<l>Far ancienter than cushions of soft beds,</l>
<l>And quenching thirst is earlier than cups.</l>
<l>These objects, therefore, which for use and life</l>
<l>Have been devised, can be conceived as found</l>
<l>For sake of using. But apart from such</l>
<l>Are all which first were born and afterwards</l>
<l>Gave knowledge of their own utility-</l>
<l>Chief in which sort we note the senses, limbs:</l>
<l>Wherefore, again, 'tis quite beyond thy power</l>
<l>To hold that these could thus have been create</l>
<l>For office of utility.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="858"/>
<l rend="indent">                        Likewise,</l>
<l>'Tis nothing strange that all the breathing creatures</l>
<l>Seek, even by nature of their frame, their food.</l>
<l>Yes, since I've taught thee that from off the things</l>
<l>Stream and depart innumerable bodies</l>
<l>In modes innumerable too; but most</l>
<l>Must be the bodies streaming from the living-</l>
<l>Which bodies, vexed by motion evermore,</l>
<l>Are through the mouth exhaled innumerable,</l>
<l>When weary creatures pant, or through the sweat</l>
<l>Squeezed forth innumerable from deep within.</l>
<l>Thus body rarefies, so undermined</l>
<l>In all its nature, and pain attends its state.</l>
<l>And so the food is taken to underprop</l>
<l>The tottering joints, and by its interfusion</l>
<l>To re-create their powers, and there stop up</l>
<l>The longing, open-mouthed through limbs and veins,</l>
<l>For eating. And the moist no less departs</l>
<l>Into all regions that demand the moist;</l>
<l>And many heaped-up particles of hot,</l>
<l>Which cause such burnings in these bellies of ours,</l>
<l>The liquid on arriving dissipates</l>
<l>And quenches like a fire, that parching heat</l>
<l>No longer now can scorch the frame. And so,</l>
<l>Thou seest how panting thirst is washed away</l>
<l>From off our body, how the hunger-pang</l>
<l>It, too, appeased.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="877"/>
<l rend="indent">                     Now, how it comes that we,</l>
<l>Whene'er we wish, can step with strides ahead,</l>
<l>And how 'tis given to move our limbs about,</l>
<l>And what device is wont to push ahead</l>
<l>This the big load of our corporeal frame,</l>
<l>I'll say to thee- do thou attend what's said.</l>
<l>I say that first some idol-films of walking</l>
<l>Into our mind do fall and smite the mind,</l>
<l>As said before. Thereafter will arises;</l>
<l>For no one starts to do a thing, before</l>
<l>The intellect previsions what it wills;</l>
<l>And what it there pre-visioneth depends</l>
<l>On what that image is. When, therefore, mind</l>
<l>Doth so bestir itself that it doth will</l>
<l>To go and step along, it strikes at once</l>
<l>That energy of soul that's sown about</l>
<l>In all the body through the limbs and frame-</l>
<l>And this is easy of performance, since</l>
<l>The soul is close conjoined with the mind.</l>
<l>Next, soul in turn strikes body, and by degrees</l>
<l>Thus the whole mass is pushed along and moved.</l>
<l>Then too the body rarefies, and air,</l>
<l>Forsooth as ever of such nimbleness,</l>
<l>Comes on and penetrates aboundingly</l>
<l>Through opened pores, and thus is sprinkled round</l>
<l>Unto all smallest places in our frame.</l>
<l>Thus then by these twain factors, severally,</l>
<l>Body is borne like ship with oars and wind.</l>
<l>Nor yet in these affairs is aught for wonder</l>
<l>That particles so fine can whirl around</l>
<l>So great a body and turn this weight of ours;</l>
<l>For wind, so tenuous with its subtle body,</l>
<l>Yet pushes, driving on the mighty ship</l>
<l>Of mighty bulk; one hand directs the same,</l>
<l>Whatever its momentum, and one helm</l>
<l>Whirls it around, whither ye please; and loads,</l>
<l>Many and huge, are moved and hoisted high</l>
<l>By enginery of pulley-blocks and wheels,</l>
<l>With but light strain.</l>

<l>Pours through our members waters of repose</l>
<l>And frees the breast from cares of mind, I'll tell</l>
<l>In verses sweeter than they many are;</l>
<l>Even as the swan's slight note is better far</l>
<l>Than that dispersed clamour of the cranes</l>
<l>Among the southwind's aery clouds. Do thou</l>
<l>Give me sharp ears and a sagacious mind,-</l>
<l>That thou mayst not deny the things to be</l>
<l>Whereof I'm speaking, nor depart away</l>
<l>With bosom scorning these the spoken truths,</l>
<l>Thyself at fault unable to perceive.</l>
<l>Sleep chiefly comes when energy of soul</l>
<l>Hath now been scattered through the frame, and part</l>
<l>Expelled abroad and gone away, and part</l>
<l>Crammed back and settling deep within the frame-</l>
<l>Whereafter then our loosened members droop.</l>
<l>For doubt is none that by the work of soul</l>
<l>Exist in us this sense, and when by slumber</l>
<l>That sense is thwarted, we are bound to think</l>
<l>The soul confounded and expelled abroad-</l>
<l>Yet not entirely, else the frame would lie</l>
<l>Drenched in the everlasting cold of death.</l>
<l>In sooth, where no one part of soul remained</l>
<l>Lurking among the members, even as fire</l>
<l>Lurks buried under many ashes, whence</l>
<l>Could sense amain rekindled be in members,</l>
<l>As flame can rise anew from unseen fire?</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="929"/>
<l rend="indent">  By what devices this strange state and new</l>
<l>May be occasioned, and by what the soul</l>
<l>Can be confounded and the frame grow faint,</l>
<l>I will untangle: see to it, thou, that I</l>
<l>Pour forth my words not unto empty winds.</l>
<l>In first place, body on its outer parts-</l>
<l>Since these are touched by neighbouring aery gusts-</l>
<l>Must there be thumped and strook by blows of air</l>
<l>Repeatedly. And therefore almost all</l>
<l>Are covered either with hides, or else with shells,</l>
<l>Or with the horny callus, or with bark.</l>
<l>Yet this same air lashes their inner parts,</l>
<l>When creatures draw a breath or blow it out.</l>
<l>Wherefore, since body thus is flogged alike</l>
<l>Upon the inside and the out, and blows</l>
<l>Come in upon us through the little pores</l>
<l>Even inward to our body's primal parts</l>
<l>And primal elements, there comes to pass</l>
<l>By slow degrees, along our members then,</l>
<l>A kind of overthrow; for then confounded</l>
<l>Are those arrangements of the primal germs</l>
<l>Of body and of mind. It comes to pass</l>
<l>That next a part of soul's expelled abroad,</l>
<l>A part retreateth in recesses hid,</l>
<l>A part, too, scattered all about the frame,</l>
<l>Cannot become united nor engage</l>
<l>In interchange of motion. Nature now</l>
<l>So hedges off approaches and the paths;</l>
<l>And thus the sense, its motions all deranged,</l>
<l>Retires down deep within; and since there's naught,</l>
<l>As 'twere, to prop the frame, the body weakens,</l>
<l>And all the members languish, and the arms</l>
<l>And eyelids fall, and, as ye lie abed,</l>
<l>Even there the houghs will sag and loose their powers.</l>
<l>Again, sleep follows after food, because</l>
<l>The food produces same result as air,</l>
<l>Whilst being scattered round through all the veins;</l>
<l>And much the heaviest is that slumber which,</l>
<l>Full or fatigued, thou takest; since 'tis then</l>
<l>That the most bodies disarrange themselves,</l>
<l>Bruised by labours hard. And in same wise,</l>
<l>This three-fold change: a forcing of the soul</l>
<l>Down deeper, more a casting-forth of it,</l>
<l>A moving more divided in its parts</l>
<l>And scattered more.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="962"/>
<l rend="indent">                      And to whate'er pursuit</l>
<l>A man most clings absorbed, or what the affairs</l>
<l>On which we theretofore have tarried much,</l>
<l>And mind hath strained upon the more, we seem</l>
<l>In sleep not rarely to go at the same.</l>
<l>The lawyers seem to plead and cite decrees,</l>
<l>Commanders they to fight and go at frays,</l>
<l>Sailors to live in combat with the winds,</l>
<l>And we ourselves indeed to make this book,</l>
<l>And still to seek the nature of the world</l>
<l>And set it down, when once discovered, here</l>
<l>In these my country's leaves. Thus all pursuits,</l>
<l>All arts in general seem in sleeps to mock</l>
<l>And master the minds of men. And whosoever</l>
<l>Day after day for long to games have given</l>
<l>Attention undivided, still they keep</l>
<l>(As oft we note), even when they've ceased to grasp</l>
<l>Those games with their own senses, open paths</l>
<l>Within the mind wherethrough the idol-films</l>
<l>Of just those games can come. And thus it is</l>
<l>For many a day thereafter those appear</l>
<l>Floating before the eyes, that even awake</l>
<l>They think they view the dancers moving round</l>
<l>Their supple limbs, and catch with both the ears</l>
<l>The liquid song of harp and speaking chords,</l>
<l>And view the same assembly on the seats,</l>
<l>And manifold bright glories of the stage-</l>
<l>So great the influence of pursuit and zest,</l>
<l>And of the affairs wherein 'thas been the wont</l>
<l>Of men to be engaged-nor only men,</l>
<l>But soothly all the animals. Behold,</l>
<l>Thou'lt see the sturdy horses, though outstretched,</l>
<l>Yet sweating in their sleep, and panting ever,</l>
<l>And straining utmost strength, as if for prize,</l>
<l>As if, with barriers opened now...</l>
<l>And hounds of huntsmen oft in soft repose</l>
<l>Yet toss asudden all their legs about,</l>
<l>And growl and bark, and with their nostrils sniff</l>
<l>The winds again, again, as though indeed</l>
<l>They'd caught the scented foot-prints of wild beasts,</l>
<l>And, even when wakened, often they pursue</l>
<l>The phantom images of stags, as though</l>
<l>They did perceive them fleeing on before,</l>
<l>Until the illusion's shaken off and dogs</l>
<l>Come to themselves again. And fawning breed</l>
<l>Of house-bred whelps do feel the sudden urge</l>
<l>To shake their bodies and start from off the ground,</l>
<l>As if beholding stranger-visages.</l>
<l>And ever the fiercer be the stock, the more</l>
<l>In sleep the same is ever bound to rage.</l>
<l>But flee the divers tribes of birds and vex</l>
<l>With sudden wings by night the groves of gods,</l>
<l>When in their gentle slumbers they have dreamed</l>
<l>Of hawks in chase, aswooping on for fight.</l>
<l>Again, the minds of mortals which perform</l>
<l>With mighty motions mighty enterprises,</l>
<l>Often in sleep will do and dare the same</l>
<l>In manner like. Kings take the towns by storm,</l>
<l>Succumb to capture, battle on the field,</l>
<l>Raise a wild cry as if their throats were cut</l>
<l>Even then and there. And many wrestle on</l>
<l>And groan with pains, and fill all regions round</l>
<l>With mighty cries and wild, as if then gnawed</l>
<l>By fangs of panther or of lion fierce.</l>
<l>Many amid their slumbers talk about</l>
<l>Their mighty enterprises, and have often</l>
<l>Enough become the proof of their own crimes.</l>
<l>Many meet death; many, as if headlong</l>
<l>From lofty mountains tumbling down to earth</l>
<l>With all their frame, are frenzied in their fright;</l>
<l>And after sleep, as if still mad in mind,</l>
<l>They scarce come to, confounded as they are</l>
<l>By ferment of their frame. The thirsty man,</l>
<l>Likewise, he sits beside delightful spring</l>
<l>Or river and gulpeth down with gaping throat</l>
<l>Nigh the whole stream. And oft the innocent young,</l>
<l>By sleep o'ermastered, think they lift their dress</l>
<l>By pail or public jordan and then void</l>
<l>The water filtered down their frame entire</l>
<l>And drench the Babylonian coverlets,</l>
<l>Magnificently bright. Again, those males</l>
<l>Into the surging channels of whose years</l>
<l>Now first has passed the seed (engendered</l>
<l>Within their members by the ripened days)</l>
<l>Are in their sleep confronted from without</l>
<l>By idol-images of some fair form-</l>
<l>Tidings of glorious face and lovely bloom,</l>
<l>Which stir and goad the regions turgid now</l>
<l>With seed abundant; so that, as it were</l>
<l>With all the matter acted duly out,</l>
<l>They pour the billows of a potent stream</l>
<l>And stain their garment.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1037"/>
<l rend="indent">                         And as said before,</l>
<l>That seed is roused in us when once ripe age</l>
<l>Has made our body strong...</l>
<l>As divers causes give to divers things</l>
<l>Impulse and irritation, so one force</l>
<l>In human kind rouses the human seed</l>
<l>To spurt from man. As soon as ever it issues,</l>
<l>Forced from its first abodes, it passes down</l>
<l>In the whole body through the limbs and frame,</l>
<l>Meeting in certain regions of our thews,</l>
<l>And stirs amain the genitals of man.</l>
<l>The goaded regions swell with seed, and then</l>
<l>Comes the delight to dart the same at what</l>
<l>The mad desire so yearns, and body seeks</l>
<l>That object, whence the mind by love is pierced.</l>
<l>For well-nigh each man falleth toward his wound,</l>
<l>And our blood spurts even toward the spot from whence</l>
<l>The stroke wherewith we are strook, and if indeed</l>
<l>The foe be close, the red jet reaches him.</l>
<l>Thus, one who gets a stroke from <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>' shafts-</l>
<l>Whether a boy with limbs effeminate</l>
<l>Assault him, or a woman darting love</l>
<l>From all her body- that one strains to get</l>
<l>Even to the thing whereby he's hit, and longs</l>
<l>To join with it and cast into its frame</l>
<l>The fluid drawn even from within its own.</l>
<l>For the mute craving doth presage delight.</l>

<p>THE PASSION OF LOVE</p>

<l rend="indent">  This craving 'tis that's <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> unto us:</l>
<l>From this, engender all the lures of love,</l>
<l>From this, O first hath into human hearts</l>
<l>Trickled that drop of joyance which ere long</l>
<l>Is by chill care succeeded. Since, indeed,</l>
<l>Though she thou lovest now be far away,</l>
<l>Yet idol-images of her are near</l>
<l>And the sweet name is floating in thy ear.</l>
<l>But it behooves to flee those images;</l>
<l>And scare afar whatever feeds thy love;</l>
<l>And turn elsewhere thy mind; and vent the sperm,</l>
<l>Within thee gathered, into sundry bodies,</l>
<l>Nor, with thy thoughts still busied with one love,</l>
<l>Keep it for one delight, and so store up</l>
<l>Care for thyself and pain inevitable.</l>
<l>For, lo, the ulcer just by nourishing</l>
<l>Grows to more life with deep inveteracy,</l>
<l>And day by day the fury swells aflame,</l>
<l>And the woe waxes heavier day by day-</l>
<l>Unless thou dost destroy even by new blows</l>
<l>The former wounds of love, and curest them</l>
<l>While yet they're fresh, by wandering freely round</l>
<l>After the freely-wandering <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>, or</l>
<l>Canst lead elsewhere the tumults of thy mind.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1073"/>
<l rend="indent">  Nor doth that man who keeps away from love</l>
<l>Yet lack the fruits of <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>; rather takes</l>
<l>Those pleasures which are free of penalties.</l>
<l>For the delights of Venus, verily,</l>
<l>Are more unmixed for mortals sane-of-soul</l>
<l>Than for those sick-at-heart with love-pining.</l>
<l>Yea, in the very moment of possessing,</l>
<l>Surges the heat of lovers to and fro,</l>
<l>Restive, uncertain; and they cannot fix</l>
<l>On what to first enjoy with eyes and hands.</l>
<l>The parts they sought for, those they squeeze so tight,</l>
<l>And pain the creature's body, close their teeth</l>
<l>Often against her lips, and smite with kiss</l>
<l>Mouth into mouth,- because this same delight</l>
<l>Is not unmixed; and underneath are stings</l>
<l>Which goad a man to hurt the very thing,</l>
<l>Whate'er it be, from whence arise for him</l>
<l>Those germs of madness. But with gentle touch</l>
<l>Venus subdues the pangs in midst of love,</l>
<l>And the admixture of a fondling joy</l>
<l>Doth curb the bites of passion. For they hope</l>
<l>That by the very body whence they caught</l>
<l>The heats of love their flames can be put out.</l>
<l>But nature protests 'tis all quite otherwise;</l>
<l>For this same love it is the one sole thing</l>
<l>Of which, the more we have, the fiercer burns</l>
<l>The breast with fell desire. For food and drink</l>
<l>Are taken within our members; and, since they</l>
<l>Can stop up certain parts, thus, easily</l>
<l>Desire of water is glutted and of bread.</l>
<l>But, lo, from human face and lovely bloom</l>
<l>Naught penetrates our frame to be enjoyed</l>
<l>Save flimsy idol-images and vain-</l>
<l>A sorry hope which oft the winds disperse.</l>
<l>As when the thirsty man in slumber seeks</l>
<l>To drink, and water ne'er is granted him</l>
<l>Wherewith to quench the heat within his members,</l>
<l>But after idols of the liquids strives</l>
<l>And toils in vain, and thirsts even whilst he gulps</l>
<l>In middle of the torrent, thus in love</l>
<l>Venus deludes with idol-images</l>
<l>The lovers. Nor they cannot sate their lust</l>
<l>By merely gazing on the bodies, nor</l>
<l>They cannot with their palms and fingers rub</l>
<l>Aught from each tender limb, the while they stray</l>
<l>Uncertain over all the body. Then,</l>
<l>At last, with members intertwined, when they</l>
<l>Enjoy the flower of their age, when now</l>
<l>Their bodies have sweet presage of keen joys,</l>
<l>And Venus is about to sow the fields</l>
<l>Of woman, greedily their frames they lock,</l>
<l>And mingle the slaver of their mouths, and breathe</l>
<l>Into each other, pressing teeth on mouths-</l>
<l>Yet to no purpose, since they're powerless</l>
<l>To rub off aught, or penetrate and pass</l>
<l>With body entire into body- for oft</l>
<l>They seem to strive and struggle thus to do;</l>
<l>So eagerly they cling in Venus' bonds,</l>
<l>Whilst melt away their members, overcome</l>
<l>By violence of delight. But when at last</l>
<l>Lust, gathered in the thews, hath spent itself,</l>
<l>There come a brief pause in the raging heat-</l>
<l>But then a madness just the same returns</l>
<l>And that old fury visits them again,</l>
<l>When once again they seek and crave to reach</l>
<l>They know not what, all powerless to find</l>
<l>The artifice to subjugate the bane.</l>
<l>In such uncertain state they waste away</l>
<l>With unseen wound.</l>

<l>Neglected languish and their honest name</l>
<l>Reeleth sick, sick; and meantime their estates</l>
<l>Are lost in Babylonian tapestries;</l>

<l>Laugh on her feet; and (as ye may be sure)</l>
<l>Big emeralds of green light are set in gold;</l>
<l>And rich sea-purple dress by constant wear</l>
<l>Grows shabby and all soaked with Venus' sweat;</l>
<l>And the well-earned ancestral property</l>
<l>Becometh head-bands, coifs, and many a time</l>
<l>The cloaks, or garments Alidensian</l>
<l>Or of the Cean isle. And banquets, set</l>
<l>With rarest cloth and viands, are prepared-</l>
<l>And games of chance, and many a drinking cup,</l>
<l>And unguents, crowns and garlands. All in vain,</l>
<l>Since from amid the well-spring of delights</l>
<l>Bubbles some drop of bitter to torment</l>
<l>Among the very flowers- when haply mind</l>
<l>Gnaws into self, now stricken with remorse</l>
<l>For slothful years and ruin in baudels,</l>
<l>Or else because she's left him all in doubt</l>
<l>By launching some sly word, which still like fire</l>
<l>Lives wildly, cleaving to his eager heart;</l>
<l>Or else because he thinks she darts her eyes</l>
<l>Too much about and gazes at another,-</l>
<l>And in her face sees traces of a laugh.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1141"/>
<l rend="indent">  These ills are found in prospering love and true;</l>
<l>But in crossed love and helpless there be such</l>
<l>As through shut eyelids thou canst still take in-</l>
<l>Uncounted ills; so that 'tis better far</l>
<l>To watch beforehand, in the way I've shown,</l>
<l>And guard against enticements. For to shun</l>
<l>A fall into the hunting-snares of love</l>
<l>Is not so hard, as to get out again,</l>
<l>When tangled in the very nets, and burst</l>
<l>The stoutly-knotted cords of Aphrodite.</l>
<l>Yet even when there enmeshed with tangled feet,</l>
<l>Still canst thou scape the danger-lest indeed</l>
<l>Thou standest in the way of thine own good,</l>
<l>And overlookest first all blemishes</l>
<l>Of mind and body of thy much preferred,</l>
<l>Desirable dame. For so men do,</l>
<l>Eyeless with passion, and assign to them</l>
<l>Graces not theirs in fact. And thus we see</l>
<l>Creatures in many a wise crooked and ugly</l>
<l>The prosperous sweethearts in a high esteem;</l>
<l>And lovers gird each other and advise</l>
<l>To placate Venus, since their friends are smit</l>

<l>Who seldom mark their own worst bane of all.</l>

<l>All, as the ugly creature, and she scents,</l>
<l>Yes she, her wretched self with vile perfumes;</l>
<l>Whom even her handmaids flee and giggle at</l>
<l>Behind her back. But he, the lover, in tears</l>
<l>Because shut out, covers her threshold o'er</l>
<l>Often with flowers and garlands, and anoints</l>
<l>Her haughty door-posts with the marjoram,</l>
<l>And prints, poor fellow, kisses on the doors-</l>
<l>Admitted at last, if haply but one whiff</l>
<l>Got to him on approaching, he would seek</l>

<l>Down at his heels; and there he'd damn himself</l>
<l>For his fatuity, observing how</l>
<l>He had assigned to that same lady more-</l>
<l>Than it is proper to concede to mortals.</l>
<l>And these our Venuses are 'ware of this.</l>

<l>Are seen to matter vastly here; and some</l>
<l>Impregnate some more readily, and from some</l>
<l>Some women conceive more readily and become</l>
<l>Pregnant. And many women, sterile before</l>
<l>In several marriage-beds, have yet thereafter</l>
<l>Obtained the mates from whom they could conceive</l>
<l>The baby-boys, and with sweet progeny</l>
<l>Grow rich. And even for husbands (whose own wives,</l>
<l>Although of fertile wombs, have borne for them</l>
<l>No babies in the house) are also found</l>
<l>Concordant natures so that they at last</l>
<l>Can bulwark their old age with goodly sons.</l>
<l>A matter of great moment 'tis in truth,</l>
<l>That seeds may mingle readily with seeds</l>
<l>Suited for procreation, and that thick</l>
<l>Should mix with fluid seeds, with thick the fluid.</l>
<l>And in this business 'tis of some import</l>
<l>Upon what diet life is nourished:</l>
<l>For some foods thicken seeds within our members,</l>
<l>And others thin them out and waste away.</l>
<l>And in what modes the fond delight itself</l>
<l>Is carried on- this too importeth vastly.</l>
<l>For commonly 'tis thought that wives conceive</l>
<l>More readily in manner of wild-beasts,</l>
<l>After the custom of the four-foot breeds,</l>
<l>Because so postured, with the breasts beneath</l>
<l>And buttocks then upreared, the seeds can take</l>
<l>Their proper places. Nor is need the least</l>
<l>For wives to use the motions of blandishment;</l>
<l>For thus the woman hinders and resists</l>
<l>Her own conception, if too joyously</l>
<l>Herself she treats the <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> of the man</l>
<l>With haunches heaving, and with all her bosom</l>
<l>Now yielding like the billows of the sea-</l>
<l>Aye, from the ploughshare's even course and track</l>
<l>She throws the furrow, and from proper places</l>
<l>Deflects the spurt of seed. And courtesans</l>
<l>Are thuswise wont to move for their own ends,</l>
<l>To keep from pregnancy and lying in,</l>
<l>And all the while to render <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> more</l>
<l>A pleasure for the men- the which meseems</l>
<l>Our wives have never need of.</l>

<l>O who can build with puissant breast a song</l>
<l>Worthy the majesty of these great finds?</l>
<l>Or who in words so strong that he can frame</l>
<l>The fit laudations for deserts of him</l>
<l>Who left us heritors of such vast prizes,</l>
<l>By his own breast discovered and sought out?-</l>
<l>There shall be none, methinks, of mortal stock.</l>
<l>For if must needs be named for him the name</l>
<l>Demanded by the now known majesty</l>
<l>Of these high matters, then a god was he,-</l>
<l>Hear me, illustrious Memmius- a god;</l>
<l>Who first and chief found out that plan of life</l>
<l>Which now is called philosophy, and who</l>
<l>By cunning craft, out of such mighty waves,</l>
<l>Out of such mighty darkness, moored life</l>
<l>In havens so serene, in light so clear.</l>
<l>Compare those old discoveries divine</l>
<l>Of others: lo, according to the tale,</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2068435">Ceres</placeName> established for mortality</l>

<l>Though life might yet without these things abide,</l>
<l>Even as report saith now some peoples live.</l>
<l>But man's well-being was impossible</l>
<l>Without a breast all free. Wherefore the more</l>
<l>That man doth justly seem to us a god,</l>
<l>From whom sweet solaces of life, afar</l>
<l>Distributed o'er populous domains,</l>
<l>Now soothe the minds of men. But if thou thinkest</l>
<l>Labours of <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> excel the same,</l>
<l>Much farther from true reasoning thou farest.</l>
<l>For what could hurt us now that mighty maw</l>
<l>Of Nemeaean Lion, or what the Boar</l>
<l>Who bristled in <placeName key="tgn,2094818">Arcadia</placeName>? Or, again,</l>

<l>So dreadfully offend us, or the Steeds</l>
<l>Of Thracian Diomedes breathing fire</l>
<l>From out their nostrils off along the zones</l>
<l>Bistonian and Ismarian? And the Snake,</l>
<l>The dread fierce gazer, guardian of the golden</l>

<l>O what, again, could he inflict on us</l>
<l>Along the <placeName key="tgn,1002157">Atlantic</placeName> shore and wastes of sea?-</l>
<l>Where neither one of us approacheth nigh</l>
<l>Nor no barbarian ventures. And the rest</l>
<l>Of all those monsters slain, even if alive,</l>
<l>Unconquered still, what injury could they do?</l>
<l>None, as I guess. For so the glutted earth</l>
<l>Swarms even now with savage beasts, even now</l>
<l>Is filled with anxious terrors through the woods</l>
<l>And mighty mountains and the forest deeps-</l>
<l>Quarters 'tis ours in general to avoid.</l>
<l>But lest the breast be purged, what conflicts then,</l>
<l>What perils, must bosom, in our own despite!</l>
<l>O then how great and keen the cares of lust</l>
<l>That split the man distraught! How great the fears!</l>
<l>And lo, the pride, grim greed, and wantonness-</l>
<l>How great the slaughters in their train! and lo,</l>

<l>Thus far we've gone; the order of my plan</l>

<l>Must make report how, too, the universe</l>
<l>Consists of mortal body, born in time,</l>
<l>And in what modes that congregated stuff</l>
<l>Established itself as earth and sky,</l>
<l>Ocean, and stars, and sun, and ball of moon;</l>
<l>And then what living creatures rose from out</l>
<l>The old telluric places, and what ones</l>
<l>Were never born at all; and in what mode</l>
<l>The human race began to name its things</l>
<l>And use the varied speech from man to man;</l>
<l>And in what modes hath bosomed in their breasts</l>
<l>That awe of gods, which halloweth in all lands</l>
<l>Fanes, altars, groves, lakes, idols of the gods.</l>
<l>Also I shall untangle by what power</l>
<l>The steersman nature guides the sun's courses,</l>
<l>And the meanderings of the moon, lest we,</l>
<l>Percase, should fancy that of own free will</l>
<l>They circle their perennial courses round,</l>
<l>Timing their motions for increase of crops</l>
<l>And living creatures, or lest we should think</l>
<l>They roll along by any plan of gods.</l>
<l>For even those men who have learned full well</l>
<l>That godheads lead a long life free of care,</l>
<l>If yet meanwhile they wonder by what plan</l>
<l>Things can go on (and chiefly yon high things</l>
<l>Observed o'erhead on the ethereal coasts),</l>
<l>Again are hurried back unto the fears</l>
<l>Of old religion and adopt again</l>
<l>Harsh masters, deemed almighty,- wretched men,</l>
<l>Unwitting what can be and what cannot,</l>
<l>And by what law to each its scope prescribed,</l>
<l>Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.</l>

<l rend="indent">  But for the rest,- lest we delay thee here</l>
<l>Longer by empty promises- behold,</l>
<l>Before all else, the seas, the lands, the sky:</l>
<l>O Memmius, their threefold nature, lo,</l>
<l>Their bodies three, three aspects so unlike,</l>
<l>Three frames so vast, a single day shall give</l>
<l>Unto annihilation! Then shall crash</l>
<l>That massive form and fabric of the world</l>
<l>Sustained so many aeons! Nor do I</l>
<l>Fail to perceive how strange and marvellous</l>
<l>This fact must strike the intellect of man,-</l>
<l>Annihilation of the sky and earth</l>
<l>That is to be,- and with what toil of words</l>

<l>Subject it to the view of eyes for him</l>
<l>Nor put it into hand- the sight and touch,</l>
<l>Whereby the opened highways of belief</l>
<l>Lead most directly into human breast</l>
<l>And regions of intelligence. But yet</l>
<l>I will speak out. The fact itself, perchance,</l>
<l>Will force belief in these my words, and thou</l>
<l>Mayst see, in little time, tremendously</l>
<l>With risen commotions of the lands all things</l>
<l>Quaking to pieces- which afar from us</l>
<l>May she, the steersman Nature, guide: and may</l>

<l>Persuade us that all things can be o'erthrown</l>
<l>And sink with awful-sounding breakage down!</l>

<l rend="indent">  But ere on this I take a step to utter</l>
<l>Oracles holier and soundlier based</l>
<l>Than ever the Pythian pronounced for men</l>
<l>From out the tripod and the Delphian laurel,</l>
<l>I will unfold for thee with learned words</l>
<l>Many a consolation, lest perchance,</l>
<l>Still bridled by religion, thou suppose</l>
<l>Lands, sun, and sky, sea, constellations, moon,</l>
<l>Must dure forever, as of frame divine-</l>
<l>And so conclude that it is just that those,</l>
<l>(After the manner of the Giants), should all</l>
<l>Pay the huge penalties for monstrous crime,</l>
<l>Who by their reasonings do overshake</l>
<l>The ramparts of the universe and wish</l>
<l>There to put out the splendid sun of heaven,</l>
<l>Branding with mortal talk immortal things-</l>
<l>Though these same things are even so far removed</l>
<l>From any touch of deity and seem</l>
<l>So far unworthy of numbering with the gods,</l>
<l>That well they may be thought to furnish rather</l>
<l>A goodly instance of the sort of things</l>
<l>That lack the living motion, living sense.</l>
<l>For sure 'tis quite beside the mark to think</l>
<l>That judgment and the nature of the mind</l>
<l>In any kind of body can exist-</l>
<l>Just as in ether can't exist a tree,</l>
<l>Nor clouds in the salt sea, nor in the fields</l>
<l>Can fishes live, nor blood in timber be,</l>
<l>Nor sap in boulders: fixed and arranged</l>
<l>Where everything may grow and have its place.</l>
<l>Thus nature of mind cannot arise alone</l>
<l>Without the body, nor have its being far</l>
<l>From thews and blood. Yet if 'twere possible?-</l>
<l>Much rather might this very power of mind</l>
<l>Be in the head, the shoulders, or the heels,</l>
<l>And, born in any part soever, yet</l>
<l>In the same man, in the same vessel abide</l>
<l>But since within this body even of ours</l>
<l>Stands fixed and appears arranged sure</l>
<l>Where soul and mind can each exist and grow,</l>
<l>Deny we must the more that they can dure</l>
<l>Outside the body and the breathing form</l>
<l>In rotting clods of earth, in the sun's fire,</l>
<l>In water, or in ether's skiey coasts.</l>
<l>Therefore these things no whit are furnished</l>
<l>With sense divine, since never can they be</l>
<l>With life-force quickened.</l>

<l rend="indent">                         Likewise, thou canst ne'er</l>
<l>Believe the sacred seats of gods are here</l>
<l>In any regions of this mundane world;</l>
<l>Indeed, the nature of the gods, so subtle,</l>
<l>So far removed from these our senses, scarce</l>
<l>Is seen even by intelligence of mind.</l>
<l>And since they've ever eluded touch and thrust</l>
<l>Of human hands, they cannot reach to grasp</l>
<l>Aught tangible to us. For what may not</l>
<l>Itself be touched in turn can never touch.</l>
<l>Wherefore, besides, also their seats must be</l>
<l>Unlike these seats of ours,- even subtle too,</l>
<l>As meet for subtle essence- as I'll prove</l>
<l>Hereafter unto thee with large discourse.</l>
<l>Further, to say that for the sake of men</l>
<l>They willed to prepare this world's magnificence,</l>
<l>And that 'tis therefore duty and behoof</l>
<l>To praise the work of gods as worthy praise,</l>
<l>And that 'tis sacrilege for men to shake</l>
<l>Ever by any force from out their seats</l>
<l>What hath been stablished by the Forethought old</l>
<l>To everlasting for races of mankind,</l>
<l>And that 'tis sacrilege to assault by words</l>
<l>And overtopple all from base to beam,-</l>
<l>Memmius, such notions to concoct and pile,</l>
<l>Is verily- to dote. Our gratefulness,</l>
<l>O what emoluments could it confer</l>
<l>Upon Immortals and upon the Blessed</l>
<l>That they should take a step to manage aught</l>
<l>For sake of us? Or what new factor could,</l>
<l>After so long a time, inveigle them-</l>
<l>The hitherto reposeful- to desire</l>
<l>To change their former life? For rather he</l>
<l>Whom old things chafe seems likely to rejoice</l>
<l>At new; but one that in fore-passed time</l>
<l>Hath chanced upon no ill, through goodly years,</l>
<l>O what could ever enkindle in such an one</l>
<l>Passion for strange experiment? Or what</l>
<l>The evil for us, if we had ne'er been born?-</l>
<l>As though, forsooth, in darkling realms and woe</l>
<l>Our life were lying till should dawn at last</l>
<l>The day-spring of creation! Whosoever</l>
<l>Hath been begotten wills perforce to stay</l>
<l>In life, so long as fond delight detains;</l>
<l>But whoso ne'er hath tasted love of life,</l>
<l>And ne'er was in the count of living things,</l>
<l>What hurts it him that he was never born?</l>
<l>Whence, further, first was planted in the gods</l>
<l>The archetype for gendering the world</l>
<l>And the fore-notion of what man is like,</l>
<l>So that they knew and pre-conceived with mind</l>
<l>Just what they wished to make? Or how were known</l>
<l>Ever the energies of primal germs,</l>
<l>And what those germs, by interchange of place,</l>
<l>Could thus produce, if nature's self had not</l>
<l>Given example for creating all?</l>
<l>For in such wise primordials of things,</l>
<l>Many in many modes, astir by blows</l>
<l>From immemorial aeons, in motion too</l>
<l>By their own weights, have evermore been wont</l>
<l>To be so borne along and in all modes</l>
<l>To meet together and to try all sorts</l>
<l>Which, by combining one with other, they</l>
<l>Are powerful to create, that thus it is</l>
<l>No marvel now, if they have also fallen</l>
<l>Into arrangements such, and if they've passed</l>
<l>Into vibrations such, as those whereby</l>
<l>This sum of things is carried on to-day</l>
<l>By fixed renewal.</l>

<l>That in no wise the nature of all things</l>

<l>So great the faults it stands encumbered with.</l>
<l>First, mark all regions which are overarched</l>

<l>And cliffs, and desert fens, and wastes of sea</l>
<l>(Which sunder afar the beaches of the lands)</l>
<l>Possess it merely; and, again, thereof</l>
<l>Well-nigh two-thirds intolerable heat</l>
<l>And a perpetual fall of frost doth rob</l>
<l>From mortal kind. And what is left to till,</l>
<l>Even that the force of nature would o'errun</l>
<l>With brambles, did not human force oppose,-</l>

<l>[The crops] spontaneously could not come up</l>
<l>Into the free bright air. Even then sometimes,</l>
<l>When things acquired by the sternest toil</l>
<l>Are now in leaf, are now in blossom all,</l>
<l>Either the skiey sun with baneful heats</l>
<l>Parches, or sudden rains or chilling rime</l>
<l>Destroys, or flaws of winds with furious whirl</l>
<l>Torment and twist. Beside these matters, why</l>
<l>Doth nature feed and foster on land and sea</l>
<l>The dreadful breed of savage beasts, the foes</l>
<l>Of the human clan? Why do the seasons bring</l>
<l>Distempers with them? Wherefore stalks at large</l>
<l>Death, so untimely? Then, again, the babe,</l>
<l>Like to the castaway of the raging surf,</l>
<l>Lies naked on the ground, speechless, in want</l>
<l>Of every help for life, when nature first</l>
<l>Hath poured him forth upon the shores of light</l>
<l>With birth-pangs from within the mother's womb,</l>
<l>And with a plaintive wail he fills the place,-</l>
<l>As well befitting one for whom remains</l>

<l>Upon the instant. For whatever effulgence</l>

<l>So know thou mayst that things forever need</l>
<l>A fresh replenishment of gleam and glow,</l>
<l>And each effulgence, foremost flashed forth,</l>
<l>Perisheth one by one. Nor otherwise</l>
<l>Can things be seen in sunlight, lest alway</l>
<l>The fountain-head of light supply new light.</l>
<l>Indeed your earthly beacons of the night,</l>

<l>For these consist of seeds more smooth and round</l>
<l>And of much smaller elements than earth.</l>
<l>And thus it was that ether, fraught with fire,</l>
<l>First broke away from out the earthen parts,</l>
<l>Athrough the innumerable pores of earth,</l>
<l>And raised itself aloft, and with itself</l>

<l>Beneath the heavens. And thuswise ether too,</l>
<l>Light and diffusive, with concreted body</l>
<l>On all sides spread, on all sides bent itself</l>
<l>Into a dome, and, far and wide diffused</l>
<l>On unto every region on all sides,</l>
<l>Thus hedged all else within its greedy clasp.</l>
<l>Hard upon ether came the origins</l>
<l>Of sun and moon, whose globes revolve in air</l>
<l>Midway between the earth and mightiest ether,-</l>
<l>For neither took them, since they weighed too little</l>
<l>To sink and settle, but too much to glide</l>

<l>In such a wise midway between the twain</l>
<l>As ever to whirl their living bodies round,</l>
<l>And ever to dure as parts of the wide Whole;</l>
<l>In the same fashion as certain members may</l>

<l>When, then, these substances had been withdrawn,</l>

<l>The earth by lashing it again, again,</l>
<l>Upon its outer edges (so that then,</l>

<l>From an eternal quarter off beyond,</l>

<l>Going wherever their food invites and calls,</l>
<l>And feeding their flaming bodies everywhere</l>

<l>Must vanish bit by bit in weight and lessen,</l>
<l>And have another substance underneath,</l>
<l>Conjoined to it from its earliest age</l>
<l>In linked unison with the vasty world's</l>
<l>Realms of the air in which it roots and lives.</l>
<l>On this account, the earth is not a load,</l>
<l>Nor presses down on winds of air beneath;</l>
<l>Even as unto a man his members be</l>
<l>Without all weight- the head is not a load</l>
<l>Unto the neck; nor do we feel the whole</l>
<l>Weight of the body to centre in the feet.</l>
<l>But whatso weights come on us from without,</l>
<l>Weights laid upon us, these harass and chafe,</l>
<l>Though often far lighter. For to such degree</l>
<l>It matters always what the innate powers</l>

<l>Was, then, no alien substance fetched amain,</l>
<l>And from no alien firmament cast down</l>

<l>Save energy of mind which steers the limbs?</l>
<l>Now seest thou not how powerful may be</l>

<l>Astonishment that yonder sun so small</l>
<l>Can yet send forth so great a light as fills</l>
<l>Oceans and all the lands and sky aflood,</l>
<l>And with its fiery exhalations steeps</l>
<l>The world at large. For it may be, indeed,</l>
<l>That one vast-flowing well-spring of the whole</l>
<l>Wide world from here hath opened and out-gushed,</l>
<l>And shot its light abroad; because thuswise</l>
<l>The elements of fiery exhalations</l>
<l>From all the world around together come,</l>
<l>And thuswise flow into a bulk so big</l>
<l>That from one single fountain-head may stream</l>
<l>This heat and light. And seest thou not, indeed,</l>
<l>How widely one small water-spring may wet</l>
<l>The meadow-lands at times and flood the fields?</l>
<l>'Tis even possible, besides, that heat</l>
<l>From forth the sun's own fire, albeit that fire</l>
<l>Be not a great, may permeate the air</l>
<l>With the fierce hot- if but, perchance, the air</l>
<l>Be of condition and so tempered then</l>
<l>As to be kindled, even when beat upon</l>
<l>Only by little particles of heat-</l>
<l>Just as we sometimes see the standing grain</l>
<l>Or stubble straw in conflagration all</l>
<l>From one lone spark. And possibly the sun,</l>
<l>Agleam on high with rosy lampion,</l>
<l>Possesses about him with invisible heats</l>
<l>A plenteous fire, by no effulgence marked,</l>
<l>So that he maketh, he, the Fraught-with-fire,</l>
<l>Increase to such degree the force of rays.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="614"/>
<l rend="indent">  Nor is there one sure cause revealed to men</l>
<l>How the sun journeys from his summer haunts</l>
<l>On to the mid-most winter turning-points</l>
<l>In Capricorn, the thence reverting veers</l>
<l>Back to solstitial goals of Cancer; nor</l>
<l>How 'tis the moon is seen each month to cross</l>
<l>That very distance which in traversing</l>
<l>The sun consumes the measure of a year.</l>
<l>I say, no one clear reason hath been given</l>
<l>For these affairs. Yet chief in likelihood</l>
<l>Seemeth the doctrine which the holy thought</l>
<l>Of great Democritus lays down: that ever</l>
<l>The nearer the constellations be to earth</l>
<l>The less can they by whirling of the sky</l>
<l>Be borne along, because those skiey powers</l>
<l>Of speed aloft do vanish and decrease</l>
<l>In under-regions, and the sun is thus</l>
<l>Left by degrees behind amongst those signs</l>
<l>That follow after, since the sun he lies</l>
<l>Far down below the starry signs that blaze;</l>
<l>And the moon lags even tardier than the sun:</l>
<l>In just so far as is her course removed</l>
<l>From upper heaven and nigh unto the lands,</l>
<l>In just so far she fails to keep the pace</l>
<l>With starry signs above; for just so far</l>
<l>As feebler is the whirl that bears her on,</l>
<l>(Being, indeed, still lower than the sun),</l>
<l>In just so far do all the starry signs,</l>
<l>Circling around, o'ertake her and o'erpass.</l>
<l>Therefore it happens that the moon appears</l>
<l>More swiftly to return to any sign</l>
<l>Along the Zodiac, than doth the sun,</l>
<l>Because those signs do visit her again</l>
<l>More swiftly than they visit the great sun.</l>
<l>It can be also that two streams of air</l>
<l>Alternately at fixed periods</l>
<l>Blow out from transverse regions of the world,</l>
<l>Of which the one may thrust the sun away</l>
<l>From summer-signs to mid-most winter goals</l>
<l>And rigors of the cold, and the other then</l>
<l>May cast him back from icy shades of chill</l>
<l>Even to the heat-fraught regions and the signs</l>
<l>That blaze along the Zodiac. So, too,</l>
<l>We must suppose the moon and all the stars,</l>
<l>Which through the mighty and sidereal years</l>
<l>Roll round in mighty orbits, may be sped</l>
<l>By streams of air from regions alternate.</l>
<l>Seest thou not also how the clouds be sped</l>
<l>By contrary winds to regions contrary,</l>
<l>The lower clouds diversely from the upper?</l>
<l>Then, why may yonder stars in ether there</l>
<l>Along their mighty orbits not be borne</l>
<l>By currents opposite the one to other?</l>

<l rend="indent">  But night o'erwhelms the lands with vasty murk</l>
<l>Either when sun, after his diurnal course,</l>
<l>Hath walked the ultimate regions of the sky</l>
<l>And wearily hath panted forth his fires,</l>
<l>Shivered by their long journeying and wasted</l>
<l>By traversing the multitudinous air,</l>
<l>Or else because the self-same force that drave</l>
<l>His orb along above the lands compels</l>
<l>Him then to turn his course beneath the lands.</l>
<l>Matuta also at a fixed hour</l>
<l>Spreadeth the roseate morning out along</l>
<l>The coasts of heaven and deploys the light,</l>
<l>Either because the self-same sun, returning</l>
<l>Under the lands, aspires to seize the sky,</l>
<l>Striving to set it blazing with his rays</l>
<l>Ere he himself appear, or else because</l>
<l>Fires then will congregate and many seeds</l>
<l>Of heat are wont, even at a fixed time,</l>
<l>To stream together- gendering evermore</l>
<l>New suns and light. Just so the story goes</l>
<l>That from the Idaean mountain-tops are seen</l>
<l>Dispersed fires upon the break of day</l>
<l>Which thence combine, as 'twere, into one ball</l>
<l>And form an orb. Nor yet in these affairs</l>
<l>Is aught for wonder that these seeds of fire</l>
<l>Can thus together stream at time so fixed</l>
<l>And shape anew the splendour of the sun.</l>
<l>For many facts we see which come to pass</l>
<l>At fixed time in all things: burgeon shrubs</l>
<l>At fixed time, and at a fixed time</l>
<l>They cast their flowers; and Eld commands the teeth,</l>
<l>At time as surely fixed, to drop away,</l>
<l>And Youth commands the growing boy to bloom</l>
<l>With the soft down and let from both his cheeks</l>
<l>The soft beard fall. And lastly, thunder-bolts,</l>
<l>Snow, rains, clouds, winds, at seasons of the year</l>
<l>Nowise unfixed, all do come to pass.</l>
<l>For where, even from their old primordial start</l>
<l>Causes have ever worked in such a way,</l>
<l>And where, even from the world's first origin,</l>
<l>Thuswise have things befallen, so even now</l>
<l>After a fixed order they come round</l>
<l>In sequence also.</l>

<l rend="indent">                    Likewise, days may wax</l>
<l>Whilst the nights wane, and daylight minished be</l>
<l>Whilst nights do take their augmentations,</l>
<l>Either because the self-same sun, coursing</l>
<l>Under the lands and over in two arcs,</l>
<l>A longer and a briefer, doth dispart</l>
<l>The coasts of ether and divides in twain</l>
<l>His orbit all unequally, and adds,</l>
<l>As round he's borne, unto the one half there</l>
<l>As much as from the other half he's ta'en,</l>
<l>Until he then arrives that sign of heaven</l>
<l>Where the year's node renders the shades of night</l>
<l>Equal unto the periods of light.</l>
<l>For when the sun is midway on his course</l>
<l>Between the blasts of northwind and of south,</l>
<l>Heaven keeps his two goals parted equally,</l>
<l>By virtue of the fixed position old</l>
<l>Of the whole starry Zodiac, through which</l>
<l>That sun, in winding onward, takes a year,</l>
<l>Illumining the sky and all the lands</l>
<l>With oblique light- as men declare to us</l>
<l>Who by their diagrams have charted well</l>
<l>Those regions of the sky which be adorned</l>
<l>With the arranged signs of Zodiac.</l>
<l>Or else, because in certain parts the air</l>
<l>Under the lands is denser, the tremulous</l>
<l>Bright beams of fire do waver tardily,</l>
<l>Nor easily can penetrate that air</l>
<l>Nor yet emerge unto their rising-place:</l>
<l>For this it is that nights in winter time</l>
<l>Do linger long, ere comes the many-rayed</l>
<l>Round Badge of the day. Or else because, as said,</l>
<l>In alternating seasons of the year</l>
<l>Fires, now more quick, and now more slow, are wont</l>
<l>To stream together,- the fires which make the sun</l>
<l>To rise in some one spot- therefore it is</l>
<l>That those men seem to speak the truth [who hold</l>
<l>A new sun is with each new daybreak born].</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="705"/>
<l rend="indent">  The moon she possibly doth shine because</l>
<l>Strook by the rays of sun, and day by day</l>
<l>May turn unto our gaze her light, the more</l>
<l>She doth recede from orb of sun, until,</l>
<l>Facing him opposite across the world,</l>
<l>She hath with full effulgence gleamed abroad,</l>
<l>And, at her rising as she soars above,</l>
<l>Hath there observed his setting; thence likewise</l>
<l>She needs must hide, as 'twere, her light behind</l>
<l>By slow degrees, the nearer now she glides,</l>
<l>Along the circle of the Zodiac,</l>
<l>From her far place toward fires of yonder sun,-</l>
<l>As those men hold who feign the moon to be</l>
<l>Just like a ball and to pursue a course</l>
<l>Betwixt the sun and earth. There is, again,</l>
<l>Some reason to suppose that moon may roll</l>
<l>With light her very own, and thus display</l>
<l>The varied shapes of her resplendence there.</l>
<l>For near her is, percase, another body,</l>
<l>Invisible, because devoid of light,</l>
<l>Borne on and gliding all along with her,</l>
<l>Which in three modes may block and blot her disk.</l>
<l>Again, she may revolve upon herself,</l>
<l>Like to a ball's sphere- if perchance that be-</l>
<l>One half of her dyed o'er with glowing light,</l>
<l>And by the revolution of that sphere</l>
<l>She may beget for us her varying shapes,</l>
<l>Until she turns that fiery part of her</l>
<l>Full to the sight and open eyes of men;</l>
<l>Thence by slow stages round and back she whirls,</l>
<l>Withdrawing thus the luminiferous part</l>
<l>Of her sphered mass and ball, as, verily,</l>
<l>The Babylonian doctrine of Chaldees,</l>
<l>Refuting the art of Greek astrologers,</l>
<l>Labours, in opposition, to prove sure-</l>
<l>As if, forsooth, the thing for which each fights,</l>
<l>Might not alike be true,- or aught there were</l>
<l>Wherefore thou mightest risk embracing one</l>
<l>More than the other notion. Then, again,</l>
<l>Why a new moon might not forevermore</l>
<l>Created be with fixed successions there</l>
<l>Of shapes and with configurations fixed,</l>
<l>And why each day that bright created moon</l>
<l>Might not miscarry and another be,</l>
<l>In its stead and place, engendered anew,</l>
<l>'Tis hard to show by reason, or by words</l>
<l>To prove absurd- since, lo, so many things</l>
<l>Can be create with fixed successions:</l>
<l>Spring-time and Venus come, and Venus' boy,</l>
<l>The winged harbinger, steps on before,</l>
<l>And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora,</l>
<l>Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all</l>
<l>With colours and with odours excellent;</l>
<l>Whereafter follows arid Heat, and he</l>
<l>Companioned is by <placeName key="tgn,2082988">Ceres</placeName>, dusty one,</l>
<l>And by the Etesian Breezes of the north;</l>
<l>Then cometh Autumn on, and with him steps</l>
<l>Lord Bacchus, and then other Seasons too</l>
<l>And other Winds do follow- the high roar</l>
<l>Of great Volturnus, and the <placeName key="tgn,2682863">Southwind</placeName> strong</l>
<l>With thunder-bolts. At last earth's Shortest-Day</l>
<l>Bears on to men the snows and brings again</l>
<l>The numbing cold. And Winter follows her,</l>
<l>His teeth with chills a-chatter. Therefore, 'tis</l>
<l>The less a marvel, if at fixed time</l>
<l>A moon is thus begotten and again</l>
<l>At fixed time destroyed, since things so many</l>
<l>Can come to being thus at fixed time.</l>
<l>Likewise, the sun's eclipses and the moon's</l>
<l>Far occultations rightly thou mayst deem</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="751"/>
<l rend="indent">  As due to several causes. For, indeed,</l>

<l>Opposing dark orb to his glowing beams-</l>
<l>And yet, at same time, one suppose the effect</l>
<l>Could not result from some one other body</l>
<l>Which glides devoid of light forevermore?</l>
<l>Again, why could not sun, in weakened state,</l>
<l>At fixed time for-lose his fires, and then,</l>
<l>When he has passed on along the air</l>
<l>Beyond the regions, hostile to his flames,</l>
<l>That quench and kill his fires, why could not he</l>
<l>Renew his light? And why should earth in turn</l>
<l>Have power to rob the moon of light, and there,</l>
<l>Herself on high, keep the sun hid beneath,</l>
<l>Whilst the moon glideth in her monthly course</l>
<l>Athrough the rigid shadows of the cone?-</l>
<l>And yet, at same time, some one other body</l>
<l>Not have the power to under-pass the moon,</l>
<l>Or glide along above the orb of sun,</l>
<l>Breaking his rays and outspread light asunder?</l>
<l>And still, if moon herself refulgent be</l>
<l>With her own sheen, why could she not at times</l>
<l>In some one quarter of the mighty world</l>

<p>ORIGINS OF VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL LIFE</p>

<l rend="indent">  And now to what remains!- Since I've resolved</l>
<l>By what arrangements all things come to pass</l>
<l>Through the blue regions of the mighty world,-</l>
<l>How we can know what energy and cause</l>
<l>Started the various courses of the sun</l>
<l>And the moon's goings, and by what far means</l>
<l>They can succumb, the while with thwarted light,</l>
<l>And veil with shade the unsuspecting lands,</l>
<l>When, as it were, they blink, and then again</l>
<l>With open eye survey all regions wide,</l>
<l>Resplendent with white radiance- I do now</l>
<l>Return unto the world's primeval age</l>
<l>And tell what first the soft young fields of earth</l>
<l>With earliest parturition had decreed</l>
<l>To raise in air unto the shores of light</l>
<l>And to entrust unto the wayward winds.</l>
<l>In the beginning, earth gave forth, around</l>
<l>The hills and over all the length of plains,</l>
<l>The race of grasses and the shining green;</l>
<l>The flowery meadows sparkled all aglow</l>
<l>With greening colour, and thereafter, lo,</l>
<l>Unto the divers kinds of trees was given</l>
<l>An emulous impulse mightily to shoot,</l>
<l>With a free rein, aloft into the air.</l>
<l>As feathers and hairs and bristles are begot</l>
<l>The first on members of the four-foot breeds</l>
<l>And on the bodies of the strong-y-winged,</l>
<l>Thus then the new Earth first of all put forth</l>
<l>Grasses and shrubs, and afterward begat</l>
<l>The mortal generations, there upsprung-</l>
<l>Innumerable in modes innumerable-</l>
<l>After diverging fashions. For from sky</l>
<l>These breathing-creatures never can have dropped,</l>
<l>Nor the land-dwellers ever have come up</l>
<l>Out of sea-pools of salt. How true remains,</l>
<l>How merited is that adopted name</l>
<l>Of earth- "The Mother!"- since from out the earth</l>
<l>Are all begotten. And even now arise</l>
<l>From out the loams how many living things-</l>
<l>Concreted by the rains and heat of the sun.</l>
<l>Wherefore 'tis less a marvel, if they sprang</l>
<l>In Long Ago more many, and more big,</l>
<l>Matured of those days in the fresh young years</l>
<l>Of earth and ether. First of all, the race</l>
<l>Of the winged ones and parti-coloured birds,</l>
<l>Hatched out in spring-time, left their eggs behind;</l>
<l>As now-a-days in summer tree-crickets</l>
<l>Do leave their shiny husks of own accord,</l>
<l>Seeking their food and living. Then it was</l>
<l>This earth of thine first gave unto the day</l>
<l>The mortal generations; for prevailed</l>
<l>Among the fields abounding hot and wet.</l>
<l>And hence, where any fitting spot was given,</l>
<l>There 'gan to grow womb-cavities, by roots</l>
<l>Affixed to earth. And when in ripened time</l>
<l>The age of the young within (that sought the air</l>
<l>And fled earth's damps) had burst these wombs, O then</l>
<l>Would Nature thither turn the pores of earth</l>
<l>And make her spurt from open veins a juice</l>
<l>Like unto milk; even as a woman now</l>
<l>Is filled, at child-bearing, with the sweet milk,</l>
<l>Because all that swift stream of aliment</l>
<l>Is thither turned unto the mother-breasts.</l>
<l>There earth would furnish to the children food;</l>
<l>Warmth was their swaddling cloth, the grass their bed</l>
<l>Abounding in soft down. Earth's newness then</l>
<l>Would rouse no dour spells of the bitter cold,</l>
<l>Nor extreme heats nor winds of mighty powers-</l>
<l>For all things grow and gather strength through time</l>
<l>In like proportions; and then earth was young.</l>

<l rend="indent">  Wherefore, again, again, how merited</l>
<l>Is that adopted name of Earth- The Mother!-</l>
<l>Since she herself begat the human race,</l>
<l>And at one well-nigh fixed time brought forth</l>
<l>Each breast that ranges raving round about</l>
<l>Upon the mighty mountains and all birds</l>
<l>Aerial with many a varied shape.</l>
<l>But, lo, because her bearing years must end,</l>
<l>She ceased, like to a woman worn by eld.</l>
<l>For lapsing aeons change the nature of</l>

<l>One status after other, nor aught persists</l>

<l>Rivers of gold through every landscape flowed,</l>
<l>That trees were wont with precious stones to flower,</l>
<l>Or that in those far aeons man was born</l>
<l>With such gigantic length and lift of limbs</l>
<l>As to be able, based upon his feet,</l>
<l>Deep oceans to bestride or with his hands</l>
<l>To whirl the firmament around his head.</l>
<l>For though in earth were many seeds of things</l>
<l>In the old time when this telluric world</l>
<l>First poured the breeds of animals abroad,</l>
<l>Still that is nothing of a sign that then</l>
<l>Such hybrid creatures could have been begot</l>
<l>And limbs of all beasts heterogeneous</l>
<l>Have been together knit; because, indeed,</l>
<l>The divers kinds of grasses and the grains</l>
<l>And the delightsome trees- which even now</l>
<l>Spring up abounding from within the earth-</l>
<l>Can still ne'er be begotten with their stems</l>
<l>Begrafted into one; but each sole thing</l>
<l>Proceeds according to its proper wont</l>
<l>And all conserve their own distinctions based</l>
<l>In nature's fixed decree.</l>

<p> ORIGINS AND SAVAGE PERIOD OF MANKIND</p>

<l rend="indent">                            But mortal man</l>
<l>Was then far hardier in the old champaign,</l>
<l>As well he should be, since a hardier earth</l>
<l>Had him begotten; builded too was he</l>
<l>Of bigger and more solid bones within,</l>
<l>And knit with stalwart sinews through the flesh,</l>
<l>Nor easily seized by either heat or cold,</l>
<l>Or alien food or any ail or irk.</l>
<l>And whilst so many lustrums of the sun</l>
<l>Rolled on across the sky, men led a life</l>
<l>After the roving habit of wild beasts.</l>
<l>Not then were sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,</l>
<l>And none knew then to work the fields with iron,</l>
<l>Or plant young shoots in holes of delved loam,</l>
<l>Or lop with hooked knives from off high trees</l>
<l>The boughs of yester-year. What sun and rains</l>
<l>To them had given, what earth of own accord</l>
<l>Created then, was boon enough to glad</l>
<l>Their simple hearts. Mid acorn-laden oaks</l>
<l>Would they refresh their bodies for the nonce;</l>
<l>And the wild berries of the arbute-tree,</l>
<l>Which now thou seest to ripen purple-red</l>
<l>In winter time, the old telluric soil</l>
<l>Would bear then more abundant and more big.</l>
<l>And many coarse foods, too, in long ago</l>
<l>The blooming freshness of the rank young world</l>
<l>Produced, enough for those poor wretches there.</l>
<l>And rivers and springs would summon them of old</l>
<l>To slake the thirst, as now from the great hills</l>
<l>The water's down-rush calls aloud and far</l>
<l>The thirsty generations of the wild.</l>
<l>So, too, they sought the grottos of the Nymphs-</l>
<l>The woodland haunts discovered as they ranged-</l>
<l>From forth of which they knew that gliding rills</l>
<l>With gush and splash abounding laved the rocks,</l>
<l>The dripping rocks, and trickled from above</l>
<l>Over the verdant moss; and here and there</l>
<l>Welled up and burst across the open flats.</l>
<l>As yet they knew not to enkindle fire</l>
<l>Against the cold, nor hairy pelts to use</l>
<l>And clothe their bodies with the spoils of beasts;</l>
<l>But huddled in groves, and mountain-caves, and woods,</l>
<l>And 'mongst the thickets hid their squalid backs,</l>
<l>When driven to flee the lashings of the winds</l>
<l>And the big rains. Nor could they then regard</l>
<l>The general good, nor did they know to use</l>
<l>In common any customs, any laws:</l>
<l>Whatever of booty fortune unto each</l>
<l>Had proffered, each alone would bear away,</l>
<l>By instinct trained for self to thrive and live.</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,2744069">Venus</placeName> in the forests then would link</l>
<l>The lovers' bodies; for the woman yielded</l>
<l>Either from mutual flame, or from the man's</l>
<l>Impetuous fury and insatiate lust,</l>
<l>Or from a bribe- as acorn-nuts, choice pears,</l>
<l>Or the wild berries of the arbute-tree.</l>
<l>And trusting wondrous strength of hands and legs,</l>
<l>They'd chase the forest-wanderers, the beasts;</l>
<l>And many they'd conquer, but some few they fled,</l>
<l>A-skulk into their hiding-places...</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>With the flung stones and with the ponderous heft</l>
<l>Of gnarled branch. And by the time of night</l>
<l>O'ertaken, they would throw, like bristly boars,</l>
<l>Their wildman's limbs naked upon the earth,</l>
<l>Rolling themselves in leaves and fronded boughs.</l>
<l>Nor would they call with lamentations loud</l>
<l>Around the fields for daylight and the sun,</l>
<l>Quaking and wand'ring in shadows of the night;</l>
<l>But, silent and buried in a sleep, they'd wait</l>
<l>Until the sun with rosy flambeau brought</l>
<l>The glory to the sky. From childhood wont</l>
<l>Ever to see the dark and day begot</l>
<l>In times alternate, never might they be</l>
<l>Wildered by wild misgiving, lest a night</l>
<l>Eternal should possess the lands, with light</l>
<l>Of sun withdrawn forever. But their care</l>
<l>Was rather that the clans of savage beasts</l>
<l>Would often make their sleep-time horrible</l>
<l>For those poor wretches; and, from home y-driven,</l>
<l>They'd flee their rocky shelters at approach</l>
<l>Of boar, the spumy-lipped, or lion strong,</l>
<l>And in the midnight yield with terror up</l>
<l>To those fierce guests their beds of out-spread leaves.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="988"/>
<l rend="indent">  And yet in those days not much more than now</l>
<l>Would generations of mortality</l>
<l>Leave the sweet light of fading life behind.</l>
<l>Indeed, in those days here and there a man,</l>
<l>More oftener snatched upon, and gulped by fangs,</l>
<l>Afforded the beasts a food that roared alive,</l>
<l>Echoing through groves and hills and forest-trees,</l>
<l>Even as he viewed his living flesh entombed</l>
<l>Within a living grave; whilst those whom flight</l>
<l>Had saved, with bone and body bitten, shrieked,</l>
<l>Pressing their quivering palms to loathsome sores,</l>
<l>With horrible voices for eternal death-</l>
<l>Until, forlorn of help, and witless what</l>
<l>Might medicine their wounds, the writhing pangs</l>
<l>Took them from life. But not in those far times</l>
<l>Would one lone day give over unto doom</l>
<l>A soldiery in thousands marching on</l>
<l>Beneath the battle-banners, nor would then</l>
<l>The ramping breakers of the main seas dash</l>
<l>Whole argosies and crews upon the rocks.</l>
<l>But ocean uprisen would often rave in vain,</l>
<l>Without all end or outcome, and give up</l>
<l>Its empty menacings as lightly too;</l>
<l>Nor soft seductions of a serene sea</l>
<l>Could lure by laughing billows any man</l>
<l>Out to disaster: for the science bold</l>
<l>Of ship-sailing lay dark in those far times.</l>
<l>Again, 'twas then that lack of food gave o'er</l>
<l>Men's fainting limbs to dissolution: now</l>
<l>'Tis plenty overwhelms. Unwary, they</l>
<l>Oft for themselves themselves would then outpour</l>
<l>The poison; now, with nicer art, themselves</l>
<l>They give the drafts to others.</l>

<p> BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION</p>

<l rend="indent">                                 Afterwards,</l>
<l>When huts they had procured and pelts and fire,</l>
<l>And when the woman, joined unto the man,</l>
<l>Withdrew with him into one dwelling place,</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>Were known; and when they saw an offspring born</l>
<l>From out themselves, then first the human race</l>
<l>Began to soften. For 'twas now that fire</l>
<l>Rendered their shivering frames less staunch to bear,</l>
<l>Under the canopy of the sky, the cold;</l>
<l>And Love reduced their shaggy hardiness;</l>
<l>And children, with the prattle and the kiss,</l>
<l>Soon broke the parents' haughty temper down.</l>
<l>Then, too, did neighbours 'gin to league as friends,</l>
<l>Eager to wrong no more or suffer wrong,</l>
<l>And urged for children and the womankind</l>
<l>Mercy, of fathers, whilst with cries and gestures</l>
<l>They stammered hints how meet it was that all</l>
<l>Should have compassion on the weak. And still,</l>
<l>Though concord not in every wise could then</l>
<l>Begotten be, a good, a goodly part</l>
<l>Kept faith inviolate- or else mankind</l>
<l>Long since had been unutterably cut off,</l>
<l>And propagation never could have brought</l>
<l>The species down the ages.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1028"/>
<l rend="indent">                           But nature 'twas</l>
<l>Urged men to utter various sounds of tongue</l>
<l>And need and use did mould the names of things,</l>
<l>About in same wise as the lack-speech years</l>
<l>Compel young children unto gesturings,</l>
<l>Making them point with finger here and there</l>
<l>At what's before them. For each creature feels</l>
<l>By instinct to what use to put his powers.</l>
<l>Ere yet the bull-calf's scarce begotten horns</l>
<l>Project above his brows, with them he 'gins</l>
<l>Enraged to butt and savagely to thrust.</l>
<l>But whelps of panthers and the lion's cubs</l>
<l>With claws and paws and bites are at the fray</l>
<l>Already, when their teeth and claws be scarce</l>
<l>As yet engendered. So again, we see</l>
<l>All breeds of winged creatures trust to wings</l>
<l>And from their fledgling pinions seek to get</l>
<l>A fluttering assistance. Thus, to think</l>
<l>That in those days some man apportioned round</l>
<l>To things their names, and that from him men learned</l>
<l>Their first nomenclature, is foolery.</l>
<l>For why could he mark everything by words</l>
<l>And utter the various sounds of tongue, what time</l>
<l>The rest may be supposed powerless</l>
<l>To do the same? And, if the rest had not</l>
<l>Already one with other used words,</l>
<l>Whence was implanted in the teacher, then,</l>
<l>Fore-knowledge of their use, and whence was given</l>
<l>To him alone primordial faculty</l>
<l>To know and see in mind what 'twas he willed?</l>
<l>Besides, one only man could scarce subdue</l>
<l>An overmastered multitude to choose</l>
<l>To get by heart his names of things. A task</l>
<l>Not easy 'tis in any wise to teach</l>
<l>And to persuade the deaf concerning what</l>
<l>'Tis needful for to do. For ne'er would they</l>
<l>Allow, nor ne'er in anywise endure</l>
<l>Perpetual vain dingdong in their ears</l>
<l>Of spoken sounds unheard before. And what,</l>
<l>At last, in this affair so wondrous is,</l>
<l>That human race (in whom a voice and tongue</l>
<l>Were now in vigour) should by divers words</l>
<l>Denote its objects, as each divers sense</l>
<l>Might prompt?- since even the speechless herds, aye, since</l>
<l>The very generations of wild beasts</l>
<l>Are wont dissimilar and divers sounds</l>
<l>To rouse from in them, when there's fear or pain,</l>
<l>And when they burst with joys. And this, forsooth,</l>
<l>'Tis thine to know from plainest facts: when first</l>
<l>Huge flabby jowls of mad Molossian hounds,</l>
<l>Baring their hard white teeth, begin to snarl,</l>
<l>They threaten, with infuriate lips peeled back,</l>
<l>In sounds far other than with which they bark</l>
<l>And fill with voices all the regions round.</l>
<l>And when with fondling tongue they start to lick</l>
<l>Their puppies, or do toss them round with paws,</l>
<l>Feigning with gentle bites to gape and snap,</l>
<l>They fawn with yelps of voice far other then</l>
<l>Than when, alone within the house, they bay,</l>
<l>Or whimpering slink with cringing sides from blows.</l>
<l>Again the neighing of the horse, is that</l>
<l>Not seen to differ likewise, when the stud</l>
<l>In buoyant flower of his young years raves,</l>
<l>Goaded by winged Love, amongst the mares,</l>
<l>And when with widening nostrils out he snorts</l>
<l>The call to battle, and when haply he</l>
<l>Whinnies at times with terror-quaking limbs?</l>
<l>Lastly, the flying race, the dappled birds,</l>
<l>Hawks, ospreys, sea-gulls, searching food and life</l>
<l>Amid the ocean billows in the brine,</l>
<l>Utter at other times far other cries</l>
<l>Than when they fight for food, or with their prey</l>
<l>Struggle and strain. And birds there are which change</l>
<l>With changing weather their own raucous songs-</l>
<l>As long-lived generations of the crows</l>
<l>Or flocks of rooks, when they be said to cry</l>
<l>For rain and water and to call at times</l>
<l>For winds and gales. Ergo, if divers moods</l>
<l>Compel the brutes, though speechless evermore,</l>
<l>To send forth divers sounds, O truly then</l>
<l>How much more likely 'twere that mortal men</l>
<l>In those days could with many a different sound</l>
<l>Denote each separate thing.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1091"/>
<l rend="indent">                         Lest, perchance,</l>
<l>Concerning these affairs thou ponderest</l>
<l>In silent meditation, let me say</l>
<l>'Twas lightning brought primevally to earth</l>
<l>The fire for mortals, and from thence hath spread</l>
<l>O'er all the lands the flames of heat. For thus</l>
<l>Even now we see so many objects, touched</l>
<l>By the celestial flames, to flash aglow,</l>
<l>When thunderbolt has dowered them with heat.</l>
<l>Yet also when a many-branched tree,</l>
<l>Beaten by winds, writhes swaying to and fro,</l>
<l>Pressing 'gainst branches of a neighbour tree,</l>
<l>There by the power of mighty rub and rub</l>
<l>Is fire engendered; and at times out-flares</l>
<l>The scorching heat of flame, when boughs do chafe</l>
<l>Against the trunks. And of these causes, either</l>
<l>May well have given to mortal men the fire.</l>
<l>Next, food to cook and soften in the flame</l>
<l>The sun instructed, since so oft they saw</l>
<l>How objects mellowed, when subdued by warmth</l>
<l>And by the raining blows of fiery beams,</l>
<l>Through all the fields.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1105"/>
<l rend="indent">                       And more and more each day</l>
<l>Would men more strong in sense, more wise in heart,</l>
<l>Teach them to change their earlier mode and life</l>
<l>By fire and new devices. Kings began</l>
<l>Cities to found and citadels to set,</l>
<l>As strongholds and asylums for themselves,</l>
<l>And flocks and fields to portion for each man</l>
<l>After the beauty, strength, and sense of each-</l>
<l>For beauty then imported much, and strength</l>
<l>Had its own rights supreme. Thereafter, wealth</l>
<l>Discovered was, and gold was brought to light,</l>
<l>Which soon of honour stripped both strong and fair;</l>
<l>For men, however beautiful in form</l>
<l>Or valorous, will follow in the main</l>
<l>The rich man's party. Yet were man to steer</l>
<l>His life by sounder reasoning, he'd own</l>
<l>Abounding riches, if with mind content</l>
<l>He lived by thrift; for never, as I guess,</l>
<l>Is there a lack of little in the world.</l>
<l>But men wished glory for themselves and power</l>
<l>Even that their fortunes on foundations firm</l>
<l>Might rest forever, and that they themselves,</l>
<l>The opulent, might pass a quiet life-</l>
<l>In vain, in vain; since, in the strife to climb</l>
<l>On to the heights of honour, men do make</l>
<l>Their pathway terrible; and even when once</l>
<l>They reach them, envy like the thunderbolt</l>
<l>At times will smite, O hurling headlong down</l>
<l>To murkiest Tartarus, in scorn; for, lo,</l>
<l>All summits, all regions loftier than the rest,</l>
<l>Smoke, blasted as by envy's thunderbolts;</l>
<l>So better far in quiet to obey,</l>
<l>Than to desire chief mastery of affairs</l>
<l>And ownership of empires. Be it so;</l>
<l>And let the weary sweat their life-blood out</l>
<l>All to no end, battling in hate along</l>
<l>The narrow path of man's ambition;</l>
<l>Since all their wisdom is from others' lips,</l>
<l>And all they seek is known from what they've heard</l>
<l>And less from what they've thought. Nor is this folly</l>
<l>Greater to-day, nor greater soon to be,</l>
<l>Than' twas of old.</l>

<l rend="indent">                  And therefore kings were slain,</l>
<l>And pristine majesty of golden thrones</l>
<l>And haughty sceptres lay o'erturned in dust;</l>
<l>And crowns, so splendid on the sovereign heads,</l>
<l>Soon bloody under the proletarian feet,</l>
<l>Groaned for their glories gone- for erst o'er-much</l>
<l>Dreaded, thereafter with more greedy zest</l>
<l>Trampled beneath the rabble heel. Thus things</l>
<l>Down to the vilest lees of brawling mobs</l>
<l>Succumbed, whilst each man sought unto himself</l>
<l>Dominion and supremacy. So next</l>
<l>Some wiser heads instructed men to found</l>
<l>The magisterial office, and did frame</l>
<l>Codes that they might consent to follow laws.</l>
<l>For humankind, o'er wearied with a life</l>
<l>Fostered by force, was ailing from its feuds;</l>
<l>And so the sooner of its own free will</l>
<l>Yielded to laws and strictest codes. For since</l>
<l>Each hand made ready in its wrath to take</l>
<l>A vengeance fiercer than by man's fair laws</l>
<l>Is now conceded, men on this account</l>
<l>Loathed the old life fostered by force. 'Tis thence</l>
<l>That fear of punishments defiles each prize</l>
<l>Of wicked days; for force and fraud ensnare</l>
<l>Each man around, and in the main recoil</l>
<l>On him from whence they sprung. Not easy 'tis</l>
<l>For one who violates by ugly deeds</l>
<l>The bonds of common peace to pass a life</l>

<l>The race of gods and men, he yet must dread</l>
<l>'Twill not be hid forever- since, indeed,</l>

<l>Befitting glorious visage and vast powers.</l>
<l>And men would give them an eternal life,</l>
<l>Because their visages forevermore</l>

<l>Of annual seasons, nor were able then</l>
<l>To know thereof the causes. Therefore 'twas</l>
<l>Men would take refuge in consigning all</l>
<l>Unto divinities, and in feigning all</l>
<l>Was guided by their nod. And in the sky</l>
<l>They set the seats and vaults of gods, because</l>
<l>Across the sky night and the moon are seen</l>
<l>To roll along- moon, day, and night, and night's</l>

<l rend="indent">  Now for the rest: copper and gold and iron</l>
<l>Discovered were, and with them silver's weight</l>
<l>And power of lead, when with prodigious heat</l>
<l>The conflagrations burned the forest trees</l>
<l>Among the mighty mountains, by a bolt</l>
<l>Of lightning from the sky, or else because</l>
<l>Men, warring in the woodlands, on their foes</l>
<l>Had hurled fire to frighten and dismay,</l>
<l>Or yet because, by goodness of the soil</l>
<l>Invited, men desired to clear rich fields</l>
<l>And turn the countryside to pasture-lands,</l>
<l>Or slay the wild and thrive upon the spoils.</l>
<l>(For hunting by pit-fall and by fire arose</l>
<l>Before the art of hedging the covert round</l>
<l>With net or stirring it with dogs of chase.)</l>
<l>Howso the fact, and from what cause soever</l>
<l>The flamy heat with awful crack and roar</l>
<l>Had there devoured to their deepest roots</l>
<l>The forest trees and baked the earth with fire,</l>
<l>Then from the boiling veins began to ooze</l>
<l>O rivulets of silver and of gold,</l>
<l>Of lead and copper too, collecting soon</l>
<l>Into the hollow places of the ground.</l>
<l>And when men saw the cooled lumps anon</l>
<l>To shine with splendour-sheen upon the ground,</l>
<l>Much taken with that lustrous smooth delight,</l>
<l>They 'gan to pry them out, and saw how each</l>
<l>Had got a shape like to its earthy mould.</l>
<l>Then would it enter their heads how these same lumps,</l>
<l>If melted by heat, could into any form</l>
<l>Or figure of things be run, and how, again,</l>
<l>If hammered out, they could be nicely drawn</l>
<l>To sharpest points or finest edge, and thus</l>
<l>Yield to the forgers tools and give them power</l>
<l>To chop the forest down, to hew the logs,</l>
<l>To shave the beams and planks, besides to bore</l>
<l>And punch and drill. And men began such work</l>
<l>At first as much with tools of silver and gold</l>
<l>As with the impetuous strength of the stout copper;</l>
<l>But vainly- since their over-mastered power</l>
<l>Would soon give way, unable to endure,</l>
<l>Like copper, such hard labour. In those days</l>
<l>Copper it was that was the thing of price;</l>
<l>And gold lay useless, blunted with dull edge.</l>
<l>Now lies the copper low, and gold hath come</l>
<l>Unto the loftiest honours. Thus it is</l>
<l>That rolling ages change the times of things:</l>
<l>What erst was of a price, becomes at last</l>
<l>A discard of no honour; whilst another</l>
<l>Succeeds to glory, issuing from contempt,</l>
<l>And day by day is sought for more and more,</l>
<l>And, when 'tis found, doth flower in men's praise,</l>
<l>Objects of wondrous honour.</l>

<l>How nature of iron discovered was, thou mayst</l>
<l>Of thine own self divine. Man's ancient arms</l>
<l>Were hands, and nails and teeth, stones too and boughs-</l>
<l>Breakage of forest trees- and flame and fire,</l>
<l>As soon as known. Thereafter force of iron</l>
<l>And copper discovered was; and copper's use</l>
<l>Was known ere iron's, since more tractable</l>
<l>Its nature is and its abundance more.</l>
<l>With copper men to work the soil began,</l>
<l>With copper to rouse the hurly waves of war,</l>
<l>To straw the monstrous wounds, and seize away</l>
<l>Another's flocks and fields. For unto them,</l>
<l>Thus armed, all things naked of defence</l>
<l>Readily yielded. Then by slow degrees</l>
<l>The sword of iron succeeded, and the shape</l>
<l>Of brazen sickle into scorn was turned:</l>
<l>With iron to cleave the soil of earth they 'gan,</l>
<l>And the contentions of uncertain war</l>
<l>Were rendered equal.</l>
<l rend="indent">                     And, lo, man was wont</l>
<l>Armed to mount upon the ribs of horse</l>
<l>And guide him with the rein, and play about</l>
<l>With right hand free, oft times before he tried</l>
<l>Perils of war in yoked chariot;</l>
<l>And yoked pairs abreast came earlier</l>
<l>Than yokes of four, or scythed chariots</l>
<l>Whereinto clomb the men-at-arms. And next</l>
<l>The Punic folk did train the elephants-</l>
<l>Those curst Lucanian oxen, hideous,</l>
<l>The serpent-handed, with turrets on their bulks-</l>
<l>To dure the wounds of war and panic-strike</l>
<l>The mighty troops of <placeName key="tgn,2008886">Mars</placeName>. Thus Discord sad</l>
<l>Begat the one Thing after other, to be</l>
<l>The terror of the nations under arms,</l>
<l>And day by day to horrors of old war</l>
<l>She added an increase.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1308"/>
<l rend="indent">                      Bulls, too, they tried</l>
<l>In war's grim business; and essayed to send</l>
<l>Outrageous boars against the foes. And some</l>
<l>Sent on before their ranks puissant lions</l>
<l>With armed trainers and with masters fierce</l>
<l>To guide and hold in chains- and yet in vain,</l>
<l>Since fleshed with pell-mell slaughter, fierce they flew,</l>
<l>And blindly through the squadrons havoc wrought,</l>
<l>Shaking the frightful crests upon their heads,</l>
<l>Now here, now there. Nor could the horsemen calm</l>
<l>Their horses, panic-breasted at the roar,</l>
<l>And rein them round to front the foe. With spring</l>
<l>The infuriate she-lions would up-leap</l>
<l>Now here, now there; and whoso came apace</l>
<l>Against them, these they'd rend across the face;</l>
<l>And others unwitting from behind they'd tear</l>
<l>Down from their mounts, and twining round them, bring</l>
<l>Tumbling to earth, o'ermastered by the wound,</l>
<l>And with those powerful fangs and hooked claws</l>
<l>Fasten upon them. Bulls would toss their friends,</l>
<l>And trample under foot, and from beneath</l>
<l>Rip flanks and bellies of horses with their horns,</l>
<l>And with a threat'ning forehead jam the sod;</l>
<l>And boars would gore with stout tusks their allies,</l>
<l>Splashing in fury their own blood on spears</l>
<l>Splintered in their own bodies, and would fell</l>
<l>In rout and ruin infantry and horse.</l>
<l>For there the beasts-of-saddle tried to scape</l>
<l>The savage thrusts of tusk by shying off,</l>
<l>Or rearing up with hoofs a-paw in air.</l>
<l>In vain- since there thou mightest see them sink,</l>
<l>Their sinews severed, and with heavy fall</l>
<l>Bestrew the ground. And such of these as men</l>
<l>Supposed well-trained long ago at home,</l>
<l>Were in the thick of action seen to foam</l>
<l>In fury, from the wounds, the shrieks, the flight,</l>
<l>The panic, and the tumult; nor could men</l>
<l>Aught of their numbers rally. For each breed</l>
<l>And various of the wild beasts fled apart</l>
<l>Hither or thither, as often in wars to-day</l>
<l>Flee those Lucanian oxen, by the steel</l>
<l>Grievously mangled, after they have wrought</l>
<l>Upon their friends so many a dreadful doom.</l>
<l>(If 'twas, indeed, that thus they did at all:</l>
<l>But scarcely I'll believe that men could not</l>
<l>With mind foreknow and see, as sure to come,</l>
<l>Such foul and general disaster.- This</l>
<l>We, then, may hold as true in the great All,</l>
<l>In divers worlds on divers plan create,-</l>
<l>Somewhere afar more likely than upon</l>

<l>Less in the hope of conquering than to give</l>
<l>Their enemies a goodly cause of woe,</l>
<l>Even though thereby they perished themselves,</l>

<l>Since iron is needful in the weaving art,</l>
<l>Nor by no other means can there be wrought</l>
<l>Such polished tools- the treadles, spindles, shuttles,</l>
<l>And sounding yarn-beams. And nature forced the men,</l>

<l>For all the male kind far excels in skill,</l>
<l>And cleverer is by much- until at last</l>
<l>The rugged farmer folk jeered at such tasks,</l>

<l>The place below for tilth, that there they might,</l>
<l>On plains and uplands, have their meadow-plats,</l>

<l>With chaplets of intertwined flowers and leaves,</l>
<l>And to dance onward, out of tune, with limbs</l>
<l>Clownishly swaying, and with clownish foot</l>
<l>To beat our mother earth- from whence arose</l>
<l>Laughter and peals of jollity, for, lo,</l>

<l>'Twas Athens first, the glorious in name,</l>
<l>That whilom gave to hapless sons of men</l>
<l>The sheaves of harvest, and re-ordered life,</l>
<l>And decreed laws; and she the first that gave</l>
<l>Life its sweet solaces, when she begat</l>
<l>A man of heart so wise, who whilom poured</l>
<l>All wisdom forth from his truth-speaking mouth;</l>
<l>The glory of whom, though dead, is yet to-day,</l>
<l>Because of those discoveries divine</l>
<l>Renowned of old, exalted to the sky.</l>
<l>For when saw he that well-nigh everything</l>
<l>Which needs of man most urgently require</l>
<l>Was ready to hand for mortals, and that life,</l>
<l>As far as might be, was established safe,</l>
<l>That men were lords in riches, honour, praise,</l>
<l>And eminent in goodly fame of sons,</l>
<l>And that they yet, O yet, within the home,</l>
<l>Still had the anxious heart which vexed life</l>
<l>Unpausingly with torments of the mind,</l>
<l>And raved perforce with angry plaints, then he,</l>
<l>Then he, the master, did perceive that 'twas</l>
<l>The vessel itself which worked the bane, and all,</l>
<l>However wholesome, which from here or there</l>
<l>Was gathered into it, was by that bane</l>
<l>Spoilt from within,- in part, because he saw</l>
<l>The vessel so cracked and leaky that nowise</l>
<l>'T could ever be filled to brim; in part because</l>
<l>He marked how it polluted with foul taste</l>
<l>Whate'er it got within itself. So he,</l>
<l>The master, then by his truth-speaking words,</l>
<l>Purged the breasts of men, and set the bounds</l>
<l>Of lust and terror, and exhibited</l>
<l>The supreme good whither we all endeavour,</l>
<l>And showed the path whereby we might arrive</l>
<l>Thereunto by a little cross-cut straight,</l>
<l>And what of ills in all affairs of mortals</l>
<l>Upsprang and flitted deviously about</l>
<l>(Whether by chance or force), since nature thus</l>

<l>As stones and timbers, nor again so fine</l>
<l>As mists and flying smoke; for then perforce</l>
<l>They'd either fall, borne down by their brute weight,</l>
<l>Like stones, or, like the smoke, they'd powerless be</l>
<l>To keep their mass, or to retain within</l>
<l>Frore snows and storms of hail. And they give forth</l>
<l>O'er skiey levels of the spreading world</l>
<l>A sound on high, as linen-awning, stretched</l>
<l>O'er mighty theatres, gives forth at times</l>
<l>A cracking roar, when much 'tis beaten about</l>
<l>Betwixt the poles and cross-beams. Sometimes, too,</l>
<l>Asunder rent by wanton gusts, it raves</l>
<l>And imitates the tearing sound of sheets</l>
<l>Of paper- even this kind of noise thou mayst</l>
<l>In thunder hear- or sound as when winds whirl</l>
<l>With lashings and do buffet about in air</l>
<l>A hanging cloth and flying paper-sheets.</l>
<l>For sometimes, too, it chances that the clouds</l>
<l>Cannot together crash head-on, but rather</l>
<l>Move side-wise and with motions contrary</l>
<l>Graze each the other's body without speed,</l>
<l>From whence that dry sound grateth on our ears,</l>
<l>So long drawn-out, until the clouds have passed</l>
<l>From out their close positions.</l>

<l rend="indent">                                 And, again,</l>
<l>In following wise all things seem oft to quake</l>
<l>At shock of heavy thunder, and mightiest walls</l>
<l>Of the wide reaches of the upper world</l>
<l>There on the instant to have sprung apart,</l>
<l>Riven asunder, what time a gathered blast</l>
<l>Of the fierce hurricane hath all at once</l>
<l>Twisted its way into a mass of clouds,</l>
<l>And, there enclosed, ever more and more</l>
<l>Compelleth by its spinning whirl the cloud</l>
<l>To grow all hollow with a thickened crust</l>
<l>Surrounding; for thereafter, when the force</l>
<l>And the keen onset of the wind have weakened</l>
<l>That crust, lo, then the cloud, to-split in twain,</l>
<l>Gives forth a hideous crash with bang and boom.</l>
<l>No marvel this; since oft a bladder small,</l>
<l>Filled up with air, will, when of sudden burst,</l>
<l>Give forth a like large sound.</l>
<l rend="indent">                             There's reason, too,</l>
<l>Why clouds make sounds, as through them blow the winds:</l>
<l>We see, borne down the sky, oft shapes of clouds</l>
<l>Rough-edged or branched many forky ways;</l>
<l>And 'tis the same, as when the sudden flaws</l>
<l>Of north-west wind through the dense forest blow,</l>
<l>Making the leaves to sough and limbs to crash.</l>
<l>It happens too at times that roused force</l>
<l>Of the fierce hurricane to-rends the cloud,</l>
<l>Breaking right through it by a front assault;</l>
<l>For what a blast of wind may do up there</l>
<l>Is manifest from facts when here on earth</l>
<l>A blast more gentle yet uptwists tall trees</l>
<l>And sucks them madly from their deepest roots.</l>
<l>Besides, among the clouds are waves, and these</l>
<l>Give, as they roughly break, a rumbling roar;</l>
<l>As when along deep streams or the great sea</l>
<l>Breaks the loud surf. It happens, too, whenever</l>
<l>Out from one cloud into another falls</l>
<l>The fiery energy of thunderbolt,</l>
<l>That straightaway the cloud, if full of wet,</l>
<l>Extinguishes the fire with mighty noise;</l>
<l>As iron, white from the hot furnaces,</l>
<l>Sizzles, when speedily we've plunged its glow</l>
<l>Down the cold water. Further, if a cloud</l>
<l>More dry receive the fire, 'twill suddenly</l>
<l>Kindle to flame and burn with monstrous sound,</l>
<l>As if a flame with whirl of winds should range</l>
<l>Along the laurel-tressed mountains far,</l>
<l>Upburning with its vast assault those trees;</l>
<l>Nor is there aught that in the crackling flame</l>
<l>Consumes with sound more terrible to man</l>
<l>Than Delphic laurel of Apollo lord.</l>
<l>Oft, too, the multitudinous crash of ice</l>
<l>And down-pour of swift hail gives forth a sound</l>
<l>Among the mighty clouds on high; for when</l>
<l>The wind hath packed them close, each mountain mass</l>
<l>Of rain-cloud, there congealed utterly</l>
<l>And mixed with hail-stones, breaks and booms...</l>

<l>Likewise, it lightens, when the clouds have struck,</l>
<l>By their collision, forth the seeds of fire:</l>
<l>As if a stone should smite a stone or steel,</l>
<l>For light then too leaps forth and fire then scatters</l>
<l>The shining sparks. But with our ears we get</l>
<l>The thunder after eyes behold the flash,</l>
<l>Because forever things arrive the ears</l>
<l>More tardily than the eyes- as thou mayst see</l>
<l>From this example too: when markest thou</l>
<l>Some man far yonder felling a great tree</l>
<l>With double-edged ax, it comes to pass</l>
<l>Thine eye beholds the swinging stroke before</l>
<l>The blow gives forth a sound athrough thine ears:</l>
<l>Thus also we behold the flashing ere</l>
<l>We hear the thunder, which discharged is</l>
<l>At same time with the fire and by same cause,</l>
<l>Born of the same collision.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="173"/>
<l rend="indent">                             In following wise</l>
<l>The clouds suffuse with leaping light the lands,</l>
<l>And the storm flashes with tremulous elan:</l>
<l>When the wind hath invaded a cloud, and, whirling there,</l>
<l>Hath wrought (as I have shown above) the cloud</l>
<l>Into a hollow with a thickened crust,</l>
<l>It becomes hot of own velocity:</l>
<l>Just as thou seest how motion will o'erheat</l>
<l>And set ablaze all objects,- verily</l>
<l>A leaden ball, hurtling through length of space,</l>
<l>Even melts. Therefore, when this same wind a-fire</l>
<l>Hath split black cloud, it scatters the fire-seeds,</l>
<l>Which, so to say, have been pressed out by force</l>
<l>Of sudden from the cloud;- and these do make</l>
<l>The pulsing flashes of flame; thence followeth</l>
<l>The detonation which attacks our ears</l>
<l>More tardily than aught which comes along</l>
<l>Unto the sight of eyeballs. This takes place-</l>
<l>As know thou mayst- at times when clouds are dense</l>
<l>And one upon the other piled aloft</l>
<l>With wonderful upheavings- nor be thou</l>
<l>Deceived because we see how broad their base</l>
<l>From underneath, and not how high they tower.</l>
<l>For make thine observations at a time</l>
<l>When winds shall bear athwart the horizon's blue</l>
<l>Clouds like to mountain-ranges moving on,</l>
<l>Or when about the sides of mighty peaks</l>
<l>Thou seest them one upon the other massed</l>
<l>And burdening downward, anchored in high repose,</l>
<l>With the winds sepulchred on all sides round:</l>
<l>Then canst thou know their mighty masses, then</l>
<l>Canst view their caverns, as if builded there</l>
<l>Of beetling crags; which, when the hurricanes</l>
<l>In gathered storm have filled utterly,</l>
<l>Then, prisoned in clouds, they rave around</l>
<l>With mighty roarings, and within those dens</l>
<l>Bluster like savage beasts, and now from here,</l>
<l>And now from there, send growlings through the clouds,</l>
<l>And seeking an outlet, whirl themselves about,</l>
<l>And roll from 'mid the clouds the seeds of fire,</l>
<l>And heap them multitudinously there,</l>
<l>And in the hollow furnaces within</l>
<l>Wheel flame around, until from bursted cloud</l>
<l>In forky flashes they have gleamed forth.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="204"/>
<l rend="indent">  Again, from following cause it comes to pass</l>
<l>That yon swift golden hue of liquid fire</l>
<l>Darts downward to the earth: because the clouds</l>
<l>Themselves must hold abundant seeds of fire;</l>
<l>For, when they be without all moisture, then</l>
<l>They be for most part of a flamy hue</l>
<l>And a resplendent. And, indeed, they must</l>
<l>Even from the light of sun unto themselves</l>
<l>Take multitudinous seeds, and so perforce</l>
<l>Redden and pour their bright fires all abroad.</l>
<l>And therefore, when the wind hath driven and thrust,</l>
<l>Hath forced and squeezed into one spot these clouds,</l>
<l>They pour abroad the seeds of fire pressed out,</l>
<l>Which make to flash these colours of the flame.</l>
<l>Likewise, it lightens also when the clouds</l>
<l>Grow rare and thin along the sky; for, when</l>
<l>The wind with gentle touch unravels them</l>
<l>And breaketh asunder as they move, those seeds</l>
<l>Which make the lightnings must by nature fall;</l>
<l>At such an hour the horizon lightens round</l>
<l>Without the hideous terror of dread noise</l>
<l>And skiey uproar.</l>

<l rend="indent">                      To proceed apace,</l>
<l>What sort of nature thunderbolts possess</l>
<l>Is by their strokes made manifest and by</l>
<l>The brand-marks of their searing heat on things,</l>
<l>And by the scorched scars exhaling round</l>
<l>The heavy fumes of sulphur. For all these</l>
<l>Are marks, O not of wind or rain, but fire.</l>
<l>Again, they often enkindle even the roofs</l>
<l>Of houses and inside the very rooms</l>
<l>With swift flame hold a fierce dominion.</l>
<l>Know thou that nature fashioned this fire</l>
<l>Subtler than fires all other, with minute</l>
<l>And dartling bodies,- a fire 'gainst which there's naught</l>
<l>Can in the least hold out: the thunderbolt,</l>
<l>The mighty, passes through the hedging walls</l>
<l>Of houses, like to voices or a shout,-</l>
<l>Through stones, through bronze it passes, and it melts</l>
<l>Upon the instant bronze and gold; and makes,</l>
<l>Likewise, the wines sudden to vanish forth,</l>
<l>The wine-jars intact,- because, ye see,</l>
<l>Its heat arriving renders loose and porous</l>
<l>Readily all the wine- jar's earthen sides,</l>
<l>And winding its way within, it scattereth</l>
<l>The elements primordial of the wine</l>
<l>With speedy dissolution- process which</l>
<l>Even in an age the fiery steam of sun</l>
<l>Could not accomplish, however puissant he</l>

<l>As to cleave towers asunder, and houses all</l>
<l>To overtopple, and to wrench apart</l>
<l>Timbers and beams, and heroes' monuments</l>
<l>To pile in ruins and upheave amain,</l>
<l>And to take breath forever out of men,</l>
<l>And to o'erthrow the cattle everywhere,-</l>

<l rend="indent">  The bolts of thunder, then, must be conceived</l>
<l>As all begotten in those crasser clouds</l>
<l>Up-piled aloft; for, from the sky serene</l>
<l>And from the clouds of lighter density,</l>
<l>None are sent forth forever. That 'tis so</l>
<l>Beyond a doubt, fact plain to sense declares:</l>
<l>To wit, at such a time the densed clouds</l>
<l>So mass themselves through all the upper air</l>
<l>That we might think that round about all murk</l>
<l>Had parted forth from Acheron and filled</l>
<l>The mighty vaults of sky- so grievously,</l>
<l>As gathers thus the storm-clouds' gruesome might,</l>
<l>Do faces of black horror hang on high-</l>
<l>When tempest begins its thunderbolts to forge.</l>
<l>Besides, full often also out at sea</l>
<l>A blackest thunderhead, like cataract</l>
<l>Of pitch hurled down from heaven, and far away</l>
<l>Bulging with murkiness, down on the waves</l>
<l>Falls with vast uproar, and draws on amain</l>
<l>The darkling tempests big with thunderbolts</l>
<l>And hurricanes, itself the while so crammed</l>
<l>Tremendously with fires and winds, that even</l>
<l>Back on the lands the people shudder round</l>
<l>And seek for cover. Therefore, as I said,</l>
<l>The storm must be conceived as o'er our head</l>
<l>Towering most high; for never would the clouds</l>
<l>O'erwhelm the lands with such a massy dark,</l>
<l>Unless up-builded heap on lofty heap,</l>
<l>To shut the round sun off. Nor could the clouds,</l>
<l>As on they come, engulf with rain so vast</l>
<l>As thus to make the rivers overflow</l>
<l>And fields to float, if ether were not thus</l>
<l>Furnished with lofty-piled clouds. Lo, then,</l>
<l>Here be all things fulfilled with winds and fires-</l>
<l>Hence the long lightnings and the thunders loud.</l>
<l>For, verily, I've taught thee even now</l>
<l>How cavernous clouds hold seeds innumerable</l>
<l>Of fiery exhalations, and they must</l>
<l>From off the sunbeams and the heat of these</l>
<l>Take many still. And so, when that same wind</l>
<l>(Which, haply, into one region of the sky</l>
<l>Collects those clouds) hath pressed from out the same</l>
<l>The many fiery seeds, and with that fire</l>
<l>Hath at the same time inter-mixed itself,</l>
<l>O then and there that wind, a whirlwind now,</l>
<l>Deep in the belly of the cloud spins round</l>
<l>In narrow confines, and sharpens there inside</l>
<l>In glowing furnaces the thunderbolt.</l>
<l>For in a two-fold manner is that wind</l>
<l>Enkindled all: it trembles into heat</l>
<l>Both by its own velocity and by</l>
<l>Repeated touch of fire. Thereafter, when</l>
<l>The energy of wind is heated through</l>
<l>And the fierce impulse of the fire hath sped</l>
<l>Deeply within, O then the thunderbolt,</l>
<l>Now ripened, so to say, doth suddenly</l>
<l>Splinter the cloud, and the aroused flash</l>
<l>Leaps onward, lumining with forky light</l>
<l>All places round. And followeth anon</l>
<l>A clap so heavy that the skiey vaults,</l>
<l>As if asunder burst, seem from on high</l>
<l>To engulf the earth. Then fearfully a quake</l>
<l>Pervades the lands, and 'long the lofty skies</l>
<l>Run the far rumblings. For at such a time</l>
<l>Nigh the whole tempest quakes, shook through and through,</l>
<l>And roused are the roarings,- from which shock</l>
<l>Comes such resounding and abounding rain,</l>
<l>That all the murky ether seems to turn</l>
<l>Now into rain, and, as it tumbles down,</l>
<l>To summon the fields back to primeval floods:</l>
<l>So big the rains that be sent down on men</l>
<l>By burst of cloud and by the hurricane,</l>
<l>What time the thunder-clap, from burning bolt</l>
<l>That cracks the cloud, flies forth along. At times</l>
<l>The force of wind, excited from without,</l>
<l>Smiteth into a cloud already hot</l>
<l>With a ripe thunderbolt.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="295"/>
<l rend="indent">And when that wind</l>
<l>Hath splintered that cloud, then down there cleaves forthwith</l>
<l>Yon fiery coil of flame which still we call,</l>
<l>Even with our fathers' word, a thunderbolt.</l>
<l>The same thing haps toward every other side</l>
<l>Whither that force hath swept. It happens, too,</l>
<l>That sometimes force of wind, though hurtled forth</l>
<l>Without all fire, yet in its voyage through space</l>
<l>Igniteth, whilst it comes along, along,-</l>
<l>Losing some larger bodies which cannot</l>
<l>Pass, like the others, through the bulks of air,-</l>
<l>And, scraping together out of air itself</l>
<l>Some smaller bodies, carries them along,</l>
<l>And these, commingling, by their flight make fire:</l>
<l>Much in the manner as oft a leaden ball</l>
<l>Grows hot upon its aery course, the while</l>
<l>It loseth many bodies of stark cold</l>
<l>And taketh into itself along the air</l>
<l>New particles of fire. It happens, too,</l>
<l>That force of blow itself arouses fire,</l>
<l>When force of wind, a-cold and hurtled forth</l>
<l>Without all fire, hath strook somewhere amain-</l>
<l>No marvel, because, when with terrific stroke</l>
<l>'Thas smitten, the elements of fiery-stuff</l>
<l>Can stream together from out the very wind</l>
<l>And, simultaneously, from out that thing</l>
<l>Which then and there receives the stroke: as flies</l>
<l>The fire when with the steel we hack the stone;</l>
<l>Nor yet, because the force of steel's a-cold,</l>
<l>Rush the less speedily together there</l>
<l>Under the stroke its seeds of radiance hot.</l>
<l>And therefore, thuswise must an object too</l>
<l>Be kindled by a thunderbolt, if haply</l>
<l>'Thas been adapt and suited to the flames.</l>
<l>Yet force of wind must not be rashly deemed</l>
<l>As altogether and entirely cold-</l>
<l>That force which is discharged from on high</l>
<l>With such stupendous power; but if 'tis not</l>
<l>Upon its course already kindled with fire,</l>
<l>It yet arriveth warmed and mixed with heat.</l>

<l rend="indent">  And, now, the speed and stroke of thunderbolt</l>
<l>Is so tremendous, and with glide so swift</l>
<l>Those thunderbolts rush on and down, because</l>
<l>Their roused force itself collects itself</l>
<l>First always in the clouds, and then prepares</l>
<l>For the huge effort of their going-forth;</l>
<l>Next, when the cloud no longer can retain</l>
<l>The increment of their fierce impetus,</l>
<l>Their force is pressed out, and therefore flies</l>
<l>With impetus so wondrous, like to shots</l>
<l>Hurled from the powerful Roman catapults.</l>
<l>Note, too, this force consists of elements</l>
<l>Both small and smooth, nor is there aught that can</l>
<l>With ease resist such nature. For it darts</l>
<l>Between and enters through the pores of things;</l>
<l>And so it never falters in delay</l>
<l>Despite innumerable collisions, but</l>
<l>Flies shooting onward with a swift elan.</l>
<l>Next, since by nature always every weight</l>
<l>Bears downward, doubled is the swiftness then</l>
<l>And that elan is still more wild and dread,</l>
<l>When, verily, to weight are added blows,</l>
<l>So that more madly and more fiercely then</l>
<l>The thunderbolt shakes into shivers all</l>
<l>That blocks its path, following on its way.</l>
<l>Then, too, because it comes along, along</l>
<l>With one continuing elan, it must</l>
<l>Take on velocity anew, anew,</l>
<l>Which still increases as it goes, and ever</l>
<l>Augments the bolt's vast powers and to the blow</l>
<l>Gives larger vigour; for it forces all,</l>
<l>All of the thunder's seeds of fire, to sweep</l>
<l>In a straight line unto one place, as 'twere,-</l>
<l>Casting them one by other, as they roll,</l>
<l>Into that onward course. Again, perchance,</l>
<l>In coming along, it pulls from out the air</l>
<l>Some certain bodies, which by their own blows</l>
<l>Enkindle its velocity. And, lo,</l>
<l>It comes through objects leaving them unharmed,</l>
<l>It goes through many things and leaves them whole,</l>
<l>Because the liquid fire flieth along</l>
<l>Athrough their pores. And much it does transfix,</l>
<l>When these primordial atoms of the bolt</l>
<l>Have fallen upon the atoms of these things</l>
<l>Precisely where the intertwined atoms</l>
<l>Are held together. And, further, easily</l>
<l>Brass it unbinds and quickly fuseth gold,</l>
<l>Because its force is so minutely made</l>
<l>Of tiny parts and elements so smooth</l>
<l>That easily they wind their way within,</l>
<l>And, when once in, quickly unbind all knots</l>

<l rend="indent">                       But to return apace,</l>
<l>Easy it is from these same facts to know</l>
<l>In just what wise those things (which from their sort</l>
<l>The Greeks have named "bellows") do come down,</l>
<l>Discharged from on high, upon the seas.</l>
<l>For it haps that sometimes from the sky descends</l>
<l>Upon the seas a column, as if pushed,</l>
<l>Round which the surges seethe, tremendously</l>
<l>Aroused by puffing gusts; and whatso'er</l>
<l>Of ships are caught within that tumult then</l>
<l>Come into extreme peril, dashed along.</l>
<l>This haps when sometimes wind's aroused force</l>
<l>Can't burst the cloud it tries to, but down-weighs</l>
<l>That cloud, until 'tis like a column from sky</l>
<l>Upon the seas pushed downward- gradually,</l>
<l>As if a Somewhat from on high were shoved</l>
<l>By fist and nether thrust of arm, and lengthened</l>
<l>Far to the waves. And when the force of wind</l>
<l>Hath rived this cloud, from out the cloud it rushes</l>
<l>Down on the seas, and starts among the waves</l>
<l>A wondrous seething, for the eddying whirl</l>
<l>Descends and downward draws along with it</l>
<l>That cloud of ductile body. And soon as ever</l>
<l>'Thas shoved unto the levels of the main</l>
<l>That laden cloud, the whirl suddenly then</l>
<l>Plunges its whole self into the waters there</l>
<l>And rouses all the sea with monstrous roar,</l>
<l>Constraining it to seethe. It happens too</l>
<l>That very vortex of the wind involves</l>
<l>Itself in clouds, scraping from out the air</l>
<l>The seeds of cloud, and counterfeits, as 'twere,</l>
<l>The "bellows" pushed from heaven. And when this shape</l>
<l>Hath dropped upon the lands and burst apart,</l>
<l>It belches forth immeasurable might</l>
<l>Of whirlwind and of blast. Yet since 'tis formed</l>
<l>At most but rarely, and on land the hills</l>
<l>Must block its way, 'tis seen more oft out there</l>
<l>On the broad prospect of the level main</l>
<l>Along the free horizons.</l>

<l rend="indent">                          Into being</l>
<l>The clouds condense, when in this upper space</l>
<l>Of the high heaven have gathered suddenly,</l>
<l>As round they flew, unnumbered particles-</l>
<l>World's rougher ones, which can, though interlinked</l>
<l>With scanty couplings, yet be fastened firm,</l>
<l>The one on other caught. These particles</l>
<l>First cause small clouds to form; and, thereupon,</l>
<l>These catch the one on other and swarm in a flock</l>
<l>And grow by their conjoining, and by winds</l>
<l>Are borne along, along, until collects</l>
<l>The tempest fury. Happens, too, the nearer</l>
<l>The mountain summits neighbour to the sky,</l>
<l>The more unceasingly their far crags smoke</l>
<l>With the thick darkness of swart cloud, because</l>
<l>When first the mists do form, ere ever the eyes</l>
<l>Can there behold them (tenuous as they be),</l>
<l>The carrier-winds will drive them up and on</l>
<l>Unto the topmost summits of the mountain;</l>
<l>And then at last it happens, when they be</l>
<l>In vaster throng upgathered, that they can</l>
<l>By this very condensation lie revealed,</l>
<l>And that at same time they are seen to surge</l>
<l>From very vertex of the mountain up</l>
<l>Into far ether. For very fact and feeling,</l>
<l>As we up-climb high mountains, proveth clear</l>
<l>That windy are those upward regions free.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="470"/>
<l>Besides, the clothes hung-out along the shore,</l>
<l>When in they take the clinging moisture, prove</l>
<l>That nature lifts from over all the sea</l>
<l>Unnumbered particles. Whereby the more</l>
<l>'Tis manifest that many particles</l>
<l>Even from the salt upheavings of the main</l>
<l>Can rise together to augment the bulk</l>
<l>Of massed clouds. For moistures in these twain</l>
<l>Are near akin. Besides, from out all rivers,</l>
<l>As well as from the land itself, we see</l>
<l>Up-rising mists and steam, which like a breath</l>
<l>Are forced out from them and borne aloft,</l>
<l>To curtain heaven with their murk, and make,</l>
<l>By slow foregathering, the skiey clouds.</l>
<l>For, in addition, lo, the heat on high</l>
<l>Of constellated ether burdens down</l>
<l>Upon them, and by sort of condensation</l>
<l>Weaveth beneath the azure firmament</l>
<l>The reek of darkling cloud. It happens, too,</l>
<l>That hither to the skies from the Beyond</l>
<l>Do come those particles which make the clouds</l>
<l>And flying thunderheads. For I have taught</l>
<l>That this their number is innumerable</l>
<l>And infinite the sum of the Abyss,</l>
<l>And I have shown with what stupendous speed</l>
<l>Those bodies fly and how they're wont to pass</l>
<l>Amain through incommunicable space.</l>
<l>Therefore, 'tis not exceeding strange, if oft</l>
<l>In little time tempest and darkness cover</l>
<l>With bulking thunderheads hanging on high</l>
<l>The oceans and the lands, since everywhere</l>
<l>Through all the narrow tubes of yonder ether,</l>
<l>Yea, so to speak, through all the breathing-holes</l>

<l rend="indent">                       Now come, and how</l>
<l>The rainy moisture thickens into being</l>
<l>In the lofty clouds, and how upon the lands</l>
<l>'Tis then discharged in down-pour of large showers,</l>
<l>I will unfold. And first triumphantly</l>
<l>Will I persuade thee that up-rise together,</l>
<l>With clouds themselves, full many seeds of water</l>
<l>From out all things, and that they both increase-</l>
<l>Both clouds and water which is in the clouds-</l>
<l>In like proportion, as our frames increase</l>
<l>In like proportion with our blood, as well</l>
<l>As sweat or any moisture in our members.</l>
<l>Besides, the clouds take in from time to time</l>
<l>Much moisture risen from the broad marine,-</l>
<l>Whilst the winds bear them o'er the mighty sea,</l>
<l>Like hanging fleeces of white wool. Thuswise,</l>
<l>Even from all rivers is there lifted up</l>
<l>Moisture into the clouds. And when therein</l>
<l>The seeds of water so many in many ways</l>
<l>Have come together, augmented from all sides,</l>
<l>The close-jammed clouds then struggle to discharge</l>
<l>Their rain-storms for a two-fold reason: lo,</l>
<l>The wind's force crowds them, and the very excess</l>
<l>Of storm-clouds (massed in a vaster throng)</l>
<l>Giveth an urge and pressure from above</l>
<l>And makes the rains out-pour. Besides when, too,</l>
<l>The clouds are winnowed by the winds, or scattered</l>
<l>Smitten on top by heat of sun, they send</l>
<l>Their rainy moisture, and distil their drops,</l>
<l>Even as the wax, by fiery warmth on top,</l>
<l>Wasteth and liquefies abundantly.</l>
<l>But comes the violence of the bigger rains</l>
<l>When violently the clouds are weighted down</l>
<l>Both by their cumulated mass and by</l>
<l>The onset of the wind. And rains are wont</l>
<l>To endure awhile and to abide for long,</l>
<l>When many seeds of waters are aroused,</l>
<l>And clouds on clouds and racks on racks outstream</l>
<l>In piled layers and are borne along</l>
<l>From every quarter, and when all the earth</l>
<l>Smoking exhales her moisture. At such a time</l>
<l>When sun with beams amid the tempest-murk</l>
<l>Hath shone against the showers of black rains,</l>
<l>Then in the swart clouds there emerges bright</l>
<l>The radiance of the bow.</l>

<l>Now come, and what the law of earthquakes is</l>
<l>Hearken, and first of all take care to know</l>
<l>That the under-earth, like to the earth around us,</l>
<l>Is full of windy caverns all about;</l>
<l>And many a pool and many a grim abyss</l>
<l>She bears within her bosom, ay, and cliffs</l>
<l>And jagged scarps; and many a river, hid</l>
<l>Beneath her chine, rolls rapidly along</l>
<l>Its billows and plunging boulders. For clear fact</l>
<l>Requires that earth must be in every part</l>
<l>Alike in constitution. Therefore, earth,</l>
<l>With these things underneath affixed and set,</l>
<l>Trembleth above, jarred by big down-tumblings,</l>
<l>When time hath undermined the huge caves,</l>
<l>The subterranean. Yea, whole mountains fall,</l>
<l>And instantly from spot of that big jar</l>
<l>There quiver the tremors far and wide abroad.</l>
<l>And with good reason: since houses on the street</l>
<l>Begin to quake throughout, when jarred by a cart</l>
<l>Of no large weight; and, too, the furniture</l>
<l>Within the house up-bounds, when a paving-block</l>
<l>Gives either iron rim of the wheels a jolt.</l>
<l>It happens, too, when some prodigious bulk</l>
<l>Of age-worn soil is rolled from mountain slopes</l>
<l>Into tremendous pools of water dark,</l>
<l>That the reeling land itself is rocked about</l>
<l>By the water's undulations; as a basin</l>
<l>Sometimes won't come to rest until the fluid</l>
<l>Within it ceases to be rocked about</l>
<l>In random undulations.</l>
<l rend="indent">                            And besides,</l>
<l>When subterranean winds, up-gathered there</l>
<l>In the hollow deeps, bulk forward from one spot,</l>
<l>And press with the big urge of mighty powers</l>
<l>Against the lofty grottos, then the earth</l>
<l>Bulks to that quarter whither push amain</l>
<l>The headlong winds. Then all the builded houses</l>
<l>Above ground- and the more, the higher up-reared</l>
<l>Unto the sky- lean ominously, careening</l>
<l>Into the same direction; and the beams,</l>
<l>Wrenched forward, over-hang, ready to go.</l>
<l>Yet dread men to believe that there awaits</l>
<l>The nature of the mighty world a time</l>
<l>Of doom and cataclysm, albeit they see</l>
<l>So great a bulk of lands to bulge and break!</l>
<l>And lest the winds blew back again, no force</l>
<l>Could rein things in nor hold from sure career</l>
<l>On to disaster. But now because those winds</l>
<l>Blow back and forth in alternation strong,</l>
<l>And, so to say, rallying charge again,</l>
<l>And then repulsed retreat, on this account</l>
<l>Earth oftener threatens than she brings to pass</l>
<l>Collapses dire. For to one side she leans,</l>
<l>Then back she sways; and after tottering</l>
<l>Forward, recovers then her seats of poise.</l>
<l>Thus, this is why whole houses rock, the roofs</l>
<l>More than the middle stories, middle more</l>
<l>Than lowest, and the lowest least of all.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="577"/>
<l rend="indent">  Arises, too, this same great earth-quaking,</l>
<l>When wind and some prodigious force of air,</l>
<l>Collected from without or down within</l>
<l>The old telluric deeps, have hurled themselves</l>
<l>Amain into those caverns sub-terrene,</l>
<l>And there at first tumultuously chafe</l>
<l>Among the vasty grottos, borne about</l>
<l>In mad rotations, till their lashed force</l>
<l>Aroused out-bursts abroad, and then and there,</l>
<l>Riving the deep earth, makes a mighty chasm-</l>
<l>What once in Syrian Sidon did befall,</l>
<l>And once in Peloponnesian Aegium,</l>
<l>Twain cities which such out-break of wild air</l>
<l>And earth's convulsion, following hard upon,</l>
<l>O'erthrew of old. And many a walled town,</l>
<l>Besides, hath fall'n by such omnipotent</l>
<l>Convulsions on the land, and in the sea</l>
<l>Engulfed hath sunken many a city down</l>
<l>With all its populace. But if, indeed,</l>
<l>They burst not forth, yet is the very rush</l>
<l>Of the wild air and fury-force of wind</l>
<l>Then dissipated, like an ague-fit,</l>
<l>Through the innumerable pores of earth,</l>
<l>To set her all a-shake- even as a chill,</l>
<l>When it hath gone into our marrow-bones,</l>
<l>Sets us convulsively, despite ourselves,</l>

<l>With two-fold terror bustle in alarm</l>
<l>Through cities to and fro: they fear the roofs</l>
<l>Above the head; and underfoot they dread</l>
<l>The caverns, lest the nature of the earth</l>
<l>Suddenly rend them open, and she gape,</l>
<l>Herself asunder, with tremendous maw,</l>
<l>And, all confounded, seek to chock it full</l>
<l>With her own ruins. Let men, then, go on</l>
<l>Feigning at will that heaven and earth shall be</l>
<l>Inviolable, entrusted evermore</l>
<l>To an eternal weal: and yet at times</l>
<l>The very force of danger here at hand</l>
<l>Prods them on some side with this goad of fear-</l>
<l>This among others- that the earth, withdrawn</l>
<l>Abruptly from under their feet, be hurried down,</l>

<p>EXTRAORDINARY AND PARADOXICAL TELLURIC PHENOMENA</p>

<l rend="indent">  In chief, men marvel nature renders not</l>
<l>Bigger and bigger the bulk of ocean, since</l>
<l>So vast the down-rush of the waters be,</l>
<l>And every river out of every realm</l>
<l>Cometh thereto; and add the random rains</l>
<l>And flying tempests, which spatter every sea</l>
<l>And every land bedew; add their own springs:</l>
<l>Yet all of these unto the ocean's sum</l>
<l>Shall be but as the increase of a drop.</l>
<l>Wherefore 'tis less a marvel that the sea,</l>
<l>The mighty ocean, increaseth not. Besides,</l>
<l>Sun with his heat draws off a mighty part:</l>
<l>Yea, we behold that sun with burning beams</l>
<l>To dry our garments dripping all with wet;</l>
<l>And many a sea, and far out-spread beneath,</l>
<l>Do we behold. Therefore, however slight</l>
<l>The portion of wet that sun on any spot</l>
<l>Culls from the level main, he still will take</l>
<l>From off the waves in such a wide expanse</l>
<l>Abundantly. Then, further, also winds,</l>
<l>Sweeping the level waters, can bear off</l>
<l>A mighty part of wet, since we behold</l>
<l>Oft in a single night the highways dried</l>
<l>By winds, and soft mud crusted o'er at dawn.</l>
<l>Again, I've taught thee that the clouds bear off</l>
<l>Much moisture too, up-taken from the reaches</l>
<l>Of the mighty main, and sprinkle it about</l>
<l>O'er all the zones, when rain is on the lands</l>
<l>And winds convey the aery racks of vapour.</l>
<l>Lastly, since earth is porous through her frame,</l>
<l>And neighbours on the seas, girdling their shores,</l>
<l>The water's wet must seep into the lands</l>
<l>From briny ocean, as from lands it comes</l>
<l>Into the seas. For brine is filtered off,</l>
<l>And then the liquid stuff seeps back again</l>
<l>And all re-poureth at the river-heads,</l>
<l>Whence in fresh-water currents it returns</l>
<l>Over the lands, adown the channels which</l>
<l>Were cleft erstwhile and erstwhile bore along</l>
<l>The liquid-footed floods.</l>

<l>Such vast tornado-fires out-breathe at times,</l>
<l>I will unfold: for with no middling might</l>
<l>Of devastation the flamy tempest rose</l>
<l>And held dominion in Sicilian fields:</l>
<l>Drawing upon itself the upturned faces</l>
<l>Of neighbouring clans, what time they saw afar</l>
<l>The skiey vaults a-fume and sparkling all,</l>
<l>And filled their bosoms with dread anxiety</l>
<l>Of what new thing nature were travailing at.</l>
<l rend="indent">  In these affairs it much behooveth thee</l>
<l>To look both wide and deep, and far abroad</l>
<l>To peer to every quarter, that thou mayst</l>
<l>Remember how boundless is the Sum-of-Things,</l>
<l>And mark how infinitely small a part</l>
<l>Of the whole Sum is this one sky of ours-</l>
<l>O not so large a part as is one man</l>
<l>Of the whole earth. And plainly if thou viewest</l>
<l>This cosmic fact, placing it square in front,</l>
<l>And plainly understandest, thou wilt leave</l>
<l>Wondering at many things. For who of us</l>
<l>Wondereth if some one gets into his joints</l>
<l>A fever, gathering head with fiery heat,</l>
<l>Or any other dolorous disease</l>
<l>Along his members? For anon the foot</l>
<l>Grows blue and bulbous; often the sharp twinge</l>
<l>Seizes the teeth, attacks the very eyes;</l>
<l>Out-breaks the sacred fire, and, crawling on</l>
<l>Over the body, burneth every part</l>
<l>It seizeth on, and works its hideous way</l>
<l>Along the frame. No marvel this, since, lo,</l>
<l>Of things innumerable be seeds enough,</l>
<l>And this our earth and sky do bring to us</l>
<l>Enough of bane from whence can grow the strength</l>
<l>Of maladies uncounted. Thuswise, then,</l>

<l>Are ever supplied from out the infinite</l>
<l>All things, O all in stores enough whereby</l>
<l>The shaken earth can of a sudden move,</l>
<l>And fierce typhoons can over sea and lands</l>
<l>Go tearing on, and Aetna's fires o'erflow,</l>
<l>And heaven become a flame-burst. For that, too,</l>
<l>Happens at times, and the celestial vaults</l>
<l>Glow into fire, and rainy tempests rise</l>
<l>In heavier congregation, when, percase,</l>
<l>The seeds of water have foregathered thus</l>
<l>From out the infinite. "Aye, but passing huge</l>
<l>The fiery turmoil of that conflagration!"</l>
<l>So sayst thou; well, huge many a river seems</l>
<l>To him that erstwhile ne'er a larger saw;</l>
<l>Thus, huge seems tree or man; and everything</l>
<l>Which mortal sees the biggest of each class,</l>

<l>All under-hollow, propped about, about</l>
<l>With caverns of basaltic piers. And, lo,</l>
<l>In all its grottos be there wind and air-</l>
<l>For wind is made when air hath been uproused</l>
<l>By violent agitation. When this air</l>
<l>Is heated through and through, and, raging round,</l>
<l>Hath made the earth and all the rocks it touches</l>
<l>Horribly hot, and hath struck off from them</l>
<l>Fierce fire of swiftest flame, it lifts itself</l>
<l>And hurtles thus straight upwards through its throat</l>
<l>Into high heav'n, and thus bears on afar</l>
<l>Its burning blasts and scattereth afar</l>
<l>Its ashes, and rolls a smoke of pitchy murk</l>
<l>And heaveth the while boulders of wondrous weight-</l>
<l>Leaving no doubt in thee that 'tis the air's</l>
<l>Tumultuous power. Besides, in mighty part,</l>
<l>The sea there at the roots of that same mount</l>
<l>Breaks its old billows and sucks back its surf.</l>
<l>And grottos from the sea pass in below</l>
<l>Even to the bottom of the mountain's throat.</l>
<l>Herethrough thou must admit there go...</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>

<l>Deeply to penetrate from the open sea,</l>
<l>And to out-blow abroad, and to up-bear</l>
<l>Thereby the flame, and to up-cast from deeps</l>
<l>The boulders, and to rear the clouds of sand.</l>
<l>For at the top be "bowls," as people there</l>

<l>For prove thou mayst he perished not by steel,</l>
<l>By cold, nor even by poison nor disease,</l>
<l>Yet somewhat of this sort hath come to him</l>

<l>Often and oft he waters Aegypt o'er,</l>
<l>Either because in summer against his mouths</l>
<l>Come those northwinds which at that time of year</l>
<l>Men name the Etesian blasts, and, blowing thus</l>

<l>Whereby the river's outlet were less free,</l>
<l>Likewise less headlong his descending floods.</l>
<l>It may be, too, that in this season rains</l>
<l>Are more abundant at its fountain head,</l>
<l>Because the Etesian blasts of those northwinds</l>
<l>Then urge all clouds into those inland parts.</l>
<l>And, soothly, when they're thus foregathered there,</l>
<l>Urged yonder into midmost realm of day,</l>
<l>Then, crowded against the lofty mountain sides,</l>
<l>They're massed and powerfully pressed. Again,</l>
<l>Perchance, his waters wax, O far away,</l>
<l>Among the Aethiopians' lofty mountains,</l>
<l>When the all-beholding sun with thawing beams</l>
<l>Drives the white snows to flow into the vales.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="738"/>
<l rend="indent">  Now come; and unto thee I will unfold,</l>
<l>As to the Birdless spots and Birdless tarns,</l>
<l>What sort of nature they are furnished with.</l>
<l>First, as to name of "birdless,"- that derives</l>
<l>From very fact, because they noxious be</l>
<l>Unto all birds. For when above those spots</l>
<l>In horizontal flight the birds have come,</l>
<l>Forgetting to oar with wings, they furl their sails,</l>
<l>And, with down-drooping of their delicate necks,</l>
<l>Fall headlong into earth, if haply such</l>
<l>The nature of the spots, or into water,</l>
<l>If haply spreads thereunder Birdless tarn.</l>
<l>Such spot's at <placeName key="tgn,7006931">Cumae</placeName>, where the mountains smoke,</l>
<l>Charged with the pungent sulphur, and increased</l>
<l>With steaming springs. And such a spot there is</l>
<l>Within the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, even there</l>
<l>On summit of Acropolis, beside</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,1123869">Fane</placeName> of Tritonian Pallas bountiful,</l>
<l>Where never cawing crows can wing their course,</l>
<l>Not even when smoke the altars with good gifts,-</l>
<l>But evermore they flee- yet not from wrath</l>
<l>Of Pallas, grieved at that espial old,</l>
<l>As poets of the Greeks have sung the tale;</l>
<l>But very nature of the place compels.</l>
<l>In <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> also- as men say- a spot</l>
<l>Is to be seen, where also four-foot kinds,</l>
<l>As soon as ever they've set their steps within,</l>
<l>Collapse, o'ercome by its essential power,</l>
<l>As if there slaughtered to the under-gods.</l>
<l>Lo, all these wonders work by natural law,</l>
<l>And from what causes they are brought to pass</l>
<l>The origin is manifest; so, haply,</l>
<l>Let none believe that in these regions stands</l>
<l>The gate of Orcus, nor us then suppose,</l>
<l>Haply, that thence the under-gods draw down</l>
<l>Souls to dark shores of Acheron- as stags,</l>
<l>The wing-footed, are thought to draw to light,</l>
<l>By sniffing nostrils, from their dusky lairs</l>
<l>The wriggling generations of wild snakes.</l>
<l>How far removed from true reason is this,</l>
<l>Perceive thou straight; for now I'll try to say</l>
<l>Somewhat about the very fact.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="769"/>
<l rend="indent">                                 And, first,</l>
<l>This do I say, as oft I've said before:</l>
<l>In earth are atoms of things of every sort;</l>
<l>And know, these all thus rise from out the earth-</l>
<l>Many life-giving which be good for food,</l>
<l>And many which can generate disease</l>
<l>And hasten death, O many primal seeds</l>
<l>Of many things in many modes- since earth</l>
<l>Contains them mingled and gives forth discrete.</l>
<l>And we have shown before that certain things</l>
<l>Be unto certain creatures suited more</l>
<l>For ends of life, by virtue of a nature,</l>
<l>A texture, and primordial shapes, unlike</l>
<l>For kinds alike. Then too 'tis thine to see</l>
<l>How many things oppressive be and foul</l>
<l>To man, and to sensation most malign:</l>
<l>Many meander miserably through ears;</l>
<l>Many in-wind athrough the nostrils too,</l>
<l>Malign and harsh when mortal draws a breath;</l>
<l>Of not a few must one avoid the touch;</l>
<l>Of not a few must one escape the sight;</l>
<l>And some there be all loathsome to the taste;</l>
<l>And many, besides, relax the languid limbs</l>
<l>Along the frame, and undermine the soul</l>
<l>In its abodes within. To certain trees</l>
<l>There hath been given so dolorous a shade</l>
<l>That often they gender achings of the head,</l>
<l>If one but be beneath, outstretched on the sward.</l>
<l>There is, again, on Helicon's high hills</l>
<l>A tree that's wont to kill a man outright</l>
<l>By fetid odour of its very flower.</l>
<l>And when the pungent stench of the night-lamp,</l>
<l>Extinguished but a moment since, assails</l>
<l>The nostrils, then and there it puts to sleep</l>
<l>A man afflicted with the falling sickness</l>
<l>And foamings at the mouth. A woman, too,</l>
<l>At the heavy castor drowses back in chair,</l>
<l>And from her delicate fingers slips away</l>
<l>Her gaudy handiwork, if haply she</l>
<l>Hath got the whiff at menstruation-time.</l>
<l>Once more, if thou delayest in hot baths,</l>
<l>When thou art over-full, how readily</l>
<l>From stool in middle of the steaming water</l>
<l>Thou tumblest in a fit! How readily</l>
<l>The heavy fumes of charcoal wind their way</l>
<l>Into the brain, unless beforehand we</l>
<l>Of water 've drunk. But when a burning fever,</l>
<l>O'ermastering man, hath seized upon his limbs,</l>
<l>Then odour of wine is like a hammer-blow.</l>
<l>And seest thou not how in the very earth</l>
<l>Sulphur is gendered and bitumen thickens</l>
<l>With noisome stench?- What direful stenches, too,</l>
<l>Scaptensula out-breathes from down below,</l>
<l>When men pursue the veins of silver and gold,</l>
<l>With pick-axe probing round the hidden realms</l>
<l>Deep in the earth?- Or what of deadly bane</l>
<l>The mines of gold exhale? O what a look,</l>
<l>And what a ghastly hue they give to men!</l>
<l>And seest thou not, or hearest, how they're wont</l>
<l>In little time to perish, and how fail</l>
<l>The life-stores in those folk whom mighty power</l>
<l>Of grim necessity confineth there</l>
<l>In such a task? Thus, this telluric earth</l>
<l>Out-streams with all these dread effluvia</l>
<l>And breathes them out into the open world</l>
<l>And into the visible regions under heaven.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="818"/>
<l rend="indent">  Thus, too, those Birdless places must up-send</l>
<l>An essence bearing death to winged things,</l>
<l>Which from the earth rises into the breezes</l>
<l>To poison part of skiey space, and when</l>
<l>Thither the winged is on pennons borne,</l>
<l>There, seized by the unseen poison, 'tis ensnared,</l>
<l>And from the horizontal of its flight</l>
<l>Drops to the spot whence sprang the effluvium.</l>
<l>And when 'thas there collapsed, then the same power</l>
<l>Of that effluvium takes from all its limbs</l>
<l>The relics of its life. That power first strikes</l>
<l>The creatures with a wildering dizziness,</l>
<l>And then thereafter, when they're once down-fallen</l>
<l>Into the poison's very fountains, then</l>
<l>Life, too, they vomit out perforce, because</l>
<l>So thick the stores of bane around them fume.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Again, at times it happens that this power,</l>
<l>This exhalation of the Birdless places,</l>
<l>Dispels the air betwixt the ground and birds,</l>
<l>Leaving well-nigh a void. And thither when</l>
<l>In horizontal flight the birds have come,</l>
<l>Forthwith their buoyancy of pennons limps,</l>
<l>All useless, and each effort of both wings</l>
<l>Falls out in vain. Here, when without all power</l>
<l>To buoy themselves and on their wings to lean,</l>
<l>Lo, nature constrains them by their weight to slip</l>
<l>Down to the earth, and lying prostrate there</l>
<l>Along the well-nigh empty void, they spend</l>
<l>Their souls through all the openings of their frame.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="840"/>
<l rend="indent">  Further, the water of wells is colder then</l>
<l>At summer time, because the earth by heat</l>
<l>Is rarefied, and sends abroad in air</l>
<l>Whatever seeds it peradventure have</l>
<l>Of its own fiery exhalations.</l>
<l>The more, then, the telluric ground is drained</l>
<l>Of heat, the colder grows the water hid</l>
<l>Within the earth. Further, when all the earth</l>
<l>Is by the cold compressed, and thus contracts</l>
<l>And, so to say, concretes, it happens, lo,</l>
<l>That by contracting it expresses then</l>
<l>Into the wells what heat it bears itself.</l>
<l rend="indent">  'Tis said at Hammon's fane a fountain is,</l>
<l>In daylight cold and hot in time of night.</l>
<l>This fountain men be-wonder over-much,</l>
<l>And think that suddenly it seethes in heat</l>
<l>By intense sun, the subterranean, when</l>
<l>Night with her terrible murk hath cloaked the lands-</l>
<l>What's not true reasoning by a long remove:</l>
<l>I' faith when sun o'erhead, touching with beams</l>
<l>An open body of water, had no power</l>
<l>To render it hot upon its upper side,</l>
<l>Though his high light possess such burning glare,</l>
<l>How, then, can he, when under the gross earth,</l>
<l>Make water boil and glut with fiery heat?-</l>
<l>And, specially, since scarcely potent he</l>
<l>Through hedging walls of houses to inject</l>
<l>His exhalations hot, with ardent rays.</l>
<l>What, then's, the principle? Why, this, indeed:</l>
<l>The earth about that spring is porous more</l>
<l>Than elsewhere the telluric ground, and be</l>
<l>Many the seeds of fire hard by the water;</l>
<l>On this account, when night with dew-fraught shades</l>
<l>Hath whelmed the earth, anon the earth deep down</l>
<l>Grows chill, contracts; and thuswise squeezes out</l>
<l>Into the spring what seeds she holds of fire</l>
<l>(As one might squeeze with fist), which render hot</l>
<l>The touch and steam of the fluid. Next, when sun,</l>
<l>Up-risen, with his rays has split the soil</l>
<l>And rarefied the earth with waxing heat,</l>
<l>Again into their ancient abodes return</l>
<l>The seeds of fire, and all the Hot of water</l>
<l>Into the earth retires; and this is why</l>
<l>The fountain in the daylight gets so cold.</l>
<l>Besides, the water's wet is beat upon</l>
<l>By rays of sun, and, with the dawn, becomes</l>
<l>Rarer in texture under his pulsing blaze;</l>
<l>And, therefore, whatso seeds it holds of fire</l>
<l>It renders up, even as it renders oft</l>
<l>The frost that it contains within itself</l>
<l>And thaws its ice and looseneth the knots.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="879"/>
<l>There is, moreover, a fountain cold in kind</l>
<l>That makes a bit of tow (above it held)</l>
<l>Take fire forthwith and shoot a flame; so, too,</l>
<l>A pitch-pine torch will kindle and flare round</l>
<l>Along its waves, wherever 'tis impelled</l>
<l>Afloat before the breeze. No marvel, this:</l>
<l>Because full many seeds of heat there be</l>
<l>Within the water; and, from earth itself</l>
<l>Out of the deeps must particles of fire</l>
<l>Athrough the entire fountain surge aloft,</l>
<l>And speed in exhalations into air</l>
<l>Forth and abroad (yet not in numbers enow</l>
<l>As to make hot the fountain). And, moreo'er,</l>
<l>Some force constrains them, scattered through the water,</l>
<l>Forthwith to burst abroad, and to combine</l>
<l>In flame above. Even as a fountain far</l>
<l>There is at <placeName key="tgn,7016538">Aradus</placeName> amid the sea,</l>
<l>Which bubbles out sweet water and disparts</l>
<l>From round itself the salt waves; and, behold,</l>
<l>In many another region the broad main</l>
<l>Yields to the thirsty mariners timely help,</l>
<l>Belching sweet waters forth amid salt waves.</l>
<l>Just so, then, can those seeds of fire burst forth</l>
<l>Athrough that other fount, and bubble out</l>
<l>Abroad against the bit of tow; and when</l>
<l>They there collect or cleave unto the torch,</l>
<l>Forthwith they readily flash aflame, because</l>
<l>The tow and torches, also, in themselves</l>
<l>Have many seeds of latent fire. Indeed,</l>
<l>And seest thou not, when near the nightly lamps</l>
<l>Thou bringest a flaxen wick, extinguished</l>
<l>A moment since, it catches fire before</l>
<l>'Thas touched the flame, and in same wise a torch?</l>
<l>And many another object flashes aflame</l>
<l>When at a distance, touched by heat alone,</l>
<l>Before 'tis steeped in veritable fire.</l>
<l>This, then, we must suppose to come to pass</l>
<l>In that spring also.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="906"/>
<l rend="indent">                      Now to other things!</l>
<l>And I'll begin to treat by what decree</l>
<l>Of nature it came to pass that iron can be</l>
<l>By that stone drawn which Greeks the magnet call</l>
<l>After the country's name (its origin</l>
<l>Being in country of Magnesian folk).</l>
<l>This stone men marvel at; and sure it oft</l>
<l>Maketh a chain of rings, depending, lo,</l>
<l>From off itself! Nay, thou mayest see at times</l>
<l>Five or yet more in order dangling down</l>
<l>And swaying in the delicate winds, whilst one</l>
<l>Depends from other, cleaving to under-side,</l>
<l>And ilk one feels the stone's own power and bonds-</l>
<l>So over-masteringly its power flows down.</l>
<l rend="indent">  In things of this sort, much must be made sure</l>
<l>Ere thou account of the thing itself canst give,</l>
<l>And the approaches roundabout must be;</l>
<l>Wherefore the more do I exact of thee</l>
<l>A mind and ears attent.</l>
<l rend="indent">                         First, from all things</l>
<l>We see soever, evermore must flow,</l>
<l>Must be discharged and strewn about, about,</l>
<l>Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.</l>
<l>From certain things flow odours evermore,</l>
<l>As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray</l>
<l>From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls</l>
<l>Along the coasts. Nor ever cease to seep</l>
<l>The varied echoings athrough the air.</l>
<l>Then, too, there comes into the mouth at times</l>
<l>The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea</l>
<l>We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch</l>
<l>The wormwood being mixed, its bitter stings.</l>
<l>To such degree from all things is each thing</l>
<l>Borne streamingly along, and sent about</l>
<l>To every region round; and nature grants</l>
<l>Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,</l>
<l>Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,</l>
<l>And all the time are suffered to descry</l>
<l>And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="936"/>
<l rend="indent">  Now will I seek again to bring to mind</l>
<l>How porous a body all things have- a fact</l>
<l>Made manifest in my first canto, too.</l>
<l>For, truly, though to know this doth import</l>
<l>For many things, yet for this very thing</l>
<l>On which straightway I'm going to discourse,</l>
<l>'Tis needful most of all to make it sure</l>
<l>That naught's at hand but body mixed with void.</l>
<l>A first ensample: in grottos, rocks o'erhead</l>
<l>Sweat moisture and distil the oozy drops;</l>
<l>Likewise, from all our body seeps the sweat;</l>
<l>There grows the beard, and along our members all</l>
<l>And along our frame the hairs. Through all our veins</l>
<l>Disseminates the foods, and gives increase</l>
<l>And aliment down to the extreme parts,</l>
<l>Even to the tiniest finger-nails. Likewise,</l>
<l>Through solid bronze the cold and fiery heat</l>
<l>We feel to pass; likewise, we feel them pass</l>
<l>Through gold, through silver, when we clasp in hand</l>
<l>The brimming goblets. And, again, there flit</l>
<l>Voices through houses' hedging walls of stone;</l>
<l>Odour seeps through, and cold, and heat of fire</l>
<l>That's wont to penetrate even strength of iron.</l>
<l>Again, where corselet of the sky girds round</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>And at same time, some Influence of bane,</l>
<l>When from Beyond 'thas stolen into [our world].</l>
<l>And tempests, gathering from the earth and sky,</l>
<l>Back to the sky and earth absorbed retire-</l>
<l>With reason, since there's naught that's fashioned not</l>
<l>With body porous.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="959"/>
<l rend="indent">                   Furthermore, not all</l>
<l>The particles which be from things thrown off</l>
<l>Are furnished with same qualities for sense,</l>
<l>Nor be for all things equally adapt.</l>
<l>A first ensample: the sun doth bake and parch</l>
<l>The earth; but ice he thaws, and with his beams</l>
<l>Compels the lofty snows, up-reared white</l>
<l>Upon the lofty hills, to waste away;</l>
<l>Then, wax, if set beneath the heat of him,</l>
<l>Melts to a liquid. And the fire, likewise,</l>
<l>Will melt the copper and will fuse the gold,</l>
<l>But hides and flesh it shrivels up and shrinks.</l>
<l>The water hardens the iron just off the fire,</l>
<l>But hides and flesh (made hard by heat) it softens.</l>
<l>The oleaster-tree as much delights</l>
<l>The bearded she-goats, verily as though</l>
<l>'Twere nectar-steeped and shed ambrosia;</l>
<l>Than which is naught that burgeons into leaf</l>
<l>More bitter food for man. A hog draws back</l>
<l>For marjoram oil, and every unguent fears</l>
<l>Fierce poison these unto the bristled hogs,</l>
<l>Yet unto us from time to time they seem,</l>
<l>As 'twere, to give new life. But, contrariwise,</l>
<l>Though unto us the mire be filth most foul,</l>
<l>To hogs that mire doth so delightsome seem</l>
<l>That they with wallowing from belly to back</l>
<l>Are never cloyed.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="979"/>
<l rend="indent">                   A point remains, besides,</l>
<l>Which best it seems to tell of, ere I go</l>
<l>To telling of the fact at hand itself.</l>
<l>Since to the varied things assigned be</l>
<l>The many pores, those pores must be diverse</l>
<l>In nature one from other, and each have</l>
<l>Its very shape, its own direction fixed.</l>
<l>And so, indeed, in breathing creatures be</l>
<l>The several senses, of which each takes in</l>
<l>Unto itself, in its own fashion ever,</l>
<l>Its own peculiar object. For we mark</l>
<l>How sounds do into one place penetrate,</l>
<l>Into another flavours of all juice,</l>
<l>And savour of smell into a third. Moreover,</l>
<l>One sort through rocks we see to seep, and, lo,</l>
<l>One sort to pass through wood, another still</l>
<l>Through gold, and others to go out and off</l>
<l>Through silver and through glass. For we do see</l>
<l>Through some pores form-and-look of things to flow,</l>
<l>Through others heat to go, and some things still</l>
<l>To speedier pass than others through same pores.</l>
<l>Of verity, the nature of these same paths,</l>
<l>Varying in many modes (as aforesaid)</l>
<l>Because of unlike nature and warp and woof</l>
<l>Of cosmic things, constrains it so to be.</l>
<l rend="indent">  Wherefore, since all these matters now have been</l>
<l>Established and settled well for us</l>
<l>As premises prepared, for what remains</l>
<l>'Twill not be hard to render clear account</l>
<l>By means of these, and the whole cause reveal</l>
<l>Whereby the magnet lures the strength of iron.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1002"/>
<l>First, stream there must from off the lode-stone seeds</l>
<l>Innumerable, a very tide, which smites</l>
<l>By blows that air asunder lying betwixt</l>
<l>The stone and iron. And when is emptied out</l>
<l>This space, and a large place between the two</l>
<l>Is made a void, forthwith the primal germs</l>
<l>Of iron, headlong slipping, fall conjoined</l>
<l>Into the vacuum, and the ring itself</l>
<l>By reason thereof doth follow after and go</l>
<l>Thuswise with all its body. And naught there is</l>
<l>That of its own primordial elements</l>
<l>More thoroughly knit or tighter linked coheres</l>
<l>Than nature and cold roughness of stout iron.</l>
<l>Wherefore, 'tis less a marvel what I said,</l>
<l>That from such elements no bodies can</l>
<l>From out the iron collect in larger throng</l>
<l>And be into the vacuum borne along,</l>
<l>Without the ring itself do follow after.</l>
<l>And this it does, and followeth on until</l>
<l>'Thath reached the stone itself and cleaved to it</l>
<l>By links invisible. Moreover, likewise,</l>
<l>The motion's assisted by a thing of aid</l>
<l>(Whereby the process easier becomes),-</l>
<l>Namely, by this: as soon as rarer grows</l>
<l>That air in front of the ring, and space between</l>
<l>Is emptied more and made a void, forthwith</l>
<l>It happens all the air that lies behind</l>
<l>Conveys it onward, pushing from the rear.</l>
<l>For ever doth the circumambient air</l>
<l>Drub things unmoved, but here it pushes forth</l>
<l>The iron, because upon one side the space</l>
<l>Lies void and thus receives the iron in.</l>
<l>This air, whereof I am reminding thee,</l>
<l>Winding athrough the iron's abundant pores</l>
<l>So subtly into the tiny parts thereof,</l>
<l>Shoves it and pushes, as wind the ship and sails.</l>
<l>The same doth happen in all directions forth:</l>
<l>From whatso side a space is made a void,</l>
<l>Whether from crosswise or above, forthwith</l>
<l>The neighbour particles are borne along</l>
<l>Into the vacuum; for of verity,</l>
<l>They're set a-going by poundings from elsewhere,</l>
<l>Nor by themselves of own accord can they</l>
<l>Rise upwards into the air. Again, all things</l>
<l>Must in their framework hold some air, because</l>
<l>They are of framework porous, and the air</l>
<l>Encompasses and borders on all things.</l>
<l>Thus, then, this air in iron so deeply stored</l>
<l>Is tossed evermore in vexed motion,</l>
<l>And therefore drubs upon the ring sans doubt</l>
<l>And shakes it up inside....</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>In sooth, that ring is thither borne along</l>
<l>To where 'thas once plunged headlong- thither, lo,</l>
<l>Unto the void whereto it took its start.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1042"/>
<l rend="indent">  It happens, too, at times that nature of iron</l>
<l>Shrinks from this stone away, accustomed</l>
<l>By turns to flee and follow. Yea, I've seen</l>
<l>Those Samothracian iron rings leap up,</l>
<l>And iron filings in the brazen bowls</l>
<l>Seethe furiously, when underneath was set</l>
<l>The magnet stone. So strongly iron seems</l>
<l>To crave to flee that rock. Such discord great</l>
<l>Is gendered by the interposed brass,</l>
<l>Because, forsooth, when first the tide of brass</l>
<l>Hath seized upon and held possession of</l>
<l>The iron's open passage-ways, thereafter</l>
<l>Cometh the tide of the stone, and in that iron</l>
<l>Findeth all spaces full, nor now hath holes</l>
<l>To swim through, as before. 'Tis thus constrained</l>
<l>With its own current 'gainst the iron's fabric</l>
<l>To dash and beat; by means whereof it spues</l>
<l>Forth from itself- and through the brass stirs up-</l>
<l>The things which otherwise without the brass</l>
<l>It sucks into itself. In these affairs</l>
<l>Marvel thou not that from this stone the tide</l>
<l>Prevails not likewise other things to move</l>
<l>With its own blows: for some stand firm by weight,</l>
<l>As gold; and some cannot be moved forever,</l>
<l>Because so porous in their framework they</l>
<l>That there the tide streams through without a break,</l>
<l>Of which sort stuff of wood is seen to be.</l>
<l>Therefore, when iron (which lies between the two)</l>
<l>Hath taken in some atoms of the brass,</l>
<l>Then do the streams of that Magnesian rock</l>
<l>Move iron by their smitings.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1065"/>
<l rend="indent">                              Yet these things</l>
<l>Are not so alien from others, that I</l>
<l>Of this same sort am ill prepared to name</l>
<l>Ensamples still of things exclusively</l>
<l>To one another adapt. Thou seest, first,</l>
<l>How lime alone cementeth stones: how wood</l>
<l>Only by glue-of-bull with wood is joined-</l>
<l>So firmly too that oftener the boards</l>
<l>Crack open along the weakness of the grain</l>
<l>Ere ever those taurine bonds will lax their hold.</l>
<l>The vine-born juices with the water-springs</l>
<l>Are bold to mix, though not the heavy pitch</l>
<l>With the light oil-of-olive. And purple dye</l>
<l>Of shell-fish so uniteth with the wool's</l>
<l>Body alone that it cannot be ta'en</l>
<l>Away forever- nay, though thou gavest toil</l>
<l>To restore the same with the Neptunian flood,</l>
<l>Nay, though all ocean willed to wash it out</l>
<l>With all its waves. Again, gold unto gold</l>
<l>Doth not one substance bind, and only one?</l>
<l>And is not brass by tin joined unto brass?</l>
<l>And other ensamples how many might one find!</l>
<l>What then? Nor is there unto thee a need</l>
<l>Of such long ways and roundabout, nor boots it</l>
<l>For me much toil on this to spend. More fit</l>
<l>It is in few words briefly to embrace</l>
<l>Things many: things whose textures fall together</l>
<l>So mutually adapt, that cavities</l>
<l>To solids correspond, these cavities</l>
<l>Of this thing to the solid parts of that,</l>
<l>And those of that to solid parts of this-</l>
<l>Such joinings are the best. Again, some things</l>
<l>Can be the one with other coupled and held,</l>
<l>Linked by hooks and eyes, as 'twere; and this</l>
<l>Seems more the fact with iron and this stone.</l>

<l>Now, of diseases what the law, and whence</l>
<l>The Influence of bane upgathering can</l>
<l>Upon the race of man and herds of cattle</l>
<l>Kindle a devastation fraught with death,</l>
<l>I will unfold. And, first, I've taught above</l>
<l>That seeds there be of many things to us</l>
<l>Life-giving, and that, contrariwise, there must</l>
<l>Fly many round bringing disease and death.</l>
<l>When these have, haply, chanced to collect</l>
<l>And to derange the atmosphere of earth,</l>
<l>The air becometh baneful. And, lo, all</l>
<l>That Influence of bane, that pestilence,</l>
<l>Or from Beyond down through our atmosphere,</l>
<l>Like clouds and mists, descends, or else collects</l>
<l>From earth herself and rises, when, a-soak</l>
<l>And beat by rains unseasonable and suns,</l>
<l>Our earth hath then contracted stench and rot.</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> thou not, also, that whoso arrive</l>
<l>In region far from fatherland and home</l>
<l>Are by the strangeness of the clime and waters</l>
<l>Distempered?- since conditions vary much.</l>
<l>For in what else may we suppose the clime</l>
<l>Among the Britons to differ from Aegypt's own</l>
<l>(Where totters awry the axis of the world),</l>
<l>Or in what else to differ Pontic clime</l>
<l>From <placeName key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>' and from climes adown the south,</l>
<l>On to black generations of strong men</l>
<l>With sun-baked skins? Even as we thus do see</l>
<l>Four climes diverse under the four main-winds</l>
<l>And under the four main-regions of the sky,</l>
<l>So, too, are seen the colour and face of men</l>
<l>Vastly to disagree, and fixed diseases</l>
<l>To seize the generations, kind by kind:</l>
<l>There is the elephant-disease which down</l>
<l>In midmost Aegypt, hard by streams of <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>,</l>
<l>Engendered is- and never otherwhere.</l>
<l>In <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> the feet are oft attacked,</l>
<l>And in Achaean lands the eyes. And so</l>
<l>The divers spots to divers parts and limbs</l>
<l>Are noxious; 'tis a variable air</l>
<l>That causes this. Thus when an atmosphere,</l>
<l>Alien by chance to us, begins to heave,</l>
<l>And noxious airs begin to crawl along,</l>
<l>They creep and wind like unto mist and cloud,</l>
<l>Slowly, and everything upon their way</l>
<l>They disarrange and force to change its state.</l>
<l>It happens, too, that when they've come at last</l>
<l>Into this atmosphere of ours, they taint</l>
<l>And make it like themselves and alien.</l>
<l>Therefore, asudden this devastation strange,</l>
<l>This pestilence, upon the waters falls,</l>
<l>Or settles on the very crops of grain</l>
<l>Or other meat of men and feed of flocks.</l>
<l>Or it remains a subtle force, suspense</l>
<l>In the atmosphere itself; and when therefrom</l>
<l>We draw our inhalations of mixed air,</l>
<l>Into our body equally its bane</l>
<l>Also we must suck in. In manner like,</l>
<l>Oft comes the pestilence upon the kine,</l>
<l>And sickness, too, upon the sluggish sheep.</l>
<l>Nor aught it matters whether journey we</l>
<l>To regions adverse to ourselves and change</l>
<l>The atmospheric cloak, or whether nature</l>
<l>Herself import a tainted atmosphere</l>
<l>To us or something strange to our own use</l>
<l>Which can attack us soon as ever it come.</l>

<p> THE PLAGUE ATHENS</p>

<l rend="indent">  'Twas such a manner of disease, 'twas such</l>
<l>Mortal miasma in Cecropian lands</l>
<l>Whilom reduced the plains to dead men's bones,</l>
<l>Unpeopled the highways, drained of citizens</l>
<l>The Athenian town. For coming from afar,</l>
<l>Rising in lands of Aegypt, traversing</l>
<l>Reaches of air and floating fields of foam,</l>
<l>At last on all Pandion's folk it swooped;</l>
<l>Whereat by troops unto disease and death</l>
<l>Were they o'er-given. At first, they'd bear about</l>
<l>A skull on fire with heat, and eyeballs twain</l>
<l>Red with suffusion of blank glare. Their throats,</l>
<l>Black on the inside, sweated oozy blood;</l>
<l>And the walled pathway of the voice of man</l>
<l>Was clogged with ulcers; and the very tongue,</l>
<l>The mind's interpreter, would trickle gore,</l>
<l>Weakened by torments, tardy, rough to touch.</l>
<l>Next when that Influence of bane had chocked,</l>
<l>Down through the throat, the breast, and streamed had</l>
<l>E'en into sullen heart of those sick folk,</l>
<l>Then, verily, all the fences of man's life</l>
<l>Began to topple. From the mouth the breath</l>
<l>Would roll a noisome stink, as stink to heaven</l>
<l>Rotting cadavers flung unburied out.</l>
<l>And, lo, thereafter, all the body's strength</l>
<l>And every power of mind would languish, now</l>
<l>In very doorway of destruction.</l>
<l>And anxious anguish and ululation (mixed</l>
<l>With many a groan) companioned alway</l>
<l>The intolerable torments. Night and day,</l>
<l>Recurrent spasms of vomiting would rack</l>
<l>Alway their thews and members, breaking down</l>
<l>With sheer exhaustion men already spent.</l>
<l>And yet on no one's body couldst thou mark</l>
<l>The skin with o'er-much heat to burn aglow,</l>
<l>But rather the body unto touch of hands</l>
<l>Would offer a warmish feeling, and thereby</l>
<l>Show red all over, with ulcers, so to say,</l>
<l>Inbranded, like the "sacred fires" o'erspread</l>
<l>Along the members. The inward parts of men,</l>
<l>In truth, would blaze unto the very bones;</l>
<l>A flame, like flame in furnaces, would blaze</l>
<l>Within the stomach. Nor couldst aught apply</l>
<l>Unto their members light enough and thin</l>
<l>For shift of aid- but coolness and a breeze</l>
<l>Ever and ever. Some would plunge those limbs</l>
<l>On fire with bane into the icy streams,</l>
<l>Hurling the body naked into the waves;</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1174"/>
<l>Many would headlong fling them deeply down</l>
<l>The water-pits, tumbling with eager mouth</l>
<l>Already agape. The insatiable thirst</l>
<l>That whelmed their parched bodies, lo, would make</l>
<l>A goodly shower seem like to scanty drops.</l>
<l>Respite of torment was there none. Their frames</l>
<l>Forspent lay prone. With silent lips of fear</l>
<l>Would Medicine mumble low, the while she saw</l>
<l>So many a time men roll their eyeballs round,</l>
<l>Staring wide-open, unvisited of sleep,</l>
<l>The heralds of old death. And in those months</l>
<l>Was given many another sign of death:</l>
<l>The intellect of mind by sorrow and dread</l>
<l>Deranged, the sad brow, the countenance</l>
<l>Fierce and delirious, the tormented ears</l>
<l>Beset with ringings, the breath quick and short</l>
<l>Or huge and intermittent, soaking sweat</l>
<l>A-glisten on neck, the spittle in fine gouts</l>
<l>Tainted with colour of crocus and so salt,</l>
<l>The cough scarce wheezing through the rattling throat.</l>
<l>Aye, and the sinews in the fingered hands</l>
<l>Were sure to contract, and sure the jointed frame</l>
<l>To shiver, and up from feet the cold to mount</l>
<l>Inch after inch: and toward the supreme hour</l>
<l>At last the pinched nostrils, nose's tip</l>
<l>A very point, eyes sunken, temples hollow,</l>
<l>Skin cold and hard, the shuddering grimace,</l>
<l>The pulled and puffy flesh above the brows!-</l>
<l>O not long after would their frames lie prone</l>
<l>In rigid death. And by about the eighth</l>
<l>Resplendent light of sun, or at the most</l>
<l>On the ninth flaming of his flambeau, they</l>
<l>Would render up the life. If any then</l>
<l>Had 'scaped the doom of that destruction, yet</l>
<l>Him there awaited in the after days</l>
<l>A wasting and a death from ulcers vile</l>
<l>And black discharges of the belly, or else</l>
<l>Through the clogged nostrils would there ooze along</l>
<l>Much fouled blood, oft with an aching head:</l>
<l>Hither would stream a man's whole strength and flesh.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1205"/>
<l>And whoso had survived that virulent flow</l>
<l>Of the vile blood, yet into thews of him</l>
<l>And into his joints and very genitals</l>
<l>Would pass the old disease. And some there were,</l>
<l>Dreading the doorways of destruction</l>
<l>So much, lived on, deprived by the knife</l>
<l>Of the male member; not a few, though lopped</l>
<l>Of hands and feet, would yet persist in life,</l>
<l>And some there were who lost their eyeballs: O</l>
<l>So fierce a fear of death had fallen on them!</l>
<l>And some, besides, were by oblivion</l>
<l>Of all things seized, that even themselves they knew</l>
<l>No longer. And though corpse on corpse lay piled</l>
<l>Unburied on ground, the race of birds and beasts</l>
<l>Would or spring back, scurrying to escape</l>
<l>The virulent stench, or, if they'd tasted there,</l>
<l>Would languish in approaching death. But yet</l>
<l>Hardly at all during those many suns</l>
<l>Appeared a fowl, nor from the woods went forth</l>
<l>The sullen generations of wild beasts-</l>
<l>They languished with disease and died and died.</l>
<l>In chief, the faithful dogs, in all the streets</l>
<l>Outstretched, would yield their breath distressfully</l>
<l>For so that Influence of bane would twist</l>
<l>Life from their members. Nor was found one sure</l>
<l>And universal principle of cure:</l>
<l>For what to one had given the power to take</l>
<l>The vital winds of air into his mouth,</l>
<l>And to gaze upward at the vaults of sky,</l>
<l>The same to others was their death and doom.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1230"/>
<l rend="indent">  In those affairs, O awfullest of all,</l>
<l>O pitiable most was this, was this:</l>
<l>Whoso once saw himself in that disease</l>
<l>Entangled, ay, as damned unto death,</l>
<l>Would lie in wanhope, with a sullen heart,</l>
<l>Would, in fore-vision of his funeral,</l>
<l>Give up the ghost, O then and there. For, lo,</l>
<l>At no time did they cease one from another</l>
<l>To catch contagion of the greedy plague,-</l>
<l>As though but woolly flocks and horned herds;</l>
<l>And this in chief would heap the dead on dead:</l>
<l>For who forbore to look to their own sick,</l>
<l>O these (too eager of life, of death afeard)</l>
<l>Would then, soon after, slaughtering Neglect</l>
<l>Visit with vengeance of evil death and base-</l>
<l>Themselves deserted and forlorn of help.</l>
<l>But who had stayed at hand would perish there</l>
<l>By that contagion and the toil which then</l>
<l>A sense of honour and the pleading voice</l>
<l>Of weary watchers, mixed with voice of wail</l>
<l>Of dying folk, forced them to undergo.</l>
<l>This kind of death each nobler soul would meet.</l>
<l>The funerals, uncompanioned, forsaken,</l>
<l>Like rivals contended to be hurried through.</l>
<l rend="indent">       .     .     .     .     .     .</l>
<l>And men contending to ensepulchre</l>
<l>Pile upon pile the throng of their own dead:</l>
<l>And weary with woe and weeping wandered home;</l>
<l>And then the most would take to bed from grief.</l>
<l>Nor could be found not one, whom nor disease</l>
<l>Nor death, nor woe had not in those dread times</l>
<l>Attacked.</l>
<milestone unit="card" n="1247"/>
<l rend="indent">  By now the shepherds and neatherds all,</l>
<l>Yea, even the sturdy guiders of curved ploughs,</l>
<l>Began to sicken, and their bodies would lie</l>
<l>Huddled within back-corners of their huts,</l>
<l>Delivered by squalor and disease to death.</l>
<l>O often and often couldst thou then have seen</l>
<l>On lifeless children lifeless parents prone,</l>
<l>Or offspring on their fathers', mothers' corpse</l>
<l>Yielding the life. And into the city poured</l>
<l>O not in least part from the countryside</l>
<l>That tribulation, which the peasantry</l>
<l>Sick, sick, brought thither, thronging from every quarter,</l>
<l>Plague-stricken mob. All places would they crowd,</l>
<l>All buildings too; whereby the more would death</l>
<l>Up-pile a-heap the folk so crammed in town.</l>
<l>Ah, many a body thirst had dragged and rolled</l>
<l>Along the highways there was lying strewn</l>
<l>Besides Silenus-headed water-fountains,-</l>
<l>The life-breath choked from that too dear desire</l>
<l>Of pleasant waters. Ah, everywhere along</l>
<l>The open places of the populace,</l>
<l>And along the highways, O thou mightest see</l>
<l>Of many a half-dead body the sagged limbs,</l>
<l>Rough with squalor, wrapped around with rags,</l>
<l>Perish from very nastiness, with naught</l>
<l>But skin upon the bones, well-nigh already</l>
<l>Buried- in ulcers vile and obscene filth.</l>
<l>All holy temples, too, of deities</l>
<l>Had Death becrammed with the carcasses;</l>
<l>And stood each fane of the Celestial Ones</l>
<l>Laden with stark cadavers everywhere-</l>
<l>Places which warders of the shrines had crowded</l>
<l>With many a guest. For now no longer men</l>
<l>Did mightily esteem the old Divine,</l>
<l>The worship of the gods: the woe at hand</l>
<l>Did over-master. Nor in the city then</l>
<l>Remained those rites of sepulture, with which</l>
<l>That pious folk had evermore been wont</l>
<l>To buried be. For it was wildered all</l>
<l>In wild alarms, and each and every one</l>
<l>With sullen sorrow would bury his own dead,</l>
<l>As present shift allowed. And sudden stress</l>
<l>And poverty to many an awful act</l>
<l>Impelled; and with a monstrous screaming they</l>
<l>Would, on the frames of alien funeral pyres,</l>
<l>Place their own kin, and thrust the torch beneath</l>
<l>Oft brawling with much bloodshed round about</l>
<l>Rather than quit dead bodies loved in life.</l>
