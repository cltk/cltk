<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Always, son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, have I observed you on the prowl to snatch some means of attack against your enemies.  So now at the tent of Ajax by the ships where he has his post at the camp's outer edge, I watch you<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>for a long time as you hunt and scan his newly pressed tracks, in order to see whether he is inside or away.  Your course leads you well to your goal, like that of a keen-scenting Laconian hound.  For the man has just now gone in,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>with sweat dripping from his head and from his hands that have killed with the sword.  There is no further need for you to peer inside these doors.  Rather tell me what your goal is that you have shown such eagerness for, so that you may learn from her who holds the knowledge.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Voice of Athena, dearest to me of the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>how clearly, though you are unseen, do I hear your call and snatch its meaning in my mind, just as I would the bronze tongue of the Tyrrhenian trumpet!  And now you have discerned correctly that I am circling my path on the track of a man who hates me, Ajax the shield-bearer.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>It is he and no other that I have been tracking so long.  For tonight he has done us a deed beyond comprehension&mdash;if he is indeed the doer.  We know nothing for certain, but drift in doubt.  And so I of my of accord took up the burden of this search.<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>For we recently found all the cattle, our plunder, dead&mdash;yes, slaughtered by human hand&mdash;and with them the guardians of the flocks.</p>
<p>Now, all men lay responsibility for this crime to him.  And further, a scout who had seen him<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>bounding alone over the plain with a newly-wet sword reported to me and declared what he saw.  Then immediately I rush upon his track, and sometimes I follow his signs, but sometimes I am bewildered, and cannot read whose they are.  Your arrival is timely, for truly in all matters, both those of the past<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>and those of the future, it is your hand that steers me.
</p></sp>
<milestone ed="p" n="36" unit="card"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>I know it, Odysseus, and some time ago I came on the path as a lookout friendly to your hunt.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>And so, dear mistress, do I toil to good effect?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Know that that man is the doer of these deeds.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>Then to what end did he thrust his hand so senselessly?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>He was mad with anger over the arms of Achilles.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Why, then, his onslaught upon the flocks?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>It was in your blood, he thought, that he was staining his hand.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Then was this a plot aimed against the Greeks?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>Yes, and he would have accomplished it, too, had I not been attentive.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>And what reckless boldness was in his mind that he dared this?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Under night's cover he set out against you, by stealth and alone.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>And did he get near us?  Did he reach his goal?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>He was already at the double doors of the two generals.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>How, then, did he restrain his hand when it was eager for murder?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>It was I who prevented him, by casting over his eyes oppressive notions of his fatal joy, and I who turned his fury aside on the flocks of sheep and the confused droves guarded by herdsmen, the spoil which you had not yet divided.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>Then he fell upon them and kept cutting out a slaughter of many horned beasts as he split their spines in a circle around him.  At one time he thought that he was killing the two Atreidae, holding them in his very hand;  at another time it was this commander, and at another that one which he attacked.  And I, while the man ran about in diseased frenzy,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>I kept urging him on, kept hurling him into the snares of doom.  Soon, when he rested from this toil, he bound together the living oxen along with with all the sheep and brought them home, as though his quarry were men, not well-horned cattle.  And now he abuses them, bound together, in the house.</p>
<p>But to you also will I show this madness openly, so that when you have seen it you may proclaim it to all the Argives.  Be of good courage and stand your ground, and do not regard the man as a cause of disaster for you.  I will turn away the beams of his eyes<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>and keep them from landing on your face.</p>
<stage>To Ajax.</stage>
<p>You there, you who bind back your captive's arms, I am calling you, come here!  I am calling Ajax!  Come out in front of the house!
</p></sp>
<milestone ed="p" n="74" unit="card"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>What are you doing, Athena?  Do not call him out.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>Hold your peace!  Do not earn a reputation for cowardice!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>No, by the gods, let it content you that he stay inside.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>What is the danger?  Was he not a man before?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Yes, a man hostile to me in the past, and especially now.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>And is not the sweetest mockery the mockery of enemies?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>I am content that he stay within his tent.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Do you fear to see a madman right before your eyes?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>I would not shrink from him in fear, if he were sane.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>But he will not see you now, even though you stand nearby.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>How could that be, if he still sees with the same eyes?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>I shall darken them, though their sight is keen.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>It is true: all is possible when a god contrives.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Stand silent, then, and stay where you are.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>I must stay.  But I would prefer to be far from here!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>You there, Ajax, once again I call you!<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>Why do you show so little regard for your ally?</p></sp>
<sp>
<stage>Enter Ajax, holding a blood-stained whip in his hand.</stage></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>Welcome, Athena!  Welcome, daughter sprung from Zeus!  How well have you stood by me!  I will crown you with trophies of pure gold in gratitude for this quarry!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>A fine pledge.  But tell me this&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>have you dyed your sword well in the Greek army?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>I can make that boast.  I do not deny it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>And have you launched your armed hand against the Atreidae?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>Yes, so that never again will they dishonor Ajax.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>The men are dead, as I interpret your words.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>Dead they are.  Now let them rob me of my arms!</p></sp><milestone ed="p" n="101" unit="card"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>I see.  And the son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, how does his fortune with respect to you?  Has he escaped you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>That blasted fox!  You ask me where he is?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Yes, I do.  I mean Odysseus, your adversary.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>My most pleasing prisoner, mistress, he sits inside.  I do not wish him to die just yet.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Until you do what?  Or win what greater advantage?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>Until he be bound to a pillar beneath my roof&mdash;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>What evil, then, will you inflict on the poor man?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>&mdash;and have his back crimsoned by the lash, before he dies.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Do not abuse the poor man so cruelly!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>In all else, Athena, I bid you take your pleasure, but he will pay this penalty and no other.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Well, then, since it delights you to do so,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>put your arm to use; spare no portion of your plan.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>I go to my work.  And I give you this commission:  be always for me the close-standing ally that you have been for me today!<stage>Exit Ajax.</stage></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Do you see, Odysseus, how great is the strength of the gods? Whom could you have found more prudent than this man,<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>or better able to do what the situation demanded?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>I know of no one, but in his misery I pity him all the same, even though he hates me, because he is yoked beneath a ruinous delusion&mdash;I think of my own lot no less than his.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>For I see that all we who live are nothing more than phantoms or fleeting shadow.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Therefore since you witness his fate, see that you yourself never utter an arrogant word against the gods, nor assume any swelling pride, if in the scales of fate you are weightier<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>than another in strength of hand or in depth of ample wealth.  For a day can press down all human things, and a day can raise them up.  But the gods embrace men of sense and abhor the evil.<stage>Exit Odysseus and Athena.</stage></p></sp><milestone ed="p" n="134" unit="card"/>
<div2 type="anapests">
<stage>Enter the Chorus of Salaminian Sailors, followers of Ajax.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Son of Telamon, you who hold<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>your throne on wave-washed <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> near the open sea, when your fortune is fair, I rejoice with you.  But whenever the stroke of Zeus, or the raging rumor of the Danaans with the clamor of their evil tongues attacks you, then I shrink with great fear and shudder in terror,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>like the fluttering eye of the winged dove.</p>
<p>Just so with the passing of the night loud tumults oppressed us to our dishonor, telling how you visited the meadow wild with horses and destroyed<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>the cattle of the Greeks, their spoil, prizes of the spear which had not yet been shared, how you killed them with flashing iron.</p>
<p>Such are the whispered slanders that Odysseus moulds and breathes into the ears of all,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>and he wins much belief.  For now he tells tales concerning you that easily win belief, and each hearer rejoices with spiteful scorn at your burdens more than he who told.</p>
<p>Point your shaft at a noble spirit,<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>and you could not miss;  but if a man were to speak such things against me, he would win no belief.  It is on the powerful that envy creeps.  Yet the small without the great are a teetering tower of defence.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>For the lowly  stand most upright and prosperous when allied with the great, and the great when served by less.</p>
<p>But foolish men cannot learn good precepts in these matters beforehand.  It is men of this sort that subject you to tumult, and<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>we lack the power to repel these charges without you, O King.  For when they have escaped your eye, they chatter like flocking birds.  But, terrified by a mighty vulture,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>perhaps, if you should appear, they would quickly cower without voice in silence.</p></sp><milestone ed="p" n="172" unit="card"/></div2>

Or can the bronze-cuirassed Lord of War<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>have had some cause for anger arising out of an alliance of spears, and taken vengeance for the outrage by contrivance shrouded in night?</p><milestone ed="p" n="182" unit="card"/></sp></div2>

<p>And if it is the great kings who slander you with their furtive stories,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>or if it is he born of the abject line of Sisyphus, do not, my king, do not win me an evil name by keeping your face still hidden in the tent by the sea.</p><milestone ed="p" n="193" unit="card"/></sp></div2>

Why do you set out unsummoned on this expedition,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>neither called by messenger, nor warned by trumpet?  In fact the whole army is sleeping now.&rdquo;  But he answered me curtly with that trite jingle:  &ldquo;Woman, silence graces woman.&rdquo;  And I, taking his meaning, desisted, but he rushed out alone.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>What happened out there, I cannot tell.  But he came in with his captives hobbled together&mdash;bulls, herding dogs, and his fleecy quarry.  Some he beheaded;  of some he cut the twisted throat or broke the spine;  others<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>he abused in their bonds as though they were men, though falling only upon cattle.  At last he darted out through the door, and dragged up words to speak to some shadow&mdash;now against the Atreidae, now about Odysseus&mdash;with many a mocking boast of all the abuse that in vengeance he had fully repaid them during his raid.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>After that he rushed back again into the house, and somehow by slow, painful steps he regained his reason.  And as he scanned the room full of his disastrous madness, he struck his head and howled;  he fell down, a wreck amid the wrecked corpses of the slaughtered sheep, and there he sat<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>with clenched nails tightly clutching his hair.  At first, and for a long while, he sat without a sound.  But then he threatened me with those dreadful threats, if I did not declare all that had happened, and he demanded to know what on earth was the business he found himself in.<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>And in my fear, friends, I told him all that had been done, as far as I knew it for certain.  But he immediately groaned mournful groans, such as I had never heard from him before.  For he had always taught that such wailing<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>was for cowardly and low-hearted men.  He used to grieve quietly without the sound of loud weeping, but instead moaned low like a bull.</p>
<p>And now, prostrate in such miserable fortune, tasting no food, no drink,<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>the man sits idly where he has fallen in the middle of the iron-slain cattle.  And plainly he plans to do something terrible.  Somehow his words and his laments say as much.  Ah, my friends&mdash;for it was my errand to ask you this&mdash;come in and help him, if in any way you can.<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>Men of his kind can be won over by the words of friends.<milestone ed="p" n="331" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>Aiai!  Who would ever have thought that my name would so descriptively suit my troubles?  For well now may Ajax cry &ldquo;Aiai&rdquo;&mdash;yes, twice and three times.  Such are the harsh troubles with which I have met.  Look, I am one whose father's<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>prowess won him the fairest prize of all the army, whose father brought every glory home from this same land of Ida;  but I, his son, who came after him to this same ground of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with no less might and proved the service of my hand in no meaner deeds,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>I am ruined as you see by dishonor from the Greeks.  And yet of this much I feel sure:  if Achilles lived, and had been called to award the first place in valor to any claimant of his arms, no one would have grasped them before me.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>But now the Atreidae have made away with them to a man without scruples and thrust away the triumphs of Ajax.  And if these eyes and this warped mind had not swerved from the purpose that was mine, they would have never in this way procured votes in judgment against another man.<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>As it was, the daughter of Zeus, the grim-eyed, unconquerable goddess, tripped me up at the instant when I was readying my hand against them, and shot me with a plague of frenzy so that I might bloody my hands in these grazers.  And those men exult to have escaped me&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>not that I wanted their escape.  But if a god sends harm, it is true that even the base man can elude the worthier.</p>
<p>And now what shall I do, when I am plainly hated by the gods, abhorred by the Greek forces and detested by all <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and all these plains?<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>Shall I leave my station at the ships and the Atreidae to their own devices in order to go home across the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName>?  And how shall I face my father Telamon, when I arrive?  How will he bear to look on me, when I stand before him stripped, without that supreme prize of valor<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>for which he himself won a great crown of fame?  No, I could not bear to do it!  But then shall I go against the bulwark of the Trojans, attacking alone in single combats and doing some valuable service, and finally die?  But, in so doing I might, I think, gladden the Atreidae.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>That must not happen.  Some enterprise must be sought whereby I may prove to my aged father that in nature, at least, his son is not gutless.  It is a stain upon a man to crave the full term of life, when he finds no variation from his ignominious troubles.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>What joy is there in day following day, now advancing us towards, now drawing us back from the verge of death?  I would not buy at any price the man who feels the glow of empty hopes.<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>The options for a noble man are only two:  either live with honor, or make a quick and honorable death.

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>No man shall say that you have spoken a bastard word, Ajax, or one not bred of your own heart.  Yet at least pause;  dismiss these thoughts, and grant friends the power to rule your purpose.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tecmessa</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>Ajax, my lord, the fortune that humans are compelled to endure is their gravest evil.  I was the daughter of a free-born father mighty in wealth, if any Phrygian was.  Now I am a slave, for somehow the gods so ordained,<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>and even more so did your strong hand.  Therefore, since I have come into your bed, I wish you well, and I do beg you, by the Zeus of our hearth, by your marriage-bed in which you coupled with me, do not condemn me to the cruel talk<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>of your enemies, do not leave me to the hand of a stranger!  On whatever day you die and widow me by your death, on that same day, be sure, I shall also be seized forcibly by the Greeks and, with your son, shall obtain a slave's portion.<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>Then one of my masters will name me bitterly, shooting me with taunts:  &ldquo; See the concubine of Ajax, who was the mightiest man in the army.  See what menial tasks she tends to, in place of such an enviable existence!&rdquo;  Such things will men say, and so will destiny afflict me<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>while the shame of these words will stain you and your family.  Show respect to your father, whom you abandon in miserable old age, and respect your mother with her share of many years, who often prays to the gods that you may come home alive.<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/>Pity, too, my king, your son.  Pity him the great sorrow which at your death you will bequeath both to him and to me, if robbed of nurturing care he must spend his days apart from you, an orphan tended by guardians who are neither family nor friends.</p>
<p>I have nothing left to which I can look,<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>save you, and you are the reason.  Your spear ravaged my country to nothingness, and another fate has brought down my mother and father, giving them a home in Hades in their death.  What homeland, then, could I have without you?  What wealth?  My welfare is entirely in your hands.<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>So remember me, too.  A true man should cherish remembrance, if anywhere he takes some pleasure.  It is kindness that always begets kindness.  But whoever lets the memory of benefits seep from him, he can no longer be a noble man.<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/>Ajax, I wish that pity touched your heart as it does mine.  Then you would approve her words.</p></sp>

<speaker>Ajax</speaker>
<p>She will have approval as far as I am concerned, if only she takes heart and graciously does my bidding.</p></sp>

<p>Yes, for fear that somehow the poor child would get in your way, and die.</p></sp>

<speaker>Tecmessa</speaker>
<p>How, then, can I serve you, as things stand now?</p></sp>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line"/>Lift him; lift him up here.  Doubtless he will not shrink to look on this newly-shed blood, if he is indeed my true-born son and heir to his father's manners.  But he must at once be broken into his father's harsh ways and moulded to the likeness of my nature.<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/>Ah, son, may you prove luckier than your father, but in all else like him.  Then you would not prove base.  Yet even now I may well envy you on this account, that you have no perception of these evils about us.  Yes, life is sweetest when one lacks sense, &lsqb;for lack of sensation is a painless evil&rsqb;<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/>that is, until one learns to know joy or pain.

Meanwhile feed on light breezes, and nurse your tender life for your mother's joy.<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line"/>There is no Greek&mdash;I know it for certain&mdash;who will do violence to you with hard outrages, even when you are without me.  So trusty is the guard, Teucer himself, whom I will leave at your gates.  He will not falter in his care for you, although now he walks a far path, busied with the hunt of enemies.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line"/>O my warriors, my seafaring comrades!  On you as on him, I lay this shared task of love:  give my command to Teucer!  Let him take this child to my home and set him before the face of Telamon, and of my mother, Eriboea,<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line"/>so that he may become the comfort of their age into eternity &lsqb;until they come to the deep hollows of the god below&rsqb;.  And order him that no commissioners of games, nor he who is my destroyer, should make my arms a prize for the Greeks.  No, you take this for my sake, Son, my broad shield from which you have your name.<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line"/>Hold it and wield it by the sturdy thong, this sevenfold, spear-proof shield!  But the rest of my arms shall be my gravemates.</p>

So it is that winter with its snow-covered paths gives place to fruitful summer;  night's dark orbit makes room for day with her white horses to kindle her radiance;  the blast of dreadful winds<milestone ed="p" n="675" unit="line"/>allows the groaning sea to rest;  and among them all, almighty Sleep releases the fettered sleeper, and does not hold him in a perpetual grasp.</p>
<p>And we men&mdash;must we not learn self-restraint?  I, at least, will learn it, since I am newly aware that an enemy is to be hated only as far as<milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/>suits one who will in turn become a friend.  Similarly to a friend I would wish to give only so much help and service as suits him who will not forever remain friendly.  For the masses regard the haven of comradeship as treacherous.</p>
<p>But concerning these things it will be well.  You, wife,<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/>go inside and pray to the gods that the desires of my heart be completed to the very end.<stage>Exit Tecmessa.</stage></p>
<p>You also, my comrades, honor my wishes just as she does, and command Teucer, when he comes, to take care of us, and to be kind to you at the same time.<milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/>I am going to where my journey inexorably leads.

<stage>Enter the Messenger, from the Greek camp.</stage></sp>
<sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Friends, my first news is this:<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/>Teucer has just now returned from the Mysian heights.  He has come to the generals' quarters mid-camp, and is being shouted at by all the Greeks at once.  Recognizing him from a distance as he approached, they gathered around him<milestone ed="p" n="725" unit="line"/>and then pelted him with jeers from every side&mdash;no one held back&mdash;calling him &ldquo;the brother of the maniac, of the plotter against the army,&rdquo; and saying that he would not be able to avoid entirely losing flesh and life before their flying stones.  In this way they had come to the point where swords<milestone ed="p" n="730" unit="line"/>had been plucked from sheaths and were drawn in their hands.  But then the conflict, when it had nearly run its full course, was halted by the conciliatory words of the elders.  But where shall I find Ajax, to tell him this?  To our lord I must tell all.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="735" unit="line"/>He is not inside, but is recently departed.  He has yoked a new purpose to his new mood.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>No!  Oh, no!  Too late, then, was he who sent me on this errand, or I myself came too slowly.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="740" unit="line"/>What is this urgent matter? What part of it has been neglected?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Teucer declared that Ajax should not slip out of the house, until he himself arrives.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Well, he is departed, I repeat, bent on the purpose that is best for him&mdash;to be rid of his anger at the gods.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="745" unit="line"/>These words betray great foolishness, if there is any wisdom in the prophecies of Calchas.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>What does he prophesy?  What knowledge of this affair do you bring?<milestone ed="p" n="748" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>This much I know and witnessed on the spot.  Leaving the royal circle of the chiefs who sat in council,<milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line"/>Calchas separated himself from the Atreidae and put his right hand with all kindness into the hand of Teucer.  The prophet then addressed him and strictly commanded him to use every possible resource to keep Ajax inside his tent for the duration of this day that now shines on us, and to prevent him from moving about<milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line"/>if he wished ever to look on him alive.  For this day alone will the anger of divine Athena lash at him.  That was the prophet's warning.  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the seer went on to explain, &ldquo;lives that have grown too proud and no longer yield good fall on grave difficulties sent from the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/>especially when someone born to man's estate forgets that fact by thinking thoughts too high for man.  And Ajax, even at the time he first set out from home, showed himself foolish, when his father advised him well.  For Telamon told him, &lsquo;My son,<milestone ed="p" n="765" unit="line"/>seek victory in arms, but always seek it with the help of god.&rsquo;  Then with a tall boast and foolishly he replied, &lsquo;Father, with the help of the gods even a worthless man might achieve victory;  but I, even without that help, fully trust to bring that glory within my grasp.&rsquo;<milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line"/>So much he boasted.  Then once again in answer to divine Athena&mdash;at a time when she was urging him forward and telling him to turn a deadly hand against the enemy&mdash;he answered her with words terrible and blasphemous, &lsquo;Queen, stand beside the other Greeks;<milestone ed="p" n="775" unit="line"/>where Ajax stands, battle will never break our line.&rsquo;  It was by such words, you must know, that he won for himself the intolerable anger of the goddess since his thoughts were too high for man.  But if he survives this day, perhaps with the god's help we may find means to save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="780" unit="line"/>With those words the seer finished, and at once Teucer rose from his seat and sent me with these orders for you to follow.  But if I have been cheated of success, Ajax does not live.  Otherwise Calchas has no skill.<milestone ed="p" n="784" unit="card"/></p></sp>

<p>Poor Tecmessa, born to misery,<milestone ed="p" n="785" unit="line"/>come out and see this man and his news.  The razor lies close at our throat, poised to cut off all joy.</p></sp>

<speaker>Tecmessa</speaker>
<p>Oh, no, what is your news, man?  Surely we are not ruined?</p></sp>

<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I have no clue of your condition, but know only that, if Ajax is away, I have little hope for him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tecmessa</speaker>
<p>But he is away, so  I am in agony to know what you mean.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="795" unit="line"/>Teucer strictly commands that you keep Ajax under shelter of his tent and not allow him to go out alone.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tecmessa</speaker>
<p>But where is Teucer?  And why these orders?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He has just now returned, and he suspects that such a departure carries death for Ajax.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tecmessa</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="800" unit="line"/>Oh, misery!  From whom can he have learned this?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>From Thestor's son, the prophet.  His prophecy applies to today, when the issue is one of life or death for Ajax.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Tecmessa</speaker>
<p>Ah, me!  My friends, protect me from the doom threatened by fate!  Hurry, some of you, to speed Teucer's coming;<milestone ed="p" n="805" unit="line"/>let others go to the westward bays, and others to the eastward, and there seek the man's disastrous path.  I see now that I have been deceived by my husband and cast out of the favor that I once had with him.  Ah, my child, what shall I do?  I must not sit idle.<milestone ed="p" n="810" unit="line"/>I too will go as far as my strength will carry me.  Move, let us be quick, this is no time to sit still, if we wish to save a man who is eager for death.</p></sp>
<sp>

<p>I am ready to help, and I will show it in more than word.  Speed of action and speed of foot will follow together.<stage>Exeunt Tecmessa and the Chorus.  A Servant takes Eurysaces into the tent.

<p><milestone ed="p" n="815" unit="line"/>The sacrificial killer stands planted in the way that will cut most deeply&mdash;if I have the leisure for even this much reflection.

For this much, Zeus, I appeal to you.

Indeed, I think, when she hears this news, she will sing a song of loud wailing throughout the entire city.  But it is not for me to weep in vain like this.

<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>What man of the army do you see?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1045" unit="line"/>Menelaus, the beneficiary of this expedition.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>I see him; he is not hard to recognize when near.</p></sp>
<sp>
<stage>Enter Menelaus.</stage></sp>
<sp><speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>You there, I tell you not to lift that corpse for burial, but leave it where it lies.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Why do you waste your breath on this arrogant command?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1050" unit="line"/>It conveys my decree, and the decree of the army's supreme ruler.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Would you mind, then, telling me what reason you pretend?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>This&mdash;that when we had hoped we were bringing Ajax from home to be an ally and a friend for the Greeks, we found him on closer examination to be an enemy worse than the Phrygians,<milestone ed="p" n="1055" unit="line"/>since he plotted the murder of the entire army and marched by night against us in order to take us with his spear.  And if some god had not smothered this attempt, we would have been allotted the fate which he now has, and we would be dead and lie prostrate by an ignoble doom,<milestone ed="p" n="1060" unit="line"/>while he would be living.  But now a god has turned his outrage aside, so that it fell on the sheep and cattle.</p>
<p>For this reason there is no man so powerful that he will be able to entomb the corpse of Ajax.  Instead he shall be cast forth somewhere on the yellow sand<milestone ed="p" n="1065" unit="line"/>to become forage for the birds of the seashore. So then do not inflame the terrible force of your spirit.  If we were unable to master him while he lived, in any case in death, at least, we shall rule him despite your opposition and control him by force of our hands.   For while he lived, there never was a time<milestone ed="p" n="1070" unit="line"/>when he would obey my commands.</p>
<p>Now it is, in truth, the mark of a base nature when a commoner does not think it right to obey those who stand over him.  Never can the laws maintain a prosperous course in a city where fear has no fixed place,<milestone ed="p" n="1075" unit="line"/>nor can a camp be ruled any more with moderation, if it lacks the guarding force of fear and reverence.  A man, though he grow his body great and mighty, must expect to fall, even from a light blow.  Whoever knows fear and shame both,<milestone ed="p" n="1080" unit="line"/>you can be certain that he has found his salvation;  but where there is license to attack others and act at will, do not doubt that such a State, though she has run before a favoring wind, will eventually sink with time into the depths.</p>
<p>No, let me see fear, too, established, where fear is fitting;<milestone ed="p" n="1085" unit="line"/>let us not think that we can act on our desires without paying the price in pain.  These things come by turns.  He was once the hot attacker, now it is my hour to glory.  And so I warn you not to bury him,<milestone ed="p" n="1090" unit="line"/>so that you can avoid falling into your own grave.<milestone ed="p" n="1091" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Menelaus, after laying down wise precepts, do not then violate the dead.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Never again, my fellow Salaminians, will I be amazed if some nobody by birth does wrong,<milestone ed="p" n="1095" unit="line"/>when those who are reputed to be born of noble blood employ such wrongful sentiments in their arguments.</p>
<p>Come, tell me from the first once more&mdash;do you really say that you brought Ajax here to the Greeks as an ally personally recruited by you?  Did he not sail of his own accord?  As his own master?<milestone ed="p" n="1100" unit="line"/>On what grounds are you his commander?  On what grounds have you a right to kingship over the men whom he brought from home?  It was as <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>'s king that you came, not as master over us.  Nowhere was it established among your lawful powers that you should order him any more than he you.<milestone ed="p" n="1105" unit="line"/>You sailed here under the command of others, not as a supreme commander who might at any time exercise authority over Ajax.</p>
<p>No, rule the troops you rule, and use your reverend words to punish them!  But this man, whether you or the other general forbid it, I will lay<milestone ed="p" n="1110" unit="line"/>in the grave as justice demands, and I will not fear your tongue.  It was not at all for your wife's sake that Ajax  made this expedition, as did those toil-worn drudges.  No, it was for the sake of the oath by which he had sworn, and not at all for you, since it was not his habit to value nobodies.<milestone ed="p" n="1115" unit="line"/>And so when you come here again, bring more heralds, and the leader of the expedition, too.  Your bluster could not make me turn to notice you, so long as you are what you are.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Again, I say, in these troubles I cannot approve of such a tone.  Harsh words sting, however just they are.<milestone ed="p" n="1120" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1120" unit="line"/>The bowman seems to feel no little grandeur.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>I do, since it is no lowly skill that I possess.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>How you would boast, if you had a shield!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Even without a shield I would be a match for you fully armed.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>What a tongue you have!  What dreadful anger it feeds!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1125" unit="line"/>When right is with him, a man's thoughts may be grand.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>What, is it right that the man who murdered me should prosper?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Murdered you?  It is truly a strange happening, if in fact you live after being killed.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>A god rescued me.  So far as that corpse is concerned, I am in Hades.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Then since it was the gods who saved you, do not dishonor the gods.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1130" unit="line"/>What, would I find fault with divine law?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Yes, if by your presence here you prevent burial of the dead.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>Prevent it I do, since he was at war with me and I with him.  Burial in such a case would not be right.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?  Did Ajax ever stand forth publicly to war with you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>He hated me as I hated him, and you knew it, too.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1135" unit="line"/>Yes, he hated you because you had been caught fixing the votes in order to rob him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>At the hands of the jurymen, not mine, he suffered that loss.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>You could make a thousand stealthy crimes look pretty.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>That sentiment leads to pain for someone I know.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>The pain will be no greater, I think, than that which we will inflict.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1140" unit="line"/>I will tell you once and for all&mdash;there is to be no burial for him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>And hear my reply&mdash;he shall be buried immediately.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>Once I saw a bold-tongued man who had urged sailors to set sail during wintertime.  Yet in him you could have found no voice<milestone ed="p" n="1145" unit="line"/>when the worst of the storm was upon him.  No, hidden beneath his cloak he allowed the crew to trample on him at will.  And so it is with you and your raging speech&mdash;perhaps a great storm, even if its blast comes from a small cloud, will extinguish your shouting.<milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="line"/>Yes, and I have seen a man stuffed with foolishness who exulted in his neighbor's misfortunes.  It turned out that a man like me and of similar temperament stared at him and said, &ldquo; Man, do not wrong the dead;<milestone ed="p" n="1155" unit="line"/>for, if you do, rest assured that you will come to harm.&rdquo;  So he warned the misguided man before him.  Take note&mdash;I see him now, and I think that he is no one but you.  Have I spoken in riddles?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Menelaus</speaker>
<p>I will go&mdash;it would be a disgrace to have it known<milestone ed="p" n="1160" unit="line"/>that I argue when I have the power to use force.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter Teucer.</stage></sp>
<sp><speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>Here I am!  I hurried back when I saw the supreme commander, Agamemnon, rapidly approaching.<milestone ed="p" n="1225" unit="line"/>It is plain to me that he will let his clumsy tongue fly.</p></sp>
<sp>
<stage>Enter Agamemnon.</stage></sp>
<sp><speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>So it is you, they tell me, who dared open your mouth wide to make fierce threats against us&mdash;and are you still unpunished?  Yes, I mean you&mdash;you, the captive slave's son.  No doubt if you were born from a noble mother,<milestone ed="p" n="1230" unit="line"/>your talk would reach the sky and you would proudly strut about, when now it is the case that, though you are a nobody and a nothing, you have stood up for this other nothing lying here, and have vowed that we came out with no authority either as admirals or as generals to rule the Greeks or you.  No, as an autonomous ruler, you say, Ajax set sail.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1235" unit="line"/>Does it not shame me that I hear these proud words from slavish mouths?  What was the man whom you shout about with such arrogance?  Where did he advance, or where did he stand his ground, where I did not do the same?  Have the Greeks, then, no other men but him?  To our own harm, it seems, we announced<milestone ed="p" n="1240" unit="line"/>to the Greeks the contests for the arms of Achilles, if on all sides we are accounted corrupt because of Teucer, and if it will never satisfy you Salaminians, even when you are defeated, to accept the verdict which satisfied the majority of the judges.  But instead you will always no doubt aim your slanderous arrows at us,<milestone ed="p" n="1245" unit="line"/>or treacherously lash at our backs when you fall behind us in the race.</p>
<p>Yet in a place where such ways prevail, there could be no settled order for any law, if we are to thrust the rightful winners aside and bring those in the rear up to the front ranks.<milestone ed="p" n="1250" unit="line"/>These tendencies must be checked. It is not the stout, broad-shouldered men that are the steadiest allies.  No, it is the wise who prevail in every engagement.  A broad-backed ox is kept straight on the road all the same when only a small whip directs him.<milestone ed="p" n="1255" unit="line"/>And a dose of this very medicine, I foresee, will find you before long, unless you gain a little good sense.  He no longer exists, but is already a shade, yet still you boldly insult us and give your tongue too much freedom.  Restrain yourself, I say.  Recall your birth, your nature.<milestone ed="p" n="1260" unit="line"/>Bring someone else here&mdash;a man who is freeborn&mdash;who can plead your cause before me in your place.

<speaker>Teucer</speaker>
<p>My, how quickly gratitude to the dead seeps away from men and is found to have turned to betrayal, since this man no longer offers even the slightest praise in remembrance of you, Ajax, even though it was for his sake<milestone ed="p" n="1270" unit="line"/>you toiled so often in battle, offering your own life to the spear!  No, your assistance is dead and gone, all flung aside!</p>
<p>Full and foolish talker, do you no longer remember anything of the time when you were trapped inside your defenses,<milestone ed="p" n="1275" unit="line"/>when you were all but destroyed in the turn of the battle and he, he alone came and saved you at the moment when the flames were already blazing around the decks at your ships' sterns and Hector was leaping high over the trench towards the vessels?<milestone ed="p" n="1280" unit="line"/>Who averted that?  Was it not Ajax who did it, the one who, you say, nowhere set foot where you were not?  Well, do you grant that he did his duty to you there?  And what about when another time, all alone, he confronted Hector in single combat according to the fall of the lots, and not at anyone's command?<milestone ed="p" n="1285" unit="line"/>The lot which he cast in was not the kind to flee the challenge;  it was no lump of moist earth, but one which would be the first to leap lightly from the crested helmet!  It was this man who did those deeds, and I, the slave, the son of the barbarian mother, was at his side.<milestone ed="p" n="1290" unit="card"/></p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1290" unit="line"/>Pitiful creature, how can you be so blind as to argue the way you do?  Are you not aware of the fact that your father's father Pelops long ago was a barbarian, a Phrygian?  That Atreus, your own begetter, set before his brother a most unholy feast made from the flesh of his brother's children?<milestone ed="p" n="1295" unit="line"/>And you yourself were born from a Cretan mother, whose father found a stranger straddling her and who was consigned by him to be prey for the mute fish.  So being of such a kind, can you reproach a man like me for my lineage?  I am the son of Telamon,<milestone ed="p" n="1300" unit="line"/>who won my mother for his consort as prize for valor supreme in the army.  And she was the daughter of Laomedon, of royal blood, and it was as the flower of the spoil that Alcmena's son gave her to Telamon.  Thus nobly born as I am from two noble parents,<milestone ed="p" n="1305" unit="line"/>could I disgrace my own flesh and blood, whom even as he lies here subdued by such massive troubles, you, making your pronouncements without a blush of shame, would thrust out without burial?  Now consider this well:  wherever you cast him away, with him you will also cast our three corpses.<milestone ed="p" n="1310" unit="line"/>It is right for me to die before all men's eyes while I am toiling in his cause, rather than for your wife&mdash;or should I say your brother's?  With this in mind, then, look not to my safety, but to yours instead, since if you cause me any grief at all, you will soon wish<milestone ed="p" n="1315" unit="line"/>that you had been more timid than bold when confronting me.

<p>Lord Odysseus, you arrive at the right time, if mediation, not division, is your purpose in coming.</p></sp>

<p>What is the trouble, friends?  From far off I heard shouting from the Atreidae over this brave man's corpse.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1320" unit="line"/>Is it not because we, Lord Odysseus, have long had to hear the worst, most shameful language from this man?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>How so?  I can pardon a man a retaliatory barrage of abuse if another has insulted him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>I insulted him, since his conduct toward me was of the same stripe.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1325" unit="line"/>And what did he do that harmed you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>He declares that he will not leave this corpse without due burial, but will entomb it in spite of me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Then may a friend speak the truth, and still remain your helpmate no less than before?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1330" unit="line"/>Speak.  Otherwise I would be less than sane, since I count you my greatest friend among all the Greeks.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Listen, then.  In the name of the gods, do not let yourself so ruthlessly cast this man out unburied.  Do not in any way let the violence of your hatred overcome you<milestone ed="p" n="1335" unit="line"/>so much that you trample justice under foot.  To me, too, this man was once the most hostile enemy in the army from the day on which I beat him for possession of Achilles' arms.  Yet for all that he was hostile towards me, I would not dishonor him in return or refuse to admit<milestone ed="p" n="1340" unit="line"/>that in all our Greek force at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> he was, in my view, the best and bravest, excepting Achilles.  It would not be just, then, that he should be dishonored by you.  It is not he, but the laws given by the gods that you would damage.  When a good man is dead, there is no justice<milestone ed="p" n="1345" unit="line"/>in doing him harm, not even if you hate him.<milestone ed="p" n="1346" unit="card"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>You, Odysseus&mdash;do you champion him against me in this battle?</p></sp>

<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>I do, though I did hate him, when it was honorable for me to hate.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>But should you not also trample him now that he is dead?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Do not take delight, son of Atreus, in that superiority which brings no honor.</p></sp>
<sp>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="1350" unit="line"/>Reverence, I tell you, is not easily practiced by the autocrat.</p></sp>

<p>Why do you do this?  Why do you so respect an enemy's corpse?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>I yield to his excellence much more than his hostility.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Men who act as you do are the unstable sort in humankind.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>It is not my habit to recommend an inflexible spirit.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>You will make us appear to be cowards today.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>On the contrary, we will be men of justice in the eyes of all the Greeks.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Then do you truly urge me to allow the burying of the dead?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1365" unit="line"/>Yes, for I too shall come to that necessity.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>How true it is that in all things alike each man works for himself!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>And for whom should I work more than for myself?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>It must be called your doing then, not mine.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>However you do it, in all respects you will at least prove beneficent.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1370" unit="line"/>In any case, be quite certain that to you I would grant a larger favor than this.   To that man, however, as on earth, so below I give my hatred.  But you can do what you will.<stage>Exit Agamemnon.</stage></p></sp>

Of all the Greeks you were his deadliest enemy, and yet you alone have stood by him with helping hand and did not come here and allow yourself in life<milestone ed="p" n="1385" unit="line"/>to violate the dead Ajax ruthlessly, as did the crazed general who came, since he and his brother wanted to cast out the outraged corpse without burial.  Therefore may the Father supreme on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> above us,<milestone ed="p" n="1390" unit="line"/>and the unforgetting Fury and Justice the Fulfiller destroy them for their wickedness with wicked deaths, just as they sought to cast this man out with unmerited, outrageous mistreatment.</p>
<p>But you, progeny of aged Laertes, I hesitate to permit you to touch the corpse in burial,<milestone ed="p" n="1395" unit="line"/>lest I so offend the dead.  In all other tasks do indeed be our partner.  And if you wish to bring any soldier of the army with you, he shall be welcome.  For the rest, I will make all things ready.  But you, Odysseus, know that to us you have been a good and noble friend.</p></sp>

<p>Enough.  Already the interval has been long drawn out.  Come, hurry some of you to dig the hollow grave; others erect the<milestone ed="p" n="1405" unit="line"/>cauldron wrapped in fire on its high stand for prompt preparation of the ritual cleansing.  Let another company bring from the tent the finery which he wore in battle beneath his shield.  And you, too, child, with such strength as you have<milestone ed="p" n="1410" unit="line"/>lay a loving hand upon your father and help me to lighten his body;  for his channels are still warm and spray upwards the dark force of his spirit.</p>
<p>Come, come everyone who claims to be our friend, start forward and move on,<milestone ed="p" n="1415" unit="line"/>laboring in service to this man of perfect excellence.  To a nobler man such service has never yet been rendered &lsqb;&mdash;nobler than Ajax when he lived, I mean&rsqb;.</p></sp></div2>

<p>Many things, I tell you, can be known through mortal eyes;  but before he sees it happening, no one can foretell<milestone ed="p" n="1420" unit="line"/>the future, or what his fate will be.</p></sp></div2>
