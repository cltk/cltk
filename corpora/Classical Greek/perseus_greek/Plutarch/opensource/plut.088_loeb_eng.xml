            <head>WERE THE ATHENIANS MORE
					FAMOUS IN WAR OR IN
					WISDOM?
					(BELLONE AN PACE CLARIORES FUERINT
					ATHENIENSES)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					Plutarch's discussion whether the Athenians were
					more famous in war or in wisdom, sometimes referred
					to by a briefer title. <hi rend="italics">De Gloria Atheniensium</hi>, is an
					epideictic oration like the preceding essays ; we may
					perhaps infer from the words (345 f), <q direct="unspecified">This city has
						been the mother and kindly nurse of many other
						arts,</q> that it was delivered at Athens. Like the
					preceding essays, it closes abruptly, and again we do
					not know the reason therefor.
				</p>
            <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his introduction to the
					translation of Plutarch revised by Goodwin, says,
					<q direct="unspecified">The vigor of his pen appears in the chapter
						&lsquo;Whether the Athenians were more Warlike or
						Learned . . .&rsquo;</q> It is strange that this vigour
					should be devoted to glorifying the men of arms
					and vilifying the men of letters, and yet this is
					precisely what Plutarch attempts to do in this essay.
					It is true that he lived in an era of profound peace,
					when the horrors of war were remote, but it is
					somewhat surprising to find him arguing for this
					thesis, especially since he shows by incidental statements that he is thoroughly aware of the contributions
					that Athens has made to literature. We may, then,
					be justified in the inference that the essay is a <hi rend="italics">tour
					de force</hi>, like other rhetorical discussions which were
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.491"/>
					
					popular in Plutarch's day ; it does not necessarily
					represent his own belief.
				</p>
            <p>Many of the historical references will be found in
					an amplified form in the <hi rend="italics">Lives</hi>.
				</p>
            <p>The essay is no. 197 in Lamprias's list of Plutarch's
					works where it bears the simpler title, <q direct="unspecified">In what
					were the Athenians famous?</q> (<foreign lang="greek">*kata\ ti/ e)/ndocoi
					*aqhnai=oi</foreign>;).

         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>This city, as we all know, has been the mother
					and kindly nurse of many other arts, some of which
					she was the first to discover and reveal, while to others
					she gave added strength and honour and advancement;
					not least of all,painting was enhanced and embellished
					by her. For Apollodorus the painter, the first man
					to discover the art of mixing colours and chiaroscuro,
					was an Athenian. Upon his productions is inscribed:
					<quote rend="blockquote">It were easier that you blame than try to make the same.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Natural History</hi>, xxxv. 9. 62, where the verse is ascribed to Zeuxis; for other references see Edmonds, <hi rend="italics">Elegy and Iambus</hi> (in the L.C.L.), ii. p. 24.</note>

					Euphranor, Nicias, Asclepiodorus, and Panaenus, the
					brother of Pheidias, some of them painted conquering
					generals, others battles, and still others the heroes
					of old. As, for example, Euphranor compared his
					own Theseus with that of Parrhasius, saying that
					Parrhasius's Theseus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Pliny, <hi rend="italics">Natural History</hi>, xxxv. 9. 69.</note> had fed on roses, but his on
					beef; for in truth Parrhasius's portrait has a certain
					delicacy and subtlety in its execution, and it does
					somewhat resemble Theseus ; but someone, on seeing
					Euphranor's Theseus, exclaimed, not inaptly,
					<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>Race of the great-hearted hero Erechtheus, whom once

				        </p>
            <p>Euphranor has painted also, not without some
					animation, the cavalry battle against Epameinondas
					at Mantineia. The action came about in this way:<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Life of Agesila&uuml;s</hi>, chaps. xxxiv.-xxxv. (615 c-616 a); Xenophon, <hi rend="italics">Hellenica</hi>, vii. 5; Diodorus, xv. 82-84.</note>
					Epameinondas the Theban, after the battle of
					Leuctra, was greatly elated, and conceived the desire
					to trample upon the prostrate Sparta, and grind her
					pride and self-esteem into the dust. And first he
					attacked with an army of seventy thousand, pillaged
					the Spartans' territory, and persuaded the Perioeci
					to revolt from them. Then he challenged to battle
					the forces that were drawn up in the vicinity of
					Mantineia; but when they did not wish or even dare
					to risk an engagement, but continued to await reinforcements from Athens, he broke camp by night
					and, without being observed by anybody, descended
					into Lacedaemon and almost succeeded, by a sudden
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.499"/>
					
					attack, in capturing and occupying the city, which was
					without defenders. But when the Spartan allies perceived this, and aid for the city quickly arrived, he retired as though he were again about totum to plundering and devastating the countryside. But when he
					had thus deceived his enemies and quieted their
					suspicions, he set forth by night from Laconia and,
					rapidly traversing the intervening territory, appeared
					to the Mantineans unexpectedly, while they also
					were engaged in discussing the right moment for
					sending aid to Sparta, and ordered the Thebans to
					arm straightway for the attack. Accordingly the
					Thebans, who took great pride in their skill at
					arms, advanced to the attack and encircled the
					city walls. There was consternation among the
					Mantineans, and shouting and running hither and
					thither, since they were unable to repulse this
					assembled force which was bursting upon them like
					a torrent, nor did any thought of possible succour
					occur to their minds. At this crucial and fateful
					moment the Athenians were descending from the
					heights to the plain of Mantineia, with no knowledge
					of this turn of fortune or of the keenness of the
					struggle, but were proceeding leisurely on their
					journey. However, when one of the Mantineans ran
					out with report of the danger, although the Athenians
					were few in comparison with the great numbers of
					their enemy, and although they were weary from
					their march, and none of their other allies was at
					hand, nevertheless they straightway took their places
					in battle-array with almost their whole number, while
					the cavalry donned their armour and rode ahead of
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.501"/>
					
					the rest, and under the very gates and the wall of
					the eity engaged in a sharp cavalry encounter; the
					Athenians prevailed and rescued Mantineia from the
					clutches of Epameinondas.
				</p>
            <p>This was the action which Euphranor depicted,
					and in his portrayal of the battle one may see the
					clash of conflict and the stout resistance abounding in
					boldness and courage and spirit. But I do not think
					you would award judgement to the painter in comparison with the general, nor would you bear with
					those who prefer the picture to the trophy of victory,
					or the imitation to the actuality.
				</p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="3">
            <p>Simonides, however, calls painting inarticulate
					poetry and poetry articulate painting:<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 18 a.</note> for the
					actions which painters portray as taking place at the
					moment literature narrates and records after they
					have taken place. Even though artists with colour
					and design, and writers with words and phrases,
					represent the same subjects, they differ in the
					material and the manner of their imitation ; and yet
					the underlying end and aim of both is one and the
					same; the most effective historian is he who, by a vivid
					representation of emotions and characters, makes his
					narration like a painting. Assuredly Thucydides<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Life of Nicias</hi>, chap. i. (523 c); Longinus, <hi rend="italics">On the Sublime</hi>, chap. xxv.</note> is
					always striving for this vividness in his writing, since it
					is his desire to make the reader a spectator, as it were,
					and to produce vividly in the minds of those who
					peruse his narrative the emotions of amazement
					and consternation which were experienced by those
					who beheld them. For he tells how Demosthenes<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Thucydides, iv. 10-12.</note> is
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.503"/>
					
					drawing up the Athenians at the very edge of the
					breakwater at Pylos, and Brasidas is urging on his pilot
					to beach the ship, and is hurrying to the landing-plank,
					and is wounded and falls fainting on the forward-deck;
					and the Spartans are fighting an infantry engagement from the sea, while the Athenians wage a naval
					battle from the land. Again, in his account of the
					Sicilian<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Thucydides, vii. 71; in the next two sentences the text is very uncertain and can only be restored with great hesitation.</note> expedition : <q direct="unspecified">The armies of both sides on
						the land, as long as the fighting at sea is evenly
						balanced, are enduring an unceasing struggle and
						tension of mind</q> because of their battling forces ;
					and <q direct="unspecified">because of the continued indecisiveness of the
						struggle they accompany it in an extremity of fear,
						with their very bodies swaying in sympathy with
						their opinion of the outcome.</q> Such a description
					is characterized by pictorial vividness both in its
					arrangement and in its power of description ; so, if
					it be unworthy to compare painters with generals, let
					us not compare historians either.
				</p>
            <p>Again, the news of the battle of Marathon Thersippus of Eroeadae brought back, as Heracleides
					Pontieus relates ; but most historians declare that it
					was Eucles who ran in full armour, hot from the battle,
					and, bursting in at the doors of the first men of the
					State, could only say, <q direct="unspecified">Hail ! we are victorious !</q>
               <note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Lucian, <hi rend="italics">Pro Lapsu inter Salutandum</hi>, 3; and F. G. Allinson in the <hi rend="italics">Classical Weekly</hi>, xxiv. p. 152.</note>

					and straightway expired. Yet this man carne as a
					self-sent messenger regarding a battle in which he
					himself had fought; but suppose that some goatherd
					or shepherd upon a hill or a height had been a distant
					spectator of the contest and had looked down upon
					that great event, too great for any tongue to teli, and
					had come to the city as a messenger, a man who had
					not felt a wound nor shed a drop of blood, and yet
					had insisted that he have such honours as Cynegeirus
					received, or Callimachus, or Polyzelus, because, forsooth, he had reported their deeds of valour, their
					wounds and death ; would he not have been thought
					of surpassing impudence? Why, as we are told,
					the Spartans merely sent meat from the public
					commons to the man who brought glad tidings of the
					victory in Mantineia which Thucydides<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> Thucydides, v. 65-73; <hi rend="italics">Life of Agesila&uuml;s</hi>, chap. xxxiii. (614f).</note> describes !
					And indeed the compilers of histories are, as it were,
					reporters of great exploits who are gifted with the
					faculty of felicitous speech, and achieve success in
					their writing through the beauty and force of their
					narration ; and to them those who first encountered
					and recorded the events are indebted for a pleasing
					retelling of them. We may be sure that such writers
					are lauded also merely through being remembered
					and read because of the men who won success ; for
					the words do not create the deeds, but because of the
					deeds they are also deemed worthy of being read.

         <div1 type="section" n="4">
            <p>Poetry also has won favour and esteem because

					The story is also told that one of Menander's<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> the Scholia Cruquiana on Horace, <hi rend="italics">Ars Poetica</hi>, 311.</note> intimate friends said to him, <q direct="unspecified">The Dionysian Festival

					consider the subject matter more necessary and vital
					than the words.
				</p>
            <p>When Pindar was still young, and prided himself
					on his felicitous use of words. Corinna warned him
					that his writing lacked refinement, since he did not
					introduce myths, which are the proper business of
					poetry, but used as a foundation for his work unusual
					and obsolete words, extensions of meaning, paraphrases, lyrics and rhythms, which are mere embellishments of the subject matter.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 769 c.</note> So Pindar,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Pindar, Frag. 29, ed. Christ; ed. Sandys (L.C.L.) p. 512; <hi rend="italics">cf.</hi> Lucian, <hi rend="italics">Demosthenis Encomium</hi>, 19.</note> giving
					all heed to her words, composed the famous lyric :
					<quote rend="blockquote">
                  <l>Ismenus, or Melia of the golden distaff,
					</l>
                  <l>Or Cadmus, or the holy race of men that were sown,
					</l>
                  <l>Or the mighty strength of Heracles,
					</l>
                  <l>Or the gladsome worship of Dionysus.</l>
               </quote>
					He showed it to Corinna, but she laughed and said
					that one should sow with the hand, not with the whole
					sack. For in truth Pindar had confused and jumbled
					together a seed-mixture, as it were, of myths, and
					poured them into his poem.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Edmonds's version (<hi rend="italics">Lyra Graeca</hi>, iii. p. 7) of this famous passage is incomprehensible to me.</note> That poetry concerns

					tale, resembling a true one ; wherefore it is far removed from actual events, if a tale is but a picture
					and an image of actuality, and a myth is but a picture
					and image of a tale. And thus those who write of
					imaginative exploits lag as far behind historians as
					persons who tell of deeds come short of those that
					do them.
