            <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <div2 type="section" n="1">
               <p> Anyone who reads some of the many articles which have been written about the
						Sayings of Kings and Commanders found in Plutarch's works would almost
						certainly gain the impression that the whole book is a tasteless forgery;
						yet a closer study would probably convince him that the Sayings are, in the
						main, just as truly the work of Plutarch as the poems of Sappho or Alcaeus
						which we now possess are the works of those authors. The only question,
						then, is how it happens that the Sayings stand in their present form, and
						this will doubtless serve as a topic for debate in the future, as it has in
						the past, since it can never be definitely settled.</p>
               <p> The assumption that the whole book is a forgery can only be regarded as
						nonsense. Many of the stories included here are found also in other writers,
						such, for example, as Aelian, Polyaenus, or Valerius Maximus, and the
						relation between the versions found in the different writers is quite the
						same as the relation between other stories found in the indisputably genuine
						works of Plutarch and the versions found in other writers.</p>
               <p> A second assumption that some of the stories were put together by a later
						writer who copied them largely from Plutarch's Lives (when there were Lives
						from which they could be copied) is more plausible <pb id="v.3.p.4"/> in the
						case of many of the Sayings, especially since the versions often coincide
						(in whole or part) in language. At the same time a comparison of the
						versions found here with the versions found in the Lives, for example, of
						Phocion, or Fabius Maximus, or the elder Cato, will probably serve to
						convince an unprejudiced reader that these were not copied verbatim from the
						Lives, but that they have been put down independently from the same or the
						original source. A special stress is laid by those who uphold this theory
						upon the words <foreign lang="greek">tau=ta me\n ou)=n u(/steron&#8232;</foreign>
						(196 e), but that again is only a natural observation which anyone writing a
						memorandum might properly make regarding that incident, and anyone
						enthusiastic in supporting the genuineness of the Sayings might equally well
						suggest that this was an observation of some copyist, put down as a marginal
						note, which has crept into the text.</p>
               <p> There remains, then, the possibility that the Sayings are in the main the
						work of Plutarch, written by him in practically their present form, and that
						some of these were copied into the Lives rather than from the Lives.
						Plutarch himself tells us, in Moralia 464 f and 457 D,<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">In 457 d if.
							Plutarch gives some examples of the kind of anecdotes which he is wont
							to collect, and some of these &#8232;are identical with those found in the <hi rend="italics">Sayings of Kings and &#8232;Commanders.&#8232;</hi>
						            </note> that he was in the habit of making collections of notes of this
						sort, and certainly nothing could be more natural than that the author of
						the Lives, to say nothing of the Moralia, should get together some of his
						material in more accessible form, especially in view of the difficulty, in
						ancient times, of consulting books, which were written and kept in the form
						of a roll. The arrangement of the Sayings of Kings and <pb id="v.3.p.5"/>
						Commanders is roughly chronological, with some retrogressions. The Greeks
						(and Persians) and the Romans are grouped separately. If these sayings were
						extracted from the Lives by a writer as dullwitted as many would have us
						believe he was, it might reasonably be expected that he would have jumbled
						the Greeks and the Romans together as they are alternated, in the Lives, but
						such is not the case. It will be noted that the names of the Spartans whose
						sayings are recorded in a similar collection are arranged in alphabetical
						order for convenience in consultation.</p>
               <p> In Lampriass catalogue of Plutarch's works the Sayings of Kings and
						Commanders is listed as No. 108, and Stobaeus, in his Florilegium, quotes
						from it freely. Of the large number of quotations from this work which are
						to be found in Stobaeus an overwhelming majority agree in language either
						verbatim or almost verbatim, and are not in agreement verbatim with variant
						versions found elsewhere in the Lives or the Moralia or in Aelian or
						Polyaenus. In one case Stobaeus (Florilegium, liv. 43 = Moralia 788 d and
						not 187c) seems to have preferred aversion found elsewhere in the Moralia,
						and in one other case (vii. 48 = Life of Lycurgus, chap. xx. 4, rather than
						Moralia, 190 d, or 215 d) a version found in the Lives. It is clear, then,
						that the book was in existence as an independent volume in the time of
						Stobaeus, and probably earlier.</p>
               <p> Whether Plutarch ever meant that this collection should be published, or
						whether he himself provided the introduction addressed to the Emperor
						Trajan, are questions of minor importance. In ancient times, no doubt, as in
						later days royalty could not afford to <pb id="v.3.p.6"/> spend too much
						time with books, and welcomed predigested information.</p>
               <p> Plutarch very seldom tells the same story in the same words. Over and over
						again in his works we find a story repeated with minor variations in
						language, or in expansion or condensation, which often serve to adapt it
						better to its context, or, again, seem to serve no purpose except to avoid
						sameness ; and so with the stories in this collection : when they are
						repeated in other parts of Plutarch's works they almost always show the same
						minor variations which are so characteristic of Plutarch.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Of the
							hundred or two hundred or more examples which &#8232;might be cited (and which
							may be found by consulting the&#8232; footnotes in the following pages) three
							or four must here &#8232;suffice. One may compare the four accounts of Ada's&#8232;
							cooks (180 a), or the three versions of Antigonus's modesty &#8232;(183 c), or
							the remark of Lysimachus to Philippides (183 e),&#8232; copied practically
							verbatim by Stobaeus, <hi rend="italics">Florilegium</hi> xlix. 19,
							&#8232;which looks like an original memorandum, while the other&#8232; versions (<hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi> 508 c and 517 <foreign lang="greek">β</foreign>) appear to be adapted to&#8232; their context; or the retort
							of Phocion to Antipater (188 f), &#8232;six times repeated, in which the
							language of the retort is&#8232; always essentially the same, but the setting
							is regularly &#8232;adapted to the context.</note>
               </p>
               <p> It is an interesting academic study, for those to whom such studies appeal,
						to compare the different versions of the same story, and to try to draw
						conclusions as to which version is derived from the other, or the others (as
						has been done by Carl Schmidt, <foreign lang="la">De apophthegmatum quae sub
							Plutarchi nomine feruntur collectionibus</foreign>, Greifswalde, 1879),
							<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">One may compare also Wilhelm Gemoll, Das <foreign lang="greek">Α</foreign>p<foreign lang="greek">ο</foreign>phthegma (Leipzig,
							1924), which is a discursive essay on the &#8232;apophthegm, anecdote, novel,
							and romance, with relatively&#8232; little reference to Plutarch. </note> but
						such studies are bound to be unconvincing at best. </p>
               <pb id="v.3.p.7"/>
               <p> Of many of the stories there is no variant version. Some were doubtless used
						in lives or essays by Plutarch which are now lost, and some were doubtless
						meant to be included in lives or essays which were never written.</p>
               <p> The collection in whole or in part is probably as well known as anything
						that Plutarch has written, for parts of it have become proverbial, and so it
						is not surprising that some of the sayings have been attributed to other
						well-known men, both ancient and modern, or that other men both ancient and
						modern have given utterance to them as their own.</p>

               <p> Artaxerxes, the king of the Persians, O Trajan, Emperor Most High and
						Monarch Supreme, used to think that, as compared with giving large gifts, it
						was no less the mark of a king and a lover of his fellow-men to accept small
						gifts graciously and with a ready goodwill; and so, on a time when he was
						riding by, and a simple labourer, possessed of nothing else, took up water
						from the river in his two hands and offered it to the king, he accepted it
						pleasantly and with a cheerful smile, measuring the favour by the ready
						goodwill of the giver and not by the service rendered by the gift.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

							Plato, <hi rend="italics">Protagoras</hi>, p. 343 B.</note> and I beg
						that you will <pb id="v.3.p.11"/> be good enough to accept, in conjunction
						with the author's ready goodwill, the utility which may be found in these
						brief notes, if so be that they contain something meet for the true
						understanding of the characters and predilections of men in high places,
						which are better reflected in their words than in their actions. True it is
						that a work of mine comprises the lives also of the most noted rulers,
						lawgivers, and monarchs among the Romans and the Greeks; but their actions,
						for the most part, have an admixture of chance, whereas their pronouncements
						and unpremeditated utterance in connexion with what they did or experienced
						or chanced upon afford an opportunity to observe, as in so many mirrors, the
						workings of the mind of each man. In keeping herewith is the remark of
						Seiramnes the Persian who, in answer to those who expressed surprise
						because, while his words showed sense, his actions were never crowned with
						success, said that he himself was master of his words, but chance, together
						with the King, was master of his actions. <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Diodorus Siculus, xv. 41,
							represents this remark as made by Pharnabazus, the Persian satrap, to
							Iphicrates, the Athenian general.</note>
               </p>
               <p> In the Lives the pronouncements of the men have the story of the men's
						actions adjoined in the same pages, and so must wait for the time when one
						has the desire to read in a leisurely way; but here the remarks, made into a
						separate collection quite by themselves, serving, so to speak, as samples
						and primal elements of the men's lives, will not, I think, be any serious
						tax on your time, and you will get in brief compass an opportunity to pass
						in review many men who have proved themselves worthy of being
						remembered.</p>
