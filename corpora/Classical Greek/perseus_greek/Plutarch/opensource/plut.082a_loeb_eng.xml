            <head>THE ANCIENT CUSTOMS OF THE SPARTANS (INSTITUTA LACONICA) <lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>Plutarch wrote an article about the Spartans, as he
					tells us in his <hi rend="italics">Life of Lysander</hi>, chap. xvii. (443 a).
					The only question, therefore, that can be raised is
					whether <hi rend="italics">The Ancient Customs of the Spartans</hi> is that
					article. It is true that adverse judgement has been
					pronounced upon it, mainly because of some infelicities of language, and the character of the last
					chapter; yet, whether written by Plutarch or by
					another, it is in the main the work of Plutarch, and
					much of it comes from the same source as Plutarch's
					<hi rend="italics">Life of Lycurgus</hi>. The body of facts and traditions
					here set down is, in great part, to be found scattered
					here and there in other writers, especially in the
					extant histories of Herodotus, Thucydides, and
					Xenophon, to say nothing of other historians whose
					works are now lost. Much had been brought together, long before Plutarch's time, in the <hi rend="italics">Constitution of Sparta</hi>, which is printed among the works
					of Xenophon.</p>
            <p>A hint that various sources were used in making
					this compilation may be found in the fact that some
					of the verbs are in the present tense and others in
					the past.</p>
