            <div2 type="section" n="1">
               <p>This is the oration of Fortune, asserting and challenge
					ing Alexander to be her masterpiece, and hers alone. In
					contradiction to which it behooves us to say something on
					the behalf of philosophy, or rather in the defence of Alexander himself, who cannot choose but spurn away the very
					thought of having received his empire as a gift at the
					hands of Fortune, knowing that it was so dearly bought
					with the price of his lost blood and many wounds, and

					and all this in opposition to armies almost irresistible, numberless nations, rivers before impassable, and rocks impenetrable; choosing, however, for his chiefest guides and

            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="2">
               <p>And now, methinks, I hear him speaking thus to Fortune, when she signalizes herself with his successes:&mdash;</p>
               <p>Envy not my virtue, nor go about to detract from my
						honor. Darius was a fabric of thy own rearing, who of a servant and the king's courier was by thee advanced to be monarch of all Persia. The same was Sardanapalus, who from
						a comber of purple wool was raised by thee to wear the
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.476"/>
						
						royal diadem. But I, subduing as I marched, from Arbela
						forced my passage even to Susa itself. Cilicia opened me
						a broad way into Egypt; and the Granicus, o'er which I
						passed without resistance, trampling under foot the slain
						carcasses of Mithridates and Spithridates, opened the way
						into Cilicia. Pamper up thyself, and boast thy kings that
						never felt a wound nor ever saw a finger bleed; for they
						were fortunate, it is true,&mdash;thy Ochi and thy Artaxerxes,
						&mdash;who were no sooner born but they were by thee established in the throne of Cyrus. But my body carries many
						marks of Fortune's unkindness, who rather fought against
						me as an enemy than assisted me as her friend. First,
						among the Illyrians I was wounded in the head with a
						stone, and received a blow in the neck with an iron mace.
						Then, near the Granicus my head was a second time gashed
						with a barbarian scimitar; at Issus I was run through the
						thigh with a sword; at Gaza I was shot in the ankle with
						a dart; and not long after, falling heavy from my saddle, I
						forced my shoulder out of joint. Among the Maracadartae
						my shinbone was split with an arrow. The wounds I received in India and my strenuous acts of daring courage
						will declare the rest. Then among the Assacani I was
						shot through the shoulder with another arrow. Encountering the Gandridae, my thigh was wounded; and one of
						the Mallotes drew his bow with that force, that the welldirected arrow made way through my iron armor to lodge
						itself in my breast; besides the blow in my neck, when
						the scaling-ladders brake that were set to the walls, and
						Fortune left me alone, to gratify with the fall of so great
						a person not a renowned or illustrious enemy, but ignoble
						and worthless barbarians. So that had not Ptolemy covered me with his shield, and Limnaeus, after he had
						received a thousand wounds directed at my body, fallen
						dead before me; or if the Macedonians, breathing nothing
						but courage and their prince's rescue, had not opened a
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.477"/>
						
						timely breach, that barbarous and nameless village might
						have proved Alexander's tomb.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="3">
               <p>Take the whole expedition together, and what was it
					but a patient endurance of cold winters and parching
					droughts; depths of rivers, rocks inaccessible to the
					winged fowl, amazing sights of strange wild beasts, savage diet, and lastly revolts and treasons of far-controlling
					potentates. As to what before the expedition befell me, it
					is well known that all Greece lay gasping and panting
					under the fatal effects of the Philippic wars. But then
					the Thebans, raising themselves upon their feet again
					after so desperate a fall, shook from their arms the dust
					of Chaeronea; with them also joined the Athenians, reaching forth their helping hands. The treacherous Macedonians, studying nothing but revenge, cast their eyes upon the
					sons of Aeropus; the Illyrians brake out into an open war;
					and the Scythians hung in equal balance, seeing their neighbors meditating new revolutions; while Persian gold, liberally scattered among the popular leaders of every city,
					put all Peloponnesus into motion.</p>
               <p>King Philip's treasuries were at that time empty, and
						besides he was in debt, as Onesicritus relates, two hundred
						talents. In the midst of so much pressing want and such
						menacing troubles, a youth but new past the age of childhood durst aspire to the conquest of Babylon and Susa, or
						rather project in his thoughts supreme dominion over all
						mankind; and all this, trusting only to the strength of
						thirty thousand foot and four thousand horse. For so
						many there were, by the account which Aristobulus gives;
						by the relation of King Ptolemy, there were five thousand
						horse; from both which Anaximenes varying musters up
						the foot to three and forty thousand, and the horse to five
						thousand five hundred. Now the glorious and magnificent
						sum which Fortune had raised up to supply the necessities
						of so great an expedition was no more than seventy talents,
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.478"/>
						
						according to Aristobulus; or, as Duris records it, only
						thirty days' provision.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="4">
               <p>You will say therefore that Alexander was too rash
					and daringly inconsiderate, with such a slender support to
					rush upon so vast an opposition. By no means: for who
					was ever better fitted than he for splendid enterprises; with
					all the choicest and most excelling precepts of magnanimity, consideration, wisdom, and virtuous fortitude, with
					which a philosophical education largely supplied him for
					his expedition? So that we may properly affirm that he
					invaded Persia with greater assistance from Aristotle than
					from his father Philip. As for those who write how
					Alexander was wont to say that the Iliad and Odyssey
					had always followed him in his wars, in honor to Homer I
					believe them. Nevertheless, if any one affirm that the
					Iliad and Odyssey were admitted of his train merely as the
					recreation of his wearied thoughts or pastime of his leisure hours, but that philosophical learning, and commentaries concerning contempt of fear, fortitude, temperance,
					and nobleness of spirit, were the real cabinet provision
					which he carried along for his personal use, we contemn
					their assertion. For he was not a person that ever wrote
					concerning arguments or syllogisms; none of those who
					observed walks in the Lyceum, or held disputes in the
					Academy; for they who thus circumscribe philosophy believe it to consist in discoursing, not in action. And yet
					we find that neither Pythagoras nor Socrates, Arcesilaus
					nor Carneades, was ever celebrated for his writings, though
					they were the most approved and esteemed among all the
					philosophers. Yet no such busy wars as these employed
					their time in civilizing wild and barbarous kings, in building Grecian cities among rude and unpolished nations, nor
					in settling government and peace among people that lived
					without humanity or control of law. They only lived at
					ease, and surrendered the business and trouble of writing
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.479"/>
					
					to the more contentious Sophists. Whence then came it
					to pass that they were believed to be philosophers? It was
					either from their sayings, from the lives they led, or from
					the precepts which they taught. Upon these grounds let
					us take a prospect of Alexander, and we shall soon find
					him, by what he said, by what he acted, and by the lessons
					he taught, to be a great philosopher.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="5">
               <p>And first, if you please, consider that which seems the
					farthest distant of all from the common received opinion,
					and compare the disciples of Alexander with the pupils of
					Plato and Socrates. The latter instructed persons ingenuous, such as speak the same speech, well understanding
					(if nothing else) the Grecian language. But there were
					many with whom their precepts did not prevail; for men
					like Critias, Alcibiades, and Cleitophon shook off their
					doctrine like a bridle, and followed the conduct of their
					own inclinations.</p>
               <p>On the other side, take a view of Alexander's discipline,
						and you shall see how he taught the Hyrcanians the conveniency of wedlock, introduced husbandry among the
						Arachosians, persuaded the Sogdians to preserve and cherish&mdash;not to kill&mdash;their aged parents; the Persians to
						reverence and honor&mdash;not to marry&mdash;their mothers.
						Most admirable philosophy! which induced the Indians
						to worship the Grecian Deities, and wrought upon the
						Scythians to bury their deceased friends, not to feed upon
						their carcasses. We admire the power of Carneades's eloquence, for forcing the Carthaginian Clitomachus, called
						Asdrubal before, to embrace the Grecian customs. No less
						we wonder at the prevailing reason of Zeno, by whom the
						Babylonian Diogenes was charmed into the love of philosophy. Yet no sooner had Alexander subdued Asia, than
						Homer became an author in high esteem, and the Persian,
						Susian, and Gedrosian youth sang the tragedies of Euripides and Sophocles. Among the Athenians, Socrates, introducing
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.480"/>
						
						 foreign Deities, was condemned to death at the
						prosecution of his accusers. But Alexander engaged both
						Bactria and Caucasus to worship the Grecian Gods, which
						they had never known before. Lastly, Plato, though he proposed but one single form of a commonwealth, could never
						persuade any people to make use of it, by reason of the austerity of his government. But Alexander, building above
						seventy cities among the barbarous nations, and as it were
						sowing the Grecian customs and constitutions all over Asia,
						quite weaned them from their former wild and savage
						manner of living. The laws of Plato here and there a
						single person may peradventure study, but myriads of
						people have made and still make use of Alexander's. And
						they whom Alexander vanquished were more greatly
						blessed than they who fled his conquests. For these had
						none to deliver them from their ancient state of misery;
						the others the victor compelled to better fortune. True
						therefore was that expression of Themistocles, when he
						was a fugitive from his native country, and the king entertained him with sumptuous presents, assigning him three
						stipendiary cities to supply his table, one with bread, a
						second with wine, a third with all manner of costly viands;
						Ah! young men, said he, had we not been undone, we had
						surely been undone. It may, however, be more justly
						averred of those whom Alexander subdued, had they not
						been vanquished, they had never been civilized. Egypt
						had not vaunted her Alexandria, nor Mesopotamia her
						Seleucia; Sogdiana had not gloried in her Propthasia, nor
						the Indians boasted their Bucephalia, nor Caucasus its
						neighboring Grecian city; by the founding of all which barbarism was extinguished and custom changed the worse
						into better.</p>
               <p>If then philosophers assume to themselves their highest
						applause for cultivating the most fierce and rugged conditions of men, certainly Alexander is to be acknowledged
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.481"/>
						
						the chiefest of philosophers, who changed the wild and
						brutish customs of so many various nations, reducing them
						to order and government.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="6">
               <p>It is true indeed that the so much admired commonwealth of Zeno, first author of the Stoic sect, aims singly
					at this, that neither in cities nor in towns we should live
					under laws distinct one from another, but that we should
					look upon all men in general to be our fellow-countrymen
					and citizens, observing one manner of living and one kind
					of order, like a flock feeding together with equal right in
					one common pasture. This Zeno wrote, fancying to himself, as in a dream, a certain scheme of civil order, and the
					image of a philosophical commonwealth. But Alexander
					made good his words by his deeds; for he did not, as
					Aristotle advised him, rule the Grecians like a moderate
					prince and insult over the barbarians like an absolute tyrant; nor did he take particular care of the first as his
					friends and domestics, and scorn the latter as mere brutes
					and vegetables; which would have filled his empire with
					fugitive incendiaries and perfidious tumults. But believing
					himself sent from Heaven as the common moderator and
					arbiter of all nations, and subduing those by force whom
					he could not associate to himself by fair offers, he labored
					thus, that he might bring all regions, far and near, under
					the same dominion. And then, as in a festival goblet,
					mixing lives, manners, customs, wedlock, all together, he
					ordained that every one should take the whole habitable
					world for his country, of which his camp and army should
					be the chief metropolis and garrison; that his friends and
					kindred should be the good and virtuous, and that the
					vicious only should be accounted foreigners. Nor would
					he that Greeks and barbarians should be distinguished
					by long garments, targets, scimitars, or turbans; but that
					the Grecians should be known by their virtue and courage,
					and the barbarians by their vices and their cowardice; and
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.482"/>
					
					that their habit, their diet, their marriage and custom of
					converse, should be everywhere the same, engaged and
					blended together by the ties of blood and pledges of
					offspring.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="7">
               <p>Therefore it was that Demaratus the Corinthian, an
					acquaintance and friend of Philip, when he beheld Alexander in Susa, bursting into tears of more than ordinary
					joy, bewailed the deceased Greeks, who, as he said, had
					been bereaved of the greatest blessing on earth, for that
					they had not seen Alexander sitting upon the throne of
					Darius. Though most assuredly, for my part, I do not
					envy the beholders this show, which was only a thing of
					chance and a happiness of more ordinary kings. But I
					would gladly have been a spectator of those majestic and
					sacred nuptials, when, after he had betrothed together a
					hundred Persian brides and a hundred Macedonian and
					Greek bridegrooms, he placed them all at one common
					table within the compass of one pavilion embroidered with
					gold, as being all of the same family; and then, crowned
					with a nuptial garland, and being himself the first to sing
					an epithalamium in honor of the conjunction between two
					of the greatest and most potent nations in the world, of
					only one the bridegroom, of all the brideman, father, and
					moderator, he caused the several couples to be severally
					married. Had I but beheld this sight, ecstasied with pleasure I should have then cried out: <q direct="unspecified">Barbarous and stupid
						Xerxes, how vain was all thy toil to cover the Hellespont
						with a floating bridge! Thus rather wise and prudent
						princes join Asia to Europe. They join and fasten nations
						together not with boards or planks, or surging brigandines,
						not with inanimate and insensible bonds, but by the ties of
						legitimate love, chaste nuptials, and the infallible gage of
						progeny.</q>
               </p>
            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="8">
               <p>But then, when he considered the Eastern garments,
					Alexander preferred the Persian before the Median habit,
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.483"/>
					
					though much the meaner and more frugal garb. Therefore rejecting the gaudy and scenical ornament of barbarian gallantry, such as were the tiara and candys, together
					with the upper breeches, according to the report of Eratosthenes, he ordered a mixture of the Macedonian and Persian modes to be observed in all the garments which he
					wore. As a philosopher, he contented himself with mediocrity; but as the common chieftain of both and as a mild
					and affable prince, he was willing to gain the affection of
					the vanquished by the esteem which he showed to the
					mode of the country; that so they might continue the
					more steadfast and loyal to the Macedonians, not hating
					them as their enemies, but loving them as their princes
					and rulers. This behavior was contrary to that of persons
					insipid and puffed up with prosperity, who wedded to their
					own humors admire the single colored robe but cannot endure the tunic bordered with purple, or else are well pleased
					with the latter and hate the former, like young children, in
					love with the mode in which, as another nurse, their country's custom first apparelled them. And yet we see that
					they who hunt wild beasts clothe themselves with their
					hairy skins; and fowlers make use of feathered jerkins;
					nor are others less wary how they show themselves to
					wild bulls in scarlet or to elephants in white; for those
					creatures are provoked and enraged at the sight of these
					colors. If then this potent monarch, designing to reclaim
					and civilize stubborn and warlike nations, took the same
					course to soften and allay their inbred fury which others
					take with wild beasts, and at length brought them to be
					tame and tractable by making use of their familiar habits
					and by submitting to their customary course of life, thereby
					removing animosity from their breasts and sour looks from
					their countenances, shall we blame his management; or
					rather must we not admire the wisdom of him who by so
					slight a change of apparel ruled all Asia, subduing their
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.484"/>
					
					bodies with his arms and vanquishing their minds with his
					habit? It is a strange thing; we applaud Socratic Aristippus, because, being sometimes clad in a poor threadbare
					cloak, sometimes in a Milesian robe, he kept a decency in
					both; but they censure Alexander, because he gave some
					respect to the garb and mode of those whom he had vanquished, as well as to that of his native country; not
					considering that he was laying the foundation of vast
					achievements. It was not his design to ransack Asia like
					a robber, or to despoil and ruin it, as the prey and rapine
					of unexpected good fortune, as afterwards Hannibal pillaged Italy, and before him the Treres ravaged Ionia and
					the Scythians harassed Media,&mdash;but to subdue all the
					kingdoms of the earth under one form of government, and
					to make one nation of all mankind. So that if the same
					Deity which hither sent the soul of Alexander had not too
					soon recalled it, one law had overlooked all the world, and
					one form of justice had been as it were the common light
					of one universal government; while now that part of the
					earth which Alexander never saw remains without a sun.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 type="section" n="9">
               <p>Thus, in the first place, the very scope and aim of
					Alexander's expedition speaks him a philosopher, as one
					that sought not to gain for himself luxurious splendor or
					riches, but to establish concord, peace, and mutual community among all men.</p>
               <p>Next, let us consider his sayings, seeing that the souls of
						other kings and potentates betray their conditions and inclinations by their expressions. Antigonus the Aged, having heard a certain poet sing before him a short treatise
						concerning justice, said, Thou art a fool to mention justice
						to me, when thou seest me thundering down the cities belonging to other people about their ears. Dionysius the
						Tyrant was wont to say that children were to be cheated
						with dice, but men with oaths. Upon the monument of
						Sardanapalus this inscription is to be seen:&mdash;
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.485"/>
						
						
						            <quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>All I did eat and drink, and all that lust</l>
							              <l>To me vouchsafed, I have; all else is gone.</l>
                  </quote>
						
						What now can a man say of these apophthems, but
						that the first denotes injustice and immoderate desire of
						sovereignty; the next impiety; and the third sensuality?
						But as for the sayings of Alexander, set aside his diadem,
						his claimed descent from Ammon, and the nobility of his
						Macedonian extraction, and you would believe them to
						have been the sayings of Socrates, Plato, or Pythagoras.
						For we omit the swelling hyperboles of flattery which
						poets have inscribed under his images and statues, studying rather to extol the power of Alexander than his moderation and temperance; as, for example,&mdash;
						
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>The statue seems to look to Jove and say,</l>
							              <l>Take thou Olympus; me let Earth obey!</l>
                  </quote>
						
						and that other,&mdash;
						
						
						<quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>This is Alexander the son of Jove.</l>
                  </quote>
               </p>
               <p>But these, as I said, were only the flashes of poetic adulation magnifying his good success. Let us therefore come
						to such sentences as were really uttered by Alexander himself, beginning first with the early blossoms of his childhood.</p>
               <p>It is well known that for swiftness in running he exceeded all that were of his years; for which reason some
						of his most familiar play-fellows would have persuaded
						him to show himself at the Olympic games. He asked
						them whether there were any kings to contend with him.
						And when they replied that there were none, he said, The
						contest then is unequal, for I can conquer only private men,
						while they may conquer a king.</p>
               <p>His father, King Philip, being run through the thigh in
						a battle against the Triballi, and, though he escaped the
						danger, being not a little troubled at the deformity of his
						limping; Be of good cheer, father, said he, and show
						yourself in public, that you may be reminded of your
						bravery at every step.</p>
               <pb id="v.1.p.486"/>
               <p>Are not these the products of a mind truly philosophical, which by an inspired inclination to what is noble
						already contemns the disfigurings of the body? Nor can
						we otherwise believe but that he himself gloried in his own
						wounds, which every time he beheld then called to his
						remembrance the conquered nation and the victory, what
						cities he had taken, what kings had surrendered themselves; never striving to conceal or cover those indelible
						characters and scars of honor, which he always carried

               <p>Tell me now; can such generous acts of Alexander
					as these be thought to speak the spontaneous favors of Fortune, only an impetuous torrent of success and strength of
					hand? Do they not rather demonstrate much of fortitude
					and justice, much of mildness and temperance, in one who
					managed all things with decorum and consideration, with a
					sober and intelligent judgment? Not that I (believe me)
					go about to distinguish between the several acts of Alexander, and to ascribe this to fortitude, that to humanity,
					another to temperance; but I take every act to be an act
					of all the virtues mixed together. This is conformable to

					Being ravished with the beauty of Roxana, the daughter

					triumphal songs to celebrate the end of so long a war, but
					unclasping his own cloak from his shoulders he threw it
					over the dead corpse philosophically, as it were to cover
					the shame of royal calamity. Another time, as he was
					perusing a private letter sent him by his mother, he observed Hephaestion, who was sitting by him, to read it
					along with him, little understanding what he did. For
					which unwary act Alexander forbore to reprove him; only
					clapping his signet to his mouth, he thus kindly admonished him that his lips were then sealed up to silence by
					the friendly confidence which he reposed in him,&mdash;all
					this philosophically. And indeed if these were not acts
					done philosophically, where shall we find them?</p>

            <div2 type="section" n="12">
               <p>Let us compare with his some few acts of those who
					are by all allowed to be philosophers. Socrates yielded to
					the lustful embraces of Alcibiades. Alexander, when Philoxenus, governor of the sea-coasts, wrote to him concerning an Ionian lad that had not his equal for youthful
					beauty, and desired to know whether he should e sent to
					him or not, returned him this nipping answer: Vilest of
					men, when wast thou ever privy to any desires of mine,
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.490"/>
					
					that thou shouldst think to flatter me with such abhorred
					allurements? We admire the abstinency of Xenocrates
					for refusing the gift of fifty talents which Alexander sent
					him; but do we take no notice of the munificence of the
					giver? Or is the bountiful person not to be thought as
					much a contemner of money as he that refuses it? Xenocrates needed not riches, by reason of his philosophy; but
					Alexander wanted wealth, by reason of the same philosophy, that he might be more liberal to such persons. . . .
					How often has Alexander borne witness to this in the
					midst of a thousand dangers? It is true, we believe that
					it is in the power of all men to judge rightly of things;
					for nature guides us of herself to virtue and bravery. But
					herein philosophers excel all others, that they have by
					education acquired a fixed and solid judgment to encounter

               <p>WE forgot in our yesterday's discourse to tell you, that
					the age wherein Alexander flourished had the happiness
					to abound in sciences and in persons of transcending natural endowments. Yet this is not to be ascribed to Alexander's but their own good fortune, which favored them with
					such a judge and such a spectator of their particular excellencies as was both able rightly to discern and liberally
					to reward their understood deserts. Therefore it is recorded
					of Archestratus, born some ages after, an elegant poet but
					buried in his own extreme poverty, that a certain person
					meeting him said, Hadst thou but lived when Alexander
					lived, for every verse he would have gratified thee with an
					island of Cyprus or a territory fair as that of Phoenicia
					Which makes me of opinion that those former famous
					artists and soaring geniuses may not so properly be said to
					have lived in the time of Alexander as by Alexander. For
					as the temperature of the season and limpid thinness of the
					surrounding air produce plenty of grain and fruit: so the
					favor, the encouragement, and benignity of a prince increase
					the number of aspiring geniuses, and advance perfection in
					sciences. And on the other side, by the envy, covetousness,
					and contentiousness of those in power, whatever soars to
					the height of true bravery or invention is utterly quelled
					and extinguished. Therefore it is reported of Dionysius
					the Tyrant that, being pleased with the music of a certain
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.492"/>
					
					player on a harp, he promised him a talent for his reward;
					but when the musician claimed his promise the next day,
					Yesterday, said he, by thee delighted, while thou sangest
					before me, I gave thee likewise the pleasure of thy hopes;
					and thence immediately didst thou receive the reward of
					thy delightful pastime, enjoying at the same time the charming expectation of my promise. In like manner Alexander
					tyrant of the Pheraeans (for it behooves us to distinguish
					him by that addition, lest we should dishonor his namesake),
					sitting to see a tragedy, was so affected with delight at the
					acting, that he found himself moved to a more than ordinary compassion. Upon which, leaping suddenly from his
					seat, as he hastily flung out of the theatre, How poor and
					mean it would look, said he, if I, that have massacred so
					many of my own citizens and subjects, should be seen here
					weeping at the misfortunes of Hecuba and Polyxena! And
					it was an even lay but that he had mischiefed the tragedian
					for having mollified his cruel and merciless disposition, like
					iron softened by fire. Timotheus also, singing to Archelaus
					who seemed too parsimonious in remuneration, frequently
					upbraided him with the following sarcasm:&mdash;
					
					
					<quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Base earth-bred silver thou admirest.</l>

					Ateas, king of the Scythians, having taken Ismenias the
					musician prisoner, commanded him to play during one of
					his royal banquets. And when all the rest admired and
					applauded his harmony, Ateas swore that the neighing of
					a horse was more delightful to his ears. So great a stranger
					was he to the habitations of the Muses; as one whose
					soul lodged always in his stables, fitter however to hear
					asses bray than horses neigh. Therefore, among such kings,
					what progress or advancement of noble sciences or esteem
					for learning can be expected? And surely no more can be
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.493"/>
					
					expected from such as would themselves be rivals, who
					therefore persecute real artists with all the hatred and envy
					imaginable. In the number of these was Dionysius before
					mentioned, who condemned Philoxenus the poet to labor
					in the quarries, because, being by the tyrant commanded
					only to correct a tragedy by him written, he struck out every
					line from the beginning to the end. Nay, I must needs say
					that Philip, who became a student not till his latter years,
					in these things descended beneath himself. For it being
					once his chance to enter into a dispute about sounds with a
					musician whom he thought he had foiled in his art, the
					person modestly and with a smile replied, May never so
					great a misfortune befall thee, O King, as to understand
					these things better than I do.</p>

               <p>But Alexander, well considering of what persons and

					For having learned this art from his ancestors, the Aeacidae and Hercules, he gave to other arts their due honor
					and esteem without the least emulation; embracing and
					favoring what was in them noble and elegant, but never
					suffering himself to be carried away with the pleasure of
					being a practitioner in any. In his time flourished the two
					tragedians, Thessalus and Athenodorus, who contending
					for the prize, the Cyprian kings supplied the charges of the
					theatre, and the judges were to be the most renowned
					captains of the age. But at length Athenodorus being adjudged the victor; I could have wished, said Alexander,

					 believing it became him to be superior to all others,
					only to submit to justice. To the comedian Lyco of Scarphe, who had inserted into one of his scenes certain verses

					laughing heartily at the conceit. Aristonicus was in the
					number of the most famous musicians of those times. This
					man being slain in battle, strenuously fighting to assist and
					save his friend, Alexander commanded his statue to be
					made in brass and set up in the temple of Pythian Apollo,
					holding his harp in one hand and his spear upright in the
					other, not only in memory of the person, but in honor of
					music itself, as exciting to fortitude and inspiring those who

						that it was said of the two Alexanders that Philip's was

						For which Alexander gave to Lysippus the sole patent for

						lustre of his virtue; while others, who strove to imitate
						the turning of his neck and softness and brightness of his

						of his countenance.</p>
               <p>Among the great artists of that time was Stasicrates, who
						never studied elegance nor what was sweet and alluring to
						the eye, but only bold and lofty workmanship and design,
						becoming the munificence of royal bounty. He attended

						sculptures, and cast figures that were made of his person,

					been brought to perfection; is there any person living, do

					one. What may we think of the statue representing him

					ever be made by Fortune without the help of art; nay,
					though she should profusely afford all the materials imaginable of gold, brass, ivory, or any other substance whatever? Much more, is it probable that so great a personage,

					among men, for his cowardice; among women, for his
					inordinate lust. For as unskilful workmen, erecting small
					figures upon huge pedestals, betray the slightness of their
					own understandings; so Fortune, when she brings a person
					of a poor and narrow soul upon the stage of weighty and
					glorious actions, does but expose and disgrace him, as a

               <p>As for Alexander, he breakfasted by break of day,
					always sitting; and supped at the shutting in of the evening; he drank when he had sacrificed to the Gods. With
					his friend Medius he played for diversion when he was sick
					with a fever. He also played upon the road as he marched,
					learning between whiles to throw a dart and leap from his
					chariot. He married Roxana merely for love; but Statira,
					the daughter of Darius, upon the account of statepolicy, for such a conjunction of both nations strengthened
					his conquest. As to the other Persian women, he excelled
					them in chastity and continence as far as he surpassed the
					men in valor. He never desired the sight of any virgin
					that was unwilling; and those he saw, he regarded less
					than if he had not seen them; mild and affable to all
					others, proud and lofty only to fair youth. As for the wife
					of Darius, a woman most beautiful, he never would endure
					to hear a word spoken in commendation of her features.
					When she was dead, he graced her funeral with such a
					regal pomp, and bewailed her death so piteously, that his
					kindness cast discredit upon his chastity, and his very
					courtesy incurred the obloquy of injustice. Indeed, Darius
					himself had been moved with suspicion at first, when he
					thought of the power and the youth of the conqueror; for
					he was one of those who thought Alexander to be only the

					<q direct="unspecified">Well,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">I do not yet perceive the condition of

               <p>So true it is that virtue is the victor still. But now,
					if you please, let us ascribe to Fortune Arbela and Cilicia,
					and those other acts of main force and violence; say that
					Fortune thundered down the walls of Tyre, and that Fortune opened the way into Egypt. Believe that by Fortune
					Halicarnassus fell, Miletus was taken, Mazaeus left Euphrates unguarded, and the Babylonian fields were strewed
					with the carcasses of the slain. Yet was not his prudence
					the gift of Fortune, nor his temperance. Neither did For

					assaults of his fervent desires. These were the weapons
					with which he overthrew Darius. Fortune's advantages,
					if so they may be called, were only the fury of armed men
					and horses, battles, slaughters, and flights of routed adversaries. But the great and most undoubted victory which
					Darius lost was this, that he was forced to yield to virtue,
					magnanimity, prowess, and justice, while he beheld with
					admiration his conqueror, who was not to be overcome by
					pleasure or by labor, nor to be matched in liberality.</p>
               <p>True it is, that among the throngs of shields and spears,
						in the midst of war-like shouts and the clashing of weapons,
						Tarrias the son of Dinomenes, Antigenes the Pellenian,
						and Philotas the son of Parmenio were invincible; but in
						respect of their inordinate debauchery, their love of women,
						their insatiable covetousness, they were nothing superior
						to the meanest of their captives. For the last of these
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.504"/>
						
						vices Tarrias was particularly noted; and when Alexander
						set the Macedonians out of debt and paid off all their
						creditors, Tarrias pretended among the rest to owe a great
						sum of money, and brought a suborned person to demand
						the sum as due to him; but being discovered, he would
						have laid violent hands upon himself, had not Alexander
						forgiven him and ordered him the money, remembering that
						at the battle of Perinthus fought by Philip, being shot into
						the eye with a dart, he would not suffer the head of it to
						be pulled out till the field was clear of the enemy. Antigenes, when the sick and maimed soldiers were to be sent
						back into Macedon, made suit to be registered down in the
						number, pretending himself utterly disabled in the wars;
						which very much troubled Alexander, who was well acquainted with his valor and knew that he wore the scars
						about him of many a bloody field. But the fraud being
						detected, that was concealed under some little present infirmity, Alexander asked him the reason of his design; and
						he answered, he did it for the love of Telesippe, that he
						might accompany her to the sea, not being able to endure
						a separation from her. Presently the King demanded to
						whom the wench belonged, and who was to be dealt with
						in regard to her. To which he replied, she was free from
						any tie. Well, then, said the King, let us persuade her to
						stay, if promises or gifts will prevail. So ready was he
						to pardon the dotages of love in others, so rigorous to himself. But Philotas the son of Parmenio exercised his incontinency after a more offensive manner. Antigona was
						a Pellaean virgin among the captives taken about Damascus, a prisoner before to Autophradates, who took her
						going by sea into Samothrace. The beauty of this damsel
						was such as kept Philotas constant to her embraces. Nay,
						she had so softened and mellowed this man of steel, I know
						not how, that he was not master of himself in his enjoyments, but told her the very secrets of his breast; among
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.505"/>
						
						other things he said: What had Philip been, but for Parmenio? And what would Alexander now be, but for Philotas? What would become of Ammon and the dragons,
						should we be once provoked? These words Antigona prattled to one of her companions, and she told them to Craterus. Craterus brings Antigona privately to Alexander, who
						forbore to offer her the least incivility, but by her means
						piercing into Philotas's breast, he detected the whole. Yet
						for seven years after he never discovered so much as the
						least sign of jealousy, either in his wine or in his anger;
						nor did he ever disclose it to any friend, even to Hephaestion, from whom he never concealed the most inward of
						his counsels and designs. For it is said that once, when
						Alexander had just opened a private letter from his mother
						and was quietly reading it, Hephaestion looked over his
						shoulder and began to read it likewise; but Alexander
						forbore to reprove him, and only took off his signet and
						clapped it to Hephaestion's mouth.</p>

               <p>But now I shall return to the beginnings of his advancement and the early dawnings of his power, and endeavor
						to discover what was there the great work of Fortune, which
						rendered Alexander so great by her assistance. First then,
						how came it to pass that some neighing barb did not seat
						him in the throne of Cyrus, free from wounds, without loss
						of blood, without a toilsome expedition, as formerly it
						happened to Darius Hystaspes? Or that some oneflattered
						by a woman, as Darius by Atossa, did not deliver up his
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.506"/>
						
						diadem to him, as the other did to Xerxes, so that the empire of Persia came home to him, even to his own doors?
						Or why did not some eunuch aid him, as Bagoas did the
						son of Parysatis, who, only throwing off the habit of a
						messenger, immediately put on the royal turban? Or why
						was he not elected on a sudden and unexpectedly by lot to
						the empire of the world, as at Athens the lawgivers and
						rulers are wont to be chosen? Would you know how men
						come to be kings by Fortune's help? At Argos the whole
						race of the Heraclidae happened to be extinct, to whom
						the sceptre of that kingdom belonged. Upon which consulting the oracle, answer was made to them that an eagle
						should direct them. Within a few days the eagle appeared
						towering aloft, but stooping he at length lighted upon
						Aegon's house; thereupon Aegon was chosen king. Another time in Paphos, the king that there reigned being
						an unjust and wicked tyrant, Alexander resolved to dethrone him, and therefore sought out for another, the race
						of the Kinyradae seeming to be at an end. They told him
						there was one yet in being, a poor man and of no account,
						who lived miserable in a certain garden. Thereupon messengers were sent, who found the poor man watering some
						few small beds of pot-herbs. The miserable creature was
						strangely surprised to see so many soldiers about him, but
						go he must; and so being brought before Alexander in his
						rags and tatters, he caused him presently to be proclaimed
						king and clad in purple; which done, he was admitted
						into the number of those who were called the king's companions. The name of this person was Alynomus. Thus
						Fortune creates kings suddenly, easily changing the habits
						and altering the names of those that never expected or
						hoped for any such thing.</p>

            <div2 type="section" n="9">
               <p>All this while, what favors did Fortune shower upon

					of great achievements and illustrious actions? He quenched
					his thirst in rivers mixed with blood; he marched over
					bridges of slain carcasses; he grazed the fields to satisfy
					his present hunger; he dug his way to nations covered
					with snow and cities lying under ground; he made the
					hostile sea submit to his fleets; and, marching over the
					thirsty and barren sands of the Gedrosians and Arachosians, he discovered green at sea before he saw it at land.
					So that if I might use the same liberty of speech for Alexander to Fortune as to a man, I would thus expostulate
					with her:&mdash;</p>
               <p>&ldquo;Insulting Fortune, when and where didst thou make

						bloody assault, by thy favor? What city didst thou ever
						deliver unguarded into his hands? Or what unarmed battalion of men? What faint-hearted prince, what negligent
						captain, or sleepy sentinels did he ever surprise? When
						didst thou ever befriend him with so much as a fordable
						river, a mild winter, or an easy summer? Get thee to
						Antiochus the son of Seleucus, to Artaxerxes the brother

					prosecute his first design. But then again spiteful Fortune stirred up the Thebans against him, and entangled
					him in the Grecian war, and in the dire necessity of
					defending himself against his fellow-countrymen and relations with fire and sword and hideous slaughter. Which
					war being brought to a dreadful end, away he presently
					crossed into Asia,&mdash;as Phylarchus relates, with only thirty
					days' provision; as Aristobulus reports, with seventy talents,&mdash;having before sold and divided among his friends
					his own revenues and those of his crown. Only Perdiccas
					refused what he offered him, asking him at the same time
					what he had left for himself. And when Alexander replied, Nothing but hopes, Then, said he, we will be content with the same; for it is not just to accept of thy
					goods, but we must wait for those of Darius.</p>

               <p>What were then the hopes with which Alexander
					passed into Asia Not a vast power mustered out of
					populous cities, nor fleets sailing through mountains; not
					whips and fetters, the instruments of barbarians' fury, to
					curb and manacle the sea. But in his small army there
					was surpassing desire of glory, emulation among those of
					equal age, and a noble strife to excel in honor and virtue
					among friends. Then, as for himself, he carried with him
					all these great hopes,&mdash;piety towards the Gods, fidelity to
					his friends, generous frugality, temperance, beneficence,
					contempt of death, magnanimity, humanity, decent affability, candid integrity, constancy in counsel, quickness in
					execution, love of precedence in honor, and an effectual
					purpose to follow the steps of virtue. And though Homer,
					in describing the beauty of Agamemnon, seems not to
					have observed the rules of decorum or probability in any
					of his three similitudes,&mdash;
					Like thundering Jove's, his awful head and eyes
					The gazing crowd with majesty surprise;
					In every part with form celestial graced,
					His breast like Neptune's, and like Mars his waist;<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Il. II. 478.</note>

					yet as for Alexander, if his celestial parents formed and
					composed him of several virtues, may we not conclude
					that he had the wisdom of Cyrus, the temperance of
					Agesilaus, the foresight of Themistocles, the skill of
					Philip, the daring courage of Brasidas, the shrewdness
					and political skill of Pericles? Certainly, if we compare
					him with the most ancient heroes, he was more temperate
					than Agamemnon, who preferred a captive before his lawful wife, though but newly wedded, while Alexander, before
					he was legally married, abstained from his prisoners. He
					was more magnanimous than Achilles, who accepted a
					small sum of money for the redemption of Hector's dead
					body, while Alexander spared no expense to adorn the
					funeral of Darius. Achilles accepted gifts and bribes
					from his friends, as the atonement of his wrath; Alexander, when once a victor, enriched his enemies. He was
					much more pious than Diomede, who scrupled not to fight
					against the Gods, while Alexander ascribed to Heaven all
					his successes. Finally, he was more bewailed of his relations than Ulysses, whose mother died for grief, while
					the mother of Alexander's enemy, out of affection, bare
					him company in his death.</p>

               <p>In short, if Solon proved so wise a ruler by Fortune,
					if Miltiades led his armies by Fortune, if Aristides was so
					renowned for his justice by Fortune, then there is nothing
					that can be called the work of virtue. Then is virtue
					only an airy fiction, and a word that passes with some
					show of glory through the life of man, but feigned and
					magnified by Sophists and lawgivers. But if every one
					of these whom we have mentioned was wealthy or poor,
					weak or strong, deformed or beautiful, long or short lived,
					by Fortune, but made himself a great captain, a great lawgiver, famous for governing kingdoms and commonwealths,
					by virtue and reason; then in God's name let us compare
					Alexander with the best of them. Solon by a law made a
					
					<pb id="v.1.p.513"/>
					
					great abatement upon the payment of the Athenians' private debts, which he called his burden-easing law; Alexander discharged the debts of his Macedonians at his own
					expense. Pericles, laying a tax upon the Greeks, expended
					the money in building temples to beautify the citadel of
					Athens; Alexander sent home ten thousand talents out
					of the spoils of the barbarians, for the building of temples to the Gods all over Greece. Brasidas advanced his
					fame all over Greece, by breaking through the enemy's
					army lying encamped by the seaside near Methone; but
					when you read of that daringjump of Alexander's (so
					astonishing to the hearers, much more to them that beheld
					it) when he threw himself from the walls of the Oxydracian metropolis among the thickest of the enemy, assailing him on every side with spears, darts, and swords, tell
					me where you meet with such an example of matchless
					prowess, or to what you can compare it but to a gleam
					of lightning violently flashing from a cloud, and impetuously driven by the wind? Such was the appearance of
					Alexander, as he leaped like an apparition to the earth,
					glittering in his flaming armor. The enemy, at first amazed
					and struck with horror, retreated and fell back; till seeing
					him single they came on again with a redoubled force.</p>
               <p>Now was not this a great and splendid testimony of
						Fortune's kindness, to throw him into an inconsiderable
						and barbarous town, and there to enclose and immure him
						a prey to worthless enemies? And when his friends made
						haste to his assistance, to break the scaling-ladders, and
						to overthrow and cast them down? Of three that got
						upon the walls and flung themselves down in his defence,
						endearing Fortune presently despatched one; the other,
						pierced and struck with a shower of darts, could only be
						said to live. Without, the Macedonians foamed and filled
						the air with helpless cries, having no engines at hind. All
						they could do was to dig down the walls with their swords,
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.514"/>
						
						tear out the stones with their nails, and almost to rend
						them out with their teeth. All this while, Alexander,
						Fortune's favorite, whom she always covered with her protection, like a wild beast entangled in a snare, stood deserted and destitute of all assistance, not laboring for Susa,
						Babylon, Bactria, or to vanquish the mighty Porus. For to
						miscarry in great and glorious attempts is no reproach;
						but so malicious was Fortune, so kind to the barbarians,
						such a hater of Alexander, that she aimed not only at his
						life and body, but at bereaving him of his honor and sullying his renown. For Alexander's fall had never been so
						much lamented had he perished near Euphrates or Hydaspes by the hand of Darius, or by the horses, swords,
						and axes of the Persians fighting with all their might and
						main in defence of their king, or had he tumbled from
						the walls of Babylon, and all his hopes together. Thus
						Pelopidas and Epaminondas fell; whose death was to be
						ascribed to their virtue, not to such a poor misfortune as
						this. But what was the singular act of Fortune's favor
						which we are now enquiring into? What indeed, but in
						the farthest nook of a barbarous country, on the farther
						side of a river, within the walls of a miserable village, to
						pen up and hide the lord and king of the world, that he
						might there perish shamefully at the hands of barbarians,
						who should knock him down and pelt him with whatever
						came next to hand? There the first blow he received with
						a battle-axe cleft his helmet and entered his skull; at the
						same time another shot him with an Indian arrow in the
						breast near one of his paps, the head being four fingers
						broad and five in length, which, together with the weight
						of the shaft which projected from the wound, did not a
						little torment him. But, what was worst of all, while he
						was thus defending himself from his enemies before him,
						when he had laid a bold attempter that approached his
						person sprawling upon the earth with his sword, a fellow
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.515"/>
						
						from a mill close by came behind him, and with a great
						iron pestle gave him such a bang upon the neck as deprived him for the present both of his senses and his sight.
						However, his virtue did not yet forsake him, but supplied
						him still with courage, infusing strength withal and speed
						into those about him. For Ptolemy, Limnaeus, and Leonnatus, and some others who had mounted or broken through
						the wall, made to his succor, and stood about him like so
						many bulwarks of his virtue; out of mere affection and
						kindness to their sovereign exposing their bodies, their
						faces, and their lives in his defence. For it is not Fortune
						that overrules men to run the hazard of death for brave
						princes; but the love of virtue allures them&mdash;as natural
						affection charms and entices bees&mdash;to surround and guard
						their chief commander.</p>
               <p>What person then, at that time beholding in security
						this strange adventure, would not have confessed that he
						had seen a desperate combat of Fortune against virtue,
						and that the barbarians were undeservedly superior through
						Fortune's help, but that the Greeks resisted beyond imagination through the force of virtue? So that if the barbarians had vanquished, it had been the act of Fortune
						or of some evil genius or divine retribution; but as the
						Greeks became the victors, they owed their conquest to
						their virtue, their prowess, their friendship and fidelity to
						each other. For these were all the life-guard Alexander
						had at that time; Fortune having interposed a wall between
						him and all his other forces, so that neither fleets nor
						armies, cavalry nor infantry, could stand him in any stead.
						Therefore the Macedonians routed the barbarians, and
						buried those that fell under the ruins of their own town.
						But this little availed Alexander; for he was carried off
						with the dart sticking in his breast, having now a war in
						his own bowels, while the arrow in his bosom was a kind
						of cord, or rather nail, that was driven through his breastplate
						
						<pb id="v.1.p.516"/>
						
						 and fastened it to his body. When they went about
						to dress him, the forked shape of the iron head would not permit the surgeons to draw it forth from the root of the wound,
						being fixed in the solid parts of the breast that fortify the
						heart. Nor durst they attempt to cut away the shaft that
						stuck out, fearing they should put him to an excess of
						torment by the motion of the iron in the cleft of the bone,
						and cause a new flux of blood not easy to be stopped. Alexander, observing their hesitation and delay, endeavored
						himself with a little knife to cut off the shaft close to the
						skin; but his hand failed him, being seized with a heavy
						numbness by reason of the inflammation of the wound.
						Thereupon he commanded the surgeons and those that
						stood about him to try the same thing themselves and not
						to be afraid, giving them all the encouragement he could.
						Those that wept he upbraided for their weakness; others
						he called deserters, that refused him their assistance in
						such a time of need. At length, calling to his friends, he
						said: Let no one of you fear for me; for how shall I believe you to be contemners of death, when you betray yourselves to be afraid of mine? <note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">See foot-note at the end of the First Oration on Alexander.</note>
