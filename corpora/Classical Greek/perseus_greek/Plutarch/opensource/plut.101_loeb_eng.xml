            <head>CONCERNING TALKATIVENESS
					(DE GARRULITATE)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					This charming essay, by far the best in the volume,
					suffers from only one defect, its length. Though
					Plutarch again and again, by his narrative skill and
					na&iuml;ve or unconscious humour, will delight even those
					who have hardened their hearts against him (I mean
					his editors), he cannot at last resist the temptation to
					indulge in what he considered scientific analysis and
					enlightened exhortation. He is then merely dull.
					But, taken as a whole, the essay is surely a success,
					and as organic and skilful a performance as any in
					the <hi rend="italics">Moralia</hi>.

            <p>
					The work was written after <hi rend="italics">De Curiositate</hi> and

            <p>It is a troublesome and difficult task that philosophy has in hand when it undertakes to cure garrulousness. For the remedy, words of reason, requires listeners ; but the garrulous listen to nobody,
					for they are always talking. And this is the first
					symptom of their ailment: looseness of the tongue
					becomes impotence of the ears.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">It suits Plutarch's humour in this passage, in which he speaks of garrulity as a disease, to invent one, and possibly two, pseudo-medical terms, <foreign lang="greek">a)sighsi/a</foreign>, <q direct="unspecified">inability to keep silent,</q> and <foreign lang="greek">a)nhkoi/+a</foreign>, <q direct="unspecified">inability to listen.</q> The figure is maintained in <foreign lang="greek">diarre/ousi</foreign> at the end of section d. Rouse suggests: <q direct="unspecified">And here is the first bad symptom in diarrhoea of the tongue - constipation of the ears.</q>
               </note> For it is a deliberate
					deafness, that of men who, I take it, blame Nature
					because they have only one tongue, but two ears.b
					If, then, Euripides<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

					reference to the unintelligent hearer,

               </quote>
					it would be more just to say to the garrulous man,
					or rather about the garrulous man,
					<quote rend="blockquote">

					or rather submerging, a man who talks to those

					who will not listen, and will not listen when others

					and among them the two first and greatest, the

					can happen to talkative persons, but even in that

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 519 d, <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> such as love of money,

					possibility of attaining their desires, but for babblers
					this is very difficult: they desire listeners and cannot

					get them, since every one runs away headlong. If
					men are sitting in a public lounge or strolling about
					in a portico, and see a talker coming up, they
					quickly give each other the counter-sign to break
					camp. And just as when silence occurs in an assemblage they say that Hermes has joined the company,
					so when a chatterbox comes into a dinner-party or
					social gathering, every one grows silent, not wishing
					to furnish him a hold ; and if he begins of his own
					accord to open his mouth,
					<quote rend="blockquote">As when the North-wind blows along

                     <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 455 a, <hi rend="superscript">supra</hi>.</note>
               </quote>
					suspecting that they will be tossed about and sea-sick,
					they rise up and go out. And so it is a talker's lot
					when travelling by land or sea, to find volunteer
					listeners neither as table-companions nor as tentmates, but only conscripts; for the talker is at
					you everywhere, catching your cloak, plucking your
					beard, digging you in the ribs.
					<quote rend="blockquote">Then are your feet of the greatest value,</quote>
					as Archilochus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Edmonds, <hi rend="italics">Elegy and Iambus</hi>, ii. p. 182, Frag. 132.</note> says, and on my word the wise Aristotle will agree. For when Aristotle himself was
					annoyed by a chatterer and bored with some silly
					stories, and the fellow kept repeating, <q direct="unspecified">Isn't it
						wonderful, Aristotle?</q> 
               <q direct="unspecified">There's nothing wonderful about that,</q> said Aristotle, <q direct="unspecified">but that anyone with

					<pb id="v.6.p.403"/>
					
					if chatterers force their talk upon us, the soul surrenders to them the ears to be flooded from outside,
					but herself within unrolls thoughts of another sort and
					follows them out by herself. Therefore talkers do
					not find it easy to secure listeners who either pay
					attention or believe what they say ; for just as they
					affirm that the seed of persons too prone to lusts
					of the flesh is barren, so is the speech of babblers
					ineffectual and fruitless.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

						tongues.</q> And those who believe that storerooms
					without doors and purses without fastenings are of
					no use to their owners, yet keep their mouths without lock or door, maintaining as perpetual an outflow
					as the mouth of the Black Sea, appear to regard
					speech as the least valuable of all things. They do
					not, therefore, meet with belief,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 519 d, <hi rend="italics">infra</hi>.</note> which is the object
					of all speech. For this is the proper end and aim
					of speech, to engender belief in the hearer ; but
					chatterers are disbelieved even if they are telling the
					truth. For as wheat shut up in a jar<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Or a <q direct="unspecified">pit,</q> perhaps; <hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 697 d.</note> is found to

					of drunkenness say that it is intoxicated and foolish
					talking ; thus drinking is not blamed if silence attends
					the drinking, but it is foolish talk which converts the
					influence of wine into drunkenness. While it is true
					that the drunken man talks foolishness in his cups,
					the chatterer talks foolishness on all occasions, in the
					market-place, in the theatre, out walking, drunk or
					sober, by day, by night. As your physician, he is
					worse than the disease ; as your ship-mate, more

            <p>For it is impossible to check the babbler by

					speaking and answering. For in a race the victory is
					his who comes in first; but here, if another makes a
					sufficient answer, it is proper to join in the approval
					and assent and so acquire the reputation of being a
					friendly fellow. But if such an answer is not made,
					then it is not invidious or inopportune both to point
					out the answer others have not known and thus to fili
					in the gap. And, in particular, let us be on our guard,
					when someone else has been asked a question, that we
					do not forestall him by taking the answer out of his
					mouth. For perhaps there are other times also when
					it is not seemly, another having been asked, to
					shoulder him aside and volunteer ourselves, since we
					shall seem to be casting a slur both on the man asked,
					as being unable to furnish what is demanded of him,
					and on the asker, as being ignorant of the source from
					which he can get help ; and, in particular, such precipitancy and boldness in answering questions smacks
					of insolence. For one who tries to get in the answTer
					ahead of the man who is questioned suggests, <q direct="unspecified">What
						do you need <hi rend="italics">him</hi> for?</q> or <q direct="unspecified">What does <hi rend="italics">he</hi> know?</q> or
					<q direct="unspecified">When I am present, no one else should be asked
						about these matters.</q> And yet we often ask people
					questions, not because we need an answer, but to elicit
					some friendly word from them, and because we wish
					to draw them on to friendly converse, as Socrates did
					with Theaetetus and Charmides.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

					answer out of another's mouth, to divert another's
					hearing and attract his attention and wrest it from
					some other, is as bad as to run up and kiss someone
					who wished to be kissed by somebody else, or to turn
					toward yourself someone who was looking at another;
					since, even if he who has been asked cannot give the
					
					<pb id="v.6.p.453"/>
					
					information, it is proper to practise restraint and
					conform oneself to the wish of the asker and thus to
					encounter with modesty and decorum the situation,
					an invitation, as it were, given to another. And
					it is also true that if persons who are asked questions
					make mistakes in their answers, they meet with just
					indulgence ; but he who voluntarily undertakes an
					answer and anticipates another is unpleasant even if
					he corrects a mistake, and if he makes a mistake
					himself, he affords a malicious joy to one and all, and
					becomes an object of ridicule.

            <p>Then the second matter for diligent practice

					themselves, devise questions and put them to men of
					this sort to set going their foolish twaddle. Against
					this talkers should be on their guard and not leap
					upon a subject quickly, or as though grateful that it
					is offered to them, but should first consider both the
					character of the questioner and the necessity for the
					question. And when it appears that the questioner
					is really anxious to learn, the babbler must accustom
					himself to stop and leave between the question and
					the answer an interval, in which the asker may add
					anything he wishes and he himself may reflect upon
					his reply instead of overrunning and obscuring the
					question by giving a long string of answers in a
					hurry while the question is still being asked. For

					yet the man who wishes to make a careful answer

					In any case this ravenous hunger for talking must be
					checked so that it may not seem as though a stream
					which has long been pressing hard upon the tongue
					were being gladly discharged at the instance of the
					question. Socrates, in fact, used to control his thirst
					in this manner-he would not allow himself to drink
					after exercise until he had drawn up and poured out
					the first bucketful, so that his irrational part might
					be trained to await the time dictated by reason.

            <p>Furthermore, there are three kinds of answers
